5450,the interconnected soil water content and movement processes are ill constrained for changing climates making estimates of surface runoff relatively unpredictable particularly for high altitude areas which are characterized by vertical climate variance changing climatic conditions raise many challenges to runoff estimates and ecosystem management to address these challenges soil property investigation hydrological modelling and multivariate statistical analysis were integrated to quantify the driving forces of surface runoff in three typical sub basins headwater highland and subtropical valley in the tibetan plateau under climate variations the results showed that soil water processes in the subtropical areas with high precipitation levels and in the headwaters with deep freeze thaw processes were very sensitive to climate variations for the headwater sub basin the soil water content was the highest 90 mm but the percolation and lateral flow were the lowest 14 3 mm and 173 9 mm respectively among the sub basins during the period 1972 2017 the annual surface runoff of the sub basins decreased as follows headwater highland subtropical valley which corresponded to the increase in precipitation and temperature during this time period furthermore the redundancy analysis showed that percolation was the most powerful governing process in the subtropical areas and the headwaters although the soil water content contributed less than percolation it was a substantial driver of surface runoff in the headwater and highland sub basins due to the freeze thaw process our results suggest that it is critical to prioritize soil water content in freeze thaw areas and subsurface flow in warmer valley areas to improve soil and water resource regulation these findings provide vital information from a systematic perspective for hydrological environmental and ecological management in high altitude areas keywords hydrological processes surface runoff soil properties temperature precipitation modelling 1 introduction soil controls hydrological processes in the land surface pedosphere by postponing reorganizing and storing water on the surface and in the subsurface of soil profiles soil water functioning can be categorized as static or dynamic the static type describes static soil water content swc and the dynamic type describes kinetic soil water movement zhu et al 2018 the swc impacts drought occurrence runoff generation and floods hao and aghakouchak 2013 mccoll et al 2017 while the soil water dynamics contribute to runoff processes more directly as infiltration and lateral flow in the soil profile are important components of the water cycle soil properties are indicators of soil water processes for both static and dynamic processes and they are necessarily required in hydrological modelling thayalakumaran et al 2018 however static and dynamic aspects of soil water processes together with runoff are usually fraught with uncertainty and they are influenced by the combined impacts of terrain land use type and climate variability kundu et al 2017 ribolzi et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 therefore predicting runoff generation under changing environments is one of the most challenging issues for agricultural practice soil and water resource management and flood control the impacts of meteorological changes on hydrological variations in high altitude areas have attracted broad attention worldwide due to climate change induced glacier melt freeze thaw variations and water security issues knoche et al 2017 rangecroft et al 2013 the temperature shift in the heating or cooling duration leads to variations in solid precipitation and liquid precipitation in high altitude areas li et al 2019 which impacts the spatio temporal pattern of soil water movement and runoff generation guevara ochoa et al 2020 in addition an increase in the magnitude of the soil temperature of unfrozen soil can also enhance soil water repellency leading to a reduced infiltration rate and greater runoff cawson et al 2016 as a result variations in soil water processes play a substantial role in runoff and sediment yield mohammadi et al 2019 particularly during freeze thaw processes and soil water may accumulate and reach a relatively higher level ouyang et al 2017 therefore the varying soil water governing forces for surface runoff yield in high altitude areas require further investigation due to the changing climate the tibetan plateau the largest continental highland on the planet known as the third pole and the water tower of asia mulch and chamberlain 2006 is very rich in hydropower resources but is facing pronounced hydrological changes due to its high sensitivity to climate change lu et al 2011 yang et al 2014 a study integrating atmospheric forcing vegetation and soil factors for runoff simulation in tibet highlighted the role of atmospheric heat transfer by climate variations as well as soil water storage based parameterizations for seasonally frozen high altitude regions zheng et al 2017 furthermore although important vegetation ultimately affects the hydrological regime by changing soil properties niu et al 2019 it is interesting that soil water content and movement processes in high altitude regions were found to have different impacts on runoff generation in addition to infiltration the initial swc was critical to runoff yield due to its impact on freeze thaw processes wang et al 2019 previous work has paid much attention to the in situ soil hydrological processes on land and to the tremendous water and hydropower resources in rivers fang and rodi 2003 fang et al 2018 song et al 2012 however it has neglected soil water processes and the driving forces of runoff generation at the watershed scale under varying precipitation and temperature conditions leading to difficulties in regional soil and water management many studies have been conducted using site scale experiments and regional scale remote sensing data boulange et al 2019 fang and lakshmi 2014 investigation of nanomaterials and their properties is helpful for environmental remediation and management zinatloo ajabshir et al 2018 besides in situ monitoring of soil water processes has also been widely employed however a dearth of valid datasets using directly monitored soil water may exist because direct monitoring of such data is time consuming karim et al 2019 such data are also site specific and only cover a short period data that are indirectly estimated by land surface modelling can improve our understanding of hydrological driving forces under climate change in addition previous studies have often not considered the differences in soil water content storage and soil water dynamic functions in controlling runoff generation al qinna and abu awwad 1998 del campo et al 2019 hence basin scale surface runoff estimations combining detailed soil hydrological mechanism analysis are very valuable for understanding the linked static and dynamic soil water processes under a changing climate condition such study will support the understanding of watershed hydrology and help the environmental and ecological planning and management zinatloo ajabshir et al 2020 particularly in high altitude areas that are sensitive to climate variations the uncertainties of the linked soil water content and movement processes in the high altitude water tower region are usually high due to the varying climate zones in the vertical direction which causes many challenges in calculating runoff yield estimates in this regard we hypothesized that the static and dynamic soil water driving forces of runoff serve different functions under varying precipitation and temperature specifically the main goals of the paper are to 1 investigate the static and dynamic characteristics of soil water in typical high altitude sub basins 2 compare surface runoff changes in response to climate variations and 3 quantify the different driving forces of surface runoff with respect to static and dynamic soil water processes under climate variations in high altitude areas 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area description the jinsha river is the headwater of the yangtze river covering a basin area of approximately 495 000 km2 fig 1 the river originates from the geladandong peak elevation 6 621 m of the tanggula mountains and it is 3481 km long and extends through the qinghai tibet plateau yunnan guizhou plateau and sichuan province in western china the terrain in the jinsha river basin jrb is rather complex with an elevation difference of up to 5000 m therefore the climate in the jrb displays great spatio temporal variability and large vertical differences song et al 2012 the annual precipitation and mean temperature increase from approximately 200 mm and 4 c in the upper stream to more than 1000 mm and approximately 16 c in the lower stream respectively therefore snow ice melt and rainfall induced runoff coexist in the jrb the annual average water discharge in the outlet of the jrb is 1400 108 m3 per year the jinsha river is one of the thirteen largest hydropower bases in china with extremely abundant hydroelectric resources exerting a great influence on the operation of the three gorges reservoir tgr fang and wang 2000 fang et al 2012 topographic conditions and land use are important factors affecting hydrological processes western et al 1999 hence three typical plateau sub basins the headwater region hw highland region hl and subtropical valley sv located in the jrb were analysed to detect soil water driving forces of runoff under different climate conditions fig 1 to highlight the impacts of climate variations on soil water and runoff processes these three sub basins were characterized by similar underlying geological features with similar slope ranges and were mainly covered by eco friendly vegetation pasture and forest the headwater region is located in the highland sub frigid zone and is characterized by dry cold and windy weather the highland region is located in the transition area between the sichuan basin and the tibetan plateau and is characterized by a highland temperate climate the subtropical valley is in the mid subtropical zone where there is an abundance of light and heat resources 2 2 soil water process and runoff modelling the soil water assessment tool swat a process based and semi distributed hydrological model was used to determine soil moisture percolation lateral flow and surface runoff in the jrb both specific physical and empirical approaches were employed in swat model to obtain different hydrological and environmental processes this model is widely employed and operated on a daily or sub daily basis for the estimation of soil water runoff and sediment yield for vast complex areas over long periods of time arnold et al 1998 shi et al 2017 in this model the scs curve number scs 1956 is used to calculate soil water processes and runoff generation specifically swat provides an option to calculate soil water processes under freeze thaw conditions the soil hydrological unit antecedent soil moisture and soil water retention are important for modelling the retention parameter was updated in equation 1 during model calculation to investigate the soil water when the top soil layers are frozen 1 s frz s max 1 exp 0 000862 s where sfrz is the retention parameter under freeze thaw conditions mm smax is the maximum retention value in a day mm and s is the retention parameter under a given soil moisture mm in addition this model considered snow temperature accumulation and melt rate in the soil hydrological process calculation ficklin and barnhart 2014 the swat model input database requires meteorological topographic land use soil characteristics and field management data the meteorological data were obtained from 29 local meteorological stations covering the jrb including 8 stations outside the basin boundary fig 1 continuously monitored daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation from 1970 to 2017 were processed to produce a meteorological database and weather generator topographic data 1 1 000 000 were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn land use data 100 m 100 m in 2015 were extracted from landsat 8 images and rectified based on field investigations there are nine types of land use in the jrb based on the national land cover database scheme paddy field dry land forest orchard pasture water urban area barren land and wetland soil data were obtained from the institute of soil science and institute of geography chinese academy of sciences field management data were collected from local survey materials cascade reservoirs were constructed in the middle to lower reaches of the jinsha river which greatly influence the hydrological processes in the mainstream yang et al 2018 a total of 13 constructed reservoirs were integrated into the model in addition small reservoirs and medium reservoirs were integrated as a single large reservoir in corresponding sub basins in the model zhang et al 2012 the original reservoir parameter thresholds were only suitable for small reservoirs the values were updated to be able to represent large reservoirs wu et al 2020 reservoir data and information of the operation of hydropower stations were provided by the china renewable energy engineering institute and changjiang institute of survey planning design and research 2 3 model calibration and validation the observation data covered four hydrological stations in the mainstreams and tributaries of the jrb from the upstream region to the downstream region fig 1 after conducting various tests on model responses to different parameter values 25 parameters influencing soil water processes runoff generation and freeze thaw processes were identified model calibration and validation were conducted using the method of sufi 2 in swat cup 2012 which has been successfully applied to large watersheds and freeze thaw areas abbaspour et al 2007 all sources of uncertainties in terms of driving variables conceptual parameters and observation data were considered in sufi 2 schuol et al 2008 observation data on daily time steps were usually used to gain a higher accuracy than that obtained from data on a monthly or annual time step for calibration and validation lin et al 2015 therefore daily observation data were employed in swat cup the time period of 2005 2006 was used to initiate the model the time period of 2007 2009 was used to calibrate the model and the time period of 2010 2012 was used to validate the model with the observation data at the zhimenda luning and shigu hydrological stations fig 1 the periods of 2007 2008 and 2010 2011 were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively with the observation data at the pingshan hydrological station due to data availability fig 1 four different sets of parameterization were identified in the three sub basins in the jrb statistical methods were used to evaluate model performance including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 as objective functions to assess the reliability of hydrological modelling nash and sutcliffe 1970 model performance was considered to be good and very good when the nse value was within 0 65 0 75 and higher than 0 75 respectively yan et al 2018 as indicated in fig 2 the nse and r2 values for the headwater were generally higher than 0 80 for the middle reach of the basin all results of both luning and shigu were higher than 0 75 and were found to be very good in particular r2 was close to 0 90 for the outlet of the basin pingshan the nse values were higher than 0 70 and the r2 values were higher than 0 80 for the calibration and validation periods which are considered to be good results and very good results respectively hence the swat model was able to adequately predict soil water and surface runoff processes in the jrb 2 4 soil property identification there were a total of 14 types of soils based on the genetic soil classification of china gscc in the three plateau sub basins table 1 the top layer soils which varied from approximately 10 cm to 30 cm as a result of soil horizon variations were analysed in this study soil moisture properties measured as field capacity saturation and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks were estimated using measured or available soil types and textures soil mechanical composition and soil organic matter data were processed based on the china soil scientific database and field investigation chen et al 2005 wang et al 2015a zhao et al 2018 the soil plant atmosphere water model spaw which has been successfully used for field hydrology assessments ouyang et al 2018a was employed to analyse the soil moisture properties soil mechanical composition fraction of clay silt and sand and soil organic matter data were pre processed as the input of the soil water characteristics tool in spaw to obtain the field capacity soil saturation and ks field capacity is the soil moisture after excess water has drained away and downward movement has become slow and it is usually imperative for agronomic and environmental applications reynolds 2018 soil saturation is the soil moisture that is greater than the field capacity when all the pores in the soil are filled with water and it can be an indicator of runoff production petch 1988 field capacity and soil saturation affect static soil water features while ks describes the soil water movement 2 5 data analysis multivariate statistical analysis was adopted to reveal the difference in driving forces of runoff in response to precipitation and temperature variations soil water content and soil moisture properties e g field capacity and saturation were quantified and they represent the static soil water features the vertical subsurface flow percolation volume and the horizontal subsurface flow lateral flow volume together with the soil water dynamic property ks were quantified and they represent the soil water dynamic features hence the static and dynamic soil water driving forces of runoff were analysed a nonparametric rank based statistical method spearman s test which does not require a specific population distribution of the samples wu et al 2018a was used to assess correlations between surface runoff and soil water process in three typical sub basins to identify the static and dynamic soil water driving forces of runoff under climate variations redundancy analysis rda was employed in this study the rda method has been effectively applied to quantify hydrological dynamics and driving forces between different basins ouyang et al 2018b stock et al 2019 the difference in the impacts of climate variations on soil water processes was revealed with the data of precipitation p and temperature t used as explanatory variables and the data of soil water content sw percolation p and lateral flow l used as response variables furthermore static and dynamic soil water drivers of runoff were revealed with the data of sw p and l used as explanatory variables and the data of surface runoff r used as a response variable the significance of the variables was tested using monte carlo permutations li et al 2017 3 results 3 1 comparison of climate and soil characteristics the three typical sub basins were characterized by different climatic features although the elevation range in hl was basically equal to that in hw the annual precipitation in hl was approximately 1 64 times higher than that in hw table 2 moreover the annual mean daily highest tmax and lowest tmin temperatures in hl were 8 7 c and 14 7 c higher than those in hw respectively with regard to sv both precipitation and temperature were much higher than those in hw and hl with the annual precipitation of 1136 7 mm the monthly precipitation in sv varied significantly with the highest error bar fig 3 indicating that distinct dry and wet seasons exist four types of soils were found in hw felty soil and dark felty soil were the main types accounting for 59 46 and 26 13 respectively there were eight types of soils in hl also with felty and dark felty soils as the main soils which together accounted for 84 96 there were nine types of soils in sv which were dominated by purplish soil and red earth and they accounted for 36 90 and 35 96 respectively 3 2 comparison of static soil water characteristics the static soil water characteristics soil moisture field capacity and saturation and the corresponding precipitation and temperature changes during the period of 1972 2017 were displayed in fig 4 to highlight the precipitation and temperature variations in the three sub basins the precipitation and temperature were compared using a dimensionless coefficient which represents the ratio of the value of one point to the mean value of the dataset three error bounds were obtained based on the data of soil water processes between sub units in the hw hl and sv areas which reflected the spatial distribution features the results of the soil water property tests illustrated that the hl sub basin had the highest average field capacity 30 5 by volume and saturation 52 9 by volume the annual swc fluctuated as a function of the climate variation fig 4a the swc in hw was the highest among the sub basins ranging from approximately 60 mm to 90 mm which implied that the cold temperature may contribute to the storage of soil water furthermore the swc in hw had the lowest error estimate of the sub basins indicating that the spatial differences were not significant the swc in hl was much lower than that in hw and varied between 20 mm and 60 mm however similar to hw the error bound in hl was small showing small spatial differences in the soil water content distribution in sv the swc fluctuated widely at both spatial and temporal scales the highest value occurred in 2016 82 0 mm which was even higher than the value in hw in the same year in 1989 the precipitation levels in hw hl and sv were similar but the soil moisture content differed in the three areas with values of 66 8 mm 60 2 mm and 38 7 mm respectively the results demonstrated that precipitation and temperature variations exerted synergic effects on soil water content changes 3 3 comparison of dynamic soil water characteristics the dynamic soil water characteristics percolation lateral flow and ks and the corresponding precipitation and temperature changes during the period of 1972 2017 were presented in fig 5 the average ks was highest for the hl sub basin 28 1 mm h 1 followed by that in hw 26 6 mm h 1 and sv 13 9 mm h 1 the annual soil water movement in the vertical and horizontal directions varied with climate variation percolation and lateral flow changes had similar varying trends in the hl and sv sub basins but not the hw sub basin the annual percolation ranged from 14 3 mm to 60 3 mm in hw while the percolation ranged from 36 2 mm to 161 1 mm in hl the highest percolation was found in the sv sub basin which ranged from 37 3 mm to 301 8 mm regarding the lateral flow changes in the three sub basins the annual lateral flow ranged from 173 9 mm to 440 1 mm in hw and from 227 5 mm to 527 3 mm in hl the annual lateral flow in sv varied between 232 3 mm and 731 8 mm furthermore of the three sub basins the percolation and lateral flow in hw had the lowest error estimates indicating that the spatial differences were not significant the percolation and lateral flow in sv were the highest with the greatest spatial differences among the three sub basins in 1989 when the precipitation levels in hw hl and sv were similar the annual percolation in hw 60 3 mm was approximately equal to that in sv 62 9 mm but lower than that in hl 101 9 mm in contrast the differences of lateral flows 440 1 mm 390 2 mm and 284 3 mm for hw hl and sv respectively in 1989 in the three sub basins were relatively low compared with the lateral flows in the other years in comparison with the swc which was the highest in hw the percolation and lateral flow were relatively lower in hw than in hl and sv this difference may be caused by the lower precipitation and lower temperatures in hw climate variations exerted an adverse effect on soil water transport compared with soil water content changes 3 4 comparison of surface runoff the three typical sub basins exhibited different surface runoff characteristics the average annual surface runoff during the period of 1972 2017 was 14 3 mm 11 8 mm and 10 3 mm in hw hl and sv respectively although the precipitation was much lower in hw the average runoff in hw ranked the highest among the three sub basins during the 46 years the runoff in the apparent freeze thaw sub basins of hw and hl ranged from 0 7 mm to 27 8 mm and from 1 4 mm to 30 5 mm respectively the runoff ranges in these two areas were close but the error bound in hw was greater than that for hl suggesting a more significant spatial difference in the runoff for the hw sub basin for the sv sub basin large fluctuations were observed at both spatial and temporal scales as indicated by the annual variations and the widest error bound fig 6 f when these factors were considered together the results suggested that the surface runoff in sv was the most sensitive to precipitation and temperature changes for the hw sub basin surface runoff was most correlated with percolation correlation coefficient 0 57 p 0 001 but no significant correlations were found between runoff and soil water content p 0 01 or lateral flow p 0 05 based on spearman s test fig 6a for the hl sub basin strong correlations were observed between runoff and lateral flow correlation coefficient 0 69 p 0 001 and between runoff and percolation correlation coefficient 0 61 p 0 001 however correlations between runoff and soil water content were weak p 0 01 finally for the sv sub basin very strong correlations existed between runoff and lateral flow correlation coefficient 0 81 p 0 001 and between runoff and percolation correlation coefficient 0 79 p 0 001 however the soil water content was very weakly correlated with runoff p 0 36 in sv overall the surface runoff was more directly correlated with percolation and lateral flow in most cases 3 5 static and dynamic driving forces of surface runoff the difference in the combined impacts of precipitation and temperature on soil water and runoff processes in the three sub basins was shown in fig 7 an analysis of the relationships between soil water processes and climate variations based on the rda axes indicated that climate soil water content and soil water movement explained 91 1 of the total variation with the first axis accounting for 67 8 and the second axis accounting for 14 0 of the total variation precipitation was the main controlling factor of static soil water processes in all sub basins but the influence of precipitation changes on soil water processes was most pronounced in sv followed by that in hw and then hl as indicated by the lengths of the arrows fig 7a moreover precipitation was closely related to soil water movement processes in all sub basins compared with precipitation the effects of temperature changes on soil water processes were comparatively low however the temperature exerted slightly negative effects on the soil water content and dynamic processes in sv and exerted stronger negative effects in hl nonetheless the temperature changes in hw exerted positive effects on the percolation and lateral flow but exerted negative effects on the swc the influence of temperature changes was also most pronounced in sv followed by that in hw and then hl rda demonstrated that hydrological changes in the sv sub basin were most sensitive to climate variations when considering precipitation and temperature together differences in static and dynamic aspects of soil water driving forces of runoff were analysed and compared among three sub basins fig 7b the rda axes explained 54 2 of the total variation the first axis explained 41 4 and the second axis explained 8 2 three obvious clusters of arrows were observed and they were caused by the unique soil water and runoff processes in the three sub basins percolation was the determining factor of surface runoff in hw percolation lateral flow and swc were positively associated with runoff in hw in hl soil water content was the dominant driving factor and percolation also played an important role as indicated by the lengths and angles of the arrows in the sv sub basin surface runoff was primarily controlled by percolation and lateral flow while swc exerted negative effects on surface runoff to a much smaller extent above all soil water movement including percolation and lateral flow were the main factors influencing runoff in the three sub basins however the role of soil water content varied as climate conditions changed and was as important as soil water transport 4 discussion 4 1 differences in static and dynamic soil water characteristics these three sub basins are representative of typical basins in high altitude areas the climate features differ greatly in the three typical areas the effect of the freeze thaw process on soils can be observed clearly in hw and hl and this process impacts soil water and runoff processes to a large extent ding et al 2019 in contrast the climate in sv is typical of a subtropical climate due to its lower latitude and lower elevation with greater precipitation than that in hw and hl soils in these three areas reflected the underlying geological characteristics fig 3 located in higher plateau areas hw and hl are mainly covered with felty soils and dark felty soils gscc purplish soils and red soils gscc are widely distributed in sv due to the warmer climate in the plateau valley lu 2005 this study and previous work ouyang et al 2018a reported that soil properties were critical in explaining the underlying surface factors that alter soil water and runoff processes soil water content and movement processes displayed various behaviours in hw hl and sv the swc in hw had the highest value i e up to 90 mm fig 4a but the subsurface flow was relatively low due to the obvious freeze thaw process which was beneficial to water enrichment zhao et al 2019 in hl the subsurface flow varied approximately between those in hw and sv in response to climate conditions it was evident that both soil water content and movement in sv fluctuated widely at spatial and temporal scales the three vertical climate zones of this plateau subtropical valley contributed to the spatial difference lin et al 2014 and the wet antecedent soil water conditions altered by high precipitation may lead to the temporal difference in sv sarkar et al 2015 hao and aghakouchak 2014 the precipitation values in hw hl and sv were similar in 1989 which was known as a transition year for climate change assessments in the upper yangtze river jiang et al 2017 however the difference in static and dynamic soil water processes in these three areas in 1989 was high the results stressed that precipitation and temperature variations exerted synergic impacts on soil water content and movement changes 4 2 implication for surface runoff changes under climate variations changes in surface runoff volume were more affected by climate variations than by soil water properties the highest average field capacity saturation and ks were all observed in hl figs 4a and 5a the variation in ks can alter the dominant flow pathways in soil profiles tian et al 2017 in combination with the varying soil water properties fig 4a this variation in ks will make soil hydrological responses rather complicated however the inner soil properties did not offset but only altered the climatic impacts on runoff by changing the soil water content and movement processes for example the saturation zone and lateral flow may display different characteristics in root macro pores under snowmelt conditions newman et al 2004 in addition the spatial distribution of the chief soil properties can be significantly affected by climate in high altitude areas zehetner and miller 2006 and climate variations can further impact the influence of soil water properties on surface runoff the annual surface runoff during 1972 2017 decreased in the following order hw hl and sv fig 6d e f which corresponded to the increase in precipitation and temperature characterized by the lowest precipitation hw had the highest runoff due much to the amount of melting accumulated snow the results highlighted the importance of climate mechanisms in predicting snowmelt runoff in headwaters which was also stressed by moore et al 2007 as the direct hydrological driver precipitation in the red soil and purplish soil zone was the highest throughout china jia et al 2019 however the highest precipitation in sv did not lead to the highest runoff due to the large evaporation induced by warmer climate characteristics runoff was closely related to subsurface flow in sv in comparison the relationships between subsurface flow and runoff were weaker in hw which could be due to the varying temperature regimes freeze thaw cycles and deep thawing in permafrost semenova et al 2013 wang et al 2015b although spearman s test showed that surface runoff was more directly correlated with percolation and lateral flow in most cases the swc also contributed to runoff changes to different degrees under climate variations which was further evidenced through rda 4 3 driving forces of surface runoff with respect to soil water processes the difference in the impacts of precipitation and temperature on soil water and runoff processes was quantified we first compared the static and dynamic soil water features in response to climate variations the results showed that precipitation was the most direct driver of hydrological processes consistent with previous findings of miller and russell 1992 especially in sv where precipitation mainly occurs in the form of a liquid however for hw and hl in the higher altitude regions where the ratio of solid and liquid precipitation depends on the hypsometry lutz et al 2014 more indirect driving forces of precipitation were pronounced the intensity of precipitation on the soil hydrological cycle may vary with climate change even with identical precipitation amounts trenberth 2011 hence a comprehensive consideration of precipitation and temperature is critical to predicting runoff generation in high altitude areas temperature variations exerted negative effects on soil water content and movement especially in hl but exerted a positive effect on the subsurface flow in hw overall the processes of static and dynamic soil water aspects in the warmer subtropical area with high precipitation and in the colder area with deep freeze thaw processes were significantly influenced by climate variations the driving force analysis highlighted the different functions of static and dynamic aspects of soil water processes for surface runoff percolation was the most powerful driver in sv with abundant rainfall and in hw with freezing temperatures and snowmelt events wu et al 2018b also concluded the important role of infiltration and percolation for runoff generation in rainy and snowmelt periods in freeze thaw areas moreover the lateral flow was a very powerful driver in sv but it became less significant for runoff in the hw and hl areas finally the function of swc was far greater in hw and hl than in sv past studies have shown that soil water controlled the surface and near surface hydrological connectivity and runoff generation ali et al 2014 tetzlaff et al 2014 notwithstanding its driving function being relatively lower than that of percolation these findings suggest that the soil water content in freeze thaw areas and the subsurface flow in warmer valley areas should become a priority for soil and water resource regulation which highlights the importance of considering local conditions of high altitude catchments for future watershed management 5 conclusions the study highlighted the differences in the driving forces of surface runoff in three typical sub basins in a high altitude catchment by considering the soil water content and movement processes the three sub basins headwater hw highland hl and subtropical valley sv were characterized by a highland sub frigid climate a highland temperate climate and a mid subtropical climate respectively the static and dynamic soil water changes in the sv area which has a high precipitation level and in the hw area which has a deep freeze thaw process were notably sensitive to climate variations the soil water content in hw had the highest value 90 mm but percolation and lateral flow were basically the lowest 14 3 mm and 173 9 mm respectively among the three sub basins furthermore the annual runoff during the period of 1972 2017 decreased in the order of hw hl and sv which corresponded to the increase in precipitation and temperature percolation was the most powerful driver in the subtropical area and the headwater area particularly the lateral flow was a very powerful driver in the subtropical area but became less significant for runoff in the headwater and highland areas notwithstanding its driving function being relatively lower than that of percolation soil water content played a more substantial role in the headwater and highland areas due to the effects of freeze thaw processes we suggest that the soil water content in the freeze thaw areas and the subsurface flow in the warmer valley areas should be on the top priority to consider for soil and water resource regulation for high altitude watersheds this study provides important information from a systematic perspective for optimizing watershed hydrological environmental and ecological planning and management future work should focus on specific management measures

5450,the interconnected soil water content and movement processes are ill constrained for changing climates making estimates of surface runoff relatively unpredictable particularly for high altitude areas which are characterized by vertical climate variance changing climatic conditions raise many challenges to runoff estimates and ecosystem management to address these challenges soil property investigation hydrological modelling and multivariate statistical analysis were integrated to quantify the driving forces of surface runoff in three typical sub basins headwater highland and subtropical valley in the tibetan plateau under climate variations the results showed that soil water processes in the subtropical areas with high precipitation levels and in the headwaters with deep freeze thaw processes were very sensitive to climate variations for the headwater sub basin the soil water content was the highest 90 mm but the percolation and lateral flow were the lowest 14 3 mm and 173 9 mm respectively among the sub basins during the period 1972 2017 the annual surface runoff of the sub basins decreased as follows headwater highland subtropical valley which corresponded to the increase in precipitation and temperature during this time period furthermore the redundancy analysis showed that percolation was the most powerful governing process in the subtropical areas and the headwaters although the soil water content contributed less than percolation it was a substantial driver of surface runoff in the headwater and highland sub basins due to the freeze thaw process our results suggest that it is critical to prioritize soil water content in freeze thaw areas and subsurface flow in warmer valley areas to improve soil and water resource regulation these findings provide vital information from a systematic perspective for hydrological environmental and ecological management in high altitude areas keywords hydrological processes surface runoff soil properties temperature precipitation modelling 1 introduction soil controls hydrological processes in the land surface pedosphere by postponing reorganizing and storing water on the surface and in the subsurface of soil profiles soil water functioning can be categorized as static or dynamic the static type describes static soil water content swc and the dynamic type describes kinetic soil water movement zhu et al 2018 the swc impacts drought occurrence runoff generation and floods hao and aghakouchak 2013 mccoll et al 2017 while the soil water dynamics contribute to runoff processes more directly as infiltration and lateral flow in the soil profile are important components of the water cycle soil properties are indicators of soil water processes for both static and dynamic processes and they are necessarily required in hydrological modelling thayalakumaran et al 2018 however static and dynamic aspects of soil water processes together with runoff are usually fraught with uncertainty and they are influenced by the combined impacts of terrain land use type and climate variability kundu et al 2017 ribolzi et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 therefore predicting runoff generation under changing environments is one of the most challenging issues for agricultural practice soil and water resource management and flood control the impacts of meteorological changes on hydrological variations in high altitude areas have attracted broad attention worldwide due to climate change induced glacier melt freeze thaw variations and water security issues knoche et al 2017 rangecroft et al 2013 the temperature shift in the heating or cooling duration leads to variations in solid precipitation and liquid precipitation in high altitude areas li et al 2019 which impacts the spatio temporal pattern of soil water movement and runoff generation guevara ochoa et al 2020 in addition an increase in the magnitude of the soil temperature of unfrozen soil can also enhance soil water repellency leading to a reduced infiltration rate and greater runoff cawson et al 2016 as a result variations in soil water processes play a substantial role in runoff and sediment yield mohammadi et al 2019 particularly during freeze thaw processes and soil water may accumulate and reach a relatively higher level ouyang et al 2017 therefore the varying soil water governing forces for surface runoff yield in high altitude areas require further investigation due to the changing climate the tibetan plateau the largest continental highland on the planet known as the third pole and the water tower of asia mulch and chamberlain 2006 is very rich in hydropower resources but is facing pronounced hydrological changes due to its high sensitivity to climate change lu et al 2011 yang et al 2014 a study integrating atmospheric forcing vegetation and soil factors for runoff simulation in tibet highlighted the role of atmospheric heat transfer by climate variations as well as soil water storage based parameterizations for seasonally frozen high altitude regions zheng et al 2017 furthermore although important vegetation ultimately affects the hydrological regime by changing soil properties niu et al 2019 it is interesting that soil water content and movement processes in high altitude regions were found to have different impacts on runoff generation in addition to infiltration the initial swc was critical to runoff yield due to its impact on freeze thaw processes wang et al 2019 previous work has paid much attention to the in situ soil hydrological processes on land and to the tremendous water and hydropower resources in rivers fang and rodi 2003 fang et al 2018 song et al 2012 however it has neglected soil water processes and the driving forces of runoff generation at the watershed scale under varying precipitation and temperature conditions leading to difficulties in regional soil and water management many studies have been conducted using site scale experiments and regional scale remote sensing data boulange et al 2019 fang and lakshmi 2014 investigation of nanomaterials and their properties is helpful for environmental remediation and management zinatloo ajabshir et al 2018 besides in situ monitoring of soil water processes has also been widely employed however a dearth of valid datasets using directly monitored soil water may exist because direct monitoring of such data is time consuming karim et al 2019 such data are also site specific and only cover a short period data that are indirectly estimated by land surface modelling can improve our understanding of hydrological driving forces under climate change in addition previous studies have often not considered the differences in soil water content storage and soil water dynamic functions in controlling runoff generation al qinna and abu awwad 1998 del campo et al 2019 hence basin scale surface runoff estimations combining detailed soil hydrological mechanism analysis are very valuable for understanding the linked static and dynamic soil water processes under a changing climate condition such study will support the understanding of watershed hydrology and help the environmental and ecological planning and management zinatloo ajabshir et al 2020 particularly in high altitude areas that are sensitive to climate variations the uncertainties of the linked soil water content and movement processes in the high altitude water tower region are usually high due to the varying climate zones in the vertical direction which causes many challenges in calculating runoff yield estimates in this regard we hypothesized that the static and dynamic soil water driving forces of runoff serve different functions under varying precipitation and temperature specifically the main goals of the paper are to 1 investigate the static and dynamic characteristics of soil water in typical high altitude sub basins 2 compare surface runoff changes in response to climate variations and 3 quantify the different driving forces of surface runoff with respect to static and dynamic soil water processes under climate variations in high altitude areas 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area description the jinsha river is the headwater of the yangtze river covering a basin area of approximately 495 000 km2 fig 1 the river originates from the geladandong peak elevation 6 621 m of the tanggula mountains and it is 3481 km long and extends through the qinghai tibet plateau yunnan guizhou plateau and sichuan province in western china the terrain in the jinsha river basin jrb is rather complex with an elevation difference of up to 5000 m therefore the climate in the jrb displays great spatio temporal variability and large vertical differences song et al 2012 the annual precipitation and mean temperature increase from approximately 200 mm and 4 c in the upper stream to more than 1000 mm and approximately 16 c in the lower stream respectively therefore snow ice melt and rainfall induced runoff coexist in the jrb the annual average water discharge in the outlet of the jrb is 1400 108 m3 per year the jinsha river is one of the thirteen largest hydropower bases in china with extremely abundant hydroelectric resources exerting a great influence on the operation of the three gorges reservoir tgr fang and wang 2000 fang et al 2012 topographic conditions and land use are important factors affecting hydrological processes western et al 1999 hence three typical plateau sub basins the headwater region hw highland region hl and subtropical valley sv located in the jrb were analysed to detect soil water driving forces of runoff under different climate conditions fig 1 to highlight the impacts of climate variations on soil water and runoff processes these three sub basins were characterized by similar underlying geological features with similar slope ranges and were mainly covered by eco friendly vegetation pasture and forest the headwater region is located in the highland sub frigid zone and is characterized by dry cold and windy weather the highland region is located in the transition area between the sichuan basin and the tibetan plateau and is characterized by a highland temperate climate the subtropical valley is in the mid subtropical zone where there is an abundance of light and heat resources 2 2 soil water process and runoff modelling the soil water assessment tool swat a process based and semi distributed hydrological model was used to determine soil moisture percolation lateral flow and surface runoff in the jrb both specific physical and empirical approaches were employed in swat model to obtain different hydrological and environmental processes this model is widely employed and operated on a daily or sub daily basis for the estimation of soil water runoff and sediment yield for vast complex areas over long periods of time arnold et al 1998 shi et al 2017 in this model the scs curve number scs 1956 is used to calculate soil water processes and runoff generation specifically swat provides an option to calculate soil water processes under freeze thaw conditions the soil hydrological unit antecedent soil moisture and soil water retention are important for modelling the retention parameter was updated in equation 1 during model calculation to investigate the soil water when the top soil layers are frozen 1 s frz s max 1 exp 0 000862 s where sfrz is the retention parameter under freeze thaw conditions mm smax is the maximum retention value in a day mm and s is the retention parameter under a given soil moisture mm in addition this model considered snow temperature accumulation and melt rate in the soil hydrological process calculation ficklin and barnhart 2014 the swat model input database requires meteorological topographic land use soil characteristics and field management data the meteorological data were obtained from 29 local meteorological stations covering the jrb including 8 stations outside the basin boundary fig 1 continuously monitored daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation from 1970 to 2017 were processed to produce a meteorological database and weather generator topographic data 1 1 000 000 were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn land use data 100 m 100 m in 2015 were extracted from landsat 8 images and rectified based on field investigations there are nine types of land use in the jrb based on the national land cover database scheme paddy field dry land forest orchard pasture water urban area barren land and wetland soil data were obtained from the institute of soil science and institute of geography chinese academy of sciences field management data were collected from local survey materials cascade reservoirs were constructed in the middle to lower reaches of the jinsha river which greatly influence the hydrological processes in the mainstream yang et al 2018 a total of 13 constructed reservoirs were integrated into the model in addition small reservoirs and medium reservoirs were integrated as a single large reservoir in corresponding sub basins in the model zhang et al 2012 the original reservoir parameter thresholds were only suitable for small reservoirs the values were updated to be able to represent large reservoirs wu et al 2020 reservoir data and information of the operation of hydropower stations were provided by the china renewable energy engineering institute and changjiang institute of survey planning design and research 2 3 model calibration and validation the observation data covered four hydrological stations in the mainstreams and tributaries of the jrb from the upstream region to the downstream region fig 1 after conducting various tests on model responses to different parameter values 25 parameters influencing soil water processes runoff generation and freeze thaw processes were identified model calibration and validation were conducted using the method of sufi 2 in swat cup 2012 which has been successfully applied to large watersheds and freeze thaw areas abbaspour et al 2007 all sources of uncertainties in terms of driving variables conceptual parameters and observation data were considered in sufi 2 schuol et al 2008 observation data on daily time steps were usually used to gain a higher accuracy than that obtained from data on a monthly or annual time step for calibration and validation lin et al 2015 therefore daily observation data were employed in swat cup the time period of 2005 2006 was used to initiate the model the time period of 2007 2009 was used to calibrate the model and the time period of 2010 2012 was used to validate the model with the observation data at the zhimenda luning and shigu hydrological stations fig 1 the periods of 2007 2008 and 2010 2011 were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively with the observation data at the pingshan hydrological station due to data availability fig 1 four different sets of parameterization were identified in the three sub basins in the jrb statistical methods were used to evaluate model performance including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 as objective functions to assess the reliability of hydrological modelling nash and sutcliffe 1970 model performance was considered to be good and very good when the nse value was within 0 65 0 75 and higher than 0 75 respectively yan et al 2018 as indicated in fig 2 the nse and r2 values for the headwater were generally higher than 0 80 for the middle reach of the basin all results of both luning and shigu were higher than 0 75 and were found to be very good in particular r2 was close to 0 90 for the outlet of the basin pingshan the nse values were higher than 0 70 and the r2 values were higher than 0 80 for the calibration and validation periods which are considered to be good results and very good results respectively hence the swat model was able to adequately predict soil water and surface runoff processes in the jrb 2 4 soil property identification there were a total of 14 types of soils based on the genetic soil classification of china gscc in the three plateau sub basins table 1 the top layer soils which varied from approximately 10 cm to 30 cm as a result of soil horizon variations were analysed in this study soil moisture properties measured as field capacity saturation and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks were estimated using measured or available soil types and textures soil mechanical composition and soil organic matter data were processed based on the china soil scientific database and field investigation chen et al 2005 wang et al 2015a zhao et al 2018 the soil plant atmosphere water model spaw which has been successfully used for field hydrology assessments ouyang et al 2018a was employed to analyse the soil moisture properties soil mechanical composition fraction of clay silt and sand and soil organic matter data were pre processed as the input of the soil water characteristics tool in spaw to obtain the field capacity soil saturation and ks field capacity is the soil moisture after excess water has drained away and downward movement has become slow and it is usually imperative for agronomic and environmental applications reynolds 2018 soil saturation is the soil moisture that is greater than the field capacity when all the pores in the soil are filled with water and it can be an indicator of runoff production petch 1988 field capacity and soil saturation affect static soil water features while ks describes the soil water movement 2 5 data analysis multivariate statistical analysis was adopted to reveal the difference in driving forces of runoff in response to precipitation and temperature variations soil water content and soil moisture properties e g field capacity and saturation were quantified and they represent the static soil water features the vertical subsurface flow percolation volume and the horizontal subsurface flow lateral flow volume together with the soil water dynamic property ks were quantified and they represent the soil water dynamic features hence the static and dynamic soil water driving forces of runoff were analysed a nonparametric rank based statistical method spearman s test which does not require a specific population distribution of the samples wu et al 2018a was used to assess correlations between surface runoff and soil water process in three typical sub basins to identify the static and dynamic soil water driving forces of runoff under climate variations redundancy analysis rda was employed in this study the rda method has been effectively applied to quantify hydrological dynamics and driving forces between different basins ouyang et al 2018b stock et al 2019 the difference in the impacts of climate variations on soil water processes was revealed with the data of precipitation p and temperature t used as explanatory variables and the data of soil water content sw percolation p and lateral flow l used as response variables furthermore static and dynamic soil water drivers of runoff were revealed with the data of sw p and l used as explanatory variables and the data of surface runoff r used as a response variable the significance of the variables was tested using monte carlo permutations li et al 2017 3 results 3 1 comparison of climate and soil characteristics the three typical sub basins were characterized by different climatic features although the elevation range in hl was basically equal to that in hw the annual precipitation in hl was approximately 1 64 times higher than that in hw table 2 moreover the annual mean daily highest tmax and lowest tmin temperatures in hl were 8 7 c and 14 7 c higher than those in hw respectively with regard to sv both precipitation and temperature were much higher than those in hw and hl with the annual precipitation of 1136 7 mm the monthly precipitation in sv varied significantly with the highest error bar fig 3 indicating that distinct dry and wet seasons exist four types of soils were found in hw felty soil and dark felty soil were the main types accounting for 59 46 and 26 13 respectively there were eight types of soils in hl also with felty and dark felty soils as the main soils which together accounted for 84 96 there were nine types of soils in sv which were dominated by purplish soil and red earth and they accounted for 36 90 and 35 96 respectively 3 2 comparison of static soil water characteristics the static soil water characteristics soil moisture field capacity and saturation and the corresponding precipitation and temperature changes during the period of 1972 2017 were displayed in fig 4 to highlight the precipitation and temperature variations in the three sub basins the precipitation and temperature were compared using a dimensionless coefficient which represents the ratio of the value of one point to the mean value of the dataset three error bounds were obtained based on the data of soil water processes between sub units in the hw hl and sv areas which reflected the spatial distribution features the results of the soil water property tests illustrated that the hl sub basin had the highest average field capacity 30 5 by volume and saturation 52 9 by volume the annual swc fluctuated as a function of the climate variation fig 4a the swc in hw was the highest among the sub basins ranging from approximately 60 mm to 90 mm which implied that the cold temperature may contribute to the storage of soil water furthermore the swc in hw had the lowest error estimate of the sub basins indicating that the spatial differences were not significant the swc in hl was much lower than that in hw and varied between 20 mm and 60 mm however similar to hw the error bound in hl was small showing small spatial differences in the soil water content distribution in sv the swc fluctuated widely at both spatial and temporal scales the highest value occurred in 2016 82 0 mm which was even higher than the value in hw in the same year in 1989 the precipitation levels in hw hl and sv were similar but the soil moisture content differed in the three areas with values of 66 8 mm 60 2 mm and 38 7 mm respectively the results demonstrated that precipitation and temperature variations exerted synergic effects on soil water content changes 3 3 comparison of dynamic soil water characteristics the dynamic soil water characteristics percolation lateral flow and ks and the corresponding precipitation and temperature changes during the period of 1972 2017 were presented in fig 5 the average ks was highest for the hl sub basin 28 1 mm h 1 followed by that in hw 26 6 mm h 1 and sv 13 9 mm h 1 the annual soil water movement in the vertical and horizontal directions varied with climate variation percolation and lateral flow changes had similar varying trends in the hl and sv sub basins but not the hw sub basin the annual percolation ranged from 14 3 mm to 60 3 mm in hw while the percolation ranged from 36 2 mm to 161 1 mm in hl the highest percolation was found in the sv sub basin which ranged from 37 3 mm to 301 8 mm regarding the lateral flow changes in the three sub basins the annual lateral flow ranged from 173 9 mm to 440 1 mm in hw and from 227 5 mm to 527 3 mm in hl the annual lateral flow in sv varied between 232 3 mm and 731 8 mm furthermore of the three sub basins the percolation and lateral flow in hw had the lowest error estimates indicating that the spatial differences were not significant the percolation and lateral flow in sv were the highest with the greatest spatial differences among the three sub basins in 1989 when the precipitation levels in hw hl and sv were similar the annual percolation in hw 60 3 mm was approximately equal to that in sv 62 9 mm but lower than that in hl 101 9 mm in contrast the differences of lateral flows 440 1 mm 390 2 mm and 284 3 mm for hw hl and sv respectively in 1989 in the three sub basins were relatively low compared with the lateral flows in the other years in comparison with the swc which was the highest in hw the percolation and lateral flow were relatively lower in hw than in hl and sv this difference may be caused by the lower precipitation and lower temperatures in hw climate variations exerted an adverse effect on soil water transport compared with soil water content changes 3 4 comparison of surface runoff the three typical sub basins exhibited different surface runoff characteristics the average annual surface runoff during the period of 1972 2017 was 14 3 mm 11 8 mm and 10 3 mm in hw hl and sv respectively although the precipitation was much lower in hw the average runoff in hw ranked the highest among the three sub basins during the 46 years the runoff in the apparent freeze thaw sub basins of hw and hl ranged from 0 7 mm to 27 8 mm and from 1 4 mm to 30 5 mm respectively the runoff ranges in these two areas were close but the error bound in hw was greater than that for hl suggesting a more significant spatial difference in the runoff for the hw sub basin for the sv sub basin large fluctuations were observed at both spatial and temporal scales as indicated by the annual variations and the widest error bound fig 6 f when these factors were considered together the results suggested that the surface runoff in sv was the most sensitive to precipitation and temperature changes for the hw sub basin surface runoff was most correlated with percolation correlation coefficient 0 57 p 0 001 but no significant correlations were found between runoff and soil water content p 0 01 or lateral flow p 0 05 based on spearman s test fig 6a for the hl sub basin strong correlations were observed between runoff and lateral flow correlation coefficient 0 69 p 0 001 and between runoff and percolation correlation coefficient 0 61 p 0 001 however correlations between runoff and soil water content were weak p 0 01 finally for the sv sub basin very strong correlations existed between runoff and lateral flow correlation coefficient 0 81 p 0 001 and between runoff and percolation correlation coefficient 0 79 p 0 001 however the soil water content was very weakly correlated with runoff p 0 36 in sv overall the surface runoff was more directly correlated with percolation and lateral flow in most cases 3 5 static and dynamic driving forces of surface runoff the difference in the combined impacts of precipitation and temperature on soil water and runoff processes in the three sub basins was shown in fig 7 an analysis of the relationships between soil water processes and climate variations based on the rda axes indicated that climate soil water content and soil water movement explained 91 1 of the total variation with the first axis accounting for 67 8 and the second axis accounting for 14 0 of the total variation precipitation was the main controlling factor of static soil water processes in all sub basins but the influence of precipitation changes on soil water processes was most pronounced in sv followed by that in hw and then hl as indicated by the lengths of the arrows fig 7a moreover precipitation was closely related to soil water movement processes in all sub basins compared with precipitation the effects of temperature changes on soil water processes were comparatively low however the temperature exerted slightly negative effects on the soil water content and dynamic processes in sv and exerted stronger negative effects in hl nonetheless the temperature changes in hw exerted positive effects on the percolation and lateral flow but exerted negative effects on the swc the influence of temperature changes was also most pronounced in sv followed by that in hw and then hl rda demonstrated that hydrological changes in the sv sub basin were most sensitive to climate variations when considering precipitation and temperature together differences in static and dynamic aspects of soil water driving forces of runoff were analysed and compared among three sub basins fig 7b the rda axes explained 54 2 of the total variation the first axis explained 41 4 and the second axis explained 8 2 three obvious clusters of arrows were observed and they were caused by the unique soil water and runoff processes in the three sub basins percolation was the determining factor of surface runoff in hw percolation lateral flow and swc were positively associated with runoff in hw in hl soil water content was the dominant driving factor and percolation also played an important role as indicated by the lengths and angles of the arrows in the sv sub basin surface runoff was primarily controlled by percolation and lateral flow while swc exerted negative effects on surface runoff to a much smaller extent above all soil water movement including percolation and lateral flow were the main factors influencing runoff in the three sub basins however the role of soil water content varied as climate conditions changed and was as important as soil water transport 4 discussion 4 1 differences in static and dynamic soil water characteristics these three sub basins are representative of typical basins in high altitude areas the climate features differ greatly in the three typical areas the effect of the freeze thaw process on soils can be observed clearly in hw and hl and this process impacts soil water and runoff processes to a large extent ding et al 2019 in contrast the climate in sv is typical of a subtropical climate due to its lower latitude and lower elevation with greater precipitation than that in hw and hl soils in these three areas reflected the underlying geological characteristics fig 3 located in higher plateau areas hw and hl are mainly covered with felty soils and dark felty soils gscc purplish soils and red soils gscc are widely distributed in sv due to the warmer climate in the plateau valley lu 2005 this study and previous work ouyang et al 2018a reported that soil properties were critical in explaining the underlying surface factors that alter soil water and runoff processes soil water content and movement processes displayed various behaviours in hw hl and sv the swc in hw had the highest value i e up to 90 mm fig 4a but the subsurface flow was relatively low due to the obvious freeze thaw process which was beneficial to water enrichment zhao et al 2019 in hl the subsurface flow varied approximately between those in hw and sv in response to climate conditions it was evident that both soil water content and movement in sv fluctuated widely at spatial and temporal scales the three vertical climate zones of this plateau subtropical valley contributed to the spatial difference lin et al 2014 and the wet antecedent soil water conditions altered by high precipitation may lead to the temporal difference in sv sarkar et al 2015 hao and aghakouchak 2014 the precipitation values in hw hl and sv were similar in 1989 which was known as a transition year for climate change assessments in the upper yangtze river jiang et al 2017 however the difference in static and dynamic soil water processes in these three areas in 1989 was high the results stressed that precipitation and temperature variations exerted synergic impacts on soil water content and movement changes 4 2 implication for surface runoff changes under climate variations changes in surface runoff volume were more affected by climate variations than by soil water properties the highest average field capacity saturation and ks were all observed in hl figs 4a and 5a the variation in ks can alter the dominant flow pathways in soil profiles tian et al 2017 in combination with the varying soil water properties fig 4a this variation in ks will make soil hydrological responses rather complicated however the inner soil properties did not offset but only altered the climatic impacts on runoff by changing the soil water content and movement processes for example the saturation zone and lateral flow may display different characteristics in root macro pores under snowmelt conditions newman et al 2004 in addition the spatial distribution of the chief soil properties can be significantly affected by climate in high altitude areas zehetner and miller 2006 and climate variations can further impact the influence of soil water properties on surface runoff the annual surface runoff during 1972 2017 decreased in the following order hw hl and sv fig 6d e f which corresponded to the increase in precipitation and temperature characterized by the lowest precipitation hw had the highest runoff due much to the amount of melting accumulated snow the results highlighted the importance of climate mechanisms in predicting snowmelt runoff in headwaters which was also stressed by moore et al 2007 as the direct hydrological driver precipitation in the red soil and purplish soil zone was the highest throughout china jia et al 2019 however the highest precipitation in sv did not lead to the highest runoff due to the large evaporation induced by warmer climate characteristics runoff was closely related to subsurface flow in sv in comparison the relationships between subsurface flow and runoff were weaker in hw which could be due to the varying temperature regimes freeze thaw cycles and deep thawing in permafrost semenova et al 2013 wang et al 2015b although spearman s test showed that surface runoff was more directly correlated with percolation and lateral flow in most cases the swc also contributed to runoff changes to different degrees under climate variations which was further evidenced through rda 4 3 driving forces of surface runoff with respect to soil water processes the difference in the impacts of precipitation and temperature on soil water and runoff processes was quantified we first compared the static and dynamic soil water features in response to climate variations the results showed that precipitation was the most direct driver of hydrological processes consistent with previous findings of miller and russell 1992 especially in sv where precipitation mainly occurs in the form of a liquid however for hw and hl in the higher altitude regions where the ratio of solid and liquid precipitation depends on the hypsometry lutz et al 2014 more indirect driving forces of precipitation were pronounced the intensity of precipitation on the soil hydrological cycle may vary with climate change even with identical precipitation amounts trenberth 2011 hence a comprehensive consideration of precipitation and temperature is critical to predicting runoff generation in high altitude areas temperature variations exerted negative effects on soil water content and movement especially in hl but exerted a positive effect on the subsurface flow in hw overall the processes of static and dynamic soil water aspects in the warmer subtropical area with high precipitation and in the colder area with deep freeze thaw processes were significantly influenced by climate variations the driving force analysis highlighted the different functions of static and dynamic aspects of soil water processes for surface runoff percolation was the most powerful driver in sv with abundant rainfall and in hw with freezing temperatures and snowmelt events wu et al 2018b also concluded the important role of infiltration and percolation for runoff generation in rainy and snowmelt periods in freeze thaw areas moreover the lateral flow was a very powerful driver in sv but it became less significant for runoff in the hw and hl areas finally the function of swc was far greater in hw and hl than in sv past studies have shown that soil water controlled the surface and near surface hydrological connectivity and runoff generation ali et al 2014 tetzlaff et al 2014 notwithstanding its driving function being relatively lower than that of percolation these findings suggest that the soil water content in freeze thaw areas and the subsurface flow in warmer valley areas should become a priority for soil and water resource regulation which highlights the importance of considering local conditions of high altitude catchments for future watershed management 5 conclusions the study highlighted the differences in the driving forces of surface runoff in three typical sub basins in a high altitude catchment by considering the soil water content and movement processes the three sub basins headwater hw highland hl and subtropical valley sv were characterized by a highland sub frigid climate a highland temperate climate and a mid subtropical climate respectively the static and dynamic soil water changes in the sv area which has a high precipitation level and in the hw area which has a deep freeze thaw process were notably sensitive to climate variations the soil water content in hw had the highest value 90 mm but percolation and lateral flow were basically the lowest 14 3 mm and 173 9 mm respectively among the three sub basins furthermore the annual runoff during the period of 1972 2017 decreased in the order of hw hl and sv which corresponded to the increase in precipitation and temperature percolation was the most powerful driver in the subtropical area and the headwater area particularly the lateral flow was a very powerful driver in the subtropical area but became less significant for runoff in the headwater and highland areas notwithstanding its driving function being relatively lower than that of percolation soil water content played a more substantial role in the headwater and highland areas due to the effects of freeze thaw processes we suggest that the soil water content in the freeze thaw areas and the subsurface flow in the warmer valley areas should be on the top priority to consider for soil and water resource regulation for high altitude watersheds this study provides important information from a systematic perspective for optimizing watershed hydrological environmental and ecological planning and management future work should focus on specific management measures

5451,generalized complementary functions which describe the relationship between the ratio of actual evaporation over the penman potential evaporation e epen and the proportion of the radiation term in epen erad epen have not been widely used at annual time scales in this study the generalized nonlinear advection aridity function gnaa and sigmoid generalized complementary function sgcf were evaluated for annual evaporation estimation with calibrated parameters in the loess plateau of china for all 15 catchments the lowest values of annual erad epen were found to be much larger than zero

yellow river china as a typical non humid region the annual precipitation p is 200 750 mm increasing from the northwest to the southeast tang et al 2018 the climate is continental monsoon with precipitation mainly concentrated between june and september that experiences frequent rainstorms the sparse vegetation resulted in severe soil erosion for a long period the land use and land cover has been greatly changed because of the grain for green project implemented by the chinese government in the loess plateau since 1999 which has contributed to the global greening trend chen et al 2019 in this study 15 typical catchments with areas ranging from 1263 to 43 216 km2 were selected fig 1 and table 1 monthly discharge data from 1960 to 2011 for all 15 catchments were provided by the

catchments and the change in water storage was negligible in a water year the water year is defined by the american meteorological society ams http glossary ametsoc org wiki water year as being from the beginning of the rainy season soil moisture recharge until the end of the season of maximum soil moisture utilization however the maximum evapotranspiration season is also in the rainy season because of rain and heat over the same period in the loess plateau so the hydrological year ends with the end of the dry season which follows the rainy season thus a period from may to the following april is defined as a water year on the loess plateau since the starting month for rainy season is may in this study parameters of the generalized complementary functions were optimized by minimizing the mean absolute error mae of the modeled and water balance derived e using the meteorological and hydrological data from 1960 to 2011 the gnaa was evaluated using three schemes calibrating αe with a

epen are within a narrow range of 0 55 0 73 and a broad range of 0 02 0 73 respectively significant linear relationships between e epen and erad epen exist for all catchments correlation coefficients range from 0 52 to 0 77 with a mean value of 0 69 table 1 the results from four example catchments located in the south c1 east c2 west c6 and northern c12 regions of the loess plateau are shown in fig 2 the linear relationship also exists for all catchments on the interannual scale fig 3 3 2 effects of different parameterization methods in the gnaa for the annual data from all catchments by setting c 0 the optimized αe of the gnaa was 0 74 table 2 and the corresponding complementary curve of the gnaa does not fit the observed values well fig 3 most points are located below the gnaa curve with αe 1 and c 0 implying that the calibrated αe would be less than unity if c 0 if αe is set to 1 26 the optimized c of the gnaa is 17 05 and the fitting degree of the gnaa curve to the observed data increases significantly however the simulated e epen would be less than zero if erad epen 0 58 the fitting degree of the gnaa curve to the observed data would further increase if both αe and c were calibrated 1 09 and 6 94 respectively and the curve was above y 0 if erad epen 0 49 xmin in fig 3 the curve within the range of the observed data approaches a straight line 3 3 effects of different parameterization methods in the sgcf for fixed xmin 0 and xmax 1 the sgcf with calibrated m and n values fits the observed data well fig 4 the calibrated αe was 1 17 which is located in a reasonable range of the priestley taylor coefficient the curve shows little change if xmax is added for calibration the calibrated value of xmax is 0 96 however the two curves of the sgcf with xmin 0 depart from the lower parts of the scatter plots the fit of the sgcf curve is improved if xmin is also added for calibration table 2 calibrated xmin and xmax values were 0 51 and 0 87 respectively which are outside their recommended ranges at a daily timescale similar results were found for the four selected catchments fig 2 the sgcf curve with four calibrated parameters was nearly equal to the linear aa curves for all 15 catchments 3 4 annual evaporation estimation performances of gnaa and sgcf the performances of gnaa and sgcf as well as the aa model were compared for modeling annual e for the 15 catchments of the loess plateau table 3 and their optimized parameters are shown in table 4 generally the discrepancies among the three complementary functions for actual evaporation estimation are small the sgcf performed better than the gnaa and aa functions for most of the catchments the relative errors of the simulated e and water balance derived e were 0 11 4 7 0 02 3 7 and 0 02 3 73 for the gnaa sgcf and aa models in the 15 catchments respectively the two catchments c3 c4 in the northern region were characterized by much smaller r2 and nse values than the other catchments which might reflect their smaller areas and the fact that they contained no meteorological sites the ranges of parameters αe and c of the gnaa were 0 91 1 18 and 2 73 11 18 respectively the ranges of parameter αe and b 1 for the aa model were 0 89 1 24 and 0 58 2 25 respectively for the sgcf the range of parameter αe was 1 03 1 27 with an average value of 1 15 the ranges of parameter b 1 xmin and xmax were 1 05 2 78 0 16 0 54 and 0 78 0 98 respectively in catchments c6 c10 c11 and c13 the optimized αe of sgcf was approximately 1 26 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 priestley taylor coefficient in generalized complementary functions the priestley taylor coefficient αe is the common parameter in complementary functions and has been thought to range from 1 0 to 1 5 brutsaert and chen 1995 it was reported that calibrated values of αe for the aa model were 1 18 1 00 and 1 04 in central sweden eastern china and northwestern cyprus respectively xu and singh 2005 and that the average of parameter αe for the aa model was 1 18 using the first international field experiment data szilagyi 2007 in four different climate and land use types in australia αe calibrated for the gnaa ranged from 1 04 to 1 19 zhang et al 2017 while it ranged from 1 01 to 1 02 for three heights in the semi humid regions of the loess plateau brutsaert et al 2017 and from 0 98 to 1 1 for four sites with differing elevations on gongga mountain southwest of china hu et al 2018 mean values of αe 1 12 and 1 13 were determined from observational data using the modified gnaa for the whole china ma et al 2019 and for 334 basins in the united states szilagyi et al 2017 han and tian 2018 obtained the ranges of αe to 0 9 1 29 for the gnaa and 0 97 1 40 for the sgcf with constraining xmin 0 and xmax 1 at 20 flux stations in different representative biomes for the tibetan plateau china the αe calibrated for the sgcf is 1 02 ma et al 2015a while it became 1 13 for aa model ma et al 2015b in this study the averages calibrated by the gnaa sgcf and aa with annual data from the loess plateau were 1 07 1 15 and 1 11 respectively which are approximately consistent with previous studies the calibrated αe from the sgcf was closest to the widely accepted value of 1 26 although it has been reported that the sensitivity of parameter αe to e is greater than that of parameter c to e liu et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 the relative variations in calibrated parameter αe for the 15 catchments were less than those of c or b 1 the optimized αe varies for the 15 catchments with a standard deviation sd of 0 07 and a coefficient of variation cv of 0 06 for gnaa which is much less than the values of c with sd of 1 95 and cv of 0 29 respectively similar results were also found for the sgcf and aa functions in which the sd cv for αe are 0 07 0 06 and 0 08 0 08 respectively and those for b 1 are 0 54 0 32 and 0 39 0 28 respectively the relatively stable αe suggests that generalized complementary functions may be used with a constant αe han et al 2012 gnaa is a nonlinear improvement based on the linear aa model and more boundary conditions the linear aa function could be regarded as a special case of the sgcf and the parameters of the sgcf were estimated with the aid of aa model because the complementary curves are approximately linear when erad epen is neither excessively large nor excessively small han and tian 2018 therefore there is an intrinsic connection among the three models the three functions are approximately equivalent under conditions neither too dry nor too wet therefore the calibrated αe values from the three models are significantly correlated with correlation coefficients of 0 72 between the gnaa and sgcf 0 95 between the gnaa and aa and 0 64 between the sgcf and aa in this study the performances of the gnaa sgcf and aa for estimating annual evaporation rates with fixed αe 1 07 1 15 and 1 11 respectively from 15 catchments were also evaluated few differences in model performances were observed among the three models with mean mae increasing from 53 0 52 9 and 52 3 to 54 3 53 6 and 54 7 mm respectively table 3 and 5 if αe is set as a constant value the burden of parameter calibration for generalized complementary functions is reduced with acceptable performances weakening 4 2 lower limit of erad epen the lower limit of erad epen is controversial in the use of complementary functions zero is generally regarded as the lower limit for erad epen in the gnaa and in the original version of the sgcf han et al 2012 however erad epen does not necessarily equal zero when e epen 0 as it is almost impossible for epen to reach infinity for a certain large erad crago et al 2016 crago and qualls 2018 szilagyi et al 2017 in the sgcf the lower limit was modified to e epen 0 at erad epen xmin at short timescales daily or hourly xmin may approach zero when the energy input is small however xmin would be much larger than zero at longer timescales as erad is much larger than zero han and tian 2018 the minimum values of observed annual erad epen ranged from 0 52 to 0 73 with a mean value of 0 64 for the 15 catchments in the loess plateau the optimized xmin of the sgcf ranged from 0 16 to 0 54 with a mean value of 0 38 the inclusion of xmin improved the performance of the sgcf when estimating annual evaporation one of four boundary conditions in the gnaa requires that the start point of the curve is the origin i e e epen 0 at erad epen 0 however the curve has two intersection points on the horizontal axis if c is larger than 2 fig 3 thus the second intersection point should be used as the starting point which corresponds to the boundary condition of e epen 0 at erad epen xmin liu et al 2020 the xmin values of the gnaa for each catchment are shown in table 4 and range from 0 2 to 0 55 with an average of 0 46 4 3 impact of spatial interpolation methods on parameters meteorological data from observation sites were used to calculate daily erad or epen in this study and then monthly erad or epen and p were interpolated using the kriging algorithm which is called the calculate then interpolate method however some researchers spatially average the meteorological data first then calculate daily and even annual erad or epen which is called the interpolate then calculate method however the latter method accumulates the interpolation error of the input variables in contrast the former method only interpolates once and thus introduces smaller errors mardikis et al 2005 in addition different interpolation algorithms have little effect on the parameters for example the cokriging interpolation method based on the kriging method with elevation as an additional input was used to spatially average epen denoted epen cok erad denoted erad cok and p denoted pcok the mae of epen erad and p between those obtained by the kriging and cokriging interpolation algorithms were 8 9 mm year 3 7 mm year and 10 8 mm year respectively for all 15 catchments table a 1 which are less than the uncertainties in parameter calibration obtained using the minimizing mae approximately 53 mm between eobs and emol table 3 moreover when epen cok erad cok and pcok were used to calibrate the parameters of the gnaa sgcf and aa table a 1 the mean αe and c in the gnaa αe 1 b xmin and xmax in the scgf and αe and 1 b in the aa were 1 05 5 95 1 14 1 61 0 21 0 94 and 1 07 1 23 for all catchments respectively which were similar to the values in table 4 only in a few catchments such as the gushanchuan kushui and sanchuan there were obvious parameter differences furthermore additional high precision grid meteorological data are now available which would benefit accurate calculation of erad or epen p etc and parameter estimations at a catchment scale 5 conclusions two generalized complementary functions the gnaa and the sgcf were validated and compared with annual water balance derived data from 15 catchments in the loess plateau china for the gnaa at an annual timescale it is necessary to optimize parameters αe and c to accurately estimate annual e for the sgcf at an annual scale the upper and lower limits of the sgcf need to be constrained when estimating e after calibration the sgcf performs a little better than the gnaa and the calibrated αe from the sgcf is closer to 1 26 than that of the gnaa as relative variations in αe are much smaller than in other parameters the generalized complementary functions have the potential to be applied with αe set as a constant value with little weakening of the model performance

5451,generalized complementary functions which describe the relationship between the ratio of actual evaporation over the penman potential evaporation e epen and the proportion of the radiation term in epen erad epen have not been widely used at annual time scales in this study the generalized nonlinear advection aridity function gnaa and sigmoid generalized complementary function sgcf were evaluated for annual evaporation estimation with calibrated parameters in the loess plateau of china for all 15 catchments the lowest values of annual erad epen were found to be much larger than zero and the annual e epen increased approximately linearly with annual erad epen this complementary evaporation relationship at an annual timescale differs from those at daily timescales and requires different parameterizations of the gnaa and sgcf for the gnaa parameter c which is often set to zero for daily time scales need to be well calibrated with available data for the sgcf the upper and lower limits of erad epen must be constrained after calibration both the sgcf and gnaa performed well at estimating annual evaporation in addition the calibrated priestley taylor coefficient from the

vegetation information brutsaert 2015 han and tian 2018 the original complementary principle involves a linear complementary relationship cr between actual evaporation e potential evaporation epo and

range from 0 52 to 0 77 with a mean value of 0 69 table 1 the results from four example catchments located in the south c1 east c2 west c6 and northern c12 regions of the loess plateau are shown in fig 2 the linear relationship also exists for all catchments on the interannual scale fig 3 3 2 effects of different parameterization methods in the gnaa for the annual data from all catchments by setting c 0 the optimized αe of the gnaa was 0 74 table 2 and the corresponding complementary curve of the gnaa does not fit the observed values well fig 3 most points are located below the gnaa curve with αe 1 and c 0 implying that the calibrated αe would be less than unity if c 0 if αe is set to 1 26 the optimized c of the gnaa is 17 05 and the fitting degree of the gnaa curve to the observed data increases significantly however the simulated e epen would be less than zero if erad epen 0 58 the fitting degree of the gnaa curve to the observed data would further increase if both αe and c were calibrated 1 09 and 6 94 respectively and the curve was above y 0 if erad epen 0 49 xmin in fig 3 the curve within the range of the observed data approaches a straight line 3 3 effects of different parameterization methods in the sgcf for fixed xmin 0 and xmax 1 the sgcf with calibrated m and n values fits the observed data well fig 4 the calibrated αe was 1 17 which is located in a reasonable range of the priestley taylor coefficient the curve shows little change if xmax is added for calibration the calibrated value of xmax is 0 96 however the two curves of the sgcf with xmin 0 depart from the lower parts of the scatter plots the fit of the sgcf curve is improved if xmin is also added for calibration table 2 calibrated xmin and xmax values were 0 51 and 0 87 respectively which are outside their recommended ranges at a daily timescale similar results were found for the four selected catchments fig 2 the sgcf curve with four calibrated parameters was nearly equal to the linear aa curves for all 15 catchments 3 4 annual evaporation estimation performances of gnaa and sgcf the performances of gnaa and sgcf as well as the aa model were compared for modeling annual e for the 15 catchments of the loess plateau table 3 and their optimized parameters are shown in table 4 generally the discrepancies among the three complementary functions for actual evaporation estimation are small the sgcf performed better than the gnaa and aa functions for most of the catchments the relative errors of the simulated e and water balance derived e were 0 11 4 7 0 02 3 7 and 0 02 3 73 for the gnaa sgcf and aa models in the 15 catchments respectively the two catchments c3 c4 in the northern region were characterized by much smaller r2 and nse values than the other catchments which might reflect their smaller areas and the fact that they contained no meteorological sites the ranges of parameters αe and c of the gnaa were 0 91 1 18 and 2 73 11 18 respectively the ranges of parameter αe and b 1 for the aa model were 0 89 1 24 and 0 58 2 25 respectively for the sgcf the range of parameter αe was 1 03 1 27 with an average value of 1 15 the ranges of parameter b 1 xmin and xmax were 1 05 2 78 0 16 0 54 and 0 78 0 98 respectively in catchments c6 c10 c11 and c13 the optimized αe of sgcf was approximately 1 26 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 priestley taylor coefficient in generalized complementary functions the priestley taylor coefficient αe is the common parameter in complementary functions and has been thought to range from 1 0 to 1 5 brutsaert and chen 1995 it was reported that calibrated values of αe for the aa model were 1 18 1 00 and 1 04 in central sweden eastern china and northwestern cyprus respectively xu and singh 2005 and that the average of parameter αe for the aa model was 1 18 using the first international field experiment data szilagyi 2007 in four different climate and land use types in australia αe calibrated for the gnaa ranged from 1 04 to 1 19 zhang et al 2017 while it ranged from 1 01 to 1 02 for three heights in the semi humid regions of the loess plateau brutsaert et al 2017 and from 0 98 to 1 1 for four sites with differing elevations on gongga mountain southwest of china hu et al 2018 mean values of αe 1 12 and 1 13 were determined from observational data using the modified gnaa for the whole china ma et al 2019 and for 334 basins in the united states szilagyi et al 2017 han and tian 2018 obtained the ranges of αe to 0 9 1 29 for the gnaa and 0 97 1 40 for the sgcf with constraining xmin 0 and xmax 1 at 20 flux stations in different representative biomes for the tibetan plateau china the αe calibrated for the sgcf is 1 02 ma et al 2015a while it became 1 13 for aa model ma et al 2015b in this study the averages calibrated by the gnaa sgcf and aa with annual data from the loess plateau were 1 07 1 15 and 1 11 respectively which are approximately consistent with previous studies the calibrated αe from the sgcf was closest to the widely accepted value of 1 26 although it has been reported that the sensitivity of parameter αe to e is greater than that of parameter c to e liu et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 the relative variations in calibrated parameter αe for the 15 catchments were less than those of c or b 1 the optimized αe varies for the 15 catchments with a standard deviation sd of 0 07 and a coefficient of variation cv of 0 06 for gnaa which is much less than the values of c with sd of 1 95 and cv of 0 29 respectively similar results were also found for the sgcf and aa functions in which the sd cv for αe are 0 07 0 06 and 0 08 0 08 respectively and those for b 1 are 0 54 0 32 and 0 39 0 28 respectively the relatively stable αe suggests that generalized complementary functions may be used with a constant αe han et al 2012 gnaa is a nonlinear improvement based on the linear aa model and more boundary conditions the linear aa function could be regarded as a special case of the sgcf and the parameters of the sgcf were estimated with the aid of aa model because the complementary curves are approximately linear when erad epen is neither excessively large nor excessively small han and tian 2018 therefore there is an intrinsic connection among the three models the three functions are approximately equivalent under conditions neither too dry nor too wet therefore the calibrated αe values from the three models are significantly correlated with correlation coefficients of 0 72 between the gnaa and sgcf 0 95 between the gnaa and aa and 0 64 between the sgcf and aa in this study the performances of the gnaa sgcf and aa for estimating annual evaporation rates with fixed αe 1 07 1 15 and 1 11 respectively from 15 catchments were also evaluated few differences in model performances were observed among the three models with mean mae increasing from 53 0 52 9 and 52 3 to 54 3 53 6 and 54 7 mm respectively table 3 and 5 if αe is set as a constant value the burden of parameter calibration for generalized complementary functions is reduced with acceptable performances weakening 4 2 lower limit of erad epen the lower limit of erad epen is controversial in the use of complementary functions zero is generally regarded as the lower limit for erad epen in the gnaa and in the original version of the sgcf han et al 2012 however erad epen does not necessarily equal zero when e epen 0 as it is almost impossible for epen to reach infinity for a certain large erad crago et al 2016 crago and qualls 2018 szilagyi et al 2017 in the sgcf the lower limit was modified to e epen 0 at erad epen xmin at short timescales daily or hourly xmin may approach zero when the energy input is small however xmin would be much larger than zero at longer timescales as erad is much larger than zero han and tian 2018 the minimum values of observed annual erad epen ranged from 0 52 to 0 73 with a mean value of 0 64 for the 15 catchments in the loess plateau the optimized xmin of the sgcf ranged from 0 16 to 0 54 with a mean value of 0 38 the inclusion of xmin improved the performance of the sgcf when estimating annual evaporation one of four boundary conditions in the gnaa requires that the start point of the curve is the origin i e e epen 0 at erad epen 0 however the curve has two intersection points on the horizontal axis if c is larger than 2 fig 3 thus the second intersection point should be used as the starting point which corresponds to the boundary condition of e epen 0 at erad epen xmin liu et al 2020 the xmin values of the gnaa for each catchment are shown in table 4 and range from 0 2 to 0 55 with an average of 0 46 4 3 impact of spatial interpolation methods on parameters meteorological data from observation sites were used to calculate daily erad or epen in this study and then monthly erad or epen and p were interpolated using the kriging algorithm which is called the calculate then interpolate method however some researchers spatially average the meteorological data first then calculate daily and even annual erad or epen which is called the interpolate then calculate method however the latter method accumulates the interpolation error of the input variables in contrast the former method only interpolates once and thus introduces smaller errors mardikis et al 2005 in addition different interpolation algorithms have little effect on the parameters for example the cokriging interpolation method based on the kriging method with elevation as an additional input was used to spatially average epen denoted epen cok erad denoted erad cok and p denoted pcok the mae of epen erad and p between those obtained by the kriging and cokriging interpolation algorithms were 8 9 mm year 3 7 mm year and 10 8 mm year respectively for all 15 catchments table a 1 which are less than the uncertainties in parameter calibration obtained using the minimizing mae approximately 53 mm between eobs and emol table 3 moreover when epen cok erad cok and pcok were used to calibrate the parameters of the gnaa sgcf and aa table a 1 the mean αe and c in the gnaa αe 1 b xmin and xmax in the scgf and αe and 1 b in the aa were 1 05 5 95 1 14 1 61 0 21 0 94 and 1 07 1 23 for all catchments respectively which were similar to the values in table 4 only in a few catchments such as the gushanchuan kushui and sanchuan there were obvious parameter differences furthermore additional high precision grid meteorological data are now available which would benefit accurate calculation of erad or epen p etc and parameter estimations at a catchment scale 5 conclusions two generalized complementary functions the gnaa and the sgcf were validated and compared with annual water balance derived data from 15 catchments in the loess plateau china for the gnaa at an annual timescale it is necessary to optimize parameters αe and c to accurately estimate annual e for the sgcf at an annual scale the upper and lower limits of the sgcf need to be constrained when estimating e after calibration the sgcf performs a little better than the gnaa and the calibrated αe from the sgcf is closer to 1 26 than that of the gnaa as relative variations in αe are much smaller than in other parameters the generalized complementary functions have the potential to be applied with αe set as a constant value with little weakening of the model performance this allows for a reduced burden of parameter calibration credit authorship contribution statement haixiang zhou conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft songjun han software

5452,cropping in the polders and islands of the ganges delta is difficult particularly in the dry season when water is limited and salinity can damage plant growth cropping is generally restricted to the wet season the limited cropping contributes to the high incidence of poverty and limited livelihood prospects in the region increasing crop production is desirable and will depend upon management of the water and salt in a polder we have developed a novel time series model of water and salt stores and flows in an idealised polder to investigate water and salt management strategies for crop production including strategies to cope with climate change and sea level rise we know of no other model that simulates the overall water and salt balance of a polder and that can assess a wide range of polder water and salt management strategies the model adequately reproduces the dynamic water and salt behaviour observed in field data and also agrees with results produced by a more detailed crop model a sensitivity analysis of the model shows the results are sensitive to the key model parameters in general the results are more sensitive to parameters governing the transfers of salt and less sensitive to those governing the availability of water the crop evapotranspiration is particularly sensitive to the model parameters the main practical consideration resulting from this simplified but robust representation of the polder salt and water balance processes is the importance of management including drainage to remove salt strategies to improve water availability while useful are secondary to the management of salt keywords water balance salt balance polder model sensitivity salt drainage 1 introduction large areas of the ganges delta comprise islands or polders of low lying alluvial sediments which have been protected by embankments and are used for cropping mainuddin et al 2019a see also mainuddin et al 2014 although productive in rice during the monsoon cropping is difficult in polders particularly in the dry season due to occasional waterlogging of the heavy soils limiting crop establishment in the early dry season plant damage due to rising soil salt concentration later in the dry season as the soils dry out and limited opportunity to store fresh water for irrigation the limited crop productivity contributes to the high incidence of poverty and limited livelihood prospects in the region increasing crop production is dependent upon water availability minimising waterlogging and the management of ponds canals and drainage channels to keep them free of salt in some polders where water in the surrounding rivers is sufficiently fresh there may be opportunities for irrigation using river water at the same time however agriculture may be made more difficult due to increasing salinization in the water and soils of the region resulting from saline aquaculture fresh groundwater pumping upstream fresh water diversion sea level rise saline water intrusion and flooding with sea water rahman et al 2019 the hydrology of polders in the ganges delta is complex with water and usually salt exchanged amongst the atmosphere the soil water plant system in the polder the underlying groundwater and the surrounding rivers the sedimentary deposits from which the polders are made developed in a saline environment resulting in much saline groundwater worland et al 2015 small pockets of freshwater including freshwater lenses occur at the top of the aquifer worland et al 2015 naus et al 2019 assessed freshwater availability in the top 60 m of the aquifer in the bangladesh coastal zone coastal zone aquifers in many parts of the world have been studied in detail with particular reference to sea water intrusion e g ketabchi et al 2016 and the references therein however these and the many similar studies say little about the dynamic nature of water availability for crops and the way this is determined by water and salt management of a polder stofberg et al 2017 note that shallow freshwater lenses may be critical for crop production in coastal environments water use by vegetation is in turn critical to the dynamics of freshwater lenses comte et al 2014 werner et al 2017 which may disappear when evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall in the summer stofberg et al 2017 the salinity of the lens also impacts on the vegetation water use comte et al 2014 freshwater lenses and soils in coastal zones and small islands are vulnerable to inundation by seawater during storm surges which may render them too saline for use for periods of a few months to several years kumar et al 2010 debnath 2013 haldar and denbath 2014 werner et al 2017 at a finer scale than that of a freshwater lens payo et al 2017 based on earlier work by clarke et al 2015 suggest that the accumulation of salt in the soil depends on the inflows and outflows of water via irrigation tidal inundation drainage capillary rise evapotranspiration and the salinity of the water in the various flows the papers noted above are a small sample of a large literature on coastal aquifers freshwater lenses which are a particularly important source of freshwater on small islands in the pacific and elsewhere werner et al 2017 water availability in polders and salinity impacts while this literature provides a good conceptual understanding of the issues and the complexity of the interactions we are not aware of a study of the exchanges of water and salt amongst the atmosphere noting that salt does not enter the atmosphere through evaporation or transpiration the soil water plant system in the polder the underlying groundwater and the surrounding rivers and how the exchanges may be affected by management actions in this paper we describe a simple monthly model of the water and salt balances in a typical polder our aim is to use the model to investigate water and salt management strategies for crop production including strategies to cope with climate change and sea level rise models that deal with water and salt balances in similar situations include saltmod oosterban 2002 which computes salt and water balances in four seasons in a year and has been applied in deltaic environments e g yao et al 2014 the daily catchment water and salt balance model of bari and smettem 2006 and the polder salt and water balance polder model of de louw et al 2011 which is directed at understanding the upward flow of water and salt in boils small zones of intense upward flow of water the model of payo et al 2017 considered the capillary rise of groundwater which could carry salt upwards into the soil and the input of salt from the surface due to irrigation and flooding they applied the model to examine the impacts of climate change on soil salinity in the coastal region of bangladesh none of the models mentioned above simulates the full suite of water and salt exchanges in a polder nor how they may be influenced by management actions the model we describe here bears some similarities with that of payo et al 2017 however our model extends the salt and water balance from the soil to the whole polder and includes the management of drainage and irrigation channels within the polder the impacts of inundation by seawater and the impact of soil water salinity on plant evapotranspiration our model thus extends the range of salt and water impacts and management strategies that can be considered as far as we know no other model has this mix of capabilities and no other model can be used to assess as wide a range of salt and water management strategies in polders in an earlier paper mainuddin et al 2019b we introduced the polder model and described the simple conceptual background and some of early calibration results here we extend that paper greatly to explicitly give the model equations and the data inputs we extend the calibration in the earlier paper to include more field data and calibration against detailed crop modelling results we add to the earlier study a monte carlo parameter sensitivity analysis which gives useful and important results on the importance of salt management in the polders and the lesser importance of providing additional water for crop growth following the description of the model we describe its calibration for three locations with differing salinities in the ganges delta fig 1 finally we examine the sensitivity of the model outputs to the key parameters 2 water and salt balances in polders processes and a simple model mainuddin et al 2014 2019b describe the physical characteristics of the coastal zone of the ganges delta it comprises a series of islands separated by the distributary channels of the ganges river many of the islands have been protected by embankments to form polders the term polder is used in bangladesh but not in west bengal in india where the embanked islands are referred to simply as islands much of the region is affected by soil and groundwater salinity rainfall generally is much higher than potential evapotranspiration during the monsoon months leading to an excess of water that is drained to the surrounding rivers through managed sluice gates these considerations together with the conceptual model of fresh and saline groundwater in the bangladesh polders of worland et al 2015 lead to the conceptual model described below 2 1 water and salt balance model the conceptual basis of the water and salt balance in a polder is shown in fig 2 the polder is conceived as a unit with an area of crops and an area of canals and ponds other areas such as houses and roads are small and are not considered in the model the area of canals and ponds may be varied to model one potential water and salt management strategy that of increasing the volume of water stored for use in irrigation increasing the area of canals and ponds leads to a corresponding decrease in the cropped area the model tracks the stores of salt and water in i the soil ii the shallow groundwater and iii the canals and ponds and the movements of salt and water between these three stores the model also tracks the movements of salt and water from these stores to the external environment of the deeper groundwater which in our model means groundwater below the freshwater lens the rivers that surround the polder and the atmosphere noting that salt does not enter the atmosphere through evaporation or transpiration the shallow groundwater will rise in the wet season and fall in the dry season it will generally have a salt concentration different to that of the deeper groundwater it is conceived as a layer or lens which sits on top of the deeper groundwater as found in the ganges delta worland et al 2015 and other environments such as small pacific islands white and falkland 2010 whereas there is some mixing between fresh groundwater lenses and the underlying groundwater white and falkland 2010 for simplicity we model the shallow transient layer as not mixing with the deeper groundwater however deeper groundwater may be accessed by capillary rise if it is shallow enough and if the shallow groundwater lens is exhausted each of the three stores of water and salt is considered to be a single store there is no differentiation of soil into several layers for example the movement of water between the stores and with the external environment is based on simple process models as described below the movement of salt is based on the movement of water and the concentration of salt in the water the model uses a monthly timestep 2 2 water and salt mass balance equations water balances are calculated for the soil water shallow groundwater and ponds and canals by mass balance equations 1 w s t d t w s t r i r r c r f et a d v d f ε ws 2 w gs t d

shallow groundwater and the canals and ponds εws εwgs and εwcp are mass balance error terms the remaining terms are all flows of water in a month depicted by the arrows in fig 2 r is the rainfall irr is applied irrigation cr is capillary rise f is a flood eta is the actual evapotranspiration dv is vertical drainage from the soil below the root zone df is drainage from the fields inriv is inflows from the surrounding rivers to the canals and ponds and outriv is outflows from the canals and ponds to the rivers apc is the area of ponds and canals and ac is the area of crops the shallow groundwater and soil water stores are treated as one dimensional stores and the water contents are calculated as depths of water the water content in the canals and ponds is calculated as a volume so the flows between the soil and the canals are multiplied by the area the flows between the canals and ponds and the surrounding rivers are calculated as volumes each water store is limited to a maximum capacity the volume of canals the saturated soil water content and the maximum depth that can be occupied by the groundwater multiplied by the specific yield for rice crops water is assumed to be ponded on top of the soil surface and the soil is saturated the individual gains and losses are calculated by simple process models to be described below salt masses are calculated for the soil water shallow groundwater and ponds and canals by mass balance equations of the form 4 s s t d t s s t i r r c cp c r c g f c r d v c s d f c df ε ss 5 s gs t d t s gs t d v c s c r c g ε sgs 6 s cp t

balance error terms the other terms are salt movement terms in which the water flow is multiplied by a salt concentration cx where x denotes the concentration of the store in question described further below 2 3 mass balance errors the water and salt mass balance errors are explicitly calculated and reported for the soil water and the canals and ponds in the current version the mass balance error is always small of order 10 8 or less of the size of the other terms in the mass balance equations in all timesteps for water contents and 10 6 or less of the size of the other terms for salt contents 2 4 water movement the shallow groundwater is modelled as gaining water and hence salt by vertical drainage from the overlying soil and capillary rise from the underlying deeper groundwater and losing water by capillary rise to the overlying soil vertical drainage from the overlying soil dv occurs when the soil water content ws exceeds the field capacity of the soil ws fc 7 d v m i n w s w s f c 0 the shallow groundwater loses water by capillary rise to the soil according to the unsaturated soil water flow equation salvucci 1993 eq 1 8 cr k w s ψ w s d z 1 where cr is the capillary rise z is the vertical distance between the water table and the base of the soil k ws is the water content dependent unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil and ψ ws is the water content dependent suction of the soil the shallow groundwater may also gain water and salt by capillary rise from the deeper groundwater below only in the circumstance that it is entirely depleted by capillary rise and water and salt to satisfy eq 8 is then brought up from the underlying deeper water table the deeper water table is considered to remain at constant depth and salinity the depth to the water table wt in the shallow groundwater is given by 9 wt t d t wt t d v c r s y where sy is the specific yield the depth of the water table thus calculated applies when the water table is below or equal to the base of the soil layer when the water table rises to the base of the soil further additions of water to the soil implies that the water table will rise into the soil layer the depth of the water table in the soil is then given by the depth of zero water suction implied by the ψ ws relationship used in eq 8 the evapotranspiration is modelled using a crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 in which the potential evapotranspiration eto is multiplied by a crop dependent coefficient kc to calculate the actual evapotranspiration et 10 et k c k s e t o where ks is a crop dependent stress factor that reduces crop water uptake in dry soils given by 11 k s w s w s w 1 p w s f c w s w where ws w is the wilting point of the soil p is a depletion factor and the other symbols were given above kc and ks both vary throughout the growing period of an individual crop and we simulate sequences of crops by sequences of the two coefficients eq 11 has been adapted from equation 84 in allen et al 1998 but given in terms of soil water contents rather than readily available water during fallow periods evaporation of water from the soil may be significant particularly after rain when the soil is wet the evapotranspiration is then taken to be the soil evaporation e is modelled by a simple empirical expression relating the evaporation e to the soil saturation s and the potential evapotranspiration 12 e s 2 e t o the irrigation irr given by the amount of water required to restore the soil to field capacity after accounting for capillary rise 13 irr m a x 0 m i n w p a a c w s f c w s c r the minimum function constrains the irrigation application to the volume of water available in the ponds and canals and from further inflows from the rivers surrounding the polder wp a divided by the area of crops ac to give the depth of water available for irrigation the availability of water from the river is constrained by a maximum inflow rate which models the flow capacity of the sluice gates and canal system when the crop is rice the irrigation requirement includes the water to saturate the soil and establish or maintain the pond the maximum function constrains the irrigation application to periods when the soil water store plus capillary rise is inadequate for the crop the final process that adds water to the soil is that of floods floods are defined by input data which give the month in which they occur the depth to which the polder is flooded and the salt concentration of the flooding water the field drainage removes water from the soil it is calculated as the value of df required to ensure that the water content w s t d t in eq 1 does not exceed the soil saturation plus a rice pond depth if the crop is rice field drainage adds to the canals and ponds as given in eq 3 the volume of water evaporating from canals and ponds is subtracted given by f1 eto multiplied by the area of canals and ponds where f1 is a constant factor analogous to a pan evaporation factor flood water also adds to the water in canals and ponds with the volume given by the depth of the flood multiplied by the area of canals and ponds if the result of the additions and subtractions is a volume of water greater than the volume of canals and ponds the excess is removed and is considered to have drained to the river within the month 2 5 salt movement the water flow terms are multiplied by salt concentrations to give the salt mass flow note that the rain and evapotranspiration evaporation water terms are absent since they move water but not salt in eqs 4 6 cs cgs and ccp are the salt concentrations in the soil the shallow groundwater and the canals and ponds calculated as the mass of salt in the store divided by the water content if the water content of the shallow groundwater falls to zero and yet there is still upward capillary flow based on the equation below the salt concentration of the upward flow is taken as that of the deeper saline groundwater which is assumed to be a fixed value not varying with time cr is the salt concentration of the surrounding rivers defined by input data to the model cdf is the salt concentration in the field drainage df the field drainage results from an excess of rain landing on the soil the rain itself has no salt but it may mix with the soil water to produce water at a salt concentration between that of the rain a concentration of zero and that of the soil water it will then carry some salt to the canals and ponds how much mixing occurs is not clear and we know of no data or study which gives a clear answer it seems reasonable to suppose that the degree of mixing may vary according to the antecedent conditions for example a period of soil drying may result in salt precipitation at the surface this can be observed in the field in salty polders during the dry season a sudden downpour of rain may pick up this salt and carry it away in runoff before there is time for much infiltration gentle rain on the other hand would leach the salt down into the soil before runoff occurs and the later runoff would carry very little salt away we therefore treated the degree of mixing as an adjustable parameter varying from 0 no mixing to 1 complete mixing to be fixed by calibration the concentration of salt in the runoff is therefore given by 14 c df m x c r w s where mx is the mixing coefficient we shall examine the impact of varying the mixing parameter in the later section on sensitivity analysis salt in the soil water is assumed to reduce crop water uptake at high concentrations represented as a modified stress factor ks as described in allen et al 1998 15 k s s a l t k s c s c s t 1 b s 100 k y where ks salt is the modified factor that includes the salt and water deficit stress effects cs and cs t are the salt concentration in the soil and a crop dependent threshold salt concentration below which the water use of the crop is not affected by salinity bs and ky are crop dependent parameters that govern how much the crop is affected by salinity values above the threshold salinity larger values of bs and smaller values of ky lead to a rapid reduction of crop water use as salinity increases beyond the threshold value the equation applies only when the soil salt concentration is above the threshold value cs t when the equation applies the modified stress factor ks salt is used in equation 6 in place of ks 2 6 input data the input data are of three types time series data fixed parameters describing the polder soil and cropping system and parameters which are designed to be varied to simulate scenarios time series monthly values for rainfall potential evapotranspiration river salt concentration flood inundation events specified as depth of flooding and salt concentration of the flood water but usually both are null values for a given month since floods are rare events and in any event we do not model flood scenarios for all simulations flood inundation events could be historical events defined by observed data or hypothetical floods for scenario exploration polder total area pond area cropping area soil root zone depth saturated water

water may not be used for irrigation and a decision parameter yes no that determines whether irrigation is used or not 3 model calibration for the three field experimental sites the model was calibrated using two approaches in the first the model results were compared to measurements taken in field experiments at the three experimental sites in the second the model results for the soil and plant water uptake were compared to the results of a detailed crop model apsim holzworth et al 2014 itself calibrated with the field experiments and previously tested thoroughly across a diverse range of environments and management practices in asia gaydon et al 2017 for each of the three sites the same calibration parameters were used for the two different calibration approaches mainuddin et al 2019a and bell et al 2019 described three years of field experiments at amtali in polder 43 and dacope in polder 31 in bangladesh and gosaba island in west bengal fig 1 the sites have an annual average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration respectively of about 2500 and 1200 mm 1800 and 1300 mm and 1900 and 1400 mm at each of three field sites there are many experimental plots involving different crops and management a range of crop water soil and salinity measurements were taken in the course of the experiments and at the two bangladesh sites there were also earlier series of groundwater depth measurements in addition to the field measurements the apsim crop management model has been calibrated at each site the model has a detailed daily description of crop growth processes and calibration included fitting the apsim model to measurements of plant growth characteristics that are not considered in the polder model described above simulations over longer periods using the calibrated apsim models for each site provides another test of the soil and crop water use parts of the polder model the input climate and river salinity data are those obtained from meteorological station records nearest to the sites khepupara for amtali polder 43 khulna for dacope polder 31 and canning town for gosaba island the calibration of the polder water and salt balance model used one set of parameters at each site for both the comparison with the field measurements and the comparison with the apsim model results an initial set of the soil shallow groundwater and crop parameters described in the previous section was derived for each site by fitting the polder model to the field measurements the properties were then refined by fitting the model to the apsim results finally the comparisons with the field measurements were re checked and some small adjustments made for the final calibrations however there are limitations to the calibrations the experimental plots at each site cover just a small fraction of the overall polder area and conditions differ somewhat from plot to plot the polder model on the other hand considers the polder as one large entity with just one value for each quantity such as soil salinity or groundwater depth the groundwater level measurements are for longer periods than other measurements furthermore as already noted the comparison with field data is augmented by a comparison over a longer period of a more detailed model this permits comparison of some water and salt stores and flows that were either not measured or seldom measured however the polder model simulates processes that the apsim model does not traditional hydrological goodness of fit measures of calibration are difficult to apply in such circumstances we therefore accept a visual judgement of a good model comparison with a range of measured and apsim modelled results 3 1 model calibration using field data with these limitations in mind fig 3 shows the comparison of field soil salinity groundwater depth and salinity and canal and pond salinity measurements with results from the calibrated polder water and salt balance model the results are for three years with the monsoon periods shown by the three periods of shallow groundwater levels note that the soil salinity readings were of electrical conductivity ec1 5 we have converted them to sodium chloride concentrations cs using the formula suggested by barrett lennard et al 2018 cs g l 0 64 ec1 5 ds m 5 100 w where w is the gravimetric moisture content sodium chloride is the dominant salt barrett lennard et al 2018 the modelled results generally show similar behaviour to the measured results the modelled canal and pond salt concentrations and the groundwater depths fall within the range of the measured results the dry season increase in pond canal salinity and increase in groundwater depth are seen both in the model results and measured data the modelled soil water salt concentration is generally of right order but there are too few measured results to properly test the model the field measurements of shallow groundwater salt concentration show one series at each site with salt concentrations similar to the modelled fresh lens at amtali and gosaba another series shows salt concentration varying roughly between that of the modelled freshwater lens and that of the assumed deeper groundwater layer this intermediate salt concentration may be due to mixing of fresher and saltier water either in the ground or in the piezometer which may intercept water of different salinities at different depths either form of mixing would result in the behaviour shown in fig 3 thus fig 3 is consistent with the assumed groundwater behaviour if the mixing is in the piezometer but is also consistent with mixing in the ground the results in fig 3 show broadly similar behaviour at all three sites in terms of both modelled and measured quantities the salt concentrations in ponds canals and groundwater and the way they change through the dry and wet seasons are similar at all three locations as is the fall and rise of groundwater with the dry and wet seasons all three sites have an annual rainfall total which exceeds the annual potential evapotranspiration by several hundred mm and so all three are likely to have salinity and groundwater depth behaviour strongly influenced by the availability of excess fresh water to flush salt out and replenish the groundwater in the wet season it is possible that this masks other differences which could arise from different soil characteristics or different management 3 2 model calibration using apsim results the apsim model was used to simulate 24 years of crop and soil dynamics at amtali and dacope and 2 years at gosaba at amtali and dacope the simulations were of rotation of a kharif wet season rice crop and a rabi dry season wheat crop at gosaba a single rice crop was simulated fig 4 shows the input rainfall for amtali and resulting actual evapotranspiration runoff vertical drainage from the soil combined runoff and drainage soil moisture content water table and soil salt concentration note that the rainfall series shows three dry years in 2007 2009 the actual rainfall records at amtali do not show this feature however we use this series since it causes a significant perturbation in those two years which is a more interesting test of the two models the actual evapotranspiration results are broadly similar with a similar peak in october each year the annual average actual evapotranspiration simulated by apsim is 1227 mm whereas with the polder model it is 1143 mm the polder model produces an average annual runoff of 922 mm whilst apsim results in runoff of 373 mm in apsim the groundwater is a fixed external entity to which drainage can always occur and this removes some of the excess water the polder model in contrast internally simulates a dynamic groundwater table when it is at or near the soil surface which is the case for much of the wet season there is little or no drainage and excess water is removed as runoff the sum of runoff and drainage in the two models is however similar as seen by the positive values only in the left hand figure of the third row in fig 4a the annual average of runoff plus drainage is 921 mm for apsim and 915 mm for the polder model the negative values in the left hand figure of the third row in fig 4a indicate capillary rise simulated by apsim and have an annual average of 407 mm the magnitude of capillary rise modelled by apsim is quite unlikely since it would lead to substantial falls in the groundwater table in the dry season of 4 m or more which is not seen in the field data as shown in fig 3 in the polder model this additional water is gained mostly from irrigation with an annual average of 437 mm the soil water content summed over the top metre varies in a similar fashion between the dry and wet seasons in the two models though the polder model indicates a longer period of wet soil this results from the ponded rice water table in the polder model staying at or near the surface for a longer period in the polder model as shown in the left hand figure of the fourth row of fig 4a finally the soil salt concentration simulated by the two models is similar for most years however in the dry years of 2007 2009 the polder model simulated that the supply of irrigation water would be inadequate resulting in greater use of stored soil water and shallow groundwater the drier soil resulted in greater soil salt concentrations in these years the results for dacope and gosaba show similar behaviour to that of amtali those for dacope are shown in fig 5 the polder model and apsim actual evapotranspiration runoff plus drainage and soil water content are again similar though in this case apsim shows some runoff the annual average evapotranspiration is 1453 mm for apsim and 1393 mm for the polder model the sum of drainage plus runoff is 923 and 867 mm for apsim and the polder model the capillary rise in apsim is 417 mm whereas the polder model applied irrigation is 416 mm the groundwater table simulated by the polder model is in dacope closer to the apsim result in the wet season in contrast to amtali where it is closer in the dry season the polder model results in peak soil water salt concentration a little higher than does apsim but the two models otherwise produce similar results with similar year to year variation the apsim model for gosaba simulated the behaviour over two years fig 6 the results of the two models are again broadly similar unlike the cases of amtali and dacope apsim did not simulate any runoff but the total runoff plus drainage is again similar the simulations were of a single crop rice and the annual average evapotranspiration was smaller than at amtali and dacope being 702 mm for apsim and 793 mm for the polder model the rainfall in the two years of simulation was wetter than the rainfall used in the simulations at amtali and dacope as a result the polder model simulation resulted in only 33 mm of irrigation and apsim had 194 mm of capillary rise overall then the polder model has simulated the apsim results reasonably well at three sites the main differences arise from the incorporation in the polder model of water table dynamics which results in 1 the different paths taken in the two models to remove excess water and 2 the accessing of groundwater in apsim for capillary rise to satisfy dry season water requirement whereas the polder model uses irrigation because there is insufficient groundwater for this purpose at least if the model is to simulate the field measured groundwater table dynamics reasonably well 4 model sensitivity analysis soil physical properties aquifer properties salt concentrations in the aquifer and surrounding rivers and the area of the polder in canals and ponds will all vary from polder to polder to examine the influence of the variation in parameters we performed a sensitivity analysis of the model using a monte carlo approach nine input parameters were allowed to vary over a pre defined range with random draws to give the value of each parameter for a single model run the procedure was repeated 1000 times for each of the three models for amtali dacope and gosaba details of the monte carlo method are given in the appendix the nine input parameters are soil saturated water content wsat soil ksat ksat specific yield of shallow fresh groundwater sy surface

conc threshold irrigsaltthresh and a river salinity scaling coefficient riverscalecoeff the parameters and the range over which they were varied are described in the appendix we examined the sensitivity to varying the input parameters of five output parameters the salinity of the fresh groundwater lens cgf the salinity of the soil csoil the salinity of the ponds and canals cpond the amount of irrigation water applied irrig and the amount of evapotranspiration from the cropping system eta the evapotranspiration calculated by the model is taken to be an indicator of crop production to show the sensitivity of the output to the input parameters we used an elasticity formula schaake and liu 1989 commonly used in hydrology see for example yang and yang 2011 16 ε δ o δ i i o where ε is the elasticity i is an input parameter o is an output parameter and δo δi is the slope of the relationship between the input and output parameter when ε is less than one a unit change to the input parameter has a less than proportional change to the output values of one indicate that a unit change to the input has an equal proportional change to the output values greater than one indicate that a unit change to the input a greater than proportional change to the output in other words the larger the elasticity the greater the sensitivity to an input parameter with values greater than one being particularly sensitive the elasticity is based on an assumed linear relationship between the input and output variables whereas the actual relationships are in some cases non linear as shown by fig a1 in non linear cases the actual elasticity varies with the value of the input variable and in some parts of the input variable range the elasticity may be greater than and in other parts less than the values discussed below the elasticity values relating each of the nine input parameters to each of the five output parameters are given in table 1 which also indicates whether the correlation between each pair is statistically significant the actual values differ amongst the three sites but the table shows several features which are common to all sites 1 the model results are significantly correlated to most model parameters at all three sites shown by general dominance of the grey shaded cells 2 the elasticities are all less than one in the case of the three salt concentration parameters whereas some elasticities greater than one appear in the two water flow parameters 3 the mixing coefficient which governs how effectively salt is transferred in runoff from the soil to the ponds and canals and thence discharged out of the polder is the most influential parameter as indicated by bold type in table 1 4 more generally parameters that govern the movement of salt are more influential than those that govern the availability of water the former includes the mixing coefficient the depth to saline groundwater which controls salt movement into the shallow fresh groundwater and thence into the soil and its salinity the irrigation salt concentration threshold which governs the salt concentration up to which river or pond and canal water may be used for irrigation and the river salinity scaling coefficient the least influential parameters include the soil water storage and the ponds and canals storage which is directly related to their area we shall discuss some practical implications of this finding below 5 the direction of influence of the model parameters is generally as expected for example an increase in the mixing coefficient reduces the soil salinity which in turn increases the pond salinity the destination for the salt removed from the soil and reduces the salinity of the shallow groundwater since less salt leaches down the less salty soil leads to greater evapotranspiration which in turn leads to more use of irrigation water increasing the depth to saline groundwater reduces the soil water salt concentration since less salt is transported to the soil by capillary rise increasing river salinity with increasing values of the river salinity scaling coefficient is associated with decreasing salt concentrations in the fresh groundwater lens and the ponds and canals and sometimes also in the soil water this is because saltier river water is less often used for irrigation shown by the negative elasticities at all three sites for the interaction of the river salinity scaling coefficient and the amount of irrigation and so less water and hence less salt is imported into the polder the features above suggest some practical considerations for polder management firstly salt management is critical salt import into the soil depresses crop production while salt export enhances it the mixing coefficient was introduced to deal with a deficiency in our knowledge that of how much the salt in the soil water mixes with and is exported in runoff however it can also be considered as a surrogate for field salt drainage management the provision of subsurface field drainage for example would in the polder model terms be similar to increasing the mixing coefficient with positive impacts on cropping evapotranspiration in model terms the management of salt extends beyond crop and soil management to groundwater management as shown by the influence of the depth to saline groundwater and to the whole polder as shown by the influence of the salt concentration threshold for using water for irrigation these considerations lead to the question of whether enhanced drainage should be contemplated the drainage and salt management of dutch polders schultz 2008 for example is through a more highly engineered and managed system than is practised in the ganges delta conversely these results suggest that it is less critical to provide additional water through increasing the area of ponds and canals or increasing the water storage capacity of the soil this result should be treated with caution since the polder model is a monthly model and is not a detailed crop model it is therefore not responsive to the details of timing of irrigation events some of which may be important at critical times a more detailed crop model such as apsim is a better model in this regard however the general result that a large amount of additional water is not so critical follows from the fact that at all three sites the rain exceeds the evapotranspiration and the combined water storage of the soil and shallow groundwater supplies most of the crops needs even in the dry season this finding was also made by schulthess et al 2019 who examined the cultivation of wheat and maize in the coastal zone of bangladesh and concluded that irrigation had no impact on wheat and little impact on maize being significant only in the driest winter of their trials 5 conclusions we have developed a simple time stepping model of water and salt stores and flows in an idealised polder the strength of this model is in the successful integration of a wide range of salt and water transfer and storage processes in a very dynamic environment as far as we know it is the only model which deals with the transfers of water and salt amongst the soil plant continuum the atmosphere with which water only is exchanged the groundwater idealised as a two component system with a shallower fresh lens overlying a deeper salty regional groundwater the ponds and canals which drain the polder and may also be used in reverse for irrigation and the surrounding rivers it is thus the only model known to us which can be used to assess a wide range of crop soil water and salt management strategies from the level of the crop to the level of the whole polder while the model is conceptually simple with only three stores of water and salt and idealised transfer processes amongst them and with the surrounding environment it nevertheless successfully reproduces the complex water and salt behaviour observed in albeit limited field data and in detailed crop modelling results for three sites in the ganges delta the model results demonstrate the importance of correctly simulating the water table dynamics in contrast the failure to model water table dynamics in apsim leads to unlikely results for capillary rise with consequent unlikely adjustments to other water balance terms a monte carlo sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the results are sensitive to the key model parameters in general the results are more sensitive to parameters governing the transfers of salt and less sensitive to those governing the availability of water the main consideration resulting from the understanding of the polder salt and water balance processes and the model is the importance of management including drainage to remove salt finally we note the model will be useful for investigating new water and salt management procedures and for investigating the impacts of climate change by modifying the input data to form appropriate scenarios model assessments of these factors will be reported elsewhere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

aciar and krishi gobeshona foundation kgf of bangladesh under the project cropping system intensification in the salt affected coastal zones of bangladesh and west bengal india appendix monte carlo method and sampling intervals we used a mersenne twister random number generator matsumoto and nishamura 1998 which is regarded as good katzgraber 2010 though not fully random under all conditions o neill 2016 the mersenne twister algorithm has a period length 219937 1 matsumoto and nishamura 1998 which is vastly in excess of our requirement and also has other desirable features including its implementation as an excel add in and the ability to reproduce the same pseudo random number series in the examples discussed here we used 1000 monte carlo iterations more would generally be regarded as necessary for high quality results but for model development directed at improved understanding of the processes we regard 1000 as adequate we varied nine model parameters over the intervals shown in table a1 we examined the impact of the variation of the nine parameters on five output parameters the salinity of the fresh groundwater lens the soil and the ponds and canals the amount of irrigation water applied and the amount of evapotranspiration from the cropping system the models were run over a 24 year period which is the same as the apsim calibration period from 1994 to 2017 in the case of the amtali and dacope models the gosaba model was run over the same time period some parameters did not necessarily reach a statistical steady state within 24 years and therefore still somewhat reflected the initial value this was particularly the case for the fresh groundwater lens the salt concentration of which changed very slowly in some simulations particularly when the deeper groundwater was at some depth and therefore the shallow groundwater had a large volume to remove initial value effects the average salt concentration of the shallow groundwater was used as the initial value for a second run of 24 years and the process repeated until a quasi steady state was achieved in which the salt concentration might vary from one time period to the next but the manner of the variation was itself statistically invariant there are four parameters see the section on input data which define the water content dependent unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil k ws and the water content dependent suction of the soil ψ ws and hence influence the capillary rise in equation 4 however all four parameters influence the capillary rise in the same sense as the parameter increases so too does the amount of capillary rise it was therefore sufficient here to vary ksat alone the output of the amtali sensitivity analysis is shown graphically in fig a1 for discussion see the main text 
5452,cropping in the polders and islands of the ganges delta is difficult particularly in the dry season when water is limited and salinity can damage plant growth cropping is generally restricted to the wet season the limited cropping contributes to the high incidence of poverty and limited livelihood prospects in the region increasing crop production is desirable and will depend upon management of the water and salt in a polder we have developed a novel time series model of water and salt stores and flows in an idealised polder to investigate water and salt management strategies for crop production including strategies to cope with climate change and sea level rise we know of no other model that simulates the overall water and salt balance of a polder and that can assess a wide range of polder water and salt management strategies the model adequately reproduces the dynamic water and salt behaviour observed in field data and also agrees with results produced by a more detailed crop model a sensitivity analysis of the model shows the results are sensitive to the key model parameters in general the results are more sensitive to parameters governing the transfers of salt and less sensitive to those governing the availability of water the crop evapotranspiration is particularly sensitive to the model parameters the main practical consideration resulting from this simplified but robust representation of the polder salt and water balance processes is the importance of management including drainage to remove salt strategies to improve water availability while useful are secondary to the management of salt keywords water balance salt balance polder model sensitivity salt drainage 1 introduction large areas of the ganges delta comprise islands or polders of low lying alluvial sediments which have been protected by embankments and are used for cropping mainuddin et al 2019a see also mainuddin et al 2014 although productive in rice during the monsoon cropping is difficult in polders particularly in the dry season due to occasional waterlogging of the heavy soils limiting crop establishment in the early dry season plant damage due to rising soil salt concentration later in the dry season as the soils dry out and limited opportunity to store fresh water for irrigation the limited crop productivity contributes to the high incidence of poverty and limited livelihood prospects in the region increasing crop production is dependent upon water availability minimising waterlogging and the management of ponds canals and drainage channels to keep them free of salt in some polders where water in the surrounding rivers is sufficiently fresh there may be opportunities for irrigation using river water at the same time however agriculture may be made more difficult due to increasing salinization in the water and soils of the region resulting from saline aquaculture fresh groundwater pumping upstream fresh water diversion sea level rise saline water intrusion and flooding with sea water rahman et al 2019 the hydrology of polders in the ganges delta is complex with water and usually salt exchanged amongst the atmosphere the soil water plant system in the polder the underlying groundwater and the surrounding rivers the sedimentary deposits from which the polders are made developed in a saline environment resulting in much saline groundwater worland et al 2015 small pockets of freshwater including freshwater lenses occur at the top of the aquifer worland et al 2015 naus et al 2019 assessed freshwater availability in the top 60 m of the aquifer in the bangladesh coastal zone coastal zone aquifers in many parts of the world have been studied in detail with particular reference to sea water intrusion e g ketabchi et al 2016 and the references therein however these and the many similar studies say little about the dynamic nature of water availability for crops and the way this is determined by water and salt management of a polder stofberg et al 2017 note that shallow freshwater lenses may be critical for crop production in coastal environments water use by vegetation is in turn critical to the dynamics of freshwater lenses comte et al 2014 werner et al 2017 which may disappear when evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall in the summer stofberg et al 2017 the salinity of the lens also impacts on the vegetation water use comte et al 2014 freshwater lenses and soils in coastal zones and small islands are vulnerable to inundation by seawater during storm surges which may render them too saline for use for periods of a few months to several years kumar et al 2010 debnath 2013 haldar and denbath 2014 werner et al 2017 at a finer scale than that of a freshwater lens payo et al 2017 based on earlier work by clarke et al 2015 suggest that the accumulation of salt in the soil depends on the inflows and outflows of water via irrigation tidal inundation drainage capillary rise evapotranspiration and the salinity of the water in the various flows the papers noted above are a small sample of a large literature on coastal aquifers freshwater lenses which are a particularly important source of freshwater on small islands in the pacific and elsewhere werner et al 2017 water availability in polders and salinity impacts while this literature provides a good conceptual understanding of the issues and the complexity of the interactions we are not aware of a study of the exchanges of water and salt amongst the atmosphere noting that salt does not enter the atmosphere through evaporation or transpiration the soil water plant system in the polder the underlying groundwater and the surrounding rivers and how the exchanges may be affected by management actions in this paper we describe a simple monthly model of the water and salt balances in a typical polder our aim is to use the model to investigate water and salt management strategies for crop production including strategies to cope with climate change and sea level rise models that deal with water and salt balances in similar situations include saltmod oosterban 2002 which computes salt and water balances in four seasons in a year and has been applied in deltaic environments e g yao et al 2014 the daily catchment water and salt balance model of bari and smettem 2006 and the polder salt and water balance polder model of de louw et al 2011 which is directed at understanding the upward flow of water and salt in boils small zones of intense upward flow of water the model of payo et al 2017 considered the capillary rise of groundwater which could carry salt upwards into the soil and the input of salt from the surface due to irrigation and flooding they applied the model to examine the impacts of climate change on soil salinity in the coastal region of bangladesh none of the models mentioned above simulates the full suite of water and salt exchanges in a polder nor how they may be influenced by management actions the model we describe here bears some similarities with that of payo et al 2017 however our model extends the salt and water balance from the soil to the whole polder and includes the management of drainage and irrigation channels within the polder the impacts of inundation by seawater and the impact of soil water salinity on plant evapotranspiration our model thus extends the range of salt and water impacts and management strategies that can be considered as far as we know no other model has this mix of capabilities and no other model can be used to assess as wide a range of salt and water management strategies in polders in an earlier paper mainuddin et al 2019b we introduced the polder model and described the simple conceptual background and some of early calibration results here we extend that paper greatly to explicitly give the model equations and the data inputs we extend the calibration in the earlier paper to include more field data and calibration against detailed crop modelling results we add to the earlier study a monte carlo parameter sensitivity analysis which gives useful and important results on the importance of salt management in the polders and the lesser importance of providing additional water for crop growth following the description of the model we describe its calibration for three locations with differing salinities in the ganges delta fig 1 finally we examine the sensitivity of the model outputs to the key parameters 2 water and salt balances in polders processes and a simple model mainuddin et al 2014 2019b describe the physical characteristics of the coastal zone of the ganges delta it comprises a series of islands separated by the distributary channels of the ganges river many of the islands have been protected by embankments to form polders the term polder is used in bangladesh but not in west bengal in india where the embanked islands are referred to simply as islands much of the region is affected by soil and groundwater salinity rainfall generally is much higher than potential evapotranspiration during the monsoon months leading to an excess of water that is drained to the surrounding rivers through managed sluice gates these considerations together with the conceptual model of fresh and saline groundwater in the bangladesh polders of worland et al 2015 lead to the conceptual model described below 2 1 water and salt balance model the conceptual basis of the water and salt balance in a polder is shown in fig 2 the polder is conceived as a unit with an area of crops and an area of canals and ponds other areas such as houses and roads are small and are not considered in the model the area of canals and ponds may be varied to model one potential water and salt management strategy that of increasing the volume of water stored for use in irrigation increasing the area of canals and ponds leads to a corresponding decrease in the cropped area the model tracks the stores of salt and water in i the soil ii the shallow groundwater and iii the canals and ponds and the movements of salt and water between these three stores the model also tracks the movements of salt and water from these stores to the external environment of the deeper groundwater which in our model means groundwater below the freshwater lens the rivers that surround the polder and the atmosphere noting that salt does not enter the atmosphere through evaporation or transpiration the shallow groundwater will rise in the wet season and fall in the dry season it will generally have a salt concentration different to that of the deeper groundwater it is conceived as a layer or lens which sits on top of the deeper groundwater as found in the ganges delta worland et al 2015 and other environments such as small pacific islands white and falkland 2010 whereas there is some mixing between fresh groundwater lenses and the underlying groundwater white and falkland 2010 for simplicity we model the shallow transient layer as not mixing with the deeper groundwater however deeper groundwater may be accessed by capillary rise if it is shallow enough and if the shallow groundwater lens is exhausted each of the three stores of water and salt is considered to be a single store there is no differentiation of soil into several layers for example the movement of water between the stores and with the external environment is based on simple process models as described below the movement of salt is based on the movement of water and the concentration of salt in the water the model uses a monthly timestep 2 2 water and salt mass balance equations water balances are calculated for the soil water shallow groundwater and ponds and canals by mass balance equations 1 w s t d t w s t r i r r c r f et a d v d f ε ws 2 w gs t d

from the surrounding rivers to the canals and ponds and outriv is outflows from the canals and ponds to the rivers apc is the area of ponds and canals and ac is the area of crops the shallow groundwater and soil water stores are treated as one dimensional stores and the water contents are calculated as depths of water the water content in the canals and ponds is calculated as a volume so the flows between the soil and the canals are multiplied by the area the flows between the canals and ponds and the surrounding rivers are calculated as volumes each water store is limited to a maximum capacity the volume of canals the saturated soil water content and the maximum depth that can be occupied by the groundwater multiplied by the specific yield for rice crops water is assumed to be ponded on top of the soil surface and the soil is saturated the individual gains and losses are calculated by simple process models to be described below salt masses are calculated for the soil water shallow groundwater and ponds and canals by mass balance equations of the form 4 s s t d t s s t i r r c cp c r c g f c r d v c s d f c df ε ss 5 s gs t d t s gs t d v c s c r c g ε sgs 6 s cp t

further below 2 3 mass balance errors the water and salt mass balance errors are explicitly calculated and reported for the soil water and the canals and ponds in the current version the mass balance error is always small of order 10 8 or less of the size of the other terms in the mass balance equations in all timesteps for water contents and 10 6 or less of the size of the other terms for salt contents 2 4 water movement the shallow groundwater is modelled as gaining water and hence salt by vertical drainage from the overlying soil and capillary rise from the underlying deeper groundwater and losing water by capillary rise to the overlying soil vertical drainage from the overlying soil dv occurs when the soil water content ws exceeds the field capacity of the soil ws fc 7 d v m i n w s w s f c 0 the shallow groundwater loses water by capillary rise to the soil according to the unsaturated soil water flow equation salvucci 1993 eq 1 8 cr k w s ψ w s d z 1 where cr is the capillary rise z is the vertical distance between the water table and the base of the soil k ws is the water content dependent unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil and ψ ws is the water content dependent suction of the soil the shallow groundwater may also gain water and salt by capillary rise from the deeper groundwater below only in the circumstance that it is entirely depleted by capillary rise and water and salt to satisfy eq 8 is then brought up from the underlying deeper water table the deeper water table is considered to remain at constant depth and salinity the depth to the water table wt in the shallow groundwater is given by 9 wt t d t wt t d v c r s y where sy is the specific yield the depth of the water table thus calculated applies when the water table is below or equal to the base of the soil layer when the water table rises to the base of the soil further additions of water to the soil implies that the water table will rise into the soil layer the depth of the water table in the soil is then given by the depth of zero water suction implied by the ψ ws relationship used in eq 8 the evapotranspiration is modelled using a crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 in which the potential evapotranspiration eto is multiplied by a crop dependent coefficient kc to calculate the actual evapotranspiration et 10 et k c k s e t o where ks is a crop dependent stress factor that reduces crop water uptake in dry soils given by 11 k s w s w s w 1 p w s f c w s w where ws w is the wilting point of the soil p is a depletion factor and the other symbols were given above kc and ks both vary throughout the growing period of an individual crop and we simulate sequences of crops by sequences of the two coefficients eq 11 has been adapted from equation 84 in allen et al 1998 but given in terms of soil water contents rather than readily available water during fallow periods evaporation of water from the soil may be significant particularly after rain when the soil is wet the evapotranspiration is then taken to be the soil evaporation e is modelled by a simple empirical expression relating the evaporation e to the soil saturation s and the potential evapotranspiration 12 e s 2 e t o the irrigation irr given by the amount of water required to restore the soil to field capacity after accounting for capillary rise 13 irr m a x 0 m i n w p a a c w s f c w s c r the minimum function constrains the irrigation application to the volume of water available in the ponds and canals and from further inflows from the rivers surrounding the polder wp a divided by the area of crops ac to give the depth of water available for irrigation the availability of water from the river is constrained by a maximum inflow rate which models the flow capacity of the sluice gates and canal system when the crop is rice the irrigation requirement includes the water to saturate the soil and establish or maintain the pond the maximum function constrains the irrigation application to periods when the soil water store plus capillary rise is inadequate for the crop the final process that adds water to the soil is that of floods floods are defined by input data which give the month in which they occur the depth to which the polder is flooded and the salt concentration of the flooding water the field drainage removes water from the soil it is calculated as the value of df required to ensure that the water content w s t d t in eq 1 does not exceed the soil saturation plus a rice pond depth if the crop is rice field drainage adds to the canals and ponds as given in eq 3 the volume of water evaporating from canals and ponds is subtracted given by f1 eto multiplied by the area of canals and ponds where f1 is a constant factor analogous to a pan evaporation factor flood water also adds to the water in canals and ponds with the volume given by the depth of the flood multiplied by the area of canals and ponds if the result of the additions and subtractions is a volume of water greater than the volume of canals and ponds the excess is removed and is considered to have drained to the river within the month 2 5 salt movement the water flow terms are multiplied by salt concentrations to give the salt mass flow note that the rain and evapotranspiration evaporation water terms are absent since they move water but not salt in eqs 4 6 cs cgs and ccp are the salt concentrations in the soil the shallow groundwater and the canals and ponds calculated as the mass of salt in the store divided by the water content if the water content of the shallow groundwater falls to zero and yet there is still upward capillary flow based on the equation below the salt concentration of the upward flow is taken as that of the deeper saline groundwater which is assumed to be a fixed value not varying with time cr is the salt concentration of the surrounding rivers defined by input data to the model cdf is the salt concentration in the field drainage df the field drainage results from an excess of rain landing on the soil the rain itself has no salt but it may mix with the soil water to produce water at a salt concentration between that of the rain a concentration of zero and that of the soil water it will then carry some salt to the canals and ponds how much mixing occurs is not clear and we know of no data or study which gives a clear answer it seems reasonable to suppose that the degree of mixing may vary according to the antecedent conditions for example a period of soil drying may result in salt precipitation at the surface this can be observed in the field in salty polders during the dry season a sudden downpour of rain may pick up this salt and carry it away in runoff before there is time for much infiltration gentle rain on the other hand would leach the salt down into the soil before runoff occurs and the later runoff would carry very little salt away we therefore treated the degree of mixing as an adjustable parameter varying from 0 no mixing to 1 complete mixing to be fixed by calibration the concentration of salt in the runoff is therefore given by 14 c df m x c r w s where mx is the mixing coefficient we shall examine the impact of varying the mixing parameter in the later section on sensitivity analysis salt in the soil water is assumed to reduce crop water uptake at high concentrations represented as a modified stress factor ks as described in allen et al 1998 15 k s s a l t k s c s c s t 1 b s 100 k y where ks salt is the modified factor that includes the salt and water deficit stress effects cs and cs t are the salt concentration in the soil and a crop dependent threshold salt concentration below which the water use of the crop is not affected by salinity bs and ky are crop dependent parameters that govern how much the crop is affected by salinity values above the threshold salinity larger values of bs and smaller values of ky lead to a rapid reduction of crop water use as salinity increases beyond the threshold value the equation applies only when the soil salt concentration is above the threshold value cs t when the equation applies the modified stress factor ks salt is used in equation 6 in place of ks 2 6 input data the input data are of three types time series data fixed parameters describing the polder soil and cropping system and parameters which are designed to be varied to simulate scenarios time series monthly values for rainfall potential evapotranspiration river salt concentration flood inundation events specified as depth of flooding and salt concentration of the flood water but usually both are null values for a given month since floods are rare events and in any event we do not model flood scenarios for all simulations flood

water may not be used for irrigation and a decision parameter yes no that determines whether irrigation is used or not 3 model calibration for the three field experimental sites the model was calibrated using two approaches in the first the model results were compared to measurements taken in field experiments at the three experimental sites in the second the model results for the soil and plant water uptake were compared to the results of a detailed crop model apsim holzworth et al 2014 itself calibrated with the field experiments and previously tested thoroughly across a diverse range of environments and management practices in asia gaydon et al 2017 for each of the three sites the same calibration parameters were used for the two different calibration approaches mainuddin et al 2019a and bell et al 2019 described three years of field experiments at amtali in polder 43 and dacope in polder 31 in bangladesh and gosaba island in west bengal fig 1 the sites have an annual average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration respectively of about 2500 and 1200 mm 1800 and 1300 mm and 1900 and 1400 mm at each of three field sites there are many experimental plots involving different crops and management a range of crop water soil and salinity measurements were taken in the course of the experiments and at the two bangladesh sites there were also earlier series of groundwater depth measurements in addition to the field measurements the apsim crop management model has been calibrated at each site the model has a detailed daily description of crop growth processes and calibration included fitting the apsim model to measurements of plant growth characteristics that are not considered in the polder model described above simulations over longer periods using the calibrated apsim models for each site provides another test of the soil and crop water use parts of the polder model the input climate and river salinity data are those obtained from meteorological station records nearest to the sites khepupara for amtali polder 43 khulna for dacope polder 31 and canning town for gosaba island the calibration of the polder water and salt balance model used one set of parameters at each site for both the comparison with the field measurements and the comparison with the apsim model results an initial set of the soil shallow groundwater and crop parameters described in the previous section was derived for each site by fitting the polder model to the field measurements the properties were then refined by fitting the model to the apsim results finally the comparisons with the field measurements were re checked and some small adjustments made for the final calibrations however there are limitations to the calibrations the experimental plots at each site cover just a small fraction of the overall polder area and conditions differ somewhat from plot to plot the polder model on the other hand considers the polder as one large entity with just one value for each quantity such as soil salinity or groundwater depth the groundwater level measurements are for longer periods than other measurements furthermore as already noted the comparison with field data is augmented by a comparison over a longer period of a more detailed model this permits comparison of some water and salt stores and flows that were either not measured or seldom measured however the polder model simulates processes that the apsim model does not traditional hydrological goodness of fit measures of calibration are difficult to apply in such circumstances we therefore accept a visual judgement of a good model comparison with a range of measured and apsim modelled results 3 1 model calibration using field data with these limitations in mind fig 3 shows the comparison of field soil salinity groundwater depth and salinity and canal and pond salinity measurements with results from the calibrated polder water and salt balance model the results are for three years with the monsoon periods shown by the three periods of shallow groundwater levels note that the soil salinity readings were of electrical conductivity ec1 5 we have converted them to sodium chloride concentrations cs using the formula suggested by barrett lennard et al 2018 cs g l 0 64 ec1 5 ds m 5 100 w where w is the gravimetric moisture content sodium chloride is the dominant salt barrett lennard et al 2018 the modelled results generally show similar behaviour to the measured results the modelled canal and pond salt concentrations and the groundwater depths fall within the range of the measured results the dry season increase in pond canal salinity and increase in groundwater depth are seen both in the model results and measured data the modelled soil water salt concentration is generally of right order but there are too few measured results to properly test the model the field measurements of shallow groundwater salt concentration show one series at each site with salt concentrations similar to the modelled fresh lens at amtali and gosaba another series shows salt concentration varying roughly between that of the modelled freshwater lens and that of the assumed deeper groundwater layer this intermediate salt concentration may be due to mixing of fresher and saltier water either in the ground or in the piezometer which may intercept water of different salinities at different depths either form of mixing would result in the behaviour shown in fig 3 thus fig 3 is consistent with the assumed groundwater behaviour if the mixing is in the piezometer but is also consistent with mixing in the ground the results in fig 3 show broadly similar behaviour at all three sites in terms of both modelled and measured quantities the salt concentrations in ponds canals and groundwater and the way they change through the dry and wet seasons are similar at all three locations as is the fall and rise of groundwater with the dry and wet seasons all three sites have an annual rainfall total which exceeds the annual potential evapotranspiration by several hundred mm and so all three are likely to have salinity and groundwater depth behaviour strongly influenced by the availability of excess fresh water to flush salt out and replenish the groundwater in the wet season it is possible that this masks other differences which could arise from different soil characteristics or different management 3 2 model calibration using apsim results the apsim model was used to simulate 24 years of crop and soil dynamics at amtali and dacope and 2 years at gosaba at amtali and dacope the simulations were of rotation of a kharif wet season rice crop and a rabi dry season wheat crop at gosaba a single rice crop was simulated fig 4 shows the input rainfall for amtali and resulting actual evapotranspiration runoff vertical drainage from the soil combined runoff and drainage soil moisture content water table and soil salt concentration note that the rainfall series shows three dry years in 2007 2009 the actual rainfall records at amtali do not show this feature however we use this series since it causes a significant perturbation in those two years which is a more interesting test of the two models the actual evapotranspiration results are broadly similar with a similar peak in october each year the annual average actual evapotranspiration simulated by apsim is 1227 mm whereas with the polder model it is 1143 mm the polder model produces an average annual runoff of 922 mm whilst apsim results in runoff of 373 mm in apsim the groundwater is a fixed external entity to which drainage can always occur and this removes some of the excess water the polder model in contrast internally simulates a dynamic groundwater table when it is at or near the soil surface which is the case for much of the wet season there is little or no drainage and excess water is removed as runoff the sum of runoff and drainage in the two models is however similar as seen by the positive values only in the left hand figure of the third row in fig 4a the annual average of runoff plus drainage is 921 mm for apsim and 915 mm for the polder model the negative values in the left hand figure of the third row in fig 4a indicate capillary rise simulated by apsim and have an annual average of 407 mm the magnitude of capillary rise modelled by apsim is quite unlikely since it would lead to substantial falls in the groundwater table in the dry season of 4 m or more which is not seen in the field data as shown in fig 3 in the polder model this additional water is gained mostly from irrigation with an annual average of 437 mm the soil water content summed over the top metre varies in a similar fashion between the dry and wet seasons in the two models though the polder model indicates a longer period of wet soil this results from the ponded rice water table in the polder model staying at or near the surface for a longer period in the polder model as shown in the left hand figure of the fourth row of fig 4a finally the soil salt concentration simulated by the two models is similar for most years however in the dry years of 2007 2009 the polder model simulated that the supply of irrigation water would be inadequate resulting in greater use of stored soil water and shallow groundwater the drier soil resulted in greater soil salt concentrations in these years the results for dacope and gosaba show similar behaviour to that of amtali those for dacope are shown in fig 5 the polder model and apsim actual evapotranspiration runoff plus drainage and soil water content are again similar though in this case apsim shows some runoff the annual average evapotranspiration is 1453 mm for apsim and 1393 mm for the polder model the sum of drainage plus runoff is 923 and 867 mm for apsim and the polder model the capillary rise in apsim is 417 mm whereas the polder model applied irrigation is 416 mm the groundwater table simulated by the polder model is in dacope closer to the apsim result in the wet season in contrast to amtali where it is closer in the dry season the polder model results in peak soil water salt concentration a little higher than does apsim but the two models otherwise produce similar results with similar year to year variation the apsim model for gosaba simulated the behaviour over two years fig 6 the results of the two models are again broadly similar unlike the cases of amtali and dacope apsim did not simulate any runoff but the total runoff plus drainage is again similar the simulations were of a single crop rice and the annual average evapotranspiration was smaller than at amtali and dacope being 702 mm for apsim and 793 mm for the polder model the rainfall in the two years of simulation was wetter than the rainfall used in the simulations at amtali and dacope as a result the polder model simulation resulted in only 33 mm of irrigation and apsim had 194 mm of capillary rise overall then the polder model has simulated the apsim results reasonably well at three sites the main differences arise from the incorporation in the polder model of water table dynamics which results in 1 the different paths taken in the two models to remove excess water and 2 the accessing of groundwater in apsim for capillary rise to satisfy dry season water requirement whereas the polder model uses irrigation because there is insufficient groundwater for this purpose at least if the model is to simulate the field measured groundwater table dynamics reasonably well 4 model sensitivity analysis soil physical properties aquifer properties salt concentrations in the aquifer and surrounding rivers and the area of the polder in canals and ponds will all vary from polder to polder to examine the influence of the variation in parameters we performed a sensitivity analysis of the model using a monte carlo approach nine input parameters were allowed to vary over a pre defined range with random draws to give the value of each parameter for a single model run the procedure was repeated 1000 times for each of the three models for amtali dacope and gosaba details of the monte carlo method are given in the appendix the nine input parameters are soil saturated water content wsat soil ksat ksat specific yield of shallow fresh groundwater sy surface

conc threshold irrigsaltthresh and a river salinity scaling coefficient riverscalecoeff the parameters and the range over which they were varied are described in the appendix we examined the sensitivity to varying the input parameters of five output parameters the salinity of the fresh groundwater lens cgf the salinity of the soil csoil the salinity of the ponds and canals cpond the amount of irrigation water applied irrig and the amount of evapotranspiration from the cropping system eta the evapotranspiration calculated by the model is taken to be an indicator of crop production to show the sensitivity of the output to the input parameters we used an elasticity formula schaake and liu 1989 commonly used in hydrology see for example yang and yang 2011 16 ε δ o δ i i o where ε is the elasticity i is an input parameter o is an output parameter and δo δi is the slope of the relationship between the input and output parameter when ε is less than one a unit change to the input parameter has a less than proportional change to the output values of one indicate that a unit change to the input has an equal proportional change to the output values greater than one indicate that a unit change to the input a greater than proportional change to the output in other words the larger the elasticity the greater the sensitivity to an input parameter with values greater than one being particularly sensitive the elasticity is based on an assumed linear relationship between the input and output variables whereas the actual relationships are in some cases non linear as shown by fig a1 in non linear cases the actual elasticity varies with the value of the input variable and in some parts of the input variable range the elasticity may be greater than and in other parts less than the values discussed below the elasticity values relating each of the nine input parameters to each of the five output parameters are given in table 1 which also indicates whether the correlation between each pair is statistically significant the actual values differ amongst the three sites but the table shows several features which are common to all sites 1 the model results are significantly correlated to most model parameters at all three sites shown by general dominance of the grey shaded cells 2 the elasticities are all less than one in the case of the three salt concentration parameters whereas some elasticities greater than one appear in the two water flow parameters 3 the mixing coefficient which governs how effectively salt is transferred in runoff from the soil to the ponds and canals and thence discharged out of the polder is the most influential parameter as indicated by bold type in table 1 4 more generally parameters that govern the movement of salt are more influential than those that govern the availability of water the former includes the mixing coefficient the depth to saline groundwater which controls salt movement into the shallow fresh groundwater and thence into the soil and its salinity the irrigation salt concentration threshold which governs the salt concentration up to which river or pond and canal water may be used for irrigation and the river salinity scaling coefficient the least influential parameters include the soil water storage and the ponds and canals storage which is directly related to their area we shall discuss some practical implications of this finding below 5 the direction of influence of the model parameters is generally as expected for example an increase in the mixing coefficient reduces the soil salinity which in turn increases the pond salinity the destination for the salt removed from the soil and reduces the salinity of the shallow groundwater since less salt leaches down the less salty soil leads to greater evapotranspiration which in turn leads to more use of irrigation water increasing the depth to saline groundwater reduces the soil water salt concentration since less salt is transported to the soil by capillary rise increasing river salinity with increasing values of the river salinity scaling coefficient is associated with decreasing salt concentrations in the fresh groundwater lens and the ponds and canals and sometimes also in the soil water this is because saltier river water is less often used for irrigation shown by the negative elasticities at all three sites for the interaction of the river salinity scaling coefficient and the amount of irrigation and so less water and hence less salt is imported into the polder the features above suggest some practical considerations for polder management firstly salt management is critical salt import into the soil depresses crop production while salt export enhances it the mixing coefficient was introduced to deal with a deficiency in our knowledge that of how much the salt in the soil water mixes with and is exported in runoff however it can also be considered as a surrogate for field salt drainage management the provision of subsurface field drainage for example would in the polder model terms be similar to increasing the mixing coefficient with positive impacts on cropping evapotranspiration in model terms the management of salt extends beyond crop and soil management to groundwater management as shown by the influence of the depth to saline groundwater and to the whole polder as shown by the influence of the salt concentration threshold for using water for irrigation these considerations lead to the question of whether enhanced drainage should be contemplated the drainage and salt management of dutch polders schultz 2008 for example is through a more highly engineered and managed system than is practised in the ganges delta conversely these results suggest that it is less critical to provide additional water through increasing the area of ponds and canals or increasing the water storage capacity of the soil this result should be treated with caution since the polder model is a monthly model and is not a detailed crop model it is therefore not responsive to the details of timing of irrigation events some of which may be important at critical times a more detailed crop model such as apsim is a better model in this regard however the general result that a large amount of additional water is not so critical follows from the fact that at all three sites the rain exceeds the evapotranspiration and the combined water storage of the soil and shallow groundwater supplies most of the crops needs even in the dry season this finding was also made by schulthess et al 2019 who examined the cultivation of wheat and maize in the coastal zone of bangladesh and concluded that irrigation had no impact on wheat and little impact on maize being significant only in the driest winter of their trials 5 conclusions we have developed a simple time stepping model of water and salt stores and flows in an idealised polder the strength of this model is in the successful integration of a wide range of salt and water transfer and storage processes in a very dynamic environment as far as we know it is the only model which deals with the transfers of water and salt amongst the soil plant continuum the atmosphere with which water only is exchanged the groundwater idealised as a two component system with a shallower fresh lens overlying a deeper salty regional groundwater the ponds and canals which drain the polder and may also be used in reverse for irrigation and the surrounding rivers it is thus the only model known to us which can be used to assess a wide range of crop soil water and salt management strategies from the level of the crop to the level of the whole polder while the model is conceptually simple with only three stores of water and salt and idealised transfer processes amongst them and with the surrounding environment it nevertheless successfully reproduces the complex water and salt behaviour observed in albeit limited field data and in detailed crop modelling results for three sites in the ganges delta the model results demonstrate the importance of correctly simulating the water table dynamics in contrast the failure to model water table dynamics in apsim leads to unlikely results for capillary rise with consequent unlikely adjustments to other water balance terms a monte carlo sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the results are sensitive to the key model parameters in general the results are more sensitive to parameters governing the transfers of salt and less sensitive to those governing the availability of water the main consideration resulting from the understanding of the polder salt and water balance processes and the model is the importance of management including drainage to remove salt finally we note the model will be useful for investigating new water and salt management procedures and for investigating the impacts of climate change by modifying the input data to form appropriate scenarios model assessments of these factors will be reported elsewhere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

method and sampling intervals we used a mersenne twister random number generator matsumoto and nishamura 1998 which is regarded as good katzgraber 2010 though not fully random under all conditions o

implementation as an excel add in and the ability to reproduce the same pseudo random number series in the examples discussed here we used 1000 monte carlo iterations more would generally be regarded as necessary for high quality results but for model development directed at improved understanding of the processes we regard 1000 as adequate we varied nine model parameters over the intervals shown in table a1 we examined the impact of the variation of the nine parameters on five output parameters the salinity of the fresh groundwater lens the soil and the ponds and canals the amount of irrigation water applied and the amount of evapotranspiration from the cropping system the models were run over a 24 year period which is the same as the apsim calibration period from 1994 to 2017 in the case of the amtali and dacope models the gosaba model was run over the same time period some parameters did not necessarily reach a statistical steady state within 24 years and therefore still somewhat reflected the initial value this was particularly the case for the fresh groundwater lens the salt concentration of which changed very slowly in some simulations particularly when the deeper groundwater was at some depth and therefore the shallow groundwater had a large volume to remove initial value effects the average salt concentration of the shallow groundwater was used as the initial value for a second run of 24 years and the process repeated until a quasi steady state was achieved in which the salt concentration might vary from one time period to the next but the manner of the variation was itself statistically invariant there are four parameters see the section on input data which define the water content dependent unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil k ws and the water content dependent suction of the soil ψ ws and hence influence the capillary rise in equation 4 however all four parameters influence the capillary rise in the same sense as the parameter increases so too does the amount of capillary rise it was therefore sufficient here to vary ksat alone the output of the amtali sensitivity analysis is shown graphically in fig a1 for discussion see

5453,in order to optimize the operation rule curve of the shahrchay reservoir in the north west of iran under climate change a new integrated simulation optimization framework under different climate change scenarios was introduced in the current study the proposed framework contains several steps first the more accurate general circulation models gcms were chosen among several available gcms and the predictors screening based on decision tree model m5 was applied to select the most important predictors among enormous number of potential large scale climate variables of gcms then the artificial neural networks anns were trained by the observed temperature and precipitation time series and the selected dominant predictors to downscale the precipitation and temperature parameters of gcms for the base period 1951 2000 over the case area and the future monthly predictions of temperature and precipitation were implemented by the trained anns under a1b b1 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios to assess the future changes of precipitation and temperature between 2020 and 2060 thereafter the estimated precipitation values were imposed to the hybrid wavelet m5 model to simulate inflow runoff to the shahrchay reservoir and finally genetic algorithm ga was used in order to optimize the operation rule curves of the reservoir system using the predicted average monthly precipitation evaporation inflow and considering water supply for agricultural and municipal targets and minimization of total squared deficiencies for future the wavelet m5 model could result in a reliable performance in the one step ahead runoff prediction as the obtained correlation coefficient cc for training and verifying data sets were 98 and 97 7 respectively the results showed that the average long term annual runoff volume may be decreased between 0 08 and 2 27 in the future with regard to the base period and the simulation results for present and future conditions indicated a decrease in water availability also the estimated optimal rule curves for the reservoir showed a different shape for all scenarios employed in this study abbreviations gcm general circulation model m5

management dong et al 2019 the hydrological and meteorological parameters which affect the amount of water stored in a reservoir include reservoir inflow runoff precipitation temperature evaporation

change prasanchum and kangrang 2018 investigated the effect of climate change in the future using the precis model under a2 and b2 climate change scenarios soil and water assessment tool swat hydrologic model and ga optimization algorithm as one of the popular algorithms due to its random search capability and near global optimal values to optimize the reservoir operation rules they claimed that quite a large amount of studies have been done applying ga for various complex problems in addition they proved that the new rule curves can be helpful using ga connected to the simulation model and it could prevent water shortage in irrigation fields in the future therefore the ga algorithm was used for optimization purposes in this study according to the literature review several river reservoir systems have been considerably influenced by climate change and it seems that the combining the hydrological models with optimization techniques adapted to climate change in the future could lead to more precise and effective management in the reservoir system therefore in this study a new hybrid methodology as a novel strategy is proposed as a simulation optimization framework to study the shahrchay reservoir operation rule curves adapted to different climate change scenarios in future the proposed method used in this study consists of seven main steps which are completely described in a separate section section 2 the overview of the proposed method the section 3 of this paper consists of eight subsections which explain the study area m5 model statistical gcm

application to the shahrchay reservoir located in north western part of iran as 1 selecting the appropriate gcms among several gcms using the cc criterion for downscaling purpose 2 applying an

effects 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area the shahrchay dam 37 46 n 44 91 e is situated in the north west of iran in west azerbaijan province and provides the annual drinking and industrial water demands of about 70 million cubic meters mcm and annual agricultural water requirements with a maximum of 132 mcm this reservoir with volume about 220 38 mcm in the normal level of operation has been constructed with clay seal core and a trapezoidal cross section the maximum reservoir height measured from the base dam crest length the active volume and the dead volume of the reservoir are 116 m 550 m 211 35 mcm and 90 3 mcm respectively the average annual precipitation is approximately 338 mm in this region 50 year monthly average inflow agriculture and municipal water demands as well as precipitation temperature and evaporation data for the study period 1951 2000 were obtained from the regional water organization of western azerbaijan province and used in the study see table 1 fig 2 illustrates the location of the shahrchay dam and reservoir constructed on the shahrchay river about 10 km far from the urmia city the climate in this region is almost warm in summer and cold in winter the region is surrounded by mountains with a semi arid and cold climate urmia city in the north western part of iran is located at an altitude of 1330 m above the sea level and is situated along the shaharchay river lake urmia one of the largest salt lakes in the world lies to the east of the city this lake is drying up due to the persistent drought in iran in recent years which has been a major concern for water resources managers in terms of water availability in the future so one way to cope with this problem in this area could be considering the impact of climate change on the management of reservoirs like the shahrchay reservoir located in the urmia lake basin in this work the gcms data were used in order to assess the effect of climate change on the reservoir operation for the future period between 2020 and 2060 these models are considered as the most essential tools in investigating the effect of climate change in future which describe atmospheric processes by mathematical equations gcms simulate large scale climate data considering the impact of changes in greenhouse gases the outputs of gcms cannot be directly applied in local scale climate studies as they were developed in rough spatial resolutions as a result gcms outputs should be downscaled into smaller local climatic data with appropriate techniques these models make a range of possible future climate conditions employing the scenarios which discover technological and economic driving forces intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 via four representative concentration pathways rcps of greenhouse gases emissions rcp 2 6 4 5 6 and 8 5 each associated with a specific radiative forcing it should be noted that the historical and forecasting periods were considered as 1951 2000 and 2020 2060 respectively the future climate variables for the 4th assessment report ar4 model were extracted under b1 and a1b scenarios and for 5th assessment report ar5 models under medium stabilization rcp4 5 and very high rcp8 5 emission scenarios to compare the effects of diverse levels of climate change on the reservoir operation the considered gcms in the current paper are shown in table 2 among 39 gcms shown in table 2 the predictors from three gcms were chosen in the current study which one was from the ar4 of ipcc model series and two others were from the ar5 of ipcc model series they were selected based on the values of the cc criterion calculated over monthly precipitation data of gcms and predictand precipitation at the ground weather station see fig 2 table 3 indicates the potential predictors applied in the downscaling process as shown in table 3 there are several potential predictors for statistical downscaling models and selecting the most dominant predictors among all of them is essential and dependent on time and location yet accuracy of downscaling procedures depends on the relationship between the predictands precipitation and temperature and predictors at the weather station so in this work the m5 model was used for this purpose the reason for applying the m5 model as the predictor screening method in this work is that it was introduced as one of the reliable methods in selecting the dominant parameters nourani et al 2019a 3 2 m5 model the m5 model tree is one of the most practical tools of data mining presented by quinlan 1992 in this model the multi dimensional parameter space is split and the model is created considering the overall quality criterion this tree structured model splits the domain of the training data into several classes sub area and a regression equation is defined for each of them quinlan 1992 the splitting criterion for this tree structure model is based on the standard deviation of each sub area as a calculation of the error at that node and measuring the expected error as a result of testing each attribute at that node the standard deviation reduction sdr is calculated as eq 1 pal and deswal 2009 1 sdr s d t i 1 n t i t s d t i where sd is the standard deviation t and t i are the set of examples and the subset of data reaching each node respectively after examining all the possible splits the m5 model tree selects the one that could maximize the error reduction it is obvious that the upper node which is called root is the best node for classification and other variables in the lower nodes have less significance as can be seen in table 3 there are many potential predictors provided at surface and pressure levels for ar4 and ar5 reports so the selection of dominant input variables predictors or independent variables is a fundamental step to develop data driven models like ann babel et al 2016 there are several feature extraction methods for selecting the dominant parameters of gcms but among all of them the m5 model as one of the best methods in selecting the dominant parameters has been rarely applied as a feature extraction tool in combination with ann downscaling method nourani et al 2019a introduced this model as an effective model in predicting precipitation and temperature in the future so the m5 model was used in this study to determine the dominant predictors by calculating multi linear relationships between the predictors see table 3 and predictand temperature and precipitation it should also be mentioned that the weka software witten and frank 1999 was applied to create the m5 model to select the important and dominant input parameters of the ann models 3 3 statistical gcm downscaling the statistical downscaling model used in this study was developed using ann model as the most commonly used nonlinear statistical downscaling model nourani et al 2019a in order to relate the large scale predictor parameters of gcms and the point scale predictand i e temperature and precipitation for the case study the grid points of cgcm3 t47 access1 0 and miroc esm chem surrounding the study area are shown in fig 3 which were used for downscaling purpose in this study the data standardization was performed as a bias correction method before the statistical downscaling via ann to decrease systematic error in the average and variance of the gcm outputs relative to the observational data it should be mentioned that the dominant predictors of each selected gcm extracted via the m5 model in four grid points surrounding the study area and the precipitation values of the base period 1951 2000 which were of enough time series to establish a reliable climatologic modeling were used as the model inputs the three layer feed forward neural network ffnn was applied in order to downscale the gcm outputs one ffnn for each of precipitation and temperature parameters to reach the best result of the ffnn the back propagation bp algorithm and the levenberg marquardt scheme were used to train the ffnn sharghi et al 2018a the model training procedure was stopped when the error rate was increased in the verification phase it should be noted that the best structures of the ffnn model were obtained via the trial error procedure there is no specific method in finding the optimal number of hidden neurons and layers except for trial and error approach which is commonly used anh and taniguchi 2018 3 4 evaporation calculation estimating the evaporative losses are essential in reservoir management and optimization there are various methods which require enormous range of data types and different equations xu and singh 2001 according to the available data for the study area karrufa method kharrufa 1985 as a temperature based method in estimating evaporation in mm month was used according to eq 2 in order to estimate the monthly evaporation values for the future period 2020 2060 using the downscaled temperature values 2 et 0 34 p t a 1 3 where et is the kharrufa potential evaporation mm month and p and ta are the proportion of total monthly daytime hours used out of annual daytime hours of the year 12 365 and mean monthly temperature in celsius respectively table 4 gives p values for different months and latitudes the shahrchay reservoir dam is at about 45 latitudes so for estimating the average monthly evaporation through the kharrufa method for the future period 2020 2060 the predicted average monthly temperature values downscaled using ffnn for the future period 2020 2060 and different p values for different months using interpolation based on p values given in table 4 were used via eq 2 to estimate et 3 5 rainfall runoff r r modeling using wavelet m5 model the runoff as the most forcing factor should be estimated in order to evaluate the future impacts of climate change in the water resources system in the current study the runoff time series were predicted using the hybrid wavelet m5 hydrological model which is a combined wavelet transform and m5 model in recent years the wavelet m5 model has been used successfully in hydrologic predicting issues utilizing the wavelet transform and m5 model could lead to efficient results as it has both m5 model and wavelet transform advantages wavelet analysis is a helpful data pre processing tool that could easily deal with multi resolution feature of the r r process on the other hand m5 is a multi linear model which can split the non linear space of a process into several linear sub spaces and lead to simplicity superposition principle and prevention of the computation error magnification furthermore m5 could be calibrated efficiently when there are low number of training data with regard to other artificial intelligent methods recent studies showed that the wavelet m5 model could result in better outcomes in comparison to other non linear models this could be explained by the fact that the non linear nature of phenomena shows appropriate compatibility with the multi linear models which is similar to its non linear instinct and instead of using a non linear and complex model a multi linear model can simulate the study process with similar accuracy nourani et al 2019b as demonstrated in fig 4 the hybrid wavelet m5 model is comprised of three stages first the rainfall and runoff data were collected and decomposed into numerous sub time series using the wavelet transform then the decomposed data were classified into homogeneous classes to optimize the structure of the hybrid model the patterns that exist between the data were finally extracted at the final step of the wavelet m5 modeling to study the mathematical basics of the hybrid wavelet m5 model the readers are referred to nourani et al 2019b different factors such as vegetation evapotranspiration and precipitation are important in the r r process so selecting the most effective factors as inputs are very important the previous researches have indicated that the r r procedure is proved to be included both autoregressive and seasonality characteristics hence it could be declared that due to the autoregressive property the impact of these effective parameters could be considered using the prior antecedent runoff q values indirectly in modeling via hybrid wavelet m5 model the wavelet used in this work to catch seasonality of the process could decompose i t and q t into approximation sub series i t a and q t a and detailed sub series i t d i and q t d i thus the output signal q t 1 could be obtained by using trained weights and bias via the wavelet m5 model to the input sub series according to eq 3 3 q t 1 f i t a i t d 1 i t d i q t a q t d 1 q t d i it should be noted that the r r time series were decomposed at level 4 i 1 2 4 into five sub time series in which there are four detailed subseries and one approximation at the monthly time scales by daubechies 4 db4 wavelet transform as it is the most useful function for training the input time series due to the main signal formation r r signals and previous studies nourani et al 2014 sharghi et al 2018b since 2 4 16 months mode is nearly one year which is the largest period in the hydrological process level 4 in monthly modeling was used in decomposing the r r time series using the wavelet transform due to the relative relationship between runoff and rainfall it was presumed that both time series have the same seasonality level and they were decomposed by the same mother wavelet transform and level nourani et al 2019c finally the rainfall and runoff sub series decomposed by wavelet transform were fed into the m5 model in order to predict one time step ahead runoff values time step by time step 3 6 genetic algorithm ga ga is based on the process of natural selection the method mixes the idea of the survival of the fittest with genetic operators extracted from nature to make a robust search system ga describes a solution in the form of a population of candidate solutions called individuals that each has its chromosomes the evaluation begins with randomly created individuals in order to evaluate every individual the objective function in the optimization problem is used during the generation iteration the more fit individual is chosen as the parent for the next iteration using a combination of genetic operators includes selection crossover and mutation goldberg 1989 found some differences between ga algorithms and the traditional optimization models for instance ga algorithms deal with the coding of the parameter set instead of working with the parameters themselves also they don t search from a single point but from a population applying the ga algorithm in obtaining the optimum reservoir rule curves is receiving noticeable attention from water resources experts loads of studies have been done using ga for a wide range of reservoir problems to use the ga in this work the objective function was introduced in order to minimize the deficit of total released water with regard to the total water demand the future monthly runoff that flows into the dam reservoir based on the climate regime in a1b b1 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios is an essential input in ga in this work the primary searching was done with a population size of 100 roulette wheel selection function and the mutation and crossover probability of 0 02 and 0 8 respectively 3 7 rule curve optimization in the current study the objective function of the reservoir management consists of the difference between the downstream total water demand and the outflow from the reservoir regarding the continuity equation afterward the minimum value of the defined function was calculated according to the following equation rouzegari et al 2019 4 of i 1 n t 1 12 de i t ir i t de max 2 in this equation of indicates the objective function value ir it indicates the amount of water released from the reservoir during year n and month t de i t is the total water demand during year n and month t de max is the maximum monthly water required in the considered period the volume of total released water

8 evaluation criteria both testing and training performances in r r modeling were evaluated by cc and root mean square error rmse indices the cc value between two variables is defined as eq 13 it shows the ability of the model in replicating the observed data baghanam et al 2019 13 cc x x y y ì x x 2 y y 2 where x x y and y are predictand the mean values of predictand predictor and the mean values of predictor respectively rmse is defined as eq 14 which shows the error of the model 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n x y 2 here x y and n are observed simulated and the number of observations data respectively these indices are usually applied to evaluate the accuracy of different hydrological models e g babel et al 2016 4 results and discussion the hybrid simulation optimization model proposed in this study consists of seven steps since the process of downscaling the precipitation and temperature parameters for the base 1951 2000 and future 2020 2060 periods is presented in one step the results are shown and discussed in six steps as follows 4 1 appropriate gcm selection choosing the suitable gcms for the study area was done according to the cc measures calculated between monthly observed precipitation at the weather station and precipitation of gcms nodes in the base period 1951 2000 the computed values of cc are shown in table 5 in this study among 39 gcms three models i e cgcm3 t47 from cmip3 and micoc esm chem and access1 0 from cmip5 which are spotlighted in the table were selected and used based on their higher cc values with the observed values 4 2 dominant predictor selection for gcm downscaling after assigning the appropriate gcms one of the most essential stages in downscaling procedure is to choose the suitable predictors or properties from many available climate parameters in gcms zhou and guo 2013 in this way the m5 model tree was applied to select the important and dominant predictors among all the predictors about 400 predictors table 6 shows the dominant predictors obtained by the m5 feature extraction method for downscaling the precipitation and temperature values for the case study through the m5 algorithm the predictors of the four grid points that were situated in the upper nodes of the tree were chosen as the most dominant parameters in the downscaling procedure according to the high values of cc values via the pre processing m5 model for both precipitation and temperature values in three gcms shown in table 6 it is obvious that the m5 model tree resulted in good performance in selecting the most dominant predictors of the gcms as it profits from the linear methods and shows multi linear function nourani et al 2019a via evaluating the results for precipitation it could be concluded that precipitation depends on the atmosphere mass content of cloud ice which means water and ice crystals clwvi can fall due to gravity and cause rain matveev and matveev 2009 showed that more than 90 percent of precipitation occurs from clouds which consists of water drops and ice crystals the other selected parameters are downwelling shortwave flux rsds the net downward radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere rtmt upwelling longwave radiation rlus and toa outgoing longwave flux rlut the solar radiation on the earth rlut rsds rtmt rlus heats its surface hfls this air can rise ta 8 5 0 ta 5 0 0 ta 2 0 0 ta 50 and expand and get cooler also the variables from the humidity type hur 5 0 0 hur 4 0 0 hur 1 0 0 hus 4 0 0 huss are other dominant parameters that were expected to be chosen because of the obvious and important role of humidity in precipitation formation jato espino et al 2019 sea surface temperature ts was another selected parameter chapin et al 2011 proved that climate warming increases ts which raises the energy of transferred to tropical storms as an important factor in climate change and precipitation formation meridional winds in various pressure levels va 8 5 0 va 20 vas were mentioned as other important items in precipitation formation it could be due to the effect of rainy winds that cross the atlantic ocean the mediterranean sea and the black sea absorb their moisture and cause rain moreover the selection of zonal wind ua 2 0 0 might be because of the adjacency to the caspian sea and the urmia lakes as temperature and ua are the key parameters in generating humidity in sea areas as well for precipitation the linear relation of the temperature of large scale variables with the average temperature was calculated and the results are given in table 6 chapin et al 2011 claimed that the sun emits most energy as high energy shortwave radiation rsds rlut some of the incoming short radiations are reflected to space due to backscatter from earth s surface it gets warm hfls and emits most energy as low energy longwave radiation rlus also the linear relation between average temperature and the average temperature of large scale variables was high as a result temperature variables i e ta tas ts were chosen as other dominant predictors in different grid points in the m5 algorithm method also humidity variables huss and ua were selected as the dominant predictors the reason for selecting ua could be due to the multi linear relation between temperature and wind which depends on the difference of heat capacity inland and seawater it could be said that the precipitation and temperature are connected to geopotential heights zg 5 0 0 zg 2 0 0 zg 70 zg 50 and zg 30 as it has been proved in a research done by kożuchowski et al 1992 probably the dominancy of all grid points in this study was due to the impact of the moisture resources such as the caspian sea urmia lakes atlantic ocean mediterranean sea and the black sea in this area 4 3 results of gcm based precipitation and temperature downscaling after selecting the effective predictors a three layer ffnn model was applied to downscale the 50 year average monthly temperature and precipitation parameters of the weather station one ffnn for each parameter of each gcm before downscaling the data standardization was performed over the period 1951 2000 for calibrating and validating the models 75 of data from 1951 to 1988 were used for calibrating and 25 from 1989 to 2000 for the validation purposes the optimum number of hidden layer neurons were obtained by the trial and error based approach the high efficiency of the ffnn downscaling models occurred at 150 epochs and 4 hidden neurons for precipitation and 200 epochs with 5 hidden neurons for temperature the results were compared to the 50 year average monthly observed precipitation and temperature of the ground weather station for the base period as illustrated in fig 5 according to fig 5a the downscaling results in the base period showed relatively a good performance in estimating the average monthly precipitation by ffnn in cgcm3 t47 and access1 0 models monthly precipitation time series experienced a drop in winter and a rise in fall compared to the observed monthly precipitation values in contrast there is an increase in precipitation time series in winter and a decrease in the fall for the miroc esm chem model in spring while access1 0 and miroc esm chem yielded estimated average monthly precipitation higher than the observed values cgcm3 t47 led to a decrease in precipitation compared to the observed data furthermore according to fig 5b all three models showed good performances in simulating the average temperature almost in all months by cgcm3 t47 model the average monthly temperature time series experienced an increase in winter an increase in spring a decrease in summer and a decrease in fall compared to the observed monthly temperature values also there is a decrease in temperature time series in summer and a decrease in fall by access1 0 model and in winter miroc esm chem yielded estimated average monthly temperature higher than the observed values the cc and rmse values for temperature and precipitation predictions are indicated in table 7 table 7 denotes that the ffnn model with the dominant variables determined by the m5 model produced acceptable climate predictions and showed high performance according to the evaluating criteria cc and rmse for the base period and it led to better results for the temperature parameter of each selected gcm compared to the precipitation parameter despite the precipitation time series the temperature time series are deterministic smoother and periodic so it can be estimated easily and accurately dibike et al 2008 ali et al 2018 the relatively low variance for precipitation compared to temperature emphasizes the more stochastic nature of precipitation magnitude and occurrence and it is difficult to capture the characteristics of the variability of the precipitation regime in the downscaling process after downscaling the temperature and precipitation parameters of three gcms for the base period 1951 2000 via ffnn the average monthly temperature and precipitation values of the study area were projected for the future 2020 2060 under b1 and a1b scenarios for cgcm3 t47 and under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios for access1 0 and miroc esm chem after developing ffnns for downscaling procedure the inputs of the ffnn model obtained by the m5 feature extraction method were applied for the projection purpose to predict precipitation and temperature for future 2020 2060 in this process the large scale variables in the future period were chosen based on the dominant historical variables selected via the m5 model for evaluating the results the difference between the average monthly temperature and precipitation predicted values for future under different climate change scenarios and the observed data in the base period are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively results in fig 6 indicate that the average monthly precipitation fluctuates in different months in the three models and the maximum decrease and increase are about 8 62 and 12 36 mm per month respectively considering the average annual precipitation observed in the base period it could be inferred that it is likely to rise in the future period 2020 2060 between 1 56 and 3 72 in all models and scenarios the precipitation increases in winter spring and summer whereas it witnesses a decrease in winter by miroc esm chem rcp4 5 and in summer by access1 0 rcp4 5 in fall the precipitation drops are seen in all models except the cgcm3 t47 under the a1b scenario the results show that the climate changes may lead to more precipitation to this region and the access1 0 and miroc esm chem model under rcp8 5 simulate more annual precipitation these results are in accordance with the results of climate conducted by the ipcc which reported that due to the climate change in future the precipitation will decrease in the low latitude regions and below the equator and it will increase in the high latitude regions bates et al 2008 fig 7 shows the results of projecting the average monthly temperature difference the base period and the total growth in the average annual temperature over the 40 year period using three gcms under different scenarios fig 7 indicates that the average monthly temperature varies over time however the annual temperature rises between 1 5 and 6 42 among different scenarios and the access1 0 model under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 generates the highest and lowest increases in the average annual temperature respectively compared to the observed average monthly temperature in the base period the simulated temperature is increased in the three gcms at the end of all seasons except in the access model rcp4 5 and 8 5 which drops at the end of fall in r r modeling the average monthly precipitation values were projected for the future period 2020 2060 and the results of the projected average monthly temperature data were used in estimating the average monthly evaporation values for the future which is presented in the following section 4 4 evaporation estimation under gcms scenarios the average monthly evaporation values were estimated for the reservoir optimization purpose in this study the results of the calculated average monthly evaporation values using the kharrufa method for the projected period 2020 2060 compared to the average monthly evaporation for the base period 1951 2000 are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the average monthly evaporation for the future period 2020 2060 increases in march april june september and october whereas it decreases in november and december via three gcms january february may july and august will experience both increase and decrease in the average monthly evaporation under different gcms scenarios 4 5 results of r r modeling for r r modeling and forecasting the runoff value one time step ahead q t 1 via wavelet m5 model for the future period 2020 2060 and under different scenarios i t and q t were considered as the potential inputs of both mentioned models according to eq 3 in order to apply q t 1 t 1 of the second month february 1951 of the historical period 1951 2000 in r r modeling using eq 3 the rainfall it and runoff qt values of the first month of 1951 january were used to measure the performance and set generalization of the trained models 75 of data from 1951 to 1988 were used for training and 25 from 1988 to 2000 for the verifying then the monthly runoff values were simulated using three gcms under different scenarios for the future period 2020 2060 the db4 mother wavelet at level 4 was applied to decompose the r r data the generated subseries were then used as the inputs of the wavelet m5 model for the case study as the results are presented in table 8 also the linear regressions of the best results of the wavelet m5 model are illustrated in appendix 1 according to table 8 and the values of cc wavelet m5 could result in satisfying performance in 1 month ahead forecasting for the study area the observed time series and the calculated time series using wavelet m5 are presented in fig 9 according to fig 9 and the results shown in table 8 wavelet m5 could lead to acceptable results since it benefits from prevention of the computation error magnification and the ability of wavelet transform in dealing with the multi resolution feature of the r r process in the next step the precipitation data downscaled under different scenarios for the future period 2020 2060 using the trained ffnn model were implemented with the calibrated wavelet m5 r r model to simulate the runoff for future 2020 2060 to determine the input discharges to the reservoir then the obtained runoff values for the future 2020 2060 using the cgcm3 t47 access1 0 and miroc esm chem gcms under different scenarios were compared with the historical runoff values to assess the impacts of climatic change on the hydrologic response of the basin fig 10 presents the simulated average monthly streamflow into the shahrchay reservoir for the future period 2020 2060 and its change under six different scenarios in comparison to the base period 1951 2000 according to fig 10 it could be observed that under all scenarios the inflow into the shahrchay reservoir increases in winter summer and fall in contrast it significantly decreases in comparison to the base period during spring generally considering the long term annual streamflow changes shown in table 9 it can be inferred that there will be a decrease in the average annual runoff over the 2020 2060 period the minimum drop in the average annual runoff will be approximately 0 08 via access1 0 rcp4 5 although the maximum decrease will be roughly 2 3 by access1 0 rcp8 5 it seems that this estimated maximum drop in the average annual runoff is obtained by the access1 0 rcp8 5 model because the growth in the average annual precipitation and temperature are the highest about 3 72 and 6 42 respectively see table 9 in this model compared to the others moreover according to table 9 the increase in the average annual temperature is approximately twice that of the precipitation in the access1 0 rcp8 5 model although the rise in temperature could increase the snow melting and lead to an increase in runoff volume it is not likely to happen in this case study and a higher increase in temperature than in precipitation will lead to a drop in runoff volume because it could increase the rate of evaporation and evapotranspiration due to land use changing overall in all scenarios for the study area the monthly streamflow changes will be much larger than the average annual streamflow changes so the reservoir planner needs to consider the monthly runoff variability for the reservoir operation for the future period consequently climate change will have a clear effect on future runoff and the reservoir operation as well 4 6 results of reservoir optimization under climate change scenarios at the last step the shahrchay reservoir rule curve was optimized using the ga optimization algorithm considering the simulated reservoir average monthly inflow corresponding to the future climate change scenarios for 2020 to 2060 the average monthly inflow evaporation precipitation and downstream water demands were imported to ga in order to optimize the shahrchay reservoir operation the optimal rule curve was obtained to minimize the total deficit according to the objective function see eq 4 over the future period in this case in order to optimize the reservoir operation rule curve for each month of the projection period 2020 to 2060 the one month step back data namely the average monthly agricultural and municipal demands gcms precipitation and temperature values downscaled via ffnn and runoff values obtained using wavelet m5 under different scenarios in this study should be used according to the continuity equation eq 5 fig 11 and table 10 illustrate the results of estimating the optimal operation rule curve using the ga algorithm for three gcms for the future and base period in comparison to the total demands as shown by fig 10 the average monthly inflow to the reservoir increases in winter january march for cgcm3 t47 considering fig 11a it makes sense that the average monthly stored water in the reservoir experiences a slight increase in comparison with the base period in spring april jun due to a sharp drop in the average monthly inflow compared to the base period the dam planner should manage to release the required water from stored water in the previous season so the amount of stored water in the reservoir becomes roughly equal to the stored water in the base period in the mid spring although according to fig 10 there are some increases in the average monthly inflow in summer and fall in the future the average monthly stored water tends to be less than in the base period from may to december see fig 11a it could be due to the significant decrease in the inflow rate at the end of spring moreover considering table 10 in cgcm3 t47 there are water shortages of 882 62 mcm and 879 59 mcm in the future respectively under a1b and b1 scenarios which are lower than the water shortage in the base period 908 1 mcm so it can be concluded that the ga algorithm in cgcm3 t47 allocated much more water to meet the agricultural and municipal needs for the future it is clear that the inflow to the reservoir in access1 0 is increased a bit less than that of cgcm3 t47 at the end of winter see fig 10 also by access1 0 the reduction of the reservoir future inflow compared to the base period at the end of spring and the amount of water shortages shown in table 10 are respectively higher and lower than those obtained by cgcm3 t47 it means the ga algorithm allocates more water to be released in the access1 0 model and consequently less water is stored in the reservoir as it can be seen in fig 10b for the miroc esm chem rcp8 5 model the decrease in the future inflow in comparison to the base period from january to may is less than that in the other models also the estimated amount of water deficit calculated by the ga algorithm for the miroc esm chem rcp8 5 model 879 21 mcm shown in table 10 is less than that for the base period and as a result more water is released see fig 11c considering fig 11c the volume of water released from the reservoir and the total decrease in the streamflow for miroc esm chem shown in table 10 are roughly equal to those for cgcm t47 under the b1 scenario and it may be the reason for the similarity in the storage month diagram in both mentioned models according to the obtained results by miroc esm chem rcp4 5 illustrated in table 10 which show a high water shortage in the future 1037 4 mcm it can be concluded that the amount of water allocated to the agricultural and municipal sections is significantly less and most of the water is stored in the reservoir according to the optimum rule curves shown in fig 11 the optimum storage should be maintained in the reservoir in each month for the future around a year for all scenarios the water level is maintained high in spring at 88 93 mcm in april and 133 9 mcm in jun and summer at 127 6mcm in july and 101 64 mcm in september to maximize the water head of the reservoir in order to meet the downstream high agricultural and municipal demands fall and winter require a lower water release from the reservoir about 76 07 mcm in january 81 96 mcm in march 85 10 mcm in october and 73 10 mcm in december to limit exceeding the maximum exploitation levels considering fig 11 the maximum storage obtained by ga is lower than the maximum reservoir capacity in all seasons for all scenarios therefore there will be no water spilled from the reservoir at any time for the future comparison of the results shown in fig 11 shows that in most months the optimum amount of released water is nearer to total water demand and it indicates that the optimization model for the shahrchay reservoir is robust and flexible in meeting the demands as a result the optimal target storage curves obtained in this study can be informative and valuable for decision makers in operating the shahrchay reservoir the outstanding effects of the new rule curves obtained by ga connected to the simulation model in this study is to enable the reservoir to be more effective by preventing the release of a greater water volume when the demand increases in the downstream areas and the risk of water shortages during the drought seasons that are likely to happen in the future as it can be seen in fig 11 the minimum water level is kept in the reservoir in all scenarios in order to reduce the risk of water shortages during the dry season in the next years fig 12 shows the average monthly released water deficit i e the average monthly water demand minus the average monthly released water obtained by the ga model under different scenarios for the future 2020 2060 from figs 10 12 it can be found that for all scenarios employed in this study except for miroc esm chem under rcp4 5 see fig 12c although less amount of inflow enters into the reservoir between 2020 and 2060 compared to the base period due to the impact of climate change the water deficit obtained for the future period is lower than that of the base period and the new simulation optimization model used in this study could result in a lower amount of water deficit see fig 12 and a higher amount of released water see fig 11 for the future compared to the base period this shows that if the reservoir is properly operated then the irrigation and other demands deficit could be decreased the results revealed that the optimization models are successful tools according to the objective function values in table 10 to provide more water for irrigation and municipal purposes than historical record due to climate change scenarios the ga optimal rule curves obtained for all scenarios used in this study have different forms and shapes see fig 11 it indicates that the reservoir is more sensitive to the future climate scenarios which could be due to the size of the shahrchay reservoir eum and simonovic 2010 showed that the small or medium size reservoirs are more sensitive to future climate change consequently the change of the rule curves for small or medium size reservoirs is necessary to be considered to adapt for future climate change finally when decision makers need to alter the reservoir operation policy to an optimization objective function in the future for example to prevent flooding or for a severe hydrological regime etc the improved simulation optimization methodology proposed in this study can be applied to develop the optimum reservoir rule curve 5 conclusions in this study in order to optimize the shahrchay reservoir operation rules under climate change three gcms cgcm t47 access1 0 and miroc esm chem under a1b b1 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were used to project the lowest and highest annual changes in temperature and precipitation the six future climate gcms scenarios for the 2020 2060 period were generated by the ffnn models in all scenarios a rise in temperature was observed and the access1 0 under the rcp8 5 scenario calculated the most serious and severe drought conditions precipitation predictions showed that precipitation would increase compared to the base period 1951 2000 especially in access1 0 under the rcp8 5 scenario the average monthly evaporation values for the future period 2020 2060 were obtained using a temperature based method kharrufa for reservoir optimization purpose in this study the results showed that the average monthly evaporation would increase in most months for the future period 2020 2060 compared to the base period 1951 2000 next the projected precipitation data imposed to the wavelet m5 model to obtain runoff in the basin for the future period through the r r modeling it was found that there will be a limited outflow in april to jun compared to the base period and it will be difficult to keep the current water level regulation in the future if it is necessary to release water from april to june in the future dam inflow from january to march should be reduced and stored in the reservoir in total the runoff in this region is supposed to be decreased over the 2020 2060 period in comparison with the base period as the result of an increase in temperature higher than in precipitation that could lead to a decrease in runoff due to the increase in the rate of evaporation and evapotranspiration land use changing the ga optimization model developed the optimal rule curves for the reservoir with specific aims including agricultural and municipal water supply in both base and future periods the estimated optimal rule curves for the shahrchay reservoir showed different shapes for all scenarios employed in this study it means that the reservoir is more sensitive to the future climate scenarios that might be due to the size of the shahrchay reservoir it could be concluded that the water released from the reservoir is increased in drought conditions in order to address water shortage downstream these results show that the framework developed in this work provides water resources management and planning as a methodology for evaluating and optimizing present systems and emphasizes the need to consider projected climate change as an assessment tool for reservoir management in the future for future work it is also recommended to apply another metaheuristic algorithms such as whale optimization algorithm woa and artificial bee colony abc to compare thier results with those obtained by ga use an optimization technique to determine the number of hidden layers and consider the impacts of the power plant land uses and water demands changes from the reservoir due to future climate change credit authorship

5453,in order to optimize the operation rule curve of the shahrchay reservoir in the north west of iran under climate change a new integrated simulation optimization framework under different climate change scenarios was introduced in the current study the proposed framework contains several steps first the more accurate general circulation models gcms were chosen among several available gcms and the predictors screening based on decision tree model m5 was applied to select the most important predictors among enormous number of potential large scale climate variables of gcms then the artificial neural networks anns were trained by the observed temperature and precipitation time series and the selected dominant predictors to downscale the precipitation and temperature parameters of gcms for the base period 1951 2000 over the case area and the future monthly predictions of temperature and precipitation were implemented by the trained anns under a1b b1 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios to assess the future changes of precipitation and temperature between 2020 and 2060 thereafter the estimated precipitation values were imposed to the hybrid wavelet m5 model to simulate inflow runoff to the shahrchay reservoir and finally genetic algorithm ga was used in order to optimize the operation rule curves of the reservoir system using the predicted average monthly precipitation evaporation inflow and considering water supply for agricultural and municipal targets and minimization of total squared deficiencies for future the wavelet m5 model could result in a reliable performance in the one step ahead runoff prediction as the obtained correlation coefficient cc for training and verifying data sets were 98 and 97 7 respectively the results showed that the average long term annual runoff volume may be decreased between 0 08 and 2 27 in the future with regard to the base period and the simulation results for present and future conditions indicated a decrease in water availability also the estimated optimal rule curves for the reservoir showed a different shape for all scenarios employed in this study abbreviations gcm general circulation model m5

the world s most efficient structure for integrated water resource management the main and primary duty of a water reservoir is to meet the basic needs of water and then to store the leftover water during the wet season to keep the downstream areas from flooding eum and simonovic 2010 chen et al 2016 it is obvious that reservoirs are essential to meet society s energy and water demands wu and chen 2013 zhou and guo 2013 recently several operational techniques have been developed and applied for the optimal operation of the reservoirs among these techniques some may be pointed such as ga and stochastic dynamic programming sdp jothiprakash et al 2011 biogeography based optimization bbo haddad et al 2015 gravitational search algorithm gsa and artificial bee colony abc ahmad et al 2016

inflows to the reservoirs and are infrequently determined using future flows under climate change scenarios the literature review shows some reports regarding the impacts of runoff uncertainty on the performance of the reservoir systems ahmadi et al 2015 shi et al 2018 jiang et al 2018a b haro monteagudo et al 2020 the previous studies emphasized that climate change may have a non negligible effect on water resources systems which could lead to some changes in the hydrologic cycle and water availability ipcc 2007 ciria et al 2019 it is obvious that due to the nature of geographic region which is dependent on good management of the water storage reservoirs investigation regarding the possible climate change effects on the reservoir performance is necessary for reliable water resource management dong et al 2019 the hydrological and meteorological parameters which affect the amount of water stored in a reservoir include reservoir inflow runoff precipitation temperature evaporation and the volume of water released to meet the needs among the mentioned parameters the runoff flowing into the reservoir is of paramount importance in which the other parameters precipitation temperature and evaporation can implicitly alter inflow amount to the reservoir haddad et al 2014 in other words variations in precipitation and temperature characteristics such as intensity and duration can affect river flows ahmadi et al 2015 evaporation is another important parameter which affects the amount of water stored in a reservoir there are several techniques for evaporation estimation these methods have been classified into five groups mass transfer water budget radiation combination and temperature based and most of them require a variety range of data xu and singh 2001 evaluated some temperature based methods i e blaney criddle linacre thornthwaite hamon hargreaves romanenko and kharrufa methods and mentioned that the temperature based methods are still widely used as simple and appropriate equations investigation of river inflow precipitation and evaporation changes in the future via different climate change scenarios could assist decision makers to properly estimate the amount of water stored in a reservoir in the future tackle the problems such as evaporation flash floods drought to provide robust operation rules with this regard zhou and guo 2013 estimated the environmental demands in optimizing the reservoir operation rules using an integrated adaptive optimization model iaom under climate change their finding showed the high possibility of decreasing the negative impact of dam on river system under climate change scenarios ahmadi et al 2015 applied the hadley centre coupled model hadcm3 using a2 climate scenario to estimate precipitation and temperature in the future an identification of unit hydrographs and component flows from rainfall evaporation and streamflow data ihacres model to simulate the inflow runoff into a reservoir and an non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii model to optimize the operation rules of the reservoir they concluded that climatic changes have essential impacts on reservoir

hydrologic model and ga optimization algorithm as one of the popular algorithms due to its random search capability and near global optimal values to optimize the reservoir operation rules they claimed that quite a large amount of studies have been done applying ga for various complex problems in addition they proved that the new rule curves can be helpful using ga connected to the simulation model and it could prevent water shortage in irrigation fields in the future therefore the ga algorithm was used for optimization purposes in this study according to the literature review several river reservoir systems have been considerably influenced by climate change and it seems that the combining the hydrological models with optimization techniques adapted to climate change in the future could lead to more precise and effective management in the reservoir system therefore in this study a new hybrid methodology as a novel strategy is proposed as a simulation optimization framework to study the shahrchay reservoir operation rule curves adapted to different climate change scenarios in future the proposed method used in this study consists of seven main steps which are completely described in a separate section section 2 the overview of the proposed method the section 3 of this paper consists of eight subsections which explain the study area m5 model statistical gcm downscaling evaporating calculation rainfall runoff r r modeling using wavelet m5 model ga algorithm optimization process and evaluating criteria respectively then the results are discussed in section 4 before reaching a conclusion in section 5 2 the overview of the proposed method the proposed method used in this study consists of seven main modules see fig 1 which is illustrated with an application to the shahrchay reservoir located in north western part of iran as 1 selecting the appropriate gcms among several gcms using the cc criterion for downscaling purpose 2 applying an effective screen model i e m5 to recognize the most dominant predictors from the selected gcms 3 training the anns using observed precipitation and temperature time series and the selected dominant

effects 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area the shahrchay dam 37 46 n 44 91 e is situated in the north west of iran in west azerbaijan province and provides the annual drinking and industrial water demands of about 70 million cubic meters mcm and annual agricultural water requirements with a maximum of 132 mcm this reservoir with volume about 220 38 mcm in the normal level of operation has been constructed with clay seal core and a trapezoidal cross section the maximum reservoir height measured from the base dam crest length the active volume and the dead volume of the reservoir are 116 m 550 m 211 35 mcm and 90 3 mcm respectively the average annual precipitation is approximately 338 mm in this region 50 year monthly average inflow agriculture and municipal water demands as well as precipitation temperature and evaporation data for the study period 1951 2000 were obtained from the regional water organization of western azerbaijan province and used in the study see table 1 fig 2 illustrates the location of the shahrchay dam and reservoir constructed on the shahrchay river about 10 km far from the urmia city the climate in this region is almost warm in summer and cold in winter the region is surrounded by mountains with a semi arid and cold climate urmia city in the north western part of iran is located at an altitude of 1330 m above the sea level and is situated along the shaharchay river lake urmia one of the largest salt lakes in the world lies to the east of the city this lake is drying up due to the persistent drought in iran in recent years which has been a major concern for water resources managers in terms of water availability in the future so one way to cope with this problem in this area could be considering the impact of climate change on the management of reservoirs like the shahrchay reservoir located in the urmia lake basin in this work the gcms data were used in order to assess the effect of climate change on the reservoir operation for the future period between 2020 and 2060 these models are considered as the most essential tools in investigating the effect of climate change in future which describe atmospheric processes by mathematical equations gcms simulate large scale climate data considering the impact of changes in greenhouse gases the outputs of gcms cannot be directly applied in local scale climate studies as they were developed in rough spatial resolutions as a result gcms outputs should be downscaled into smaller local climatic data with appropriate techniques these models make a range of possible future climate conditions employing the scenarios which discover technological and economic driving forces intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 via four representative concentration pathways rcps of greenhouse gases emissions rcp 2 6 4 5 6 and 8 5 each associated with a specific radiative forcing it should be noted that the historical and forecasting periods were considered as 1951 2000 and 2020 2060 respectively the future climate variables for the 4th assessment report ar4 model were extracted under b1 and a1b scenarios and for 5th assessment report ar5 models under medium stabilization rcp4 5 and very high rcp8 5 emission scenarios to compare the effects of diverse levels of climate change on the reservoir operation the considered gcms in the current paper are shown in table 2 among 39 gcms shown in table 2 the predictors from three gcms were chosen in the current study which one was from the ar4 of ipcc model series and two others were from the ar5 of ipcc model series they were selected based on the values of the cc criterion calculated over monthly precipitation data of gcms and predictand precipitation at the ground weather station see fig 2 table 3 indicates the potential predictors applied in the downscaling process as shown in table 3 there are several potential predictors for statistical downscaling models and selecting the most dominant predictors among all of them is essential and dependent on time and location yet accuracy of downscaling procedures depends on the relationship between the predictands precipitation and temperature and predictors at the weather station so in this work the m5 model was used for this purpose the reason for applying the m5 model as the predictor screening method in this work is that it was introduced as one of the reliable methods in selecting the dominant parameters nourani et al 2019a 3 2 m5 model the m5 model tree is one of the most practical tools of data mining presented by quinlan 1992 in this model the multi dimensional parameter space is split and the model is created considering the overall quality criterion this tree structured model splits the domain of the training data into several classes sub area and a regression equation is defined for each of them quinlan 1992 the splitting criterion for this tree structure model is based on the standard deviation of each sub area as a calculation of the error at that node and measuring the expected error as a result of testing each attribute at that node the standard deviation reduction sdr is calculated as eq 1 pal and deswal 2009 1 sdr s d t i 1 n t i t s d t i where sd is the standard deviation t and t i are the set of examples and the subset of data reaching each node respectively after examining all the possible splits the m5 model tree selects the one that could maximize the error reduction it is obvious that the upper node which is called root is the best node for classification and other variables in the lower nodes have less significance as can be seen in table 3 there are many potential predictors provided at surface and pressure levels for ar4 and ar5 reports so the selection of dominant input variables predictors or independent variables is a fundamental step to develop data driven models like ann babel et al 2016 there are several feature extraction methods for selecting the dominant parameters of gcms but among all of them the m5 model as one of the best methods in selecting the dominant parameters has been rarely applied as a feature extraction tool in combination with ann downscaling method nourani et al 2019a introduced this model as an effective model in predicting precipitation and temperature in the future so the m5 model was used in this study to determine the dominant predictors by calculating multi linear relationships between the predictors see table 3 and predictand temperature and precipitation it should also be mentioned that the weka software witten and frank 1999 was applied to create the m5 model to select the important and dominant input parameters of the ann models 3 3 statistical gcm downscaling the statistical downscaling model used in this study was developed using ann model as the most commonly used nonlinear statistical downscaling model nourani et al 2019a in order to relate the large scale predictor parameters of gcms and the point scale predictand i e temperature and precipitation for the case study the grid points of cgcm3 t47 access1 0 and miroc esm chem surrounding the study area are shown in fig 3 which were used for downscaling purpose in this study the data standardization was performed as a bias correction method before the statistical downscaling via ann to decrease systematic error in the average and variance of the gcm outputs relative to the observational data it should be mentioned that the dominant predictors of each selected gcm extracted via the m5 model in four grid points surrounding the study area and the precipitation values of the base period 1951 2000 which were of enough time series to establish a reliable climatologic modeling were used as the model inputs the three layer feed forward neural network ffnn was applied in order to downscale the gcm outputs one ffnn for each of precipitation and temperature parameters to reach the best result of the ffnn the back propagation bp algorithm and the levenberg marquardt scheme were used to train the ffnn sharghi et al 2018a the model training procedure was stopped when the error rate was increased in the verification phase it should be noted that the best structures of the ffnn model were obtained via the trial error procedure there is no specific method in finding the optimal number of hidden neurons and layers except for trial and error approach which is commonly used anh and taniguchi 2018 3 4 evaporation calculation estimating the evaporative losses are essential in reservoir management and optimization there are various methods which require enormous range of data types and different equations xu and singh 2001 according to the available data for the study area karrufa method kharrufa 1985 as a temperature based method in estimating evaporation in mm month was used according to eq 2 in order to estimate the monthly evaporation values for the future period 2020 2060 using the downscaled temperature values 2 et 0 34 p t a 1 3 where et is the kharrufa potential evaporation mm month and p and ta are the proportion of total monthly daytime hours used out of annual daytime hours of the year 12 365 and mean monthly temperature in celsius respectively table 4 gives p values for different months and latitudes the shahrchay reservoir dam is at about 45 latitudes so for estimating the average monthly evaporation through the kharrufa method for the future period 2020 2060 the predicted average monthly temperature values downscaled using ffnn for the future period 2020 2060 and different p values for different months using interpolation based on p values given in table 4 were used via eq 2 to estimate et 3 5 rainfall runoff r r modeling using wavelet m5 model the runoff as the most forcing factor should be estimated in order to evaluate the future impacts of climate change in the water resources system in the current study the runoff time series were predicted using the hybrid wavelet m5 hydrological model which is a combined wavelet transform and m5 model in recent years the wavelet m5 model has been used successfully in hydrologic predicting issues utilizing the wavelet transform and m5 model could lead to efficient results as it has both m5 model and wavelet transform advantages wavelet analysis is a helpful data pre processing tool that could easily deal with multi resolution feature of the r r process on the other hand m5 is a multi linear model which can split the non linear space of a process into several linear sub spaces and lead to simplicity superposition principle and prevention of the computation error magnification furthermore m5 could be calibrated efficiently when there are low number of training data with regard to other artificial intelligent methods recent studies showed that the wavelet m5 model could result in better outcomes in comparison to other non linear models this could be explained by the fact that the non linear nature of phenomena shows appropriate compatibility with the multi linear models which is similar to its non linear instinct and instead of using a non linear and complex model a multi linear model can simulate the study process with similar accuracy nourani et al 2019b as demonstrated in fig 4 the hybrid wavelet m5 model is comprised of three stages first the rainfall and runoff data were collected and decomposed into numerous sub time series using the wavelet transform then the decomposed data were classified into homogeneous classes to optimize the structure of the hybrid model the patterns that exist between the data were finally extracted at the final step of the wavelet m5 modeling to study the mathematical basics of the hybrid wavelet m5 model the readers are referred to nourani et al 2019b different factors such as vegetation evapotranspiration and precipitation are important in the r r process so selecting the most effective factors as inputs are very important the previous researches have indicated that the r r procedure is proved to be included both autoregressive and seasonality characteristics hence it could be declared that due to the autoregressive property the impact of these effective parameters could be considered using the prior antecedent runoff q values indirectly in modeling via hybrid wavelet m5 model the wavelet used in this work to catch seasonality of the process could decompose i t and q t into approximation sub series i t a and q t a and detailed sub series i t d i and q t d i thus the output signal q t 1 could be obtained by using trained weights and bias via the wavelet m5 model to the input sub series according to eq 3 3 q t 1 f i t a i t d 1 i t d i q t a q t d 1 q t d i it should be noted that the r r time series were decomposed at level 4 i 1 2 4 into five sub time series in which there are four detailed subseries and one approximation at the monthly time scales by daubechies 4 db4 wavelet transform as it is the most useful function for training the input time series due to the main signal formation r r signals and previous studies nourani et al 2014 sharghi et al 2018b since 2 4 16 months mode is nearly one year which is the largest period in the hydrological process level 4 in monthly modeling was used in decomposing the r r time series using the wavelet transform due to the relative relationship between runoff and rainfall it was presumed that both time series have the same seasonality level and they were decomposed by the same mother wavelet transform and level nourani et al 2019c finally the rainfall and runoff sub series decomposed by wavelet transform were fed into the m5 model in order to predict one time step ahead runoff values time step by time step 3 6 genetic algorithm ga ga is based on the process of natural selection the method mixes the idea of the survival of the fittest with genetic operators extracted from nature to make a robust search system ga describes a solution in the form of a population of candidate solutions called individuals that each has its chromosomes the evaluation begins with randomly created individuals in order to evaluate every individual the objective function in the optimization problem is used during the generation iteration the more fit individual is chosen as the parent for the next iteration using a combination of genetic operators includes selection crossover and mutation goldberg 1989 found some differences between ga algorithms and the traditional optimization models for instance ga algorithms deal with the coding of the parameter set instead of working with the parameters themselves also they don t search from a single point but from a population applying the ga algorithm in obtaining the optimum reservoir rule curves is receiving noticeable attention from water resources experts loads of studies have been done using ga for a wide range of reservoir problems to use the ga in this work the objective function was introduced in order to minimize the deficit of total released water with regard to the total water demand the future monthly runoff that flows into the dam reservoir based on the climate regime in a1b b1 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios is an essential input in ga in this work the primary searching was done with a population size of 100 roulette wheel selection function and the mutation and crossover probability of 0 02 and 0 8 respectively 3 7 rule curve optimization in the current study the objective function of the reservoir management consists of the difference between the downstream total water demand and the outflow from the reservoir regarding the continuity equation afterward the minimum value of the defined function was calculated according to the following equation rouzegari et al 2019 4 of i 1 n t 1 12 de i t ir i t de max 2 in this equation of indicates the objective function value ir it indicates the amount of water released from the

8 evaluation criteria both testing and training performances in r r modeling were evaluated by cc and root mean square error rmse indices the cc value between two variables is defined as eq 13 it

respectively these indices are usually applied to evaluate the accuracy of different hydrological models e g babel et al 2016 4 results and discussion the hybrid simulation optimization model proposed in this study consists of seven steps since the process of downscaling the precipitation and temperature parameters for the base 1951 2000 and future 2020 2060 periods is presented in one step the results are shown and discussed in six steps as follows 4 1 appropriate gcm selection choosing the suitable gcms for the study area was done according to the cc measures calculated between monthly observed precipitation at the weather station and precipitation of gcms nodes in the base period 1951 2000 the computed values of cc are shown in table 5 in this study among 39 gcms three models i e cgcm3 t47 from cmip3 and micoc esm chem and access1 0 from cmip5 which are spotlighted in the table were selected and used based on their higher cc values with the observed values 4 2 dominant predictor selection for gcm downscaling after assigning the appropriate gcms one of the most essential stages in downscaling procedure is to choose the suitable predictors or properties from many available climate parameters in gcms zhou and guo 2013 in this way the m5 model tree was applied to select the important and dominant predictors among all the predictors about 400 predictors table 6 shows the dominant predictors obtained by the m5 feature extraction method for downscaling the precipitation and temperature values for the case study through the m5 algorithm the predictors of the four grid points that were situated in the upper nodes of the tree were chosen as the most dominant parameters in the downscaling procedure according to the high values of cc values via the pre processing m5 model for both precipitation and temperature values in three gcms shown in table 6 it is obvious that the m5 model tree resulted in good performance in selecting the most dominant predictors of the gcms as it profits from the linear methods and shows multi linear function nourani et al 2019a via evaluating the results for precipitation it could be concluded that precipitation depends on the atmosphere mass content of cloud ice which means water and ice crystals clwvi can fall due to gravity and cause rain matveev and matveev 2009 showed that more than 90 percent of precipitation occurs from clouds which consists of water drops and ice crystals the other selected parameters are downwelling shortwave flux rsds the net downward radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere rtmt upwelling longwave radiation rlus and toa outgoing longwave flux rlut the solar radiation on the earth rlut rsds rtmt rlus heats its surface hfls this air can rise ta 8 5 0 ta 5 0 0 ta 2 0 0 ta 50 and expand and get cooler also the variables from the humidity type hur 5 0 0 hur 4 0 0 hur 1 0 0 hus 4 0 0 huss are other dominant parameters that were expected to be chosen because of the obvious and important role of humidity in precipitation formation jato espino et al 2019 sea surface temperature ts was another selected parameter chapin et al 2011 proved that climate warming increases ts which raises the energy of transferred to tropical storms as an important factor in climate change and precipitation formation meridional winds in various pressure levels va 8 5 0 va 20 vas were mentioned as other important items in precipitation formation it could be due to the effect of rainy winds that cross the atlantic ocean the mediterranean sea and the black sea absorb their moisture and cause rain moreover the selection of zonal wind ua 2 0 0 might be because of the adjacency to the caspian sea and the urmia lakes as temperature and ua are the key parameters in generating humidity in sea areas as well for precipitation the linear relation of the temperature of large scale variables with the average temperature was calculated and the results are given in table 6 chapin et al 2011 claimed that the sun emits most energy as high energy shortwave radiation rsds rlut some of the incoming short radiations are reflected to space due to backscatter from earth s surface it gets warm hfls and emits most energy as low energy longwave radiation rlus also the linear relation between average temperature and the average temperature of large scale variables was high as a result temperature variables i e ta tas ts were chosen as other dominant predictors in different grid points in the m5 algorithm method also humidity variables huss and ua were selected as the dominant predictors the reason for selecting ua could be due to the multi linear relation between temperature and wind which depends on the difference of heat capacity inland and seawater it could be said that the precipitation and temperature are connected to geopotential heights zg 5 0 0 zg 2 0 0 zg 70 zg 50 and zg 30 as it has been proved in a research done by kożuchowski et al 1992 probably the dominancy of all grid points in this study was due to the impact of the moisture resources such as the caspian sea urmia lakes atlantic ocean mediterranean sea and the black sea in this area 4 3 results of gcm based precipitation and temperature downscaling after selecting the effective predictors a three layer ffnn model was applied to downscale the 50 year average monthly temperature and precipitation parameters of the weather station one ffnn for each parameter of each gcm before downscaling the data standardization was performed over the period 1951 2000 for calibrating and validating the models 75 of data from 1951 to 1988 were used for calibrating and 25 from 1989 to 2000 for the validation purposes the optimum number of hidden layer neurons were obtained by the trial and error based approach the high efficiency of the ffnn downscaling models occurred at 150 epochs and 4 hidden neurons for precipitation and 200 epochs with 5 hidden neurons for temperature the results were compared to the 50 year average monthly observed precipitation and temperature of the ground weather station for the base period as illustrated in fig 5 according to fig 5a the downscaling results in the base period showed relatively a good performance in estimating the average monthly precipitation by ffnn in cgcm3 t47 and access1 0 models monthly precipitation time series experienced a drop in winter and a rise in fall compared to the observed monthly precipitation values in contrast there is an increase in precipitation time series in winter and a decrease in the fall for the miroc esm chem model in spring while access1 0 and miroc esm chem yielded estimated average monthly precipitation higher than the observed values cgcm3 t47 led to a decrease in precipitation compared to the observed data furthermore according to fig 5b all three models showed good performances in simulating the average temperature almost in all months by cgcm3 t47 model the average monthly temperature time series experienced an increase in winter an increase in spring a decrease in summer and a decrease in fall compared to the observed monthly temperature values also there is a decrease in temperature time series in summer and a decrease in fall by access1 0 model and in winter miroc esm chem yielded estimated average monthly temperature higher than the observed values the cc and rmse values for temperature and precipitation predictions are indicated in table 7 table 7 denotes that the ffnn model with the dominant variables determined by the m5 model produced acceptable climate predictions and showed high performance according to the evaluating criteria cc and rmse for the base period and it led to better results for the temperature parameter of each selected gcm compared to the precipitation parameter despite the precipitation time series the temperature time series are deterministic smoother and periodic so it can be estimated easily and accurately dibike et al 2008 ali et al 2018 the relatively low variance for precipitation compared to temperature emphasizes the more stochastic nature of precipitation magnitude and occurrence and it is difficult to capture the characteristics of the variability of the precipitation regime in the downscaling process after downscaling the temperature and precipitation parameters of three gcms for the base period 1951 2000 via ffnn the average monthly temperature and precipitation values of the study area were projected for the future 2020 2060 under b1 and a1b scenarios for cgcm3 t47 and under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios for access1 0 and miroc esm chem after developing ffnns for downscaling procedure the inputs of the ffnn model obtained by the m5 feature extraction method were applied for the projection purpose to predict precipitation and temperature for future 2020 2060 in this process the large scale variables in the future period were chosen based on the dominant historical variables selected via the m5 model for evaluating the results the difference between the average monthly temperature and precipitation predicted values for future under different climate change scenarios and the observed data in the base period are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively results in fig 6 indicate that the average monthly precipitation fluctuates in different months in the three models and the maximum decrease and increase are about 8 62 and 12 36 mm per month respectively considering the average annual precipitation observed in the base period it could be inferred that it is likely to rise in the future period 2020 2060 between 1 56 and 3 72 in all models and scenarios the precipitation increases in winter spring and summer whereas it witnesses a decrease in winter by miroc esm chem rcp4 5 and in summer by access1 0 rcp4 5 in fall the precipitation drops are seen in all models except the cgcm3 t47 under the a1b scenario the results show that the climate changes may lead to more precipitation to this region and the access1 0 and miroc esm chem model under rcp8 5 simulate more annual precipitation these results are in accordance with the results of climate conducted by the ipcc which reported that due to the climate change in future the precipitation will decrease in the low latitude regions and below the equator and it will increase in the high latitude regions bates et al 2008 fig 7 shows the results of projecting the average monthly temperature difference the base period and the total growth in the average annual temperature over the 40 year period using three gcms under different scenarios fig 7 indicates that the average monthly temperature varies over time however the annual temperature rises between 1 5 and 6 42 among different scenarios and the access1 0 model under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 generates the highest and lowest increases in the average annual temperature respectively compared to the observed average monthly temperature in the base period the simulated temperature is increased in the three gcms at the end of all seasons except in the access model rcp4 5 and 8 5 which drops at the end of fall in r r modeling the average monthly precipitation values were projected for the future period 2020 2060 and the results of the projected average monthly temperature data were used in estimating the average monthly evaporation values for the future which is presented in the following section 4 4 evaporation estimation under gcms scenarios the average monthly evaporation values were estimated for the reservoir optimization purpose in this study the results of the calculated average monthly evaporation values using the kharrufa method for the projected period 2020 2060 compared to the average monthly evaporation for the base period 1951 2000 are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the average monthly evaporation for the future period 2020 2060 increases in march april june september and october whereas it decreases in november and december via three gcms january february may july and august will experience both increase and decrease in the average monthly evaporation under different gcms scenarios 4 5 results of r r modeling for r r modeling and forecasting the runoff value one time step ahead q t 1 via wavelet m5 model for the future period 2020 2060 and under different scenarios i t and q t were considered as the potential inputs of both mentioned models according to eq 3 in order to apply q t 1 t 1 of the second month february 1951 of the historical period 1951 2000 in r r modeling using eq 3 the rainfall it and runoff qt values of the first month of 1951 january were used to measure the performance and set generalization of the trained models 75 of data from 1951 to 1988 were used for training and 25 from 1988 to 2000 for the verifying then the monthly runoff values were simulated using three gcms under different scenarios for the future period 2020 2060 the db4 mother wavelet at level 4 was applied to decompose the r r data the generated subseries were then used as the inputs of the wavelet m5 model for the case study as the results are presented in table 8 also the linear regressions of the best results of the wavelet m5 model are illustrated in appendix 1 according to table 8 and the values of cc wavelet m5 could result in satisfying performance in 1 month ahead forecasting for the study area the observed time series and the calculated time series using wavelet m5 are presented in fig 9 according to fig 9 and the results shown in table 8 wavelet m5 could lead to acceptable results since it benefits from prevention of the computation error magnification and the ability of wavelet transform in dealing with the multi resolution feature of the r r process in the next step the precipitation data downscaled under different scenarios for the future period 2020 2060 using the trained ffnn model were implemented with the calibrated wavelet m5 r r model to simulate the runoff for future 2020 2060 to determine the input discharges to the reservoir then the obtained runoff values for the future 2020 2060 using the cgcm3 t47 access1 0 and miroc esm chem gcms under different scenarios were compared with the historical runoff values to assess the impacts of climatic change on the hydrologic response of the basin fig 10 presents the simulated average monthly streamflow into the shahrchay reservoir for the future period 2020 2060 and its change under six different scenarios in comparison to the base period 1951 2000 according to fig 10 it could be observed that under all scenarios the inflow into the shahrchay reservoir increases in winter summer and fall in contrast it significantly decreases in comparison to the base period during spring generally considering the long term annual streamflow changes shown in table 9 it can be inferred that there will be a decrease in the average annual runoff over the 2020 2060 period the minimum drop in the average annual runoff will be approximately 0 08 via access1 0 rcp4 5 although the maximum decrease will be roughly 2 3 by access1 0 rcp8 5 it seems that this estimated maximum drop in the average annual runoff is obtained by the access1 0 rcp8 5 model because the growth in the average annual precipitation and temperature are the highest about 3 72 and 6 42 respectively see table 9 in this model compared to the others moreover according to table 9 the increase in the average annual temperature is approximately twice that of the precipitation in the access1 0 rcp8 5 model although the rise in temperature could increase the snow melting and lead to an increase in runoff volume it is not likely to happen in this case study and a higher increase in temperature than in precipitation will lead to a drop in runoff volume because it could increase the rate of evaporation and evapotranspiration due to land use changing overall in all scenarios for the study area the monthly streamflow changes will be much larger than the average annual streamflow changes so the reservoir planner needs to consider the monthly runoff variability for the reservoir operation for the future period consequently climate change will have a clear effect on future runoff and the reservoir operation as well 4 6 results of reservoir optimization under climate change scenarios at the last step the shahrchay reservoir rule curve was optimized using the ga optimization algorithm considering the simulated reservoir average monthly inflow corresponding to the future climate change scenarios for 2020 to 2060 the average monthly inflow evaporation precipitation and downstream water demands were imported to ga in order to optimize the shahrchay reservoir operation the optimal rule curve was obtained to minimize the total deficit according to the objective function see eq 4 over the future period in this case in order to optimize the reservoir operation rule curve for each month of the projection period 2020 to 2060 the one month step back data namely the average monthly agricultural and municipal demands gcms precipitation and temperature values downscaled via ffnn and runoff values obtained using wavelet m5 under different scenarios in this study should be used according to the continuity equation eq 5 fig 11 and table 10 illustrate the results of estimating the optimal operation rule curve using the ga algorithm for three gcms for the future and base period in comparison to the total demands as shown by fig 10 the average monthly inflow to the reservoir increases in winter january march for cgcm3 t47 considering fig 11a it makes sense that the average monthly stored water in the reservoir experiences a slight increase in comparison with the base period in spring april jun due to a sharp drop in the average monthly inflow compared to the base period the dam planner should manage to release the required water from stored water in the previous season so the amount of stored water in the reservoir becomes roughly equal to the stored water in the base period in the mid spring although according to fig 10 there are some increases in the average monthly inflow in summer and fall in the future the average monthly stored water tends to be less than in the base period from may to december see fig 11a it could be due to the significant decrease in the inflow rate at the end of spring moreover considering table 10 in cgcm3 t47 there are water shortages of 882 62 mcm and 879 59 mcm in the future respectively under a1b and b1 scenarios which are lower than the water shortage in the base period 908 1 mcm so it can be concluded that the ga algorithm in cgcm3 t47 allocated much more water to meet the agricultural and municipal needs for the future it is clear that the inflow to the reservoir in access1 0 is increased a bit less than that of cgcm3 t47 at the end of winter see fig 10 also by access1 0 the reduction of the reservoir future inflow compared to the base period at the end of spring and the amount of water shortages shown in table 10 are respectively higher and lower than those obtained by cgcm3 t47 it means the ga algorithm allocates more water to be released in the access1 0 model and consequently less water is stored in the reservoir as it can be seen in fig 10b for the miroc esm chem rcp8 5 model the decrease in the future inflow in comparison to the base period from january to may is less than that in the other models also the estimated amount of water deficit calculated by the ga algorithm for the miroc esm chem rcp8 5 model 879 21 mcm shown in table 10 is less than that for the base period and as a result more water is released see fig 11c considering fig 11c the volume of water released from the reservoir and the total decrease in the streamflow for miroc esm chem shown in table 10 are roughly equal to those for cgcm t47 under the b1 scenario and it may be the reason for the similarity in the storage month diagram in both mentioned models according to the obtained results by miroc esm chem rcp4 5 illustrated in table 10 which show a high water shortage in the future 1037 4 mcm it can be concluded that the amount of water allocated to the agricultural and municipal sections is significantly less and most of the water is stored in the reservoir according to the optimum rule curves shown in fig 11 the optimum storage should be maintained in the reservoir in each month for the future around a year for all scenarios the water level is maintained high in spring at 88 93 mcm in april and 133 9 mcm in jun and summer at 127 6mcm in july and 101 64 mcm in september to maximize the water head of the reservoir in order to meet the downstream high agricultural and municipal demands fall and winter require a lower water release from the reservoir about 76 07 mcm in january 81 96 mcm in march 85 10 mcm in october and 73 10 mcm in december to limit exceeding the maximum exploitation levels considering fig 11 the maximum storage obtained by ga is lower than the maximum reservoir capacity in all seasons for all scenarios therefore there will be no water spilled from the reservoir at any time for the future comparison of the results shown in fig 11 shows that in most months the optimum amount of released water is nearer to total water demand and it indicates that the optimization model for the shahrchay reservoir is robust and flexible in meeting the demands as a result the optimal target storage curves obtained in this study can be informative and valuable for decision makers in operating the shahrchay reservoir the outstanding effects of the new rule curves obtained by ga connected to the simulation model in this study is to enable the reservoir to be more effective by preventing the release of a greater water volume when the demand increases in the downstream areas and the risk of water shortages during the drought seasons that are likely to happen in the future as it can be seen in fig 11 the minimum water level is kept in the reservoir in all scenarios in order to reduce the risk of water shortages during the dry season in the next years fig 12 shows the average monthly released water deficit i e the average monthly water demand minus the average monthly released water obtained by the ga model under different scenarios for the future 2020 2060 from figs 10 12 it can be found that for all scenarios employed in this study except for miroc esm chem under rcp4 5 see fig 12c although less amount of inflow enters into the reservoir between 2020 and 2060 compared to the base period due to the impact of climate change the water deficit obtained for the future period is lower than that of the base period and the new simulation optimization model used in this study could result in a lower amount of water deficit see fig 12 and a higher amount of released water see fig 11 for the future compared to the base period this shows that if the reservoir is properly operated then the irrigation and other demands deficit could be decreased the results revealed that the optimization models are successful tools according to the objective function values in table 10 to provide more water for irrigation and municipal purposes than historical record due to climate change scenarios the ga optimal rule curves obtained for all scenarios used in this study have different forms and shapes see fig 11 it indicates that the reservoir is more sensitive to the future climate scenarios which could be due to the size of the shahrchay reservoir eum and simonovic 2010 showed that the small or medium size reservoirs are more sensitive to future climate change consequently the change of the rule curves for small or medium size reservoirs is necessary to be considered to adapt for future climate change finally when decision makers need to alter the reservoir operation policy to an optimization objective function in the future for example to prevent flooding or for a severe hydrological regime etc the improved simulation optimization methodology proposed in this study can be applied to develop the optimum reservoir rule curve 5 conclusions in this study in order to optimize the shahrchay reservoir operation rules under climate change three gcms cgcm t47 access1 0 and miroc esm chem under a1b b1 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were used to project the lowest and highest annual changes in temperature and precipitation the six future climate gcms scenarios for the 2020 2060 period were generated by the ffnn models in all scenarios a rise in temperature was observed and the access1 0 under the rcp8 5 scenario calculated the most serious and severe drought conditions precipitation predictions showed that precipitation would increase compared to the base period 1951 2000 especially in access1 0 under the rcp8 5 scenario the average monthly evaporation values for the future period 2020 2060 were obtained using a temperature based method kharrufa for reservoir optimization purpose in this study the results showed that the average monthly evaporation would increase in most months for the future period 2020 2060 compared to the base period 1951 2000 next the projected precipitation data imposed to the wavelet m5 model to obtain runoff in the basin for the future period through the r r modeling it was found that there will be a limited outflow in april to jun compared to the base period and it will be difficult to keep the current water level regulation in the future if it is necessary to release water from april to june in the future dam inflow from january to march should be reduced and stored in the reservoir in total the runoff in this region is supposed to be decreased over the 2020 2060 period in comparison with the base period as the result of an increase in temperature higher than in precipitation that could lead to a decrease in runoff due to the increase in the rate of evaporation and evapotranspiration land use changing the ga optimization model developed the optimal rule curves for the reservoir with specific aims including agricultural and municipal water supply in both base and future periods the estimated optimal rule curves for the shahrchay reservoir showed different shapes for all scenarios employed in this study it means that the reservoir is more sensitive to the future climate scenarios that might be due to the size of the shahrchay reservoir it could be concluded that the water released from the reservoir is increased in drought conditions in order to address water shortage downstream these results show that the framework developed in this work provides water resources management and planning as a methodology for evaluating and optimizing present systems and emphasizes the need to consider projected climate change as an assessment tool for reservoir management in the future for future work it is also recommended to apply another metaheuristic algorithms such as whale optimization algorithm woa and artificial bee colony abc to compare thier results with those obtained by ga use an optimization technique to determine the number of hidden layers and consider the impacts of the power plant land uses and water demands changes from the reservoir due to future climate change credit authorship

5454,we quantify the dilution of solute clouds in geological formations displaying hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture through the use of a lagrangian framework this allows for a fundamental understanding of how dilution arises from the hierarchical architecture of sedimentary facies and enables for a quantitative decomposition of dilution into facies related contributions at different scales within the hierarchy the new developed semi analytical solution that quantify the dilution index is based on hierarchical expressions of the spatial covariance of the log conductivity the spatial correlation structure in the covariance expression is defined by the probability of transitioning within and across facies types of different scales which are parameterized by independent and physically quantifiable attributes of sediments including geostatistical properties of the conductivity field and the proportions and lengths of facies types we illustrate the applicability of the model in the well documented tracer test at the borden research site canada we show how different scales of sedimentary architecture contribute to the dilution enhancement of the solute cloud at borden aquifer by quantitatively decomposing the dilution index into facies related contributions we gain fundamental insights on the key factors controlling the time dependent rate of dilution the results also illustrate that the probability of transitioning from one facies to another i e cross transitions at different scales defines the temporal scaling for enhanced dilution additionally we perform sensitivity analyses to investigate the effects of mean difference in conductivity volume proportion the statistical anisotropy ratio and the scale of heterogeneity on the overall solute

introduction estimating dilution rates of contaminant clouds is important in many hydrogeological environmental petroleum and agricultural related applications kitanidis and mccarty 2012 de barros at al 2009 fiori and dagan 2000 fiori 2001 de barros et al 2015 christov et al 2011 jiménez martínez et al 2016 jha et al 2011 amooie et al 2017 the rate of dilution of a contaminant migrating in the subsurface is strongly controlled by the spatial variability in physical and geochemical properties as well as intensity of molecular diffusion and local scale dispersion mechanisms for example spatial variability in the hydraulic properties e g hydraulic conductivity k of an aquifer results in an erratic spreading of contaminant clouds which in turn augments their surface area and therefore enhances dilution rates kitanidis 1994 kapoor and kitanidis 1998 dentz et al 2011 de barros at al 2012 for such reasons it is imperative to improve fundamental understanding on the role of spatial variability in controlling solute dilution several studies proposed analytical solutions to illustrate how dilution is controlled by the spatial bivariate correlation structure of the k field fiori and dagan 2000 tonina and bellin 2008 de barros and fiori 2014 de barros et al 2015 the impact of such heterogeneity on mixing measured using the scalar dissipation rate was also investigated numerically le borgne et al 2010 it was also shown that the combined effect of spatial variability and local scale dispersion have strong control on the concentration probability density function cirpka et al 2008 sanchez vila et al 2009 dentz and tartakovsky 2010 de barros and fiori 2014 boso and tartakovsky 2016 meyer 2010 particular attention was devoted to studying the effect of k heterogeneity on the temporal evolution of the concentration variance kapoor and gelhar 1994 kapoor and kitanidis 1998 fiori and dagan 2000 numerical modeling results and detailed laboratory experiments also demonstrate the significant contribution of flow focusing events induced by contrasts in hydraulic properties on enhancing transverse mixing werth at al 2006 rolle et al 2009 de barros and nowak 2010 cirpka 2011 cirpka et al 2012 other authors have focused on temporal mixing evolution of a solute cloud in a stratified geological formations bolster et al 2011 alternative approaches for quantifying mixing enhancement in porous media are also available de barros at al 2012 dentz et al 2018 aquino and bolster 2017 le borgne et al 2015 the above mentioned works highlight how the spatial correlation structure of the heterogeneous k field is important for evaluating solute spreading and dilution the previously cited studies investigated solute mixing and dilution in log conductivity i e y ln k fields characterized by spatial correlation models that are formulated without considering the role of underlying sedimentary architecture these spatial correlation models such as the ones adopted in the works cited in the previous paragraph are formulated based on a uni modal covariance with a single finite integral scale representing the spatial correlation structure recently attention has shifted to representing y across different spatial scales so that the integral scale may be neither finite nor single valued dagan 1994 neuman 1990 glimm et al 1993 di federico and neuman 1998 dai et al 2004 ramanathan et al 2008 sun et al 2008 ramanathan et al 2010 soltanian et al 2018 dai et al 2020 for example sedimentary deposits are organized into facies types that are defined at different spatial scales with a hierarchical and multiscale organization gershenzon et al 2015a b in the hierarchy assemblages of smaller scale facies types create larger scale facies types as shown conceptually in fig 1 therefore more than one scale of spatial correlation could be relevant the spatial variability of hydraulic and geochemical e g sorption coefficient attributes affecting dilution rate may display spatial structure that corresponds to this hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture ritzi et al 2007 dai et al 2004 dai et al 2019 ramanathan et al 2010 deng et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015a b c 2018 establishing a strong link between the spatial correlation structure of y and the underlying sedimentary architecture has been found to be essential especially in explaining solute retardation and spreading ritzi and soltanian 2015 providing a better explanation for dilution rate using such a link between spatial correlation structure of y and the underlying sedimentary architecture is the goal of this article the objective of this article is to analyze the process of dilution of a non reactive solute and to determine the controlling influence of sedimentary architecture in spite of its importance research efforts are still needed to better understand how heterogeneity created by such complex hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture controls the dilution process of a given solute prior work incorporating such architecture only studied spreading and neglected the effects of mixing and dilution dai et al 2004 ramanathan et al 2010 in order to study dilution in multiscale and hierarchical sedimentary structures we derive a novel semi analytical solution for the dilution index kitanidis 1994 the proposed semi analytical solution is based on the concept of the lagrangian concentration fiori 2001 de barros et al 2015 using the stochastic approach described in de barros et al 2015 the new semi analytical solution is a function of the geostatistical properties of the aquifer as well as other key transport parameters such as the péclet number it also incorporates the hierarchical organization of sedimentary facies types occurring over range of scales i e it represents the corresponding spatial variability of the attributes controlling dilution specifically the solution is based on the concept of transition probabilities probabilities of transitioning from one facies type to another which has shown to solely define the spatial correlation structure of y and sorption coefficients i e general shape and effective range of the correlation structure in different depositional settings ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2019 ritzi et al 2013 importantly the transition probability structures within each hierarchical level are controlled by and quantitatively linked to the quantifiable physical attributes of sediments such as the volume proportions and the mean lengths therefore as it will be demonstrated in this article the semi analytical solution for dilution is directly linked to field quantified and observable attributes of sediments in this way we provide an improved understanding on what aspect of the sedimentary architecture is more relevant to the dilution process 2 background to explore the effects of the hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture on solute dilution we employ a random space function rsf model to represent the spatially heterogeneous log conductivity field y x ln k x where x x 1 x 2 x 3 is the cartesian coordinate system in section 2 1 we review the salient points on the link between sedimentary architecture and spatial variability in y the rsf model for the hydraulic conductivity field is then introduced in section 2 2 2 1 sedimentary architecture sedimentary deposits have a hierarchical organization across different spatial scales as shown in fig 1 there is a corresponding hierarchy of y sub populations this has been shown in field studies in different types of deposits including fluvial ritzi et al 2004 alluvial dai et al 2005 2019 and lake shoreline deposits kalinovich et al 2012 ritzi et al 2013 as reviewed by ritzi and soltanian 2015 these studies as well as other related works provide a direct link between the sedimentary architecture and the spatial variability of hydraulic and geochemical properties anderson 1989 anderson 1990 anderson 1991 davis et al 1993 davis et al 1997 allen king et al 1998 barrash and clemo 2002 biteman et al 2004 dai et al 2005 kalinovich et al 2012 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015a b the most important finding of these works is that the spatial bivariate correlation structure of hydraulic and geochemical properties is fully characterized by transition probability structure and is defined by the sedimentary architecture data alone without curve fitting these works also made it possible to identify and model the separate impact of each scale of sedimentary architecture on the spatial bivariate correlation structure it has also been shown that sedimentary facies data are more readily accessible than y and specially geochemical data sedimentary data can be used to better represent and model the spatial bivariate correlation structure of both hydraulic and the geochemical attributes allen king et al 2006 2015 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015a b below we briefly review the mathematical description of the spatial variability model for hierarchical and multiscale media such spatial bivariate correlation structures have been developed for bimodal media rubin 1995 multimodal media barrash and clemo 2002 zhang 2002 and hierarchical multimodal media ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015a 2017 2 2 hierarchical and multiscale spatial correlation model in this work we consider two scales levels of stratal hierarchy in larger scale denoted by scale ii there are n facies types filling space in mutually exclusive occurrences scale ii regions are made up of n o or n j with o j 1 n facies types at scale i also occurring as mutually exclusive entities the larger scale facies types scale ii can include any number of smaller scale facies types at scale i consider two points x and x that are separated by a separation lag distance h location x is within scale i facies type k which in turn is within scale ii facies type o location x is within scale i facies type i which in turn is within scale ii facies type j we represent the mutually exclusive occurrence of sedimentary facies types by an indicator random space function i ok x the i ok x is 1 if x is within facies type ok and zero otherwise the composite sample covariance c y h is written as below with designation of facies types into which the heads and tails of the lag distance h fall i e h falls within the lag interval with y values at points x and x see ritzi et al 2004 2013 1 c y h σ y 2 o k j i γ ok ji h p ok h t ok ji h where σ y 2 is the univariate point sample variance and γ ok ji h is facies specific auto and cross semivarigrams ok ji and ok ji respectively defined by scale i and scale ii facies types the t ok ji h terms are transition probabilities which give the fraction of lags of a distance h and direction with tail in region of facies type ok and head in region of facies type ji the volume proportions p ok h give the fraction of lags starting in facies type ok ritzi 2000 showed that if the coefficient of variation of the facies length distributions are of order of unity the sample covariance could be modeled by an exponential correlation structure it has been shown that in natural deposits the facies length distribution are erlangian and the coefficient of variation of length is as large as unity this includes the borden aquifer whose heterogeneity characteristics is used in this paper to parameterize the developed semi analytical solution white and willis 2000 guin and ritzi 2008 ritzi et al 2007 2013 therefore an exponential function can be used within eq 1 in order to model t ok ji h using this concept one can find the following general vertically anisotropic and multiscale covariance function c y h the composite mean m y and variance σ y 2 of y x for a system with two scales of stratal hierarchy 2a c y h o 1 n k 1 n o p ok 2 σ ok 2 exp h λ ok 2b o 1 n k 1 n o p ok 1 p ok σ ok 2 exp h λ ok λ α α λ ok λ α α 2c 1 2 o 1 n k 1 n o i k σ ok 2 σ oi 2 m ok m oi 2 p ok p oi exp h λ α χ 2d 1 2 o 1 n i o k 1 n o i k σ ok 2 σ ji 2 m ok m ji 2 p ok p ji exp h λ χ χ 3 m y o 1 n k 1 n o p

found by integrating c y h following dagan 1989 and is given by 5 λ y 1 σ y 2 0 c y h dh χ σ y 2 where χ o 1 n k 1 n o p ok 2 σ ok 2 λ ok o 1 n k 1 n o p ok 1 p ok σ ok 2 λ ok λ α α λ ok λ α α 1 2 o 1

there are four groups of terms on the right hand side of eq 2 the first and the second terms terms 2a and 2b are from the auto transition group of terms that are defined by lags that are auto transitions at both scale i and ii the third term 2c is the cross transition group with auto transitions at scale ii and cross transitions at scale i with indicator integral scale of λ α χ the fourth term 2d represents cross transitions at both scales i and ii with indicator integral scale of λ χ χ as per prior studies ritzi et al 2007 ramanathan et al 2008 2010 the volumetric proportion weighted average is used at each scale to find λ α χ and λ χ χ which are given by 6a λ α χ o k l ok 1 p ok p ok 6b λ χ χ r l r 1 p r p r where l ok and l r are the mean length of facies types at each hierarchical scales the integral scales of auto transition probabilities λ α α is equal to λ α χ ritzi et al 2007 as shown in 6a and 6b λ α χ and λ χ χ are determined directly from the mean length and volume proportion of each facies types at each scale without a need for hydraulic conductivity data this is in fact a powerful feature of this formulation since facies types can be observed from outcrops stratigraphic data or models or geophysical data the formulation uses more abundant geological and geophysical data than hydraulic conductivity or permeability measurements therefore there is advantage in utilizing geological data to estimate related integral scales within each scale of the stratal hierarchy importantly this overcomes the equivocal aspects of fitting different correlation models to the sample variogram see discussion by woodbury and sudicky 1991 in which it was found that it is unlikely that one can unequivocally distinguish between various competing variogram models from detailed permeability measurements at the borden aquifer also see discussion by ritzi et al 2007 the contribution of each term presented in eq 2 in defining the covariance structure general shape and range were studied by ritzi et al 2004 for fluvial point bar deposit by dai et al 2005 for alluvial deposits and for lakeshore line deposits using data from borden site by ritzi et al 2007 and ritzi et al 2013 in all cases the covariance structure is entirely determined by the cross transition probability structures terms 2c and 2d and minor contributions by auto transition probabilities this means that the exponential like structure of p ro h t ro ji h for cross transition probabilities explain majority of the covariance structure and thus the hierarchical stratal architecture should provide the foundation for better understanding the spatial correlation of attributes controlling solute transport processes in this article we address dilution of non reactive solutes and incorporate effects of local scale dispersion while we hypothesize that cross transition probability structures explain majority of dilution we explore the contribution from auto and cross terms in our semi analytical lagrangian formulation for the solute dilution in order to better study their effects and contributions to dilution and its scaling behavior 3 lagrangian approach for quantifying dilution in the following we provide details regarding the solute transport modeling approach as previously mentioned see section 2 y is spatially variable and modeled as a rsf as an outcome of the spatial variability of y the flow field is heterogeneous for the purpose of our illustrations we consider the following assumptions the flow field under consideration is assumed to be at steady state uniform in the mean along the longitudinal direction in an unbounded domain and in the absence of source and sinks the average longitudinal velocity is given by u furthermore we consider low to mild heterogeneity in y field a non reactive solute is instantaneously released from a point like source the initial concentration of the injected solute is c o transport is at a finite péclet number pe u λ y d d where d d is the local scale dispersion coefficient in the upcoming results local scale dispersion is assumed to be isotropic and constant the constant d d assumption is consistent with the first order approximation in the log conductivity variance fiori 2001 de barros et al 2015 with the goal of reducing the uncertainty associated with y heterogeneity on the concentration estimate fiori 2001 developed the concept of the lagrangian concentration which is defined as 7 c t ξ c v o c o a δ ξ x t t a p t c d a details pertaining to the concept of the lagrangian concentration and its applications can be found in the literature fiori 2001 boso et al 2013 de barros et al 2015 for the sake of completeness we summarize the key ideas behind the lagrangian concentration relevant for our work as described in fiori 2001 the concentration in eq 7 is computed in a mobile system of coordinates ξ x p where p corresponds to the trajectory of the solute particle s centroid which originates from c v o the integration over the source volume v o accounts for all initial particle locations a v o following the work of fiori 2001 a relative solute particle trajectory can be defined in this mobile coordinate system ξ namely w t t a c x t t a p t c using the first order approximation in the log conductivity variance and the point source assumption i e a c 0 the relative solute particle trajectory is characterized by the following moments see details in fiori 2001 8 w t t a c a c 9 w t ii t x t ii t 2 d d t z t ii t where w t and w t ii are the mean and variance respectively w t ii t contains information about the flow field and is described as the separation distance of the trajectory of a particle released at position a relative to the darcy scale center of mass of a parcel centered at c the particle trajectories needed to compute w t ii in eq 9 namely x t ii and z t ii are the one and two particle cross covariance functions fiori and dagan 2000 derivation of x t ii and z t ii for finite péclet numbers pe and uni modal media proposed by fiori and dagan 2000 and are summarized in appendix i in de de barros et al 2015 particle trajectories x t ii in hierarchical and multiscale media for infinite pe numbers i e no dilution are presented in soltanian et al 2015b d the lagrangian concentration concept developed by fiori 2001 has been utilized to study the concentration uncertainty and has been verified against field data and high resolution numerical simulations boso et al 2013 de barros et al 2015 in particular the work of de barros et al 2015 expanded the use of the lagrangian concentration to quantify dilution of a solute cloud the authors derived a semi analytical solution for the time dependent entropy based metric known as dilution index e t proposed by kitanidis 1994 the full derivation of e t for uni modal porous media was presented by de barros et al 2015 importantly de barros et al 2015 verified the semi analytical solution using smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph numerical method to solve for advection dispersion equation and successfully tested it against the cape cod tracer data because our goal is to 1 provide a link between e t and the geologic architecture and 2 to study how physical attributes of sediments at different scales control e t growth rate we expand the semi analytical solution proposed by de barros et al 2015 for hierarchical and multiscale geological media using eq 2 following de barros et al 2015 the semi analytical solution for e t is 10 e t 2 π 2 exp n d 2 i 1 n d w t ii t with n d denoting spatial dimensionality here n d 3 and w t ii is defined in eq 9 using the hierarchical covariance function in eq 2 one can find the following expressions for one particle trajectory second moment x t

the mean velocity assuming that the x 1 direction is aligned with the mean groundwater velocity the j and n are the mean hydraulic gradient and porosity respectively the coefficients ξ vok and η vok can be found in table 1 and are mainly univariate statistics of each covariance term in eq 2 comparing coefficients for ξ vok and η vok in table 1 with rhs terms in eq 2 shows that the sum of v 1 and v 2 terms in eqs 11 and 15 correspond to auto covariance of y weighted by volume proportions and auto transition probabilities therefore v 1 2 are the contributions of auto transition probabilities to dilution and are called auto terms however the v 3 and v 4 correspond to mean differences across facies boundaries at scale i and ii respectively and are weighted by cross transition probabilities therefore v 3 and v 4 are the contribution to the tracer dilution from cross transition probabilities respectively at scale i and ii and are called cross terms note that prior work have used hierarchical correlation models to derive the one particle trajectory covariance x t ii i e measure of spreading by neglecting local scale dispersion see zhang 2002 dai et al 2004 ramanathan et al 2010 soltanian et al 2015d however in eq 11 we incorporated the effect of local scale dispersion and thus eq 11 is a novel expression for x t ii in hierarchical and multiscale media the two particle trajectory cross covariance z t ii in eq 15 for hierarchical and multiscale media has not been derived in prior work both eqs 11 and 15 link particle trajectories to the hierarchical stratal architecture through parameters of the hierarchical covariance model thus the novel expressions derived in this work link the statistics of particle trajectories to quantifiable physical attributes of the sedimentary architecture a detailed derivation of x t ii t and z t ii t for uni modal porous media can be found in de barros et al 2015 and the expressions in eq 11 and eq 15 are obtained by similar derivations for hierarchical media next we evaluate the developed solution for eq 10 by using input parameters estimated from highly resolved data of the cfb borden site see section 4 4 results and discussion in this section we examine how sedimentary architecture controls rates of dilution and what aspects of sedimentary architecture are most important in evaluation of e t and its transient growth rate 4 1 comparison with field data here we follow hierarchical multimodal media of the lake shoreline deposit at cfb borden site see figs 1 and 2 of supplementary materials showing maps of strata at different scales as well as cumulative frequency of y as subdivided into subpopulations by stratal facies type at two scales observed at the borden aquifer following the works of ramanathan et al 2010 ritzi et al 2013 and soltanian et al 2015a b and incorporate indicator integral scales for facies types at each scale of the hierarchy while the spatial bivariate correlation model and the lagrangian based framework are written here for two scales of stratal hierarchy they can easily be extended for any number of scales with any number of sedimentary facies types using covariance models with only cross transition terms terms 2c and 2d ramanathan et al 2010 derived a lagrangian based model for the spreading of non reactive solutes and soltanian et al 2015a b derived models for the transient retardation factor and spreading of the perchloroethene pce cloud for the well known natural gradient tracer experiments conducted at the cfb borden site despite illustrating the applicability of lagrangian based models their studies only considered global quantities related to solute spreading and neglected the effects of local scale dispersion in accordance with the findings in the literature dagan 1989 dagan and fiori 1997 we evaluate the performance of e t by comparing it to field measured data of the natural gradient tracer test at cfb borden site sudicky 1986 mackay et al 1986 roberts et al 1986 we will use available information from original publications as well as recently obtained highly resolved sedimentary architecture data described below the average groundwater velocity is u 0 091 m d to the best of our knowledge fiori and dagan 1999 provided the only estimates of local scale transverse dispersivity α t after careful analysis of field measured concentration data by fitts 1996 there is no data on the local scale longitudinal dispersion α l however α l has a minor effect on x t ii and z t ii fiori and dagan 1999 given this we assumed péclet number is the same in both longitudinal and transverse directions using α t of 0 0005 m as per fiori and dagan 1999 as noted the péclet number is calculated by pe u λ y d d because d d is the local scale transverse dispersivity multiplied by u the péclet number is calculated by pe λ y α t we will perform sensitivity analysis to α t the observed dilution index e t was estimated by thierrin and kitanidis 1994 using interpolation scheme to estimate the edge of the concentration field there are uncertainties in their calculations especially in estimating the extension of the cloud which could affect the e t calculations to our view the borden experiment itself is a single realization and that the lagrangian models represent ensemble behavior among possible realizations from the correlation model therefore our goal in this paper is not to exactly reproduce the observed dilution index of the borden non reactive solute clouds instead we focus on the role of hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture on the time evolution of the dilution index the univariate statistics of y and facies lengths and proportions at different scales that form the parameters of the dilution index model in eq 10 were quantified for the borden site by ritzi et al 2013 the point statistics calculated for y per each facies defined at each hierarchical scale are presented in table 2 note that borden site is the only site for which there is 1 documented high quality tracer data and 2 there is a quantitative characterization of the stratal architecture including proportions and length statistics of facies types as well as univariate statistics of y within each facies type using the data presented in table 2 the horizontal integral scales λ α χ and λ χ χ in eq 6 are computed as 1 19 m and 2 11 m respectively see soltanian et al 2015a b the vertical integral scales λ α χ and λ χ χ are calculated in the same way as 0 09 m and 0 116 m respectively therefore the average anisotropy ratio e is calculated as 0 06 the sample auto and cross transition probability structures of this highly resolved sedimentary architecture data were evaluated by ritzi et al 2013 using about 9800 indicator data see fig 2 in supplementary materials the length statistics reported in table 2 were corrected for bias by ramanathan et al 2010 ritzi et al 2013 showed that the spatial bivariate correlation model in eq 2 match the sample transition probabilities quite well without curve fitting they also found that majority of the sample correlation structure is defined by cross transition probability structures at scales i and ii fig 2 shows the observed and estimated eq 10 time evolution of e t for the borden site the e t has a unit of volume as it measures the aquifer volume occupied by the solute cloud as shown the model with α t of 0 0005 m is in good agreement with the observed dilution index as expected we cannot perfectly match the data also see related discussion by soltanian et al 2015a b at large time the model over predicts the observed data in our view this is in part related to truncation sample locations that did not fully capture the edge of the cloud in both the vertical and the horizontal directions see discussion by rajaram and gelhar 1991 and thierrin and kitanidis 1994 the e t for α t to 0 005 m is also shown in fig 2 it is clear that increasing the α t by a factor ten did not significantly change our results note that there are also some non physical values for e t in the observed data e g time of 680 days in which the e t suddenly decreases thierrin and kitanidis 1994 argued that this is due to poor mass recovery 4 2 theoretical analysis an important point of discussion is with regard to the insight we gain from the model about the dilution process with specific focus here on how e t relates to the hierarchy of stratal architecture fig 3 a shows the contribution from auto v 1 and v 2 and cross v 3 and v 4 terms to e t it is clear that cross terms v 3 and v 4 explain majority of dilution however about 20 30 of cloud dilution is still explained by auto terms v 1 and v 2 this means that as the probability of cross transitioning across different facies increases the solute cloud dilution also increases with time the practicality of our formulation is that it allows identifying and separating the individual effects from each scale of stratal architecture to e t this allows us to quantitatively see which scale of sedimentary architecture is more relevant to dilution process to better visualize the impact of sedimentary architecture on dilution process in fig 3b we show scaling results of e t for all auto and cross terms e t is depicted versus normalized time tu λ y on a logarithmic scale as depicted in fig 3b e t t 1 5 for auto terms v 1 and v 2 for all times the t 1 5 is in fact reflection of homogeneous behavior and similar to early time behavior in heterogeneous media since in such conditions w t ii t t and therefore e t t n d 2 see detailed discussion in kitanidis 1994 and de barros et al 2015 this importantly shows that the variability within facies types at each scales does not result in an enhanced dilution process as shown in fig 3b at intermediate times the scaling for the cross transition related terms at both scales v 3 and v 4 increase to 1 85 this means that the cross transition for facies types at both scales enhance e t at later time after times of about 650 days tu λ y 20 the scaling starts to decrease to about 1 7 until it finally reaches to 1 5 at large time not shown in fig 3b this corresponds to the time at which w t ii t t and macrodispersion reaches its asymptotic value rubin 2003 de barros et al 2015 as a result again e t t n d 2 another interesting point is that the scaling cross terms at larger scale v 4 is identical to the scaling when all model terms are combined black line this means that the relevant terms to identify e t scaling are solely the cross transition terms at larger scales in fig 4 we show the effect of e on e t it is clear that increasing e does not significantly change e t as observed in de de barros et al 2015 the dilution index reduces with increasing values of e fig 5 a shows components of one and two particle trajectory covariances used in calculation of e t in eq 10 it is clear that x t 11 and z t 11 are the largest terms the transverse components e g x t 22 and z t 22 have comparable values but they are all smaller than x t 11 and z t 11 therefore as expected the cloud is mainly stretching in the direction of mean groundwater flow also the cloud slowly increases in size in the vertical direction fig 5b shows the difference between the one and two particle trajectory covariances e g x t 11 z t 11 which are the main terms in w t ii calculations and thus the e t it is evident that x t 11 z t 11 is the major contributor and x t 22 z t 22 and x t 33 z t 33 have smaller roles in eq 10 5 sensitivity study we perform a sensitivity analysis to most important parameters affecting mass transport processes e g macrodispersion found in prior work rubin 1995 zhang 2002 dai et al 2004 deng et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015a this includes the indicator integral scale that controls scale of heterogeneity difference in the mean conductivities that control the overlap between hydraulic conductivity distributions and as a result the velocity contrasts and the volume proportion that controls facies connectivity in order to make our sensitivity study simpler to understand we only use sedimentary architecture data of larger scale level ii of the borden data i e m and fz facies types in this way we simplify the structure to one with a uniform indicator integral scale and two facies types i e bimodal distribution therefore eq 2 is simplified to the form below following prior work zhang 2002 dai et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015d 17a c y h o 1 n p o 2 σ o 2 exp h λ o 17b o 1 n j 1 n p o 1 p j σ o 2 exp h λ o λ i λ o λ i 17c 1 2 o 1 n k 1 n σ o 2 σ j 2 m o m j 2 p o p j exp h λ i where λ i is the indicator integral scale which is found in a two facies system by l r 1 l r 1 l r 2 where l r 1 and l r 2 are mean length of facies types 1 and 2 respectively zhang 2002 dai et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015d 2017 eq 12 matches the covariance derived by zhang 2002 and rubin 1995 for the bimodal facies distribution using the simplified covariance in eq 17 one can easily modify the expressions for one and two particle trajectory covariances x t ii and z t ii as 18 x t ii t v 1 3 o 1 n 4 ξ vok η vok epe π 2 0 dx 0

coefficients ξ vo and η vo in are reported in table 3 5 1 influence of indicator scale to examine the sensitivity of e t to the scale of heterogeneity we fix all parameters related to the larger scale level ii in table 2 and allow λ i to vary we increase λ i to 2 λ i 5 λ i and 10 λ i the results are shown in fig 6 a f among the sensitivity results presented in section 5 e t shows a complex dependency to λ i looking at fig 6a it is clear that increasing λ i from λ i to 2 λ i slightly increases e t this effect is better visualized in the inset of fig 6a interestingly increasing λ i to 5 λ i and 10 λ i results in smaller values for e t at the same time fig 6b shows that the case with 10 λ i has a longer enhanced dilution period of e t t 1 85 and the dilution index continue to grow with this rate and will eventually exceed dilution values of cases with shorter λ i to better understand this behavior we look more closely at eq 9 for the relative trajectory variance w t ii t x t ii t 2 d d t z t ii t used in eq 10 to calculate the dilution index fig 6c e show that the differences between x t 11 and z t 11 are the most important contributors to dilution index calculations the differences between transverse trajectory covariances e g x t 22 and cross covariances e g z t 22 are also important as they scale the e t estimates see eq 10 increasing λ i results in more stretched solute clouds this can be concluded from x t 11 results showing higher x t 11 for larger λ i it is clear that 10 λ i has the maximum stretching this results in smaller amount of transverse spreading i e x t 22 for 10 λ i shown in fig 6d the opposite is true for z t 22 however due to larger z t 11 the difference x t 11 z t 11 is smaller for cases with 5 λ i and 10 λ i and thus e t is smaller while the difference x t 22 z t 22 reaches a relatively constant value at time approximately equal to 1000 days those of other cases continue to increase therefore e t will continue to grow and will eventually exceeds other cases physically this means that in shorter λ i cases the cloud continue to grow in the transverse direction while dispersing in the longitudinal direction this initially causes more mixing and dilution however if λ i is larger the cloud needs to spend more time sampling full scales of heterogeneity and will need to grow more in the longitudinal direction this results in less spreading in the transverse direction the interplay between these effects causes smaller values of e t initially for larger scales of heterogeneities e g 5 λ i and 10 λ i while enhanced dilution occurring 5 2 influence of mean conductivity the contrast in mean conductivity is one of the parameters to which the e t is most sensitive to in borden data shown in table 2 the k m and k fz are 7 85 m d and 3 38 m d respectively we define the ratio of mean conductivities as ρ k m k fz we fixed k fz at 3 38 m d and studied the effect of changing ρ to 0 1 10 and 100 on e t when ρ increases the difference between mean conductivity and the velocity of the m and fz facies increases thus the conductivity probability distributions are more separated the results are shown in fig 7 a d as shown in fig 7a the dilution index increases as the contrast in conductivity between facies m and fz increases fig 7b shows several stages of enhanced dilution scaling due to changes in ρ when ρ is 0 1 both facies do not have high conductivities and enhanced dilution does not occur t 1 5 in the green dotted line the scaling shows t 1 5 which is a reflection of w t ii t t and therefore e t t n d 2 see kitanidis 1994 de barros et al 2015 because the solute cloud is influenced by heterogeneity see one and two particle covariances displayed in fig 7c and d the dilution is mainly controlled by macrodispersion instead of local scale dispersion when the contrast in conductivity is large enhanced dilution could occur with higher scaling for example for ρ of 100 four stages are observed before t 1 5 is obtained i e t 2 2 t 2 t 1 85 and t 1 7 5 3 influence of volume proportion it is known that the volume proportion of high conductivity facies controls the hydrogeological system connectivity as volume proportion of such facies increases the hydrogeological connectivity increases harter 2005 guin and ritzi 2008 gershenzon et al 2015c pescimoro et al 2019 therefore we changed the volume proportion of m facies type p m to 0 1 0 2 and 0 6 the results are shown in fig 8 a d in general as p m increases the e t increases however only slight increase in e t is observed as p m increases from 0 2 to 0 6 this is because there is no significant change in difference between longitudinal trajectory covariances e g x t 11 and cross covariances e g z t 11 which is the main contributor to the dilution see fig 8c for volume proportions of 0 1 and 0 2 dilution enhancement occurs but with a smaller scaling of t 1 7 before it reaches t 1 5 for high volume proportion of 0 6 dilution is enhanced initially to what we usually observed previously i e t 1 85 following scaling of t 1 7 6 concluding remarks in this paper we have developed a new semi analytical solution to quantify the dilution of a solute cloud in a 3d spatially heterogeneous aquifer solute dilution is measured through the entropy based metric denoted as the dilution index introduced by kitanidis 1994 the new derived solution for the dilution index is based on the framework developed in de barros et al 2015 and has been expanded to include sedimentary aquifers displaying a hierarchical and multiscale variability of the hydraulic conductivity similar to de barros et al 2015 the solution is valid for aquifers displaying low to mild levels of heterogeneity small solute injection zones and uniform in the mean flows in the absence of sinks and sources we tested the performance of the new solution with the well documented cfb borden non reactive tracer test standing the complexity of subsurface systems and the influence of spatial variability of hydraulic properties on flow and solute transport there is an increasing need to simplify the aquifer structures and to reduce the model parameterization a preliminary and fundamental prerequisite is a basic science understanding of the role of the aquifer architecture on transport processes such as dispersion and dilution insights gained from this work and prior works on the controlling influence of sedimentary architecture on plume retardation and dispersion ramanathan et al 2010 soltanian et al 2015a b provide such basic understanding furthermore the insights gained at data rich sites such as borden site can provide practical benefits to addressing common challenges created by data limitations in other sites our work provides insights into the relationship between solute dilution and stratal geometries at each scale separating the influence of each scale of sedimentary architecture and identifying the relative contribution of each scale directly enhance our understanding of the dilution process at the borden tracer test our results show that the majority of solute dilution is explained by larger scale facies types of medium sand and fine sand and silt facies types smaller scale facies at scale i explain about one third of the dilution process also the cross transition probabilities between larger scale and binary facies types can capture the temporal scaling of the dilution index however this does not mean that a simple binary medium is sufficient to explain dilution process at all sites rather it shows the applicability of sedimentary architecture data in developing transition probability based models by which one can study and understand what aspects of sedimentary architecture of a given site are important in explaining transport parameters also as noted by soltanian and ritzi 2014 facies classifications are not unique and there is no universal answer to questions over how facies should be defined at any scale and how many scales should be used however at a given site it is useful to integrate sedimentary architecture data into frameworks such as the one proposed here to quantify what aspect of heterogeneity is important in explaining solute transport note that the framework presented here could be applied to any facies classifications the practical advantage of the proposed framework comes from the fact that commonly there are challenges created by data limitations when studying solute transport in groundwater systems because of time effort and cost sedimentary architecture data are more abundant and less uncertain than hydraulic conductivity measurements for instance geologic data can be directly observed in drill cuttings or cores and facies proportions and lengths can be quantified from outcrop exposures cores geophysical transects or inferred from stratigraphic models sun et al 2008 the expressions for the dilution index presented in this work rely only on the data containing information related to the geologic architecture without the traditional curve fitting procedure for estimating the conductivity integral scale therefore there is strong practical advantage in being able to directly use geologic data in evaluating transport processes at sites with limited data given that the cross transition probability explains majority of solute dilution and its rate of growth it is most important to represent such transitions through incorporating more geologic data into solute transport models note that the solute spreading analysis carried out by sudicky 1986 at the borden site involved determining the permeability correlation structure with use of 1279 data almost an order of magnitude more in number than the number of permeability data used to develop the sample covariance in this study see ritzi et al 2013 this is because the multiscale covariance model is based on the indicator data and only univariate statistics for permeability are required therefore the permeability data requirements are significantly reduced we encourage the readers to see ritzi and soltanian 2015 for further discussions also in a recent work dai et al 2020 showed what level of sedimentary architecture data is required to better explain plume dispersion the framework presented is computationally cheap while keeping a functional analytical relationship between the dilution index and key features that are commonly characterized in a given site given its analytical feature the proposed solution can be used for parametric sensitivity analysis finally the developed expressions for the dilution index is currently being extended to account for relevant geochemical reactions in hydrogeological systems displaying

5454,we quantify the dilution of solute clouds in geological formations displaying hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture through the use of a lagrangian framework this allows for a fundamental understanding of how dilution arises from the hierarchical architecture of sedimentary facies and enables for a quantitative decomposition of dilution into facies related contributions at different scales within the hierarchy the new developed semi analytical solution that quantify the dilution index is based on hierarchical expressions of the spatial covariance of the log conductivity the spatial correlation structure in the covariance expression is defined by the probability of transitioning within and across facies types of different scales which are parameterized by independent and physically quantifiable attributes of sediments including geostatistical properties of the conductivity field and the proportions and lengths of facies types we illustrate the applicability of the model in the well documented tracer test at the borden research site canada we show how different scales of sedimentary architecture contribute to the dilution enhancement of the solute cloud at borden aquifer by quantitatively decomposing the dilution index into facies related contributions we gain fundamental insights on the key factors controlling the time dependent rate of dilution the results also illustrate that the probability of transitioning from one facies to another i e cross transitions at different scales defines the temporal scaling for enhanced dilution additionally we perform sensitivity analyses to investigate the effects of mean difference in conductivity volume proportion the statistical anisotropy ratio and the scale of heterogeneity on the overall solute

introduction estimating dilution rates of contaminant clouds is important in many hydrogeological environmental petroleum and agricultural related applications kitanidis and mccarty 2012 de barros at al 2009 fiori and dagan 2000 fiori 2001 de barros et al 2015 christov et al 2011 jiménez martínez et al 2016 jha et al 2011 amooie et al 2017 the rate of dilution of a contaminant migrating in the subsurface is strongly controlled by the spatial variability in physical and geochemical properties as well as intensity of molecular diffusion and local scale dispersion mechanisms for example spatial variability in the hydraulic properties e g hydraulic conductivity k of an aquifer results in an erratic spreading of contaminant clouds which in turn augments their surface area and therefore enhances dilution rates kitanidis 1994 kapoor and kitanidis 1998 dentz et al 2011 de barros at al 2012 for such reasons it is imperative to improve fundamental understanding on the role of spatial variability in controlling solute dilution several studies proposed analytical solutions to illustrate how dilution is controlled by the spatial bivariate correlation structure of the k field fiori and dagan 2000 tonina and bellin 2008 de barros and fiori 2014 de barros et al 2015 the impact of such heterogeneity on mixing measured using the scalar dissipation rate was also investigated numerically le borgne et al 2010 it was also shown that the combined effect of spatial variability and local scale dispersion have strong control on the concentration probability density function cirpka et al 2008 sanchez vila et al 2009 dentz and tartakovsky 2010 de barros and fiori 2014 boso and tartakovsky 2016 meyer 2010 particular attention was devoted to studying the effect of k heterogeneity on the temporal evolution of the concentration variance kapoor and gelhar 1994 kapoor and kitanidis 1998 fiori and dagan 2000 numerical modeling results and detailed laboratory experiments also demonstrate the significant contribution of flow focusing events induced by contrasts in hydraulic properties on enhancing transverse mixing werth at al 2006 rolle et al 2009 de barros and nowak 2010 cirpka 2011 cirpka et al 2012 other authors have focused on temporal mixing evolution of a solute cloud in a stratified geological formations bolster et al 2011 alternative approaches for quantifying mixing enhancement in porous media are also available de barros at al 2012 dentz et al 2018 aquino and bolster 2017 le borgne et al 2015 the above mentioned works highlight how the spatial correlation structure of the heterogeneous k field is important for evaluating solute spreading and dilution the previously cited studies investigated solute mixing and dilution in log conductivity i e y ln k fields characterized by spatial correlation models that are formulated without considering the role of underlying sedimentary architecture these spatial correlation models such as the ones adopted in the works cited in the previous paragraph are formulated based on a uni modal covariance with a single finite integral scale representing the spatial correlation structure recently attention has shifted to representing y across different spatial scales so that the integral scale may be neither finite nor single valued dagan 1994 neuman 1990 glimm et al 1993 di federico and neuman 1998 dai et al 2004 ramanathan et al 2008 sun et al 2008 ramanathan et al 2010 soltanian et al 2018 dai et al 2020 for example sedimentary deposits are organized into facies types that are defined at different spatial scales with a hierarchical and multiscale organization gershenzon et al 2015a b in the hierarchy assemblages of smaller scale facies types create larger scale facies types as shown conceptually in fig 1 therefore more than one scale of spatial correlation could be relevant the spatial variability of hydraulic and geochemical e g sorption coefficient attributes affecting dilution rate may display spatial structure that corresponds to this hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture ritzi et al 2007 dai et al 2004 dai et al 2019 ramanathan et al 2010 deng et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015a b c 2018 establishing a strong link between the spatial correlation structure of y and the underlying sedimentary architecture has been found to be essential especially in explaining solute retardation and spreading ritzi and soltanian 2015 providing a better explanation for dilution rate using such a link between spatial correlation structure of y and the underlying sedimentary architecture is the goal of this article the objective of this article is to analyze the process of dilution of a non reactive solute and to determine the controlling influence of sedimentary architecture in spite of its importance research efforts are still needed to better understand how heterogeneity created by such complex hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture controls the dilution process of a given solute prior work incorporating such architecture only studied spreading and neglected the effects of mixing and dilution dai et al 2004 ramanathan et al 2010 in order to study dilution in multiscale and hierarchical sedimentary structures we derive a novel semi analytical solution for the dilution index kitanidis 1994 the proposed semi analytical solution is based on the concept of the lagrangian concentration fiori 2001 de barros et al 2015 using the stochastic approach described in de barros et al 2015 the new semi analytical solution is a function of the geostatistical properties of the aquifer as well as other key transport parameters such as the péclet number it also incorporates the hierarchical organization of sedimentary facies types occurring over range of scales i e it represents the corresponding spatial variability of the attributes controlling dilution specifically the solution is based on the concept of transition probabilities probabilities of transitioning from one facies type to another which has shown to solely define the spatial correlation structure of y and sorption coefficients i e general shape and effective range of the correlation structure in different depositional settings ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2019 ritzi et al 2013 importantly the transition probability structures within each hierarchical level are controlled by and quantitatively linked to the quantifiable physical attributes of sediments such as the volume proportions and the mean lengths therefore as it will be demonstrated in this article the semi analytical solution for dilution is directly linked to field quantified and observable attributes of sediments in this way we provide an improved understanding on what aspect of the sedimentary architecture is more relevant to the dilution process 2 background to explore the effects of the hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture on solute dilution we employ a random space function rsf model to represent the spatially heterogeneous log conductivity field y x ln k x where x x 1 x 2 x 3 is the cartesian coordinate system in section 2 1 we review the salient points on the link between sedimentary architecture and spatial variability in y the rsf model for the hydraulic conductivity field is then introduced in section 2 2 2 1 sedimentary architecture sedimentary deposits have a hierarchical organization across different spatial scales as shown in fig 1 there is a corresponding hierarchy of y sub populations this has been shown in field studies in different types of deposits including fluvial ritzi et al 2004 alluvial dai et al 2005 2019 and lake shoreline deposits kalinovich et al 2012 ritzi et al 2013 as reviewed by ritzi and soltanian 2015 these studies as well as other related works provide a direct link between the sedimentary architecture and the spatial variability of hydraulic and geochemical properties anderson 1989 anderson 1990 anderson 1991 davis et al 1993 davis et al 1997 allen king et al 1998 barrash and clemo 2002 biteman et al 2004 dai et al 2005 kalinovich et al 2012 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015a b the most important finding of these works is that the spatial bivariate correlation structure of hydraulic and geochemical properties is fully characterized by transition probability structure and is defined by the sedimentary architecture data alone without curve fitting these works also made it possible to identify and model the separate impact of each scale of sedimentary architecture on the spatial bivariate correlation structure it has also been shown that sedimentary facies data are more readily accessible than y and specially geochemical data sedimentary data can be used to better represent and model the spatial bivariate correlation structure of both hydraulic and the geochemical attributes allen king et al 2006 2015 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015a b below we briefly review the mathematical description of the spatial variability model for hierarchical and multiscale media such spatial bivariate correlation structures have been developed for bimodal media rubin 1995 multimodal media barrash and clemo 2002 zhang 2002 and hierarchical multimodal media ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015a 2017 2 2 hierarchical and multiscale spatial correlation model in this work we consider two scales levels of stratal hierarchy in larger scale denoted by scale ii there are n facies types filling space in mutually exclusive occurrences scale ii regions are made up of n o or n j with o j 1 n facies types at scale i also occurring as mutually exclusive entities the larger scale facies types scale ii can include any number of smaller scale facies types at scale i consider two points x and x that are separated by a separation lag distance h location x is within scale i facies type k which in turn is within scale ii facies type o location x is within scale i facies type i which in turn is within scale ii facies type j we represent the mutually exclusive occurrence of sedimentary facies types by an indicator random space function i ok x the i ok x is 1 if x is within facies type ok and zero otherwise the composite sample covariance c y h is written as below with designation of facies types into which the heads and tails of the lag distance h fall i e h falls within the lag interval with y values at points x and x see ritzi et al 2004 2013 1 c y h σ y 2 o k j i γ ok ji h p ok h t ok ji h where σ y 2 is the univariate point sample variance and γ ok ji h is facies specific auto and cross semivarigrams ok ji and ok ji respectively defined by scale i and scale ii facies types the t ok ji h terms are transition probabilities which give the fraction of lags of a distance h and direction with tail in region of facies type ok and head in region of facies type ji the volume proportions p ok h give the fraction of lags starting in facies type ok ritzi 2000 showed that if the coefficient of variation of the facies length distributions are of order of unity the sample covariance could be modeled by an exponential correlation structure it has been shown that in natural deposits the facies length distribution are erlangian and the coefficient of variation of length is as large as unity this includes the borden aquifer whose heterogeneity characteristics is used in this paper to parameterize the developed semi analytical solution white and willis 2000 guin and ritzi 2008 ritzi et al 2007 2013 therefore an exponential function can be used within eq 1 in order to model t ok ji h using this concept one can find the following general vertically anisotropic and multiscale covariance function c y h the composite mean m y and variance σ y 2 of y x for a system with two scales of stratal hierarchy 2a c y h o 1 n k 1 n o p ok 2 σ ok 2 exp h λ ok 2b o 1 n k 1 n o p ok 1 p ok σ ok 2

there are four groups of terms on the right hand side of eq 2 the first and the second terms terms 2a and 2b are from the auto transition group of terms that are defined by lags that are auto transitions at both scale i and ii the third term 2c is the cross transition group with auto transitions at scale ii and cross transitions at scale i with indicator integral scale of λ α χ the fourth term 2d represents cross transitions at both scales i and ii with indicator integral scale of λ χ χ as per prior studies ritzi et al 2007 ramanathan et al 2008 2010 the volumetric proportion weighted average is used at each scale to find λ α χ and λ χ χ which are given by 6a λ α χ o k l ok 1 p ok p ok 6b λ χ χ r l r 1 p r p r where l ok and l r are the mean length of facies types at each hierarchical scales the integral scales of auto transition probabilities λ α α is equal to λ α χ ritzi et al 2007 as shown in 6a and 6b λ α χ and λ χ χ are determined directly from the mean length and volume proportion of each facies types at each scale without a need for hydraulic conductivity data this is in fact a powerful feature of this formulation since facies types can be observed from outcrops stratigraphic data or models or geophysical data the formulation uses more abundant geological and geophysical data than hydraulic conductivity or permeability measurements therefore there is advantage in utilizing geological data to estimate related integral scales within each scale of the stratal hierarchy importantly this overcomes the equivocal aspects of fitting different correlation models to the sample variogram see discussion by woodbury and sudicky 1991 in which it was found that it is unlikely that one can unequivocally distinguish between various competing variogram models from detailed permeability measurements at the borden aquifer also see discussion by ritzi et al 2007 the contribution of each term presented in eq 2 in defining the covariance structure general shape and range were studied by ritzi et al 2004 for fluvial point bar deposit by dai et al 2005 for alluvial deposits and for lakeshore line deposits using data from borden site by ritzi et al 2007 and ritzi et al 2013 in all cases the covariance structure is entirely determined by the cross transition probability structures terms 2c and 2d and minor contributions by auto transition probabilities this means that the exponential like structure of p ro h t ro ji h for cross transition probabilities explain majority of the covariance structure and thus the hierarchical stratal architecture should provide the foundation for better understanding the spatial correlation of attributes controlling solute transport processes in this article we address dilution of non reactive solutes and incorporate effects of local scale dispersion while we hypothesize that cross transition probability structures explain majority of dilution we explore the contribution from auto and cross terms in our semi analytical lagrangian formulation for the solute dilution in order to better study their effects and contributions to dilution and its scaling behavior 3 lagrangian approach for quantifying dilution in the following we provide details regarding the solute transport modeling approach as previously mentioned see section 2 y is spatially variable and modeled as a rsf as an outcome of the spatial variability of y the flow field is heterogeneous for the purpose of our illustrations we consider the following assumptions the flow field under consideration is assumed to be at steady state uniform in the mean along the longitudinal direction in an unbounded domain and in the absence of source and sinks the average longitudinal velocity is given by u furthermore we consider low to mild heterogeneity in y field a non reactive solute is instantaneously released from a point like source the initial concentration of the injected solute is c o transport is at a finite péclet number pe u λ y d d where d d is the local scale dispersion coefficient in the upcoming results local scale dispersion is assumed to be isotropic and constant the constant d d assumption is consistent with the first order approximation in the log conductivity variance fiori 2001 de barros et al 2015 with the goal of reducing the uncertainty associated with y heterogeneity on the concentration estimate fiori 2001 developed the concept of the lagrangian concentration which is defined as 7 c t ξ c v o c o a δ ξ x t t a p t c d a details pertaining to the concept of the lagrangian concentration and its applications can be found in the literature fiori 2001 boso et al 2013 de barros et al 2015 for the sake of completeness we summarize the key ideas behind the lagrangian concentration relevant for our work as described in fiori 2001 the concentration in eq 7 is computed in a mobile system of coordinates ξ x p where p corresponds to the trajectory of the solute particle s centroid which originates from c v o the integration over the source volume v o accounts for all initial particle locations a v o following the work of fiori 2001 a relative solute particle trajectory can be defined in this mobile coordinate system ξ namely w t t a c x t t a p t c using the first order approximation in the log conductivity variance and the point source assumption i e a c 0 the relative solute particle trajectory is characterized by the following moments see details in fiori 2001 8 w t t a c a c 9 w t ii t x t ii t 2 d d t z t ii t where w t and w t ii are the mean and variance respectively w t ii t contains information about the flow field and is described as the separation distance of the trajectory of a particle released at position a relative to the darcy scale center of mass of a parcel centered at c the particle trajectories needed to compute w t ii in eq 9 namely x t ii and z t ii are the one and two particle cross covariance functions fiori and dagan 2000 derivation of x t ii and z t ii for finite péclet numbers pe and uni modal media proposed by fiori and dagan 2000 and are summarized in appendix i in de de barros et al 2015 particle trajectories x t ii in hierarchical and multiscale media for infinite pe numbers i e no dilution are presented in soltanian et al 2015b d the lagrangian concentration concept developed by fiori 2001 has been utilized to study the concentration uncertainty and has been verified against field data and high resolution numerical simulations boso et al 2013 de barros et al 2015 in particular the work of de barros et al 2015 expanded the use of the lagrangian concentration to quantify dilution of a solute cloud the authors derived a semi analytical solution for the time dependent entropy based metric known as dilution index e t proposed by kitanidis 1994 the full derivation of e t for uni modal porous media was presented by de barros et al 2015 importantly de barros et al 2015 verified the semi analytical solution using smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph numerical method to solve for advection dispersion equation and successfully tested it against the cape cod tracer data because our goal is to 1 provide a link between e t and the geologic architecture and 2 to study how physical attributes of sediments at different scales control e t growth rate we expand the semi analytical solution proposed by de barros et al 2015 for hierarchical and multiscale geological media using eq 2 following de barros et al 2015 the semi analytical solution for e t is 10 e t 2 π 2 exp n d 2 i 1 n d w t ii t with n d denoting spatial dimensionality here n d 3 and w t ii is defined in eq 9 using the hierarchical covariance function in eq 2 one can find the following expressions for one particle trajectory second moment x t

the mean velocity assuming that the x 1 direction is aligned with the mean groundwater velocity the j and n are the mean hydraulic gradient and porosity respectively the coefficients ξ vok and η vok can be found in table 1 and are mainly univariate statistics of each covariance term in eq 2 comparing coefficients for ξ vok and η vok in table 1 with rhs terms in eq 2 shows that the sum of v 1 and v 2 terms in eqs 11 and 15 correspond to auto covariance of y weighted by volume proportions and auto transition probabilities therefore v 1 2 are the contributions of auto transition probabilities to dilution and are called auto terms however the v 3 and v 4 correspond to mean differences across facies boundaries at scale i and ii respectively and are weighted by cross transition probabilities therefore v 3 and v 4 are the contribution to the tracer dilution from cross transition probabilities respectively at scale i and ii and are called cross terms note that prior work have used hierarchical correlation models to derive the one particle trajectory covariance x t ii i e measure of spreading by neglecting local scale dispersion see zhang 2002 dai et al 2004 ramanathan et al 2010 soltanian et al 2015d however in eq 11 we incorporated the effect of local scale dispersion and thus eq 11 is a novel expression for x t ii in hierarchical and multiscale media the two particle trajectory cross covariance z t ii in eq 15 for hierarchical and multiscale media has not been derived in prior work both eqs 11 and 15 link particle trajectories to the hierarchical stratal architecture through parameters of the hierarchical covariance model thus the novel expressions derived in this work link the statistics of particle trajectories to quantifiable physical attributes of the sedimentary architecture a detailed derivation of x t ii t and z t ii t for uni modal porous media can be found in de barros et al 2015 and the expressions in eq 11 and eq 15 are obtained by similar derivations for hierarchical media next we evaluate the developed solution for eq 10 by using input parameters estimated from highly resolved data of the cfb borden site see section 4 4 results and discussion in this section we examine how sedimentary architecture controls rates of dilution and what aspects of sedimentary architecture are most important in evaluation of e t and its transient growth rate 4 1 comparison with field data here we follow hierarchical multimodal media of the lake shoreline deposit at cfb borden site see figs 1 and 2 of supplementary materials showing maps of strata at different scales as well as cumulative frequency of y as subdivided into subpopulations by stratal facies type at two scales observed at the borden aquifer following the works of ramanathan et al 2010 ritzi et al 2013 and soltanian et al 2015a b and incorporate indicator integral scales for facies types at each scale of the hierarchy while the spatial bivariate correlation model and the lagrangian based framework are written here for two scales of stratal hierarchy they can easily be extended for any number of scales with any number of sedimentary facies types using covariance models with only cross transition terms terms 2c and 2d ramanathan et al 2010 derived a lagrangian based model for the spreading of non reactive solutes and soltanian et al 2015a b derived models for the transient retardation factor and spreading of the perchloroethene pce cloud for the well known natural gradient tracer experiments conducted at the cfb borden site despite illustrating the applicability of lagrangian based models their studies only considered global quantities related to solute spreading and neglected the effects of local scale dispersion in accordance with the findings in the literature dagan 1989 dagan and fiori 1997 we evaluate the performance of e t by comparing it to field measured data of the natural gradient tracer test at cfb borden site sudicky 1986 mackay et al 1986 roberts et al 1986 we will use available information from original publications as well as recently obtained highly resolved sedimentary architecture data described below the average groundwater velocity is u 0 091 m d to the best of our knowledge fiori and dagan 1999 provided the only estimates of local scale transverse dispersivity α t after careful analysis of field measured concentration data by fitts 1996 there is no data on the local scale longitudinal dispersion α l however α l has a minor effect on x t ii and z t ii fiori and dagan 1999 given this we assumed péclet number is the same in both longitudinal and transverse directions using α t of 0 0005 m as per fiori and dagan 1999 as noted the péclet number is calculated by pe u λ y d d because d d is the local scale transverse dispersivity multiplied by u the péclet number is calculated by pe λ y α t we will perform sensitivity analysis to α t the observed dilution index e t was estimated by thierrin and kitanidis 1994 using interpolation scheme to estimate the edge of the concentration field there are uncertainties in their calculations especially in estimating the extension of the cloud which could affect the e t calculations to our view the borden experiment itself is a single realization and that the lagrangian models represent ensemble behavior among possible realizations from the correlation model therefore our goal in this paper is not to exactly reproduce the observed dilution index of the borden non reactive solute clouds instead we focus on the role of hierarchical and multiscale sedimentary architecture on the time evolution of the dilution index the univariate statistics of y and facies lengths and proportions at different scales that form the parameters of the dilution index model in eq 10 were quantified for the borden site by ritzi et al 2013 the point statistics calculated for y per each facies defined at each hierarchical scale are presented in table 2 note that borden site is the only site for which there is 1 documented high quality tracer data and 2 there is a quantitative characterization of the stratal architecture including proportions and length statistics of facies types as well as univariate statistics of y within each facies type using the data presented in table 2 the horizontal integral scales λ α χ and λ χ χ in eq 6 are computed as 1 19 m and 2 11 m respectively see soltanian et al 2015a b the vertical integral scales λ α χ and λ χ χ are calculated in the same way as 0 09 m and 0 116 m respectively therefore the average anisotropy ratio e is calculated as 0 06 the sample auto and cross transition probability structures of this highly resolved sedimentary architecture data were evaluated by ritzi et al 2013 using about 9800 indicator data see fig 2 in supplementary materials the length statistics reported in table 2 were corrected for bias by ramanathan et al 2010 ritzi et al 2013 showed that the spatial bivariate correlation model in eq 2 match the sample transition probabilities quite well without curve fitting they also found that majority of the sample correlation structure is defined by cross transition probability structures at scales i and ii fig 2 shows the observed and estimated eq 10 time evolution of e t for the borden site the e t has a unit of volume as it measures the aquifer volume occupied by the solute cloud as shown the model with α t of 0 0005 m is in good agreement with the observed dilution index as expected we cannot perfectly match the data also see related discussion by soltanian et al 2015a b at large time the model over predicts the observed data in our view this is in part related to truncation sample locations that did not fully capture the edge of the cloud in both the vertical and the horizontal directions see discussion by rajaram and gelhar 1991 and thierrin and kitanidis 1994 the e t for α t to 0 005 m is also shown in fig 2 it is clear that increasing the α t by a factor ten did not significantly change our results note that there are also some non physical values for e t in the observed data e g time of 680 days in which the e t suddenly decreases thierrin and kitanidis 1994 argued that this is due to poor mass recovery 4 2 theoretical analysis an important point of discussion is with regard to the insight we gain from the model about the dilution process with specific focus here on how e t relates to the hierarchy of stratal architecture fig 3 a shows the contribution from auto v 1 and v 2 and cross v 3 and v 4 terms to e t it is clear that cross terms v 3 and v 4 explain majority of dilution however about 20 30 of cloud dilution is still explained by auto terms v 1 and v 2 this means that as the probability of cross transitioning across different facies increases the solute cloud dilution also increases with time the practicality of our formulation is that it allows identifying and separating the individual effects from each scale of stratal architecture to e t this allows us to quantitatively see which scale of sedimentary architecture is more relevant to dilution process to better visualize the impact of sedimentary architecture on dilution process in fig 3b we show scaling results of e t for all auto and cross terms e t is depicted versus normalized time tu λ y on a logarithmic scale as depicted in fig 3b e t t 1 5 for auto terms v 1 and v 2 for all times the t 1 5 is in fact reflection of homogeneous behavior and similar to early time behavior in heterogeneous media since in such conditions w t ii t t and therefore e t t n d 2 see detailed discussion in kitanidis 1994 and de barros et al 2015 this importantly shows that the variability within facies types at each scales does not result in an enhanced dilution process as shown in fig 3b at intermediate times the scaling for the cross transition related terms at both scales v 3 and v 4 increase to 1 85 this means that the cross transition for facies types at both scales enhance e t at later time after times of about 650 days tu λ y 20 the scaling starts to decrease to about 1 7 until it finally reaches to 1 5 at large time not shown in fig 3b this corresponds to the time at which w t ii t t and macrodispersion reaches its asymptotic value rubin 2003 de barros et al 2015 as a result again e t t n d 2 another interesting point is that the scaling cross terms at larger scale v 4 is identical to the scaling when all model terms are combined black line this means that the relevant terms to identify e t scaling are solely the cross transition terms at larger scales in fig 4 we show the effect of e on e t it is clear that increasing e does not significantly change e t as observed in de de barros et al 2015 the dilution index reduces with increasing values of e fig 5 a shows components of one and two particle trajectory covariances used in calculation of e t in eq 10 it is clear that x t 11 and z t 11 are the largest terms the transverse components e g x t 22 and z t 22 have comparable values but they are all smaller than x t 11 and z t 11 therefore as expected the cloud is mainly stretching in the direction of mean groundwater flow also the cloud slowly increases in size in the vertical direction fig 5b shows the difference between the one and two particle trajectory covariances e g x t 11 z t 11 which are the main terms in w t ii calculations and thus the e t it is evident that x t 11 z t 11 is the major contributor and x t 22 z t 22 and x t 33 z t 33 have smaller roles in eq 10 5 sensitivity study we perform a sensitivity analysis to most important parameters affecting mass transport processes e g macrodispersion found in prior work rubin 1995 zhang 2002 dai et al 2004 deng et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015a this includes the indicator integral scale that controls scale of heterogeneity difference in the mean conductivities that control the overlap between hydraulic conductivity distributions and as a result the velocity contrasts and the volume proportion that controls facies connectivity in order to make our sensitivity study simpler to understand we only use sedimentary architecture data of larger scale level ii of the borden data i e m and fz facies types in this way we simplify the structure to one with a uniform indicator integral scale and two facies types i e bimodal distribution therefore eq 2 is simplified to the form below following prior work zhang 2002 dai et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015d 17a c y h o 1 n p o 2 σ o 2 exp h λ o 17b o 1 n j 1 n p o 1 p j σ o 2 exp h λ o λ i λ o λ i 17c 1 2 o 1 n k 1 n σ o 2 σ j 2 m o m j 2 p o p j exp h λ i where λ i is the indicator integral scale which is found in a two facies system by l r 1 l r 1 l r 2 where l r 1 and l r 2 are mean length of facies types 1 and 2 respectively zhang 2002 dai et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015d 2017 eq 12 matches the covariance derived by zhang 2002 and rubin 1995 for the bimodal facies distribution using the simplified covariance in eq 17 one can easily modify the expressions for one and two particle trajectory covariances x t ii and z t ii as 18 x t ii t v 1 3 o 1 n 4 ξ vok η vok epe π 2 0 dx 0

coefficients ξ vo and η vo in are reported in table 3 5 1 influence of indicator scale to examine the sensitivity of e t to the scale of heterogeneity we fix all parameters related to the larger scale level ii in table 2 and allow λ i to vary we increase λ i to 2 λ i 5 λ i and 10 λ i the results are shown in fig 6 a f among the sensitivity results presented in section 5 e t shows a complex dependency to λ i looking at fig 6a it is clear that increasing λ i from λ i to 2 λ i slightly increases e t this effect is better visualized in the inset of fig 6a interestingly increasing λ i to 5 λ i and 10 λ i results in smaller values for e t at the same time fig 6b shows that the case with 10 λ i has a longer enhanced dilution period of e t t 1 85 and the dilution index continue to grow with this rate and will eventually exceed dilution values of cases with shorter λ i to better understand this behavior we look more closely at eq 9 for the relative trajectory variance w t ii t x t ii t 2 d d t z t ii t used in eq 10 to calculate the dilution index fig 6c e show that the differences between x t 11 and z t 11 are the most important contributors to dilution index calculations the differences between transverse trajectory covariances e g x t 22 and cross covariances e g z t 22 are also important as they scale the e t estimates see eq 10 increasing λ i results in more stretched solute clouds this can be concluded from x t 11 results showing higher x t 11 for larger λ i it is clear that 10 λ i has the maximum stretching this results in smaller amount of transverse spreading i e x t 22 for 10 λ i shown in fig 6d the opposite is true for z t 22 however due to larger z t 11 the difference x t 11 z t 11 is smaller for cases with 5 λ i and 10 λ i and thus e t is smaller while the difference x t 22 z t 22 reaches a relatively constant value at time approximately equal to 1000 days those of other cases continue to increase therefore e t will continue to grow and will eventually exceeds other cases physically this means that in shorter λ i cases the cloud continue to grow in the transverse direction while dispersing in the longitudinal direction this initially causes more mixing and dilution however if λ i is larger the cloud needs to spend more time sampling full scales of heterogeneity and will need to grow more in the longitudinal direction this results in less spreading in the transverse direction the interplay between these effects causes smaller values of e t initially for larger scales of heterogeneities e g 5 λ i and 10 λ i while enhanced dilution occurring 5 2 influence of mean conductivity the contrast in mean conductivity is one of the parameters to which the e t is most sensitive to in borden data shown in table 2 the k m and k fz are 7 85 m d and 3 38 m d respectively we define the ratio of mean conductivities as ρ k m k fz we fixed k fz at 3 38 m d and studied the effect of changing ρ to 0 1 10 and 100 on e t when ρ increases the difference between mean conductivity and the velocity of the m and fz facies increases thus the conductivity probability distributions are more separated the results are shown in fig 7 a d as shown in fig 7a the dilution index increases as the contrast in conductivity between facies m and fz increases fig 7b shows several stages of enhanced dilution scaling due to changes in ρ when ρ is 0 1 both facies do not have high conductivities and enhanced dilution does not occur t 1 5 in the green dotted line the scaling shows t 1 5 which is a reflection of w t ii t t and therefore e t t n d 2 see kitanidis 1994 de barros et al 2015 because the solute cloud is influenced by heterogeneity see one and two particle covariances displayed in fig 7c and d the dilution is mainly controlled by macrodispersion instead of local scale dispersion when the contrast in conductivity is large enhanced dilution could occur with higher scaling for example for ρ of 100 four stages are observed before t 1 5 is obtained i e t 2 2 t 2 t 1 85 and t 1 7 5 3 influence of volume proportion it is known that the volume proportion of high conductivity facies controls the hydrogeological system connectivity as volume proportion of such facies increases the hydrogeological connectivity increases harter 2005 guin and ritzi 2008 gershenzon et al 2015c pescimoro et al 2019 therefore we changed the volume proportion of m facies type p m to 0 1 0 2 and 0 6 the results are shown in fig 8 a d in general as p m increases the e t increases however only slight increase in e t is observed as p m increases from 0 2 to 0 6 this is because there is no significant change in difference between longitudinal trajectory covariances e g x t 11 and cross covariances e g z t 11 which is the main contributor to the dilution see fig 8c for volume proportions of 0 1 and 0 2 dilution enhancement occurs but with a smaller scaling of t 1 7 before it reaches t 1 5 for high volume proportion of 0 6 dilution is enhanced initially to what we usually observed previously i e t 1 85 following scaling of t 1 7 6 concluding remarks in this paper we have developed a new semi analytical solution to quantify the dilution of a solute cloud in a 3d spatially heterogeneous aquifer solute dilution is measured through the entropy based metric denoted as the dilution index introduced by kitanidis 1994 the new derived solution for the dilution index is based on the framework developed in de barros et al 2015 and has been expanded to include sedimentary aquifers displaying a hierarchical and multiscale variability of the hydraulic conductivity similar to de barros et al 2015 the solution is valid for aquifers displaying low to mild levels of heterogeneity small solute injection zones and uniform in the mean flows in the absence of sinks and sources we tested the performance of the new solution with the well documented cfb borden non reactive tracer test standing the complexity of subsurface systems and the influence of spatial variability of hydraulic properties on flow and solute transport there is an increasing need to simplify the aquifer structures and to reduce the model parameterization a preliminary and fundamental prerequisite is a basic science understanding of the role of the aquifer architecture on transport processes such as dispersion and dilution insights gained from this work and prior works on the controlling influence of sedimentary architecture on plume retardation and dispersion ramanathan et al 2010 soltanian et al 2015a b provide such basic understanding furthermore the insights gained at data rich sites such as borden site can provide practical benefits to addressing common challenges created by data limitations in other sites our work provides insights into the relationship between solute dilution and stratal geometries at each scale separating the influence of each scale of sedimentary architecture and identifying the relative contribution of each scale directly enhance our understanding of the dilution process at the borden tracer test our results show that the majority of solute dilution is explained by larger scale facies types of medium sand and fine sand and silt facies types smaller scale facies at scale i explain about one third of the dilution process also the cross transition probabilities between larger scale and binary facies types can capture the temporal scaling of the dilution index however this does not mean that a simple binary medium is sufficient to explain dilution process at all sites rather it shows the applicability of sedimentary architecture data in developing transition probability based models by which one can study and understand what aspects of sedimentary architecture of a given site are important in explaining transport parameters also as noted by soltanian and ritzi 2014 facies classifications are not unique and there is no universal answer to questions over how facies should be defined at any scale and how many scales should be used however at a given site it is useful to integrate sedimentary architecture data into frameworks such as the one proposed here to quantify what aspect of heterogeneity is important in explaining solute transport note that the framework presented here could be applied to any facies classifications the practical advantage of the proposed framework comes from the fact that commonly there are challenges created by data limitations when studying solute transport in groundwater systems because of time effort and cost sedimentary architecture data are more abundant and less uncertain than hydraulic conductivity measurements for instance geologic data can be directly observed in drill cuttings or cores and facies proportions and lengths can be quantified from outcrop exposures cores geophysical transects or inferred from stratigraphic models sun et al 2008 the expressions for the dilution index presented in this work rely only on the data containing information related to the geologic architecture without the traditional curve fitting procedure for estimating the conductivity integral scale therefore there is strong practical advantage in being able to directly use geologic data in evaluating transport processes at sites with limited data given that the cross transition probability explains majority of solute dilution and its rate of growth it is most important to represent such transitions through incorporating more geologic data into solute transport models note that the solute spreading analysis carried out by sudicky 1986 at the borden site involved determining the permeability correlation structure with use of 1279 data almost an order of magnitude more in number than the number of permeability data used to develop the sample covariance in this study see ritzi et al 2013 this is because the multiscale covariance model is based on the indicator data and only univariate statistics for permeability are required therefore the permeability data requirements are significantly reduced we encourage the readers to see ritzi and soltanian 2015 for further discussions also in a recent work dai et al 2020 showed what level of sedimentary architecture data is required to better explain plume dispersion the framework presented is computationally cheap while keeping a functional analytical relationship between the dilution index and key features that are commonly characterized in a given site given its analytical feature the proposed solution can be used for parametric sensitivity analysis finally the developed expressions for the dilution index is currently being extended to account for relevant geochemical reactions in hydrogeological systems displaying
