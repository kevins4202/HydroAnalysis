11545,phosphorus p is essential for various metabolic activities in plants and plays an extremely important role in crop development yield and quality organic p fertilizers can provide sustainable p and maintain agroecosystem health however the uptake of soil organic p by plants is significantly influenced by soil phosphatase activities the objective of this study was to quantify the effects of different layout measures film covering drip irrigation line density and irrigation lower limits in drip irrigation with film mulch on the soil phosphatase activity culturable microorganism populations and crop growth and yield in a greenhouse the results show that the greatest levels of soil alkaline phosphatase activity were observed with an irrigation lower limit of 80 a field capacity of 50 and film mulch covering but were relatively insensitive to the drip irrigation line density soil alkaline phosphatase activity was also significantly correlated with the root growth and culturable microbial populations specifically soil alkaline phosphatase activity was positively correlated with the actinomycete population and root activity but negatively correlated with root volume and root area these results can be used to improve crop production in greenhouse conditions in china keywords film mulching mode drip irrigation irrigation lower limits soil alkaline phosphatase root activity soil microorganisms 1 introduction phosphorus p is essential for various metabolic activities in plants and plays an extremely important role in crop development yield and quality attiwill and adams 1993 chapin et al 1994 kramer and douglas 2000 however the excessive input of inorganic phosphate fertilizer to enhance production in agriculture results in soil environmental problems such as soil p accumulation leaching and eutrophication vaneeckhaute et al 2016 these problems are more serious in greenhouse soils because of the continuous cropping and high use of inorganic phosphate fertilizer used in a short period to maximize economic benefits liang et al 2013 which not only damages agroecosystem functions and the long term sustainability of food production but also human health norse and ju 2015 the use of organic p fertilizers in agricultural production has increased annually because they can provide sustainable p teixeira et al 2016 and reduce the damages of p residues in soil however organic p fertilizers must first be converted to inorganic p i e phosphate to be taken up by plants a reaction facilitated by soil phosphatase i e phosphate firsching and claassen 1996 tarafdar and claassen 1988 therefore soil phosphatase activity has an important influence on the availability of p to plants the effectiveness of organic p fertilizers and soil p cycling soil phosphatase is excreted from plant roots and microbial cells many studies have shown that microbial cells are the main source of soil phosphatase and have a large influence on soil phosphatase activity grierson and adams 2000 nannipieri et al 2002 tabatabai and dick 2002 speir and ross 1978 some studies have observed that plant roots can directly or indirectly affect soil phosphatase levels through the secretion of extracellular enzymes that stimulate soil microbial activity speir and ross 1978 some studies have investigated the practice of inoculating the soil immediately surrounding plant roots with microorganisms to improve soil phosphatase activity boddington and dodd 1999 abdel fattah 1997 but the effects of this practice on soil enzyme activities were limited tarafdar and claassen 1988 or undermined the original soil micro ecological balance therefore the widespread use of this practice was deemed infeasible application of plant growth regulators i e hormones to the soil can also improve phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere by regulating root growth and improving the soil microenvironment li et al 2004a 2004b 2004c but residual levels of these growth regulators may cause adverse effects on the soil ecological environment the growth of soil microorganisms and plant roots are affected and constrained by soil aeration water content and temperature which also directly affect the state and strength of soil enzyme activity hojeong and freeman 1999 zornoza et al 2006 tiwari et al 1989 frankenburger et al 1983 therefore environmental conditions that improve soil phosphatase activity likely promote the uptake of p by plants dodor and tabatabai 2003 chander et al 1997 li et al 2001 some investigations have reported that film mulch and irrigation management can affect soil aeration water content and temperature and produce changes in soil microorganism populations and enzyme levels chen et al 1998 gramss et al 1999 guo et al 1995 li et al 2004a b c mi et al 2005 but most research to date has mainly focused on the primary effects of film mulches and irrigation management with less emphasis on the interactions between these two factors in addition although most previous studies on soil enzymes have mainly focused on field crops greenhouse production offers many opportunities for the intensive management of the factors affecting soil enzyme activities greenhouse crops have short growth cycles and the soil water and temperature regimes in greenhouses are very different than those in the field soil phosphatase activity is vital to address early phosphorus deficiency in crops because the p uptake during early growth stages is more important to the crop development and yield potential than uptake during very late growth stages grant et al 2001 song 2008 therefore the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of different layout measures film covering drip irrigation line density and irrigation lower limits in drip irrigation with plastic film mulch on the soil phosphatase soil microbes and crop root growth in greenhouse raised crops during the flowering and fruit bearing periods the main objective of this work is to quantify the effects of film mulching and irrigation management on soil phosphatase activity soil microbial populations and crop root growth to support management practice decisions and efficient water use for greenhouse melon production 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design three factors plastic film mulch drip irrigation line density and irrigation low limits were evaluated in the experiment the plastic film mulch p factor had three levels fig 1 1 full film cover pf 2 half film cover ph and 3 bare soil no film cover pn for the full cover condition pf the film mulch covered the furrow ridge inter row and rows of the cultivated area for the half cover condition ph only the furrow and ridges of the cultivated area were covered for the bare soil condition pn none of the cultivated area was covered the plastic film produced by the xinfeng plastic factory in jingjiang city jiangsu province was white low density polyethylene 0 014mm thick and pervious to light the drip irrigation line density factor also had three levels fig 2 1 1 line per plant row t1 1 2 3 lines per 4 rows t3 4 and 3 1 line per 2 rows t1 2 for the high density level t1 1 the drip irrigation line was placed directly adjacent to the plant rows for the medium density level t3 4 3 drip irrigation lines were placed in the middle of every 4 inter row spaces resulting in 30cm between each plant and the irrigation line for the low density level t1 2 drip irrigation lines were placed between two plant rows the drip irrigation lines produced by the gansu dayu water saving group co ltd were flat insert type drip lines with an outside diameter of 16mm a wall thickness of 0 3mm a drop head distance of 30cm a working pressure of 0 10mpa and a drip flow rate of 1 2l h the irrigation lower limit factor was also divided into 3 levels 1 60 l60 2 70 l70 and 3 80 l80 of the field capacity f corresponding to the upper limits of 65 f 75 f 85 f respectively soil moisture was monitored by a field tdr 200 moisture probe spectrum company usa which was inserted into 100 cm long access tubes installed in the middle of every test area to measure the soil moisture content at 10 cm intervals to a maximum depth of 60cm additional soil moisture measurements on soil core samples were conducted after each irrigation using the oven drying gravimetric method when the soil water content reached the lower soil water limits irrigation was applied to bring the top 40cm to the target soil water content 65 75 or 85 of field capacity assuming a 95 irrigation efficiency irrigation amounts were calculated with the following formula m sρbphθf q 1 q 2 η where m represents the irrigation water amount m3 s represents the wet area 4 6m2 ρb represents the soil bulk density 1 35 g m 3 p represents

irrigation upper limit and the measured soil moisture content respectively field capacity f and η represents irrigation efficiency which is assumed to be equal to 0 95 the experiment was planned with an orthogonal design and the l9 34 orthogonal table was used to derive the following 9 orthogonal treatments pft1 1 l80 treatment 1 pn t1 2 l70 treatment 2 pn t3 4 l80 treatment 3 pht1 2 l80 treatment

measurement experiment was carried from april july 2014 in a sunlit plastic greenhouse in the da zhai village of the da zhai township in shaanxi province 34 16 n 108 08 e 521 asl the experimental soil had a loess parent material and was collected from the yangling region of shaanxi province with a bulk density of 1 35gcm 3 field capacity of 28 2 gravimetric and ph of 7 82 the soil contained 25 4 gravel 2 0 02mm 44 1 silt 0 02 0 002mm and 30 5 clay 0 002mm with a total porosity value of 49 38 the soil ph was 8 21 the greenhouse was 108m long from the east to the west and 8m wide from the north to the south the planting crop was melon double ridged mounds which were 5 7m long by 0 8m wide by 0 2m high with a 0 4m ridge groove were created and 30 melon plants were planted in each mound in paired rows separated by 0 6m protection lines were placed at both ends of the greenhouse 2 2 measurement of response variables 2 2 1 soil temperature and ph soil temperature was measured with a geothermometer inserted in the 5 10 15 20 and 25cm soil layers in the center of each plot the soil temperature values were measured at 10 00 a m every 5days soil ph was measured with a phb 4ph meter for soil samples that were collected during the melon seedling blossoming and fruit bearing growth stages 2 2 2 soil alkaline phosphatase the average measured soil ph was 8 21 therefore the rhizosphere alkaline phosphatase was measured the rhizosphere soil from 0 to 30cm below the surface of three melon plants was collected during the crop flowering and fruit bearing periods first the above ground portion of the plants was cut off and then the soil was collected from a 50cm 40cm 35cm excavation bordering the midpoint between two rows the majority of the soil surrounding the roots was removed and the remaining soil still adhering to the roots was shaken off onto clean filter papers that had been sterilized in advance and then taken to the lab in the lab any fine root fragments or hairs were removed by sterile tweezers on a sterile test bench and the remaining soil was considered to be rhizosphere soil and used for further analysis smalla et al 2001 the fresh soil samples were refrigerated at 4 c soil phosphatase activity was measured using the phenyl phosphate disodium colorimetric method boldt burisch and naeth 2017 2 2 3 root growth the roots from an additional three crop plants were excavated in this case the above ground parts of the plant were removed and the soil and roots from an area of 50cm 40cm to the maximum rooting depth approximately 50cm was excavated soil was shaken off the roots and discarded and the root samples were placed into mesh bags 0 5mm orifices the root samples were soaked in water in the laboratory and then rinsed with water to completely remove the soil from the roots fine roots were prevented from going down the drain of the wash basin by three layers of cheese cloth covering the drain the fine roots were removed from the drain trap using tweezers and placed into a clean plastic bag the root samples were scanned with a double sided scanner epson expression 1600 pro model eu 35 japan and analyzed for total root length cm and root surface area cm2 using the winrhizo image analysis system winrhizo pro2004b 5 0 canada some root samples were taken to determine the root activity using the ttc method zhao et al 2014 2 2 4 soil microorganisms rhizosphere soil suspensions were prepared with sterile water the rhizosphere culturable fungi bacteria and actinomycetes were estimated with the plate dilution method in beef extract peptone the improved gause s no 1 growth media and mardin s media respectively huang et al 2012 media plates were incubated at 37 c and 25 c and the number of colonies after approximately 3 5days was counted 2 2 5 phosphorus content in plant dry matter after the fruit harvest of the crops fresh plant and root samples from different test treatments were collected dried in an oven at 75 c and weighed the phosphorus content in dry plant roots stems leaves and fruit samples were measured with sulfuric acid perchloric acid and molybdenum antimony digests using the colorimetric method kobayashi and nakamura 2007 3 data analyses data were analyzed using spss version 22 0 software the normality and homogeneity of the dates of each response variable was tested before the statistical analysis the significance of the differences between the treatments for each response variable was evaluated using main effects analysis of variance anova the interactions and ranges were also analyzed pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the linear relationships between the response variables 4 results 4 1 soil temperature and ph the influences of the experimental factors on the average soil temperature and ph are shown in table 1 the mulch irrigation lower limits and irrigation line density conditions had some statistically significant effects on the soil temperature and ph full film cover pf and 80 f increased the soil temperature by 4 45 and 5 18 respectively compared to conditions with bare soil pn and 70 f 60 f increased the soil ph by 0 84 and 0 96 compared to 70 f and 80 f respectively and under t1 soil ph increased by 1 32 and 1 56 compared to t3 4 and t1 2 respectively but the magnitude of these effects was small 4 2 soil alkaline phosphatase all three factors and their two way interactions pxt pxl and txl had significant effects on the soil alkaline phosphatase activity table 2 the range analysis showed that the soil alkaline phosphatase activity was most sensitive to changes in the irrigation lower limits followed by changes in film covering and drip irrigation line density for both the irrigation lower limit and irrigation line density soil alkaline phosphatase activity was relatively high at the low level decreased at the intermediate level and then increased again at the high level the maximum soil alkaline phosphatase activity was observed at 80 f followed by the activity at 60 f whereas the lowest values were observed at 70 f the alkaline phosphatase activities at 80 f and 60 f were 33 26 and 18 39 greater respectively than those at 70 f for the irrigation line density the lowest soil alkaline phosphatase activity occurred under t3 4 and it decreased by 15 22 and 15 48 under t1 and t1 2 respectively for the film covering the maximum soil alkaline phosphatase activity was observed under the half film cover condition ph followed by the no film cover condition whereas its lowest values were observed with full film covering the soil alkaline phosphatase activities under half and no film cover were 18 56 and 7 84 greater respectively than that under full film cover based on these observations the highest alkaline phosphatase activities were associated with half film cover 80 f and 1 irrigation line per paired row with slightly lower activities when f was 60 instead of 80 4 3 soil microorganisms the soil microorganism populations were significantly affected by all the three factors and their two way interactions pxt pxl and txl table 3 the most abundant culturable soil microorganisms under the greenhouse conditions were bacteria followed by actinomyces and fungi the range analysis showed that the film covering factor had the greatest influence on the culturable soil bacteria followed by the irrigation lower limits and drip irrigation line density factors the culturable actinomycetes were most affected by the irrigation lower limit factor followed by the film covering and drip irrigation line density factors the culturable fungi populations were most affected by the drip irrigation line density factor followed by the irrigation lower limit and film cover factors the number of culturable bacteria increased with decreasing film cover table 3 but the actinomycetes and fungi were most abundant under the half cover level and the least abundant under the no cover level with respect to the irrigation lower limit the abundance of the culturable actinomycetes decreased from 60 f to 70 f and increased under 80 f the maximum abundance which was 1 91 and 4 07 times higher than that under 60 f and 70 f respectively was observed at 80 f the abundance of fungi increased as the irrigation lower limit increased thus the maximum abundance of fungi was observed at 80 f and it was 65 84 and 51 12 higher than that at 70 f and 60 f respectively for bacteria the maximum abundance observed at 60 f was 39 03 and 93 34 higher than the abundances at 80 f and 70 f respectively with the reduction of irrigation line density the abundances of the bacteria and actinomycetes decreased and the fungi increased in number the largest numbers of bacteria and actinomycetes were observed when the drip irrigation line density was the greatest t1 followed by the numbers under t3 4 and t1 2 the bacteria populations of the t1 factor increased by 18 69 and 77 66 compared to those under t3 4 and t1 2 respectively and the actinomycetes populations of the t1 factor increased by 52 82 and 78 77 compared to those under t3 4 and t1 2 respectively conversely the maximum number of fungi was observed at the lowest drip irrigation line density t1 2 which was 61 36 and 82 06 higher than the numbers under t3 4 and t1 respectively for the abundances of culturable microorganisms the half film cover 80 f and t1 factors best promoted the soil microbial quantities therefore an arrangement using the 60 f and t3 4 factors represents a suboptimal choice 4 4 root growth table 4 shows that root length root volume root area and root activity were significantly affected by the film covering irrigation lower limit and drip irrigation line density factors as well as the two way interactions pxt pxl and txl the range analysis showed that the irrigation lower limit factor followed by the film covering and irrigation line density factors had the greatest effect on root length and area the film covering factor followed by the drip irrigation line density and irrigation lower limit factors had the greatest effect on root volume the irrigation lower limit factor followed by the drip irrigation line density and film cover factors had the greatest effect on root activity with increases in the irrigation lower limits the root length and area decreased however the root volume increased from the lowest to the intermediate irrigation lower limit and then it decreased at the highest limit the root activity decreased from the lowest and the intermediate irrigation lower limit and then it increased at the highest limit the maximum root length was observed at 60 f which was 1 80 and 3 75 times higher than the values under 70 f and 80 f respectively similarly the maximum root area was also observed at 60 f and which was 19 98 and 100 41 higher than that under 70 f and 80 f respectively in contrast the maximum root activity was observed at 80 f which was 4 49 and 4 89 times greater than that under 60 f and 70 f respectively with decreasing drip irrigation line density root length and root activity decreased from the low to the intermediate factor levels and then they increased at the highest level the but root area and root volume displayed the opposite trend the maximum root length root area root volume and root activity values were observed at the t1 2 t3 4 t3 4 and t1 2 levels respectively for the film cover factor the root length root volume and root area decreased between the full and half cover conditions and then they increased under the no cover condition the maximum root length and area values were observed under full film cover pf and the lowest values were observed under half film cover ph the root length under pf was 2 10 and 1 55 times greater than that under ph and pn respectively and the root area under pf increased by 68 74 and 18 50 compared to that under ph and pn respectively the maximum root volume was observed under no film cover and was 54 19 and 96 24 greater than that under full and half film cover respectively the maximum root activity occurred under full film cover and it was 1 49 and 2 24 times greater than that under half and no cover respectively given the variable responses of the various root characteristics full film cover 60 f and medium drip irrigation line density t3 4 appear to be best combination of factors to promote root growth 4 5 correlation analysis to explore the relationships between the levels of soil alkaline phosphatase activity microorganisms and root growth a simple correlation analysis was carried out and the results are shown in table 5 the results show that the soil phosphatase was significantly and positively correlated with root activity and actinomycetes and some of the root growth characteristics were correlated to each other root length and root area were strongly positively correlated r 0849 and root volume and root area were weakly positively correlated r 0 449 and significantly negatively correlated with root activity r 0489 r 0 610 among microorganisms there was a significant negative correlation between bacteria and actinomycetes culturable actinomycetes had a significant negative correlation with root length root area and root volume but had positive correlation with root activity 5 discussion 5 1 half film covering improved the soil phosphatase activity by optimizing the soil microorganism composition the response patterns to the film cover levels coupled with their ranges and the correlation analysis can be used to determine best film cover practices to optimize soil alkaline phosphatase activities soil microorganism abundances and root growth the maximum number of actinomycetes and soil alkaline phosphatase activity occurred under ph as shown in table 2 a result that is consistent with the strong correlation between the actinomycetes abundances and soil alkaline phosphatase activity root activity was also significantly correlated with alkaline phosphatase activity and actinomycete abundance but it was not very sensitive to the film cover level therefore the response pattern of the root activity to the film cover conditions differed from that of actinomycete abundance and phosphatase activity table 2 root activity was best promoted through the management of the irrigation lower limit table 4 therefore half film covering appears to be the optimal choice for the promotion of soil alkaline phosphatase activity and actinomycete abundance although optimal for alkaline phosphatase activity and the abundance of actinomycetes the half film cover condition was suboptimal for bacterial abundance compared with nofilm covering half film covering limited the growth of the bacteria to a certain degree but it significantly promoted the growth of the actinomyces and fungi therefore it optimized the total soil microbial community composition and increases in actinomycete abundance could significantly improve the soil phosphatase activity table 4 reducing the abundance of bacteria and fungi to maximize the amounts of alkaline phosphatase and actinomycetes is likely to be an acceptable trade off depending on greenhouse management goals in addition the higher root activity that was maintained by the half film covering factor also increased the soil phosphatase activity hu and li 2003 and plant water uptake dai and dong 2014 further the half film covering ph and 80 f created conditions that promoted minimum to median values of root length area and volume which is an acceptable outcome if the goal is increased alkaline phosphatase activity these patterns might occur because half film covering appears to be a good compromise that creates favorable soil water aeration and temperature conditions maintaining a direct connection between the soil surface and the atmosphere in locations that are not entirely covered by the film enhances aeration and promotes the exchange of gases perhaps thereby promoting a balance of soil water and temperature that is favorable to the growth of microorganisms and root activity however the no film cover condition may create good soil permeability and be beneficial to the growth of aerobic bacteria with fast metabolic rates in the soil and the elevated bacterial growth could squeeze the ecological niche of the actinomycetes and inhibit their growth which is not conducive to the improvement of soil phosphatase activity table 4 in addition the full film covering factor might prevent gas exchanges between the soil and atmosphere and prevent soil reducing gases such as co2 from discharging in time gao et al 2014 thus increasing the anaerobic factors in the soil and producing harmful factors for the growth of actinomycetes which would lower the soil phosphatase activity during a study on maize yongchun song et al found that soil phosphatase activity could be significantly increased by inoculating the maize rhizosphere with mycorrhizal fungi but the impact was limited song et al 2001 the results in this paper suggest that proper management of soil moisture and film cover choice can enhance soil phosphatase activities and the native microorganism populations without an artificial inoculation of the rhizosphere 5 2 irrigation lower limits affected soil phosphatase activity by changing root growth and root activity the soil alkaline phosphatase culturable actinomycete and root activities all showed the same response patterns to the irrigation factor levels with minimum values occurring at 70 f and maximum values occurring at 80 f importantly the alkaline phosphatase activities at 80 f and 60 f were 33 26 and 18 39 greater respectively than those at 70 f previous studies observed that root activity was negatively correlated to bulk density and increasing root activity could promote soil loosening and enhance aeration water availability and root respiration sun et al 2005 li et al 2005 wang and sun 2015 observed that root activity promoted the growth of actinomycetes and other microbes which also directly promoted the soil phosphatase wang and sun 2015 the experiment results that are presented in this paper show that actinomycetes abundance was significantly and positively correlated to root activity therefore 80 f may increase soil phosphatase activity by improving root activity however compared to the activity at 80 f there was no difference in the soil alkaline phosphatase activity at 60 f although the root activity at 60 f was significantly lower than that at 80 f this may be because 60 f had the maximum root length and root area values which would greatly increase root secretions and these secretions significantly promote soil alkaline phosphatase activities li et al 2014 the negative relationship between root activity and actinomycete abundance and root volume and root area table 5 are likely because the dry soil conditions that promoted increased root volume and root area via increased aeration simultaneously inhibited root activity yang et al 2009 with the increase in soil moisture root area decreased but root activity increased perhaps more resources were devoted to increasing the root biomass under low water availability i e low irrigation limits in order to meet the plant water demand and as a result there was less energy available for root activity graham 1984 and the dry conditions with low root activity caused the actinomycete populations to decrease the culturable fungi also showed increased numbers under wetter soil conditions higher lower limits and a weak positive correlation not significant to root activity the increase in fungi could be beneficial to the decomposition of organic matter in the soil which may have promoted the growth of actinomycetes marcus et al 1997 therefore the growth of actinomycetes increased the soil phosphatase activity ghorbani nasrabadi et al 2013 bacteria were the least sensitive group to soil water content which is consistent with their very low correlation to phosphatase activity and negative correlation to actinomycete and root activities table 5 some research has found that high irrigation levels can significantly reduce the soil phosphatase activity of tomato plants for example mi et al 2005 found that high irrigation rates significantly reduced the soil phosphatase activity of tomato crops which is inconsistent with the results in this paper this is likely because the highest irrigation amount in their test was 4541m3 hm 2 which is higher than the 1996m3 hm 2 level used in this study therefore the soil was much wetter and as a result aeration was low at field capacity causing a low rate of gas exchange with the atmosphere and potentially anaerobic conditions gao et al 2014 which may have reduced the soil microbial growth and root activity thus reducing the soil enzyme activity 5 3 irrigation line density minimally affected soil phosphatase activity the soil culturable fungi were slightly more sensitive to the drip irrigation line density factor than to the film cover and irrigation lower limit factors fungi abundances were not highly correlated to the phosphatase activity other microorganisms or root activity but they could be associated with other factors i e nutrient and water uptake through mycorrhizal associations that were not measured in this study because the phosphatase activity bacteria actinomycetes abundance and root activity were not very sensitive to the drip irrigation line density there is no large compromise involved in choosing a drip irrigation line density that favors fungi over the other variables as a result the t1 2 condition favors maximum fungi abundance maximum root activity intermediate phosphatase activity and minimum actinomycete abundance however the actinomycetes were less sensitive to drip irrigation line density than the other measured characteristics so the t1 2 condition in combination with half film covering and 80 f may be an acceptable choice 5 4 optimal conditions for soil alkaline phosphatase activity culturable microorganisms root activity phosphorus uptake and crop growth based on the above discussion the half film covering h 80 f and t1 2 drip irrigation line density factors resulted in an optimal combination for soil alkaline phosphatase activity to verify the recommended scheme the phosphorus uptake of the melons is shown in table 6 and the response of the melon yield fruit and plants to the experimental factors was analyzed with the results shown in table 7 table 6 shows that the full and half film covering significantly improved the phosphorus uptake level in melon roots leaves and fruit compared to no film covering the fruit mass ratio could be remarkably enhanced by using half film covering instead of full film covering the t1 2 level could increase not only the phosphorus uptake level in melon fruit but also the fruit mass ratio the 60 f and 80 f conditions could promote phosphorus uptake level in melon roots leaves and fruit more than 70 f table 7 shows that the yield single fruit weight pulp thickness and fresh weight of above ground biomass were the highest under the half film cover h condition the t1 2 level favored the maximum yield and single fruit weight values and intermediate pulp thickness and fresh weight of ground plant values the 80 f condition favored maximum yield single fruit weight and fresh weight of ground plant values and an intermediate pulp thickness value therefore the agronomic arrangement recommendations in this paper are verified by increased melon yield 6 conclusion this paper found that different factors film covering drip irrigation line density and irrigation lower limits had complicated effects on soil phosphatase activity fig 3 however a combination of half film covering h 80 f and t1 2 drip irrigation line density factors resulted in optimal values of root area root volume root activity actinomycete abundances and soil alkaline phosphatase activity further these measurements were verified by observations that phosphorus uptake and crop yield were optimized under the optimal conditions therefore we suggest that arrangements using these agronomic factors should be used when planting under greenhouse conditions acknowledgments this work is

management can affect soil aeration water content and temperature and produce changes in soil microorganism populations and enzyme levels chen et al 1998 gramss et al 1999 guo et al 1995 li et al 2004a b c mi et al 2005 but most research to date has mainly focused on the primary effects of film mulches and irrigation management with less emphasis on the interactions between these two factors in addition although most previous studies on soil enzymes have mainly focused on field crops greenhouse production offers many opportunities for the intensive management of the factors affecting soil enzyme activities greenhouse crops have short growth cycles and the soil water and temperature regimes in greenhouses are very different than those in the field soil phosphatase activity is vital to address early phosphorus deficiency in crops because the p uptake during early growth stages is more important to the crop development and yield potential than uptake during very late growth stages grant et al 2001 song 2008 therefore the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of different layout measures film covering drip irrigation line density and irrigation lower limits in drip irrigation with plastic film mulch on the soil phosphatase soil microbes and crop root growth in greenhouse raised crops during the flowering and fruit bearing periods the main objective of this work is to quantify the effects of film mulching and irrigation management on soil phosphatase activity soil microbial populations and crop root growth to support management practice decisions and efficient water use for greenhouse melon production 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design three factors plastic film mulch drip irrigation line density and irrigation low limits were evaluated in the experiment the plastic film mulch p factor had three levels fig 1 1 full film cover pf 2 half film cover ph and 3 bare soil no film cover pn for the full cover condition pf the film mulch covered the furrow ridge inter row and rows of the cultivated area for the half cover condition ph only the furrow and ridges of the cultivated area were covered for the bare soil condition pn none of the cultivated area was covered the plastic film produced by the xinfeng plastic factory in jingjiang city jiangsu province was white low density polyethylene 0 014mm thick and pervious to light the drip irrigation line density factor also had three levels fig 2 1 1 line per plant row t1 1 2 3 lines per 4 rows t3 4 and 3 1 line per 2 rows t1 2 for the high density level t1 1 the drip irrigation line was placed directly adjacent to the plant rows for the medium density level t3 4 3 drip irrigation lines were placed in the middle of every 4 inter row spaces resulting in 30cm between each plant and the irrigation line for the low density level t1 2 drip irrigation lines were placed between two plant rows the drip irrigation lines produced by the gansu dayu water saving group co ltd were flat insert type drip lines with an outside diameter of 16mm a wall thickness of 0 3mm a drop head distance of 30cm a working pressure of 0 10mpa and a drip flow rate of 1 2l h the irrigation lower limit factor was also divided into 3 levels 1 60 l60 2 70 l70 and 3 80 l80 of the field capacity f corresponding to the upper limits of 65 f 75 f 85 f respectively soil moisture was monitored by a field tdr 200 moisture probe spectrum company usa which was inserted into 100 cm long access tubes installed in the middle of every test area to measure the soil moisture content at 10 cm intervals to a maximum depth of 60cm additional soil moisture measurements on soil core samples were conducted after each irrigation using the oven drying gravimetric method when the soil water content reached the lower soil water limits irrigation was applied to bring the top 40cm to the target soil water content 65 75 or 85 of field capacity assuming a 95 irrigation efficiency irrigation amounts were calculated with the following formula m sρbphθf q 1 q 2 η where m represents the irrigation water amount m3 s represents the wet area 4 6m2 ρb represents the soil bulk density 1 35 g m 3 p represents the soil wetness ratio 0 8 h represents the depth of the wetting layer 0 4m θf represents the maximum value of the field water holding capacity i e field capacity 31 54 q 1 and q 2 represent the irrigation upper limit and the measured soil moisture content respectively field capacity f and η represents irrigation efficiency which is assumed to be equal to 0 95 the experiment was planned with an orthogonal design and the l9 34 orthogonal table was used to derive the following 9 orthogonal treatments pft1 1 l80 treatment 1 pn t1 2 l70 treatment 2 pn t3 4 l80 treatment 3 pht1 2 l80 treatment 4 pft1 2 l60 treatment 5 pft3 4 l70 treatment 6 pnt1 1l60 treatment 7 pht3 4 l60 treatment 8 pht1 1l70 treatment 9 each treatment was replicated 3 times resulting in 27 test plots the layout measurement experiment was carried from april july 2014 in a sunlit plastic greenhouse in the da zhai village of the da zhai township in shaanxi province 34 16 n 108 08 e 521 asl the experimental soil had a loess parent material and was collected from the yangling region of shaanxi province with a bulk density of 1 35gcm 3 field capacity of 28 2 gravimetric and ph of 7 82 the soil contained 25 4 gravel 2 0 02mm 44 1 silt 0 02 0 002mm and 30 5 clay 0 002mm with a total porosity value of 49 38 the soil ph was 8 21 the greenhouse was 108m long from the east to the west and 8m wide from the north to the south the planting crop was melon double ridged mounds which were 5 7m long by 0 8m wide by 0 2m high with a 0 4m ridge groove were created and 30 melon plants were planted in each mound in paired rows separated by 0 6m protection lines were placed at both ends of the greenhouse 2 2 measurement of response variables 2 2 1 soil temperature and ph soil temperature was measured with a geothermometer inserted in the 5 10 15 20 and 25cm soil layers in the center of each plot the soil temperature values were measured at 10 00 a m every 5days soil ph was measured with a phb 4ph meter for soil samples that were collected during the melon seedling blossoming and fruit bearing growth stages 2 2 2 soil alkaline phosphatase the average measured soil ph was 8 21 therefore the rhizosphere alkaline phosphatase was measured the rhizosphere soil from 0 to 30cm below the surface of three melon plants was collected during the crop flowering and fruit bearing periods first the above ground portion of the plants was cut off and then the soil was collected from a 50cm 40cm 35cm excavation bordering the midpoint between two rows the majority of the soil surrounding the roots was removed and the remaining soil still adhering to the roots was shaken off onto clean filter papers that had been sterilized in advance and then taken to the lab in the lab any fine root fragments or hairs were removed by sterile tweezers on a sterile test bench and the remaining soil was considered to be rhizosphere soil and used for further analysis smalla et al 2001 the fresh soil samples were refrigerated at 4 c soil phosphatase activity was measured using the phenyl phosphate disodium colorimetric method boldt burisch and naeth 2017 2 2 3 root growth the roots from an additional three crop plants were excavated in this case the above ground parts of the plant were removed and the soil and roots from an area of 50cm 40cm to the maximum rooting depth approximately 50cm was excavated soil was shaken off the roots and discarded and the root samples were placed into mesh bags 0 5mm orifices the root samples were soaked in water in the laboratory and then rinsed with water to completely remove the soil from the roots fine roots were prevented from going down the drain of the wash basin by three layers of cheese cloth covering the drain the fine roots were removed from the drain trap using tweezers and placed into a clean plastic bag the root samples were scanned with a double sided scanner epson expression 1600 pro model eu 35 japan and analyzed for total root length cm and root surface area cm2 using the winrhizo image analysis system winrhizo pro2004b 5 0 canada some root samples were taken to determine the root activity using the ttc method zhao et al 2014 2 2 4 soil microorganisms rhizosphere soil suspensions were prepared with sterile water the rhizosphere culturable fungi bacteria and actinomycetes were estimated with the plate dilution method in beef extract peptone the improved gause s no 1 growth media and mardin s media respectively huang et al 2012 media plates were incubated at 37 c and 25 c and the number of colonies after approximately 3 5days was counted 2 2 5 phosphorus content in plant dry matter after the fruit harvest of the crops fresh plant and root samples from different test treatments were collected dried in an oven at 75 c and weighed the phosphorus content in dry plant roots stems leaves and fruit samples were measured with sulfuric acid perchloric acid and molybdenum antimony digests using the colorimetric method kobayashi and nakamura 2007 3 data analyses data were analyzed using spss version 22 0 software the normality and homogeneity of the dates of each response variable was tested before the statistical analysis the significance of the differences between the treatments for each response variable was evaluated using main effects analysis of variance anova the interactions and ranges were also analyzed pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the linear relationships between the response variables 4 results 4 1 soil temperature and ph the influences of the experimental factors on the average soil temperature and ph are shown in table 1 the mulch irrigation lower limits and irrigation line density conditions had some statistically significant effects on the soil temperature and ph full film cover pf and 80 f increased the soil temperature by 4 45 and 5 18 respectively compared to conditions with bare soil pn and 70 f 60 f increased the soil ph by 0 84 and 0 96 compared to 70 f and 80 f respectively and under t1 soil ph increased by 1 32 and 1 56 compared to t3 4 and t1 2 respectively but the magnitude of these effects was small 4 2 soil alkaline phosphatase all three factors and their two way interactions pxt pxl and txl had significant effects on the soil alkaline phosphatase activity table 2 the range analysis showed that the soil alkaline phosphatase activity was most sensitive to changes in the irrigation lower limits followed by changes in film covering and drip irrigation line density for both the irrigation lower limit and irrigation line density soil alkaline phosphatase activity was relatively high at the low level decreased at the intermediate level and then increased again at the high level the maximum soil alkaline phosphatase activity was observed at 80 f followed by the activity at 60 f whereas the lowest values were observed at 70 f the alkaline phosphatase activities at 80 f and 60 f were 33 26 and 18 39 greater respectively than those at 70 f for the irrigation line density the lowest soil alkaline phosphatase activity occurred under t3 4 and it decreased by 15 22 and 15 48 under t1 and t1 2 respectively for the film covering the maximum soil alkaline phosphatase activity was observed under the half film cover condition ph followed by the no film cover condition whereas its lowest values were observed with full film covering the soil alkaline phosphatase activities under half and no film cover were 18 56 and 7 84 greater respectively than that under full film cover based on these observations the highest alkaline phosphatase activities were associated with half film cover 80 f and 1 irrigation line per paired row with slightly lower activities when f was 60 instead of 80 4 3 soil microorganisms the soil microorganism populations were significantly affected by all the three factors and their two way interactions pxt pxl and txl table 3 the most abundant culturable soil microorganisms under the greenhouse conditions were bacteria followed by actinomyces and fungi the range analysis showed that the film covering factor had the greatest influence on the culturable soil bacteria followed by the irrigation lower limits and drip irrigation line density factors the culturable actinomycetes were most affected by the irrigation lower limit factor followed by the film covering and drip irrigation line density factors the culturable fungi populations were most affected by the drip irrigation line density factor followed by the irrigation lower limit and film cover factors the number of culturable bacteria increased with decreasing film cover table 3 but the actinomycetes and fungi were most abundant under the half cover level and the least abundant under the no cover level with respect to the irrigation lower limit the abundance of the culturable actinomycetes decreased from 60 f to 70 f and increased under 80 f the maximum abundance which was 1 91 and 4 07 times higher than that under 60 f and 70 f respectively was observed at 80 f the abundance of fungi increased as the irrigation lower limit increased thus the maximum abundance of fungi was observed at 80 f and it was 65 84 and 51 12 higher than that at 70 f and 60 f respectively for bacteria the maximum abundance observed at 60 f was 39 03 and 93 34 higher than the abundances at 80 f and 70 f respectively with the reduction of irrigation line density the abundances of the bacteria and actinomycetes decreased and the fungi increased in number the largest numbers of bacteria and actinomycetes were observed when the drip irrigation line density was the greatest t1 followed by the numbers under t3 4 and t1 2 the bacteria populations of the t1 factor increased by 18 69 and 77 66 compared to those under t3 4 and t1 2 respectively and the actinomycetes populations of the t1 factor increased by 52 82 and 78 77 compared to those under t3 4 and t1 2 respectively conversely the maximum number of fungi was observed at the lowest drip irrigation line density t1 2 which was 61 36 and 82 06 higher than the numbers under t3 4 and t1 respectively for the abundances of culturable microorganisms the half film cover 80 f and t1 factors best promoted the soil microbial quantities therefore an arrangement using the 60 f and t3 4 factors represents a suboptimal choice 4 4 root growth table 4 shows that root length root volume root area and root activity were significantly affected by the film covering irrigation lower limit and drip irrigation line density factors as well as the two way interactions pxt pxl and txl the range analysis showed that the irrigation lower limit factor followed by the film covering and irrigation line density factors had the greatest effect on root length and area the film covering factor followed by the drip irrigation line density and irrigation lower limit factors had the greatest effect on root volume the irrigation lower limit factor followed by the drip irrigation line density and film cover factors had the greatest effect on root activity with increases in the irrigation lower limits the root length and area decreased however the root volume increased from the lowest to the intermediate irrigation lower limit and then it decreased at the highest limit the root activity decreased from the lowest and the intermediate irrigation lower limit and then it increased at the highest limit the maximum root length was observed at 60 f which was 1 80 and 3 75 times higher than the values under 70 f and 80 f respectively similarly the maximum root area was also observed at 60 f and which was 19 98 and 100 41 higher than that under 70 f and 80 f respectively in contrast the maximum root activity was observed at 80 f which was 4 49 and 4 89 times greater than that under 60 f and 70 f respectively with decreasing drip irrigation line density root length and root activity decreased from the low to the intermediate factor levels and then they increased at the highest level the but root area and root volume displayed the opposite trend the maximum root length root area root volume and root activity values were observed at the t1 2 t3 4 t3 4 and t1 2 levels respectively for the film cover factor the root length root volume and root area decreased between the full and half cover conditions and then they increased under the no cover condition the maximum root length and area values were observed under full film cover pf and the lowest values were observed under half film cover ph the root length under pf was 2 10 and 1 55 times greater than that under ph and pn respectively and the root area under pf increased by 68 74 and 18 50 compared to that under ph and pn respectively the maximum root volume was observed under no film cover and was 54 19 and 96 24 greater than that under full and half film cover respectively the maximum root activity occurred under full film cover and it was 1 49 and 2 24 times greater than that under half and no cover respectively given the variable responses of the various root characteristics full film cover 60 f and medium drip irrigation line density t3 4 appear to be best combination of factors to promote root growth 4 5 correlation analysis to explore the relationships between the levels of soil alkaline phosphatase activity microorganisms and root growth a simple correlation analysis was carried out and the results are shown in table 5 the results show that the soil phosphatase was significantly and positively correlated with root activity and actinomycetes and some of the root growth characteristics were correlated to each other root length and root area were strongly positively correlated r 0849 and root volume and root area were weakly positively correlated r 0 449 and significantly negatively correlated with root activity r 0489 r 0 610 among microorganisms there was a significant negative correlation between bacteria and actinomycetes culturable actinomycetes had a significant negative correlation with root length root area and root volume but had positive correlation with root activity 5 discussion 5 1 half film covering improved the soil phosphatase activity by optimizing the soil microorganism composition the response patterns to the film cover levels coupled with their ranges and the correlation analysis can be used to determine best film cover practices to optimize soil alkaline phosphatase activities soil microorganism abundances and root growth the maximum number of actinomycetes and soil alkaline phosphatase activity occurred under ph as shown in table 2 a result that is consistent with the strong correlation between the actinomycetes abundances and soil alkaline phosphatase activity root activity was also significantly correlated with alkaline phosphatase activity and actinomycete abundance but it was not very sensitive to the film cover level therefore the response pattern of the root activity to the film cover conditions differed from that of actinomycete abundance and phosphatase activity table 2 root activity was best promoted through the management of the irrigation lower limit table 4 therefore half film covering appears to be the optimal choice for the promotion of soil alkaline phosphatase activity and actinomycete abundance although optimal for alkaline phosphatase activity and the abundance of actinomycetes the half film cover condition was suboptimal for bacterial abundance compared with nofilm covering half film covering limited the growth of the bacteria to a certain degree but it significantly promoted the growth of the actinomyces and fungi therefore it optimized the total soil microbial community composition and increases in actinomycete abundance could significantly improve the soil phosphatase activity table 4 reducing the abundance of bacteria and fungi to maximize the amounts of alkaline phosphatase and actinomycetes is likely to be an acceptable trade off depending on greenhouse management goals in addition the higher root activity that was maintained by the half film covering factor also increased the soil phosphatase activity hu and li 2003 and plant water uptake dai and dong 2014 further the half film covering ph and 80 f created conditions that promoted minimum to median values of root length area and volume which is an acceptable outcome if the goal is increased alkaline phosphatase activity these patterns might occur because half film covering appears to be a good compromise that creates favorable soil water aeration and temperature conditions maintaining a direct connection between the soil surface and the atmosphere in locations that are not entirely covered by the film enhances aeration and promotes the exchange of gases perhaps thereby promoting a balance of soil water and temperature that is favorable to the growth of microorganisms and root activity however the no film cover condition may create good soil permeability and be beneficial to the growth of aerobic bacteria with fast metabolic rates in the soil and the elevated bacterial growth could squeeze the ecological niche of the actinomycetes and inhibit their growth which is not conducive to the improvement of soil phosphatase activity table 4 in addition the full film covering factor might prevent gas exchanges between the soil and atmosphere and prevent soil reducing gases such as co2 from discharging in time gao et al 2014 thus increasing the anaerobic factors in the soil and producing harmful factors for the growth of actinomycetes which would lower the soil phosphatase activity during a study on maize yongchun song et al found that soil phosphatase activity could be significantly increased by inoculating the maize rhizosphere with mycorrhizal fungi but the impact was limited song et al 2001 the results in this paper suggest that proper management of soil moisture and film cover choice can enhance soil phosphatase activities and the native microorganism populations without an artificial inoculation of the rhizosphere 5 2 irrigation lower limits affected soil phosphatase activity by changing root growth and root activity the soil alkaline phosphatase culturable actinomycete and root activities all showed the same response patterns to the irrigation factor levels with minimum values occurring at 70 f and maximum values occurring at 80 f importantly the alkaline phosphatase activities at 80 f and 60 f were 33 26 and 18 39 greater respectively than those at 70 f previous studies observed that root activity was negatively correlated to bulk density and increasing root activity could promote soil loosening and enhance aeration water availability and root respiration sun et al 2005 li et al 2005 wang and sun 2015 observed that root activity promoted the growth of actinomycetes and other microbes which also directly promoted the soil phosphatase wang and sun 2015 the experiment results that are presented in this paper show that actinomycetes abundance was significantly and positively correlated to root activity therefore 80 f may increase soil phosphatase activity by improving root activity however compared to the activity at 80 f there was no difference in the soil alkaline phosphatase activity at 60 f although the root activity at 60 f was significantly lower than that at 80 f this may be because 60 f had the maximum root length and root area values which would greatly increase root secretions and these secretions significantly promote soil alkaline phosphatase activities li et al 2014 the negative relationship between root activity and actinomycete abundance and root volume and root area table 5 are likely because the dry soil conditions that promoted increased root volume and root area via increased aeration simultaneously inhibited root activity yang et al 2009 with the increase in soil moisture root area decreased but root activity increased perhaps more resources were devoted to increasing the root biomass under low water availability i e low irrigation limits in order to meet the plant water demand and as a result there was less energy available for root activity graham 1984 and the dry conditions with low root activity caused the actinomycete populations to decrease the culturable fungi also showed increased numbers under wetter soil conditions higher lower limits and a weak positive correlation not significant to root activity the increase in fungi could be beneficial to the decomposition of organic matter in the soil which may have promoted the growth of actinomycetes marcus et al 1997 therefore the growth of actinomycetes increased the soil phosphatase activity ghorbani nasrabadi et al 2013 bacteria were the least sensitive group to soil water content which is consistent with their very low correlation to phosphatase activity and negative correlation to actinomycete and root activities table 5 some research has found that high irrigation levels can significantly reduce the soil phosphatase activity of tomato plants for example mi et al 2005 found that high irrigation rates significantly reduced the soil phosphatase activity of tomato crops which is inconsistent with the results in this paper this is likely because the highest irrigation amount in their test was 4541m3 hm 2 which is higher than the 1996m3 hm 2 level used in this study therefore the soil was much wetter and as a result aeration was low at field capacity causing a low rate of gas exchange with the atmosphere and potentially anaerobic conditions gao et al 2014 which may have reduced the soil microbial growth and root activity thus reducing the soil enzyme activity 5 3 irrigation line density minimally affected soil phosphatase activity the soil culturable fungi were slightly more sensitive to the drip irrigation line density factor than to the film cover and irrigation lower limit factors fungi abundances were not highly correlated to the phosphatase activity other microorganisms or root activity but they could be associated with other factors i e nutrient and water uptake through mycorrhizal associations that were not measured in this study because the phosphatase activity bacteria actinomycetes abundance and root activity were not very sensitive to the drip irrigation line density there is no large compromise involved in choosing a drip irrigation line density that favors fungi over the other variables as a result the t1 2 condition favors maximum fungi abundance maximum root activity intermediate phosphatase activity and minimum actinomycete abundance however the actinomycetes were less sensitive to drip irrigation line density than the other measured characteristics so the t1 2 condition in combination with half film covering and 80 f may be an acceptable choice 5 4 optimal conditions for soil alkaline phosphatase activity culturable microorganisms root activity phosphorus uptake and crop growth based on the above discussion the half film covering h 80 f and t1 2 drip irrigation line density factors resulted in an optimal combination for soil alkaline phosphatase activity to verify the recommended scheme the phosphorus uptake of the melons is shown in table 6 and the response of the melon yield fruit and plants to the experimental factors was analyzed with the results shown in table 7 table 6 shows that the full and half film covering significantly improved the phosphorus uptake level in melon roots leaves and fruit compared to no film covering the fruit mass ratio could be remarkably enhanced by using half film covering instead of full film covering the t1 2 level could increase not only the phosphorus uptake level in melon fruit but also the fruit mass ratio the 60 f and 80 f conditions could promote phosphorus uptake level in melon roots leaves and fruit more than 70 f table 7 shows that the yield single fruit weight pulp thickness and fresh weight of above ground biomass were the highest under the half film cover h condition the t1 2 level favored the maximum yield and single fruit weight values and intermediate pulp thickness and fresh weight of ground plant values the 80 f condition favored maximum yield single fruit weight and fresh weight of ground plant values and an intermediate pulp thickness value therefore the agronomic arrangement recommendations in this paper are verified by increased melon yield 6 conclusion this paper found that different factors film covering drip irrigation line density and irrigation lower limits had complicated effects on soil phosphatase activity fig 3 however a combination of half film covering h 80 f and t1 2 drip irrigation line density factors resulted in optimal values of root area root volume root activity actinomycete abundances and soil alkaline phosphatase activity further these measurements were verified by observations that phosphorus uptake and crop yield were optimized under the optimal conditions therefore we suggest that arrangements using these agronomic factors should be used when planting under greenhouse conditions acknowledgments this work is

11546,the inadequate soil and water management has resulted in ecological and environmental problems in hetao irrigation district which is characterized by low precipitation high evaporation and soil salinity issues a two year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of the combined application of irrigation methods irrigation amounts and plastic mulching modes on soil moisture soil salinity and water use efficiency of spring maize this experiment included four treatments i border irrigation partially mulched by plastic film with full irrigation amount ck ii ridge furrow irrigation not mulched by plastic film with high irrigation amount nrf iii ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with high irrigation amount prf iv ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with low irrigation amount prl the results demonstrated that soil water and soil salinity mainly changed in the upper 80 cm soil layer the proportion of the amount of deep percolation in the total growing season ranged from 9 3 to 29 5 and the highest deep percolation amount appeared in ck less irrigation amount generally resulted in a higher salt accumulation in the upper 40 cm soil layer at harvest the highest salt accumulation appeared in prl and the lowest salt accumulation appeared in prf among the three ridge furrow irrigation treatments compared with the ck treatment the average grain yields in the prf prl and nrf treatments were increased by 29 6 12 2 and 14 4 in 2015 and increased by 5 5 4 2 and 2 5 in 2016 respectively the highest water use efficiency was found in the treatment with prf in 2015 growing season and in the treatment with prl in 2016 growing season irrigation water use efficiency was lower in prf than in prl whereas higher than in ck and nrf fully considering maize yield soil water storage soil salt balance and water use efficiency in the hetao irrigation district ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with about 300 mm of irrigation water can be recommended as the effective soil and water management practice keywords soil salinity deep percolation ridge furrow irrigation plastic mulching water useefficiency 1 introduction the hetao irrigation district is one of the main grain production areas in northwest china comprising of about 2 8 105 ha irrigated cropland on saline soils zhao et al 2014 irrigation with the yellow river water plays an important role in crop production and salt leaching because of low precipitation about 160 mm per year and high pan evaporation ren et al 2016 however excessive application of the yellow river water and inappropriate drainage management of irrigation water have resulted in rising groundwater levels which have the potential to bring about salt accumulation in the upper soil layer sharma and minhas 2005 qadir et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 meanwhile with increasing water demand of the yellow river basin the amount of water diverted from the yellow river to the hetao irrigation district will be reduced from 5 0 to 4 0 billion m3 per year in the following decade zhang et al 2017 therefore efficient water saving techniques should be developed to cope with the water reduction and soil salinization problems spring maize is a major grain crop and feed resource in the hetao irrigation district due to the sunlight heat resources e g temperature and breeding requirements the cultivated area of spring maize accounts for more than 30 of the total arable land in this area ren et al 2016 liu et al 2017 spring maize has an high irrigation water demand during the total growing season because of the high ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation in hetao irrigation district and thus the combined application of basin flood irrigation and transparent plastic mulching is commonly used for spring maize fields zhang et al 2017 however about 150 mm water is lost from 500 mm of irrigation water through deep percolation caused by basin flood irrigation xu et al 2010 liu et al 2017 meanwhile spring maize is more sensitive to soil salinity at the seeding stage tong et al 2012 and control of root zone salinity in saline fields is considered beneficial to seed emergence and stand establishment meiri and plaut 1985 abd ei mageed et al 2016 therefore reducing irrigation amount within a suitable soil salinity level and increasing water use efficiency without a crop yield decrease are the primary goals of soil and water management in hetao irrigation district currently mulched drip irrigation and mulched ridge furrow irrigation with transparent plastic film are utilized in the arid and semiarid regions of northwest china plastic mulching can efficiently conserve soil water reduce evaporation losses increase soil temperature reduce salt accumulation within the shallow soil depth and enhance biological activity and crop yield pang et al 2010 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 mulched drip irrigation with transparent plastic film is an effective method to reduce irrigation amount without decreasing crop yield in arid and semiarid regions wang et al 2015 liu et al 2013 however the application of mulched drip irrigation in hetao irrigation district may be subject to emitter clogging induced by the yellow river water with high sediment concentration ridge furrow irrigation with plastic mulch is currently the most common irrigation practice in northwest china compared with border irrigation ridge furrow irrigation can significantly improve water use efficiency wu et al 2015 but salts tend to accumulate in surface soil layers below the ridges because leaching occurs primarily below the furrows saggu and kaushal 1991 plastic mulching may induce pronounced changes in soil water flow and salt transfer paths and the mulched treatments can retain 40 60 more water than the un mulched treatment humberto and lal 2007 zhou et al 2009 bezborodov et al 2010 chen et al 2015 however no research has been conducted to study the combined effect of plastic mulching and ridge furrow irrigation on water saving and salt leaching in hetao irrigation district therefore this modified soil and water environment caused by plastic mulching and ridge furrow irrigation needs to be recognized when reducing irrigation amount and changing local irrigation method in this study we assume that the dynamics of soil water and salinity and their distributions in the soil profile as well as water use efficiency of spring maize would be affected by ridge furrow irrigation method and plastic mulching modes therefore the objectives of this research are 1 to determine the effect of ridge furrow irrigation and plastic mulching on soil water and salt content 2 to investigate how spring maize yield and water use efficiency are affected by plastic mulching and ridge furrow irrigation method in hetao irrigation district 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted from april 2015 to september 2016 at the shuguang experimental station in hetao irrigation district western inner mongolia autonomous region china latitude 40 46 n longitude 107 24 e and altitude 1039 m the area has a typical arid continental climate with an annual precipitation of 105 mm occurring mainly between may and september wang et al 2014 and the mean annual pan evaporation exceeds 2000 mm hao et al 2015 the mean annual temperature is 7 8 c and the mean annual total sunshine duration is 3156 h wang et al 2014 the groundwater level varies from 1 7 to 2 8 m below the soil surface during the two crop growth seasons the soils are alluvial silt sediments with an upper layer 0 60 cm of silt loam a lower layer 60 100 cm of sand and sandy loam and a sand layer of about 30 cm thick between 60 and 90 cm below the soil surface the climate and special geographical conditions of this region make it liable for salt accumulation on the soil surface the physical and chemical properties of the soil at the experimental site are summarized in table 1 weather data for the two growing seasons were obtained from the standard meteorological observation station located approximately 150 m from the experiment 2 2 experimental design and field management ridge furrow irrigation system and border irrigation system were used to apply the yellow river water this experiment included four treatments i border irrigation partially mulched by plastic film with full irrigation amount ck ii ridge furrow irrigation not mulched by plastic film with high irrigation amount nrf iii ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with high irrigation amount prf iv ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with low irrigation amount prl the four treatments were replicated three times in a completely randomized block design each plot consisted of 8 rows of spring maize planted on a flat ground mulched by plastic film ck or four raised ridges nrf prf and prl for the two experimental years each plot was 4 8 m í 45 m and each ridge furrow was 1 2 m í 45 m fig 1 the ridge and furrow for any group were 50 cm wide 20 cm high and 70 cm wide 20 cm high respectively the furrows were closed at the end of the plot to withhold the irrigation water irrigation is important for spring maize in this rainfall scare region the amounts and dates of irrigation for spring maize plants table 2 were applied during the two growing seasons depending on climatic condition plant growth water allocation for irrigation managed by hetao irrigation district authority and the previous publications duan et al 2005 xu et al 2010 miao et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in both years the total n application rate was 300 kg n ha 1 for all treatments before sowing p2o5 diammonium phosphate was spread at level of 600 kg ha 1 as a base fertilizer and n was broadcast at levels of 150 kg n ha 1 urea as a base fertilizer before mulching in both years the remaining 150 kg n ha 1 urea was evenly applied at the tasseling and filling stages in both years the plots were manually covered with a transparent plastic film of 140 cm wide on any ridge and the flat ground was covered with a transparent plastic film of 70 cm wide the plastic film was joined at the bottom of the furrow and a 50 cm space without plastic film was maintained for water infiltration fig 1 seeds of maize zea mays l hybrid ximeng no 6 were sown using a hole sowing machine at a 5 cm depth on april 28 and april 30 and corresponding harvested on september 11 and september 16 in the 2015 and 2016 experiments respectively plants were seeded in double rows on ridges with a row space of 40 cm fig 1a and the wide narrow rows pattern with wide and narrow rows spaces of 80 and 40 cm was applied in ck fig 1b for both years thinning operations were performed on the 28th day after planting at a planting spacing of 30 cm resulting in a population density of 55 000 plants per hectare 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water and salinity during the spring maize growing seasons soil samples were collected every 10 cm for the top 20 cm and every 20 cm from 20 to 120 cm soil samples were obtained from the center of ridge narrow row in ck shown in fig 1 and the center of furrow wide row in ck shown in fig 1 at the top one quarter middle three quarters and bottom of one ridge furrow wide narrow row at each plot respectively with an auger at 1 day before seeding 1 day before and 5 days after irrigation and 1 day before harvest time in 2015 and 2016 respectively all soil samples were divided into two parts one part was used to measure soil water contents by the gravimetric method and the other part was used to prepare dilute soil extract solutions samples for the solutions were air dried and sieved through a 1 mm mesh soluble salt estimates were based on extracts with a 1 5 soil water ratio determined using a conductivity meter ec 1 5 ds m 1 soil samples with a wide range of ec 1 5 values were selected to measure the conductivity of saturated paste extract ece and the relationship between ece and ec 1 5 was developed subsequently the conductivities were highly correlated r 2 0 914 thus ece was estimated for all samples using the following formula 1 e c e 5 880 e c 1 5 1 331 2 3 2 plant measurements grain yield was determined by hand harvesting the two adjacent center rows 45 m in length in each plot at maturity the harvest samples were sun dried for 4 5 days and weighed after threshing then the kernel number per ear was counted the grain yield of maize was calculated when the water content in sun dried grain was about 15 measured by oven drying method at harvest three plants were selected at the top middle and bottom of each ridge or narrow row twelve plant samples for each plot respectively to investigate maize harvest factors including grain weight dry aboveground biomass and hundred grain weight biomass was dried at the 105 c about 10 min for de enzyme then 75 c to a constant weight 2 3 3 actual evapotranspiration and water use efficiency in the two experimental seasons actual crop evapotranspiration eta was calculated by using the soil water balance equation 2 e t a i p e r q δ w where i is the irrigation depth mm pe is effective rainfall mm r is runoff loss from ground surface mm q is vertical soil water exchange at the depth of 100 cm positive downward negative upward mm and dw is the difference in soil water storage in the 100 cm soil layer between the two soil water measurements at begin and end seasons mm the effective rainfall pe can be estimated as 40 2 of rainfall amount during the growing season of spring maize liu et al 2017 r was neglected because of the small amount rainfall during the two growing seasons generally maize roots are mainly distributed in the 100 cm of soil layer under surface irrigation condition yang et al 2010 wang et al 2013 the 100 cm soil layer is considered to be the depth at which soil water flows into or out the root zone to calculate the soil water flux the water contents at depth intervals of 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 and 100 120 cm were converted to volumetric water content using the bulk densities listed in table 1 the soil water exchange q at the 100 cm soil depth was determined using the darcy s equation ma et al 2011 liu et al 2017 3 q k θ d ϕ d z 1 k θ ϕ 120 ϕ 80 z 120 z 80 1 4 k θ k s s e 1 2 1 1 s

exchange was estimated daily using measured and interpolated data soil water was measured about 10 days considering there was no great variation for soil water content in soil layer of 80 120 cm because of less rainfall and the controlled irrigation depths soil water contents in days between two measurements was linearly interpolated using the two measured soil water contents liu et al 2017

analyses were performed using the spss statistical package multiple comparisons of annual mean values were performed using least significant difference lsd method in all analyses p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate and irrigation mean daily air temperature relative humidity and wind speed in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons are presented in table 3 the precipitation and irrigation distributions during the spring maize growing seasons are provided in fig 2 these data indicated that climatic condition was different in the two growing seasons the rainfall during the spring maize growth stage in 2015 and 2016 were about 15 mm and 122 mm respectively the annual rainfall during the spring maize growth stage was 105 mm which indicated that 2015 was a dry growing season and 2016 was a wet growing season the monthly temperature presented the similar trend during the two growing seasons increasing from may to july and decreasing from august to september however the monthly temperature in 2015 growing season was lower than that in 2016 growing season the monthly relative humidity also showed a similar trend during the two growing seasons but was lower in 2015 growing season than that in 2016 the monthly wind speed presented the variable of the trend alternate in 2015 growing season and decreased from may to september in 2016 growing season however wind speed was much higher in 2016 than that in 2015 this was because drought occurred in 2015 but relatively humid was in 2016 which resulted in the different wind speed in both years pan evaporation also varied greatly between the two experimental seasons fig 2 the total pan evaporation was 925 mm in 2015 and 865 mm in 2016 during the experimental period daily fluctuations in pan evaporation were large ranging from 1 mm to 18 mm generally the pan evaporation declined during the experimental period and a higher evaporation occurred during the first half of the spring maize growing season therefore more water loss to soil evaporation occurred in the early experimental period the total precipitation during the experimental period was about 15 mm in 2015 28 april 11 september and 122 mm in 2016 30 april 16 september respectively however these rainfall amounts could not satisfy the water requirement of spring maize for acceptable grain yields especially during the critical growth period from elongation to milking stages in july and august the total rainfall was about 6 and 84 mm in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively therefore the appropriate irrigation amounts in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons were used according to the different climatic conditions and water saving requirements tables 2 and 3 fig 2 the seasonal irrigation depth in 2015 growing season was 360 mm under border irrigation condition full irrigation which was calculated according to the results of miao et al 2015 of 300 mm under ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation condition high irrigation and of 240 mm under ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation condition low irrigation indicating a great water saving potential using ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation the irrigation amounts were reduced in 2016 growing season according to rainfall and water saving requirements 3 2 dynamics of soil water soil water content in the 0 120 cm soil profile of narrow row fig 1 for four treatments at harvest in both years are shown in fig 3 as compared at the seeding period the data of init on fig 3 soil water content in four treatments decreased at harvest and mainly changed in the upper root zone of 0 80 cm soil layer indicating soil water content decreased after a spring maize growing season because of low precipitation high evaporation and plant transpiration spring maize roots absorbed water in the upper 80 cm soil layer and resulted in greater soil water variation because of more than 80 of plant root located in the upper 50 cm soil layer jiang et al 2013 gao et al 2014 in soil layer deeper than 80 cm for narrow row soil water content in four treatments changed little indicating soil water content at 80 120 cm soil depth may not be affected by precipitation evaporation irrigation and plant transpiration soil water content at the 100 cm soil depth were much lower than those at the 80 cm soil depth and 120 cm soil depth for narrow row this soil water pattern is result of having more than 80 sand portion in the 70 100 cm soil layer for narrow row which had a low water holding capacity and resulted in low soil water content spring maize mainly used soil water in the 0 60 cm soil layer and soil water in the 60 120 cm soil layer showed only a minor variation in both years fig 4 soil water content before the first irrigation was the lowest in nrf at the 0 120 cm soil depth of narrow row fig 4 indicating plastic mulching could reduce soil evaporation and improve water use in the root zone soil water variation between 50 dasm 5 days after the first irrigation and 77 dasm 1 day before the second irrigation in 2015 was the highest in prl 14 11 g g 1 followed by nrf 6 46 g g 1 ck 6 26 g g 1 and then prf 5 02 g g 1 at the 0 60 cm soil depth fig 4a and soil water content at 47 74 and 109 dasm in 2016 were lower in prl and nrf than in prf and ck at the 0 60 cm soil depth fig 4c indicating ridge furrow irrigation in prf could improve soil water use and save irrigation water soil water contents were higher in prf and lower in nrf than in ck indicating ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation having the strong ability of saving irrigation water the amounts of seasonal deep percolation induced by border furrow irrigation for ck prf prl and nrf in 2015 were 106 66 22 and 44 mm while in 2016 the values were 97 62 24 and 48 mm respectively the amounts of deep percolation for four treatments declined with the order of ck prf nrf and prl during the two experiments these findings implied that the amount of deep percolation was affected by irrigation amounts and plastic mulch ratios and low irrigation amount prl and no plastic mulching nrf resulting in a reduction in deep percolation the proportion of the amount of deep percolation in the total irrigation amount ranged from 9 3 to 29 5 these findings implied that the application of high irrigation amount can cause a higher proportion of irrigation water to be subject to deep percolation the amount of deep percolation was lower in 2016 than in 2015 despite high precipitation was in 2016 this may have been due to the low irrigation amount and high evaporation in 2016 table 2 and fig 2 which resulted in less water available for deep percolation compared with the ck treatment prf nrf and prl may have less effect on the water table depth and could substantially reduce the risk of secondary salinization in this area therefore it is crucial to control irrigation amount and find a suitable irrigation method in hetao irrigation district to reduce the risk of further salt accumulation and soil degradation 3 3 dynamics of soil salinity the distribution of ec e in the 0 120 cm soil profile of narrow row for four treatments at harvest in 2015 and 2016 are illustrated in fig 5 compared with the initial values at the seeding stage ec e in most treatments increased at harvest fig 5 indicating soil salt content increased after a maize season under irrigation precipitation and plant transpiration conditions these results were in agreement with findings of ren et al 2016 and liu et al 2017 among the four treatments ec e was the highest in prl followed by nrf prf and ck indicating that low irrigation amount prl and no plastic mulching nrf generally resulted in a higher salt accumulation in the root zone generally crops absorbed water from deeper soil layers when low irrigation amount could not satisfy crop water requirement thus soil water in deeper soil layer could move up to the upper soil layer and lastly result in a higher salt accumulation in the upper soil layer liu et al 2017 in this study soil salt increased mainly in the upper 80 cm soil layer fig 5 this region was similar to the soil water dynamic zone fig 3 indicating a coupling movement of water and salt soil salt at the 0 80 cm soil depth was even higher in prl than in the other treatments this was due to plant root absorbing water but leaving salt at the 0 80 cm soil depth in prl resulting in a higher salt accumulation in this soil layer which could explain why rebound in salinity was even greater in prl than in the other treatments at the 0 80 cm soil depth during the irrigation period salts moved downward with irrigation water and upward with soil evaporation and plant transpiration fig 6 ec e at 45 dasm in 2015 was the highest in nrf 8 69 ds m 1 at the 0 60 cm soil depth fig 6a indicating plastic mulching significantly affected soil salt variation ec e increased from 50 to 77 dasm in 2015 and was greater at the 0 60 cm soil depth than at the 60 120 cm soil depth because of soil water moving up from the 60 120 cm soil layer and salt also moving up to the upper 60 cm soil layer fig 6a and b ec e from 47 to 139 dasm in 2016 was the highest in prl 7 91 ds m 1 followed by nrf 7 34 ds m 1 prf 5 31 ds m 1 and ck 5 19 ds m 1 at the 0 60 cm soil depth whereas the highest in nrf 5 58 ds m 1 followed by ck 5 32 ds m 1 prf 4 96 ds m 1 and prl 4 94 ds m 1 at the 60 120 cm soil depth fig 6c and d this indicated that ridge with plastic mulch furrow with a suitable irrigation amount about 300 mm could enhance the ability of alleviating soil salinity and improving spring maize growth environment in hetao irrigation district in this study ec e in most treatments were higher than 10 0 ds m 1 in the upper 20 cm soil layer at harvest in 2015 whereas the reverse occurred in 2016 this may be due to the low precipitation amount about 15 mm and no irrigation at harvest in 2015 and high precipitation amount 122 mm in 2016 however ec e in all treatments were lower than 6 2 ds m 1 in the 20 120 cm soil layer in both years this may be due to the high groundwater level and the low salt content in the irrigation water 0 5 g l 1 this phenomenon was in agreement with the previous reports in which ec e decreased with the groundwater level increasing yu et al 2010 liu et al 2017 for prf ec e was basically less than the other treatments and irrigation amount was less than 60 mm than that in ck therefore prf was recommended with the objective of alleviating soil salinity and saving irrigation water 3 4 spring maize yield dry matter and water use efficiency the maize yields ranged from 10611 to 15578 kg ha 1 in the two seasons table 4 which were similar to the results found by ren et al 2016 and wang et al 2015 in the same region which had similar soil salinity levels and climatic conditions meanwhile the average ece at the 0 120 cm soil depth ranged from 4 1 to 5 2 ds m 1 in 2015 and from 4 2 to 6 1 ds m 1 in 2016 figs 5 and 6 and the surface soil salt 0 20 cm was higher than 7 2 ds m 1 before each irrigation event and at harvest this indicated that spring maize yields were not seriously affected by soil salinity which is because that high salinity only appeared in the 0 20 cm soil layer before each irrigation event and at harvest due to no irrigation and decayed maize leaves at harvest for the same treatment spring maize yields in 2016 were higher than that in 2015 this may be due to the different climatic conditions irrigation amounts fig 2 and table 3 and soil salinity levels figs 5 and 6 compared with the ck treatment the average grain yields in the prf prl and nrf treatments were increased by 29 6 12 2 and 14 4 in 2015 and increased by 5 5 4 2 and 2 5 in 2016 respectively one reason may be that plastic mulching on ridge can reduce soil evaporation increase topsoil temperature retain soil water and ridge furrow irrigation can improve the environment of sunlight temperature and wind among the spring maize rows the other reason may be that the coupling of water and nitrogen enhance maize growth and grain yield under ridge furrow irrigation the traditional basin border irrigation generally used more irrigation which caused further deep seepage and nitrogen leaching xu et al 2012 ren et al 2016 and may negatively affect spring maize yield grain yield in prf was higher by 2 9 13 5 in 2015 and 1 3 3 0 in 2016 than that in nrf and prl respectively this may be mainly due to prf changing the soil water redistribution decreasing the soil salt concentration improving the balance of soil water salt and nitrogen and applying more irrigation water than prl did under the same irrigation amount conditions hundred grain weight hgw was higher in prf than in nrf under plastic mulching conditions hgw increased with the order of ck prl and prf in 2015 and 2016 perhaps as a result of sufficient n conservation and appropriate soil temperature in the ridge furrow irrigation treatments the high surface soil temperature that results from mulching may cause a shorter lag phase in grain filling and reduce photoassimilate production per unit of thermal time which may result in kernel abortion cantarero et al 1999 however hgm under mulched drip irrigation zhou et al 2017 liu et al 2017 was lower than hgw in this study this was mainly due to different irrigation methods irrigation amounts climatic conditions and planting densities dry matter dm exhibited different results for spring maize yields in both years fig 4 dm was higher in prf and lower in prl than in ck and nrf which indicated that irrigation amount and irrigation method affected plant height and leaf area index of spring maize this was because ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation improved the environment of wind sunlight and temperature among the crop rows which could enhance the productivity of spring maize in relation to the full irrigation in ck the mean depths of saved water were 60 mm 17 4 saving in prf and 120 mm 34 8 saving in prl in both years thus irrigation savings were low with prf which could enhance the productivity of spring maize and resulted in high dm and grain yield however irrigation conservation was very high with prl and resulted in severe water stress and reduced the dm of spring maize in addition hgw exhibited a close relationship with yield and dm in both years it can be concluded that yield variation was primarily attributable to hgw water use efficiencies wues ranged from 2 46 to 3 75 kg m 3 and irrigation water use efficiencies iwues ranged from 2 95 to 6 83 kg m 3 the highest wue was found in the treatment with prf in 2015 and in the treatment with prl in 2016 drought occurred in hetao irrigation district in 2015 and spring maize suffered severe water stress resulting in low grain yields for four experimental treatments however prf presented the greater ability for soil water conservation and evaporation loss reduction therefore wue was higher in prf than in ck prf and nrf in 2015 due to the high precipitation and shallow ground water level the water demand of spring maize was satisfied in 2016 and grain yields were not significantly different p 0 05 among the four treatments therefore the treatment with low irrigation amount prl had the higher wue than that with high irrigation amount ck prf and nrf in 2016 irrigation water use efficiency iwue was closely related with maize yields and irrigation amount iwue was lower in ck than in prl prf and nrf indicating ridge furrow irrigation affected plant growth and yield formation of spring maize in hetao irrigation district iwue was lower in prf than in prl whereas higher than in nrf no significant difference of iwue was found between nrf and prf in 2016 whereas the inverse situation was found in 2015 this may be due to the different climatic condition such as precipitation and soil environment which resulted in the abovementioned phenomenon the other reason may be that high irrigation amount decreased irrigation water use efficiency and ridge not covered by plastic film negatively affected spring maize yield 4 conclusions soil water and salt mainly changed in the upper 80 cm soil layer under ridge furrow irrigation and border irrigation the amount of deep percolation in the total irrigation amount ranged from 9 3 to 29 5 and the highest deep percolation amount occurred in ck less amount of irrigation prl resulted in a reduction in deep percolation and a higher salt accumulation in the upper 40 cm soil layer at harvest the highest salt accumulation appeared in prl and the lowest salt accumulation appeared in prf among the three ridge furrow irrigation treatments grain yields under the three ridge furrow irrigation treatments were higher by 12 2 29 6 in 2015 and 2 5 5 6 in 2016 than that in ck respectively grain yield in prf was higher by 2 9 13 5 in 2015 and 1 3 3 0 in 2016 than that in nrf and prl respectively the highest wue was found in the treatment with prf in 2015 and in the treatment with prl in 2016 iwue was lower in ck than in prl nrf and prf indicating ridge furrow irrigation affected plant growth and yield formation of spring maize in hetao irrigation district iwue was lower in prf than in prl whereas higher than in ck and nrf this study region is characterized by low rainfall and high evaporative potential contrary it is the main grain production region in china because of the rich water resources from the yellow river with the increasing water demand to support the development of economy water allocation for irrigation is decreasing in the subsequent years xu et al 2010 therefore traditional basin flood irrigation practice with the objective of maximum yield should be changed to a scheduling with the objective of achieving both high yield and wue while controlling soil salinity when the discharge of yellow river is not enough to satisfy the agricultural water demand and economic water demand in hetao irrigation district ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation method with about 300 mm of irrigation is recommend for spring maize to produce the optimal grain yield

11546,the inadequate soil and water management has resulted in ecological and environmental problems in hetao irrigation district which is characterized by low precipitation high evaporation and soil salinity issues a two year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of the combined application of irrigation methods irrigation amounts and plastic mulching modes on soil moisture soil salinity and water use efficiency of spring maize this experiment included four treatments i border irrigation partially mulched by plastic film with full irrigation amount ck ii ridge furrow irrigation not mulched by plastic film with high irrigation amount nrf iii ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with high irrigation amount prf iv ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with low irrigation amount prl the results demonstrated that soil water and soil salinity mainly changed in the upper 80 cm soil layer the proportion of the amount of deep percolation in the total growing season ranged from 9 3 to 29 5 and the highest deep percolation amount appeared in ck less irrigation amount generally resulted in a higher salt accumulation in the upper 40 cm soil layer at harvest the highest salt accumulation appeared in prl and the lowest salt accumulation appeared in prf among the three ridge furrow irrigation treatments compared with the ck treatment the average grain yields in the prf prl and nrf treatments were increased by 29 6 12 2 and 14 4 in 2015 and increased by 5 5 4 2 and 2 5 in 2016 respectively the highest water use efficiency was found in the treatment with prf in 2015 growing season and in the treatment with prl in 2016 growing season irrigation water use efficiency was lower in prf than in prl whereas higher than in ck and nrf fully considering maize yield soil water storage soil salt balance and water use efficiency in the hetao irrigation district ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with about 300 mm of irrigation water can be recommended as the effective soil and water management practice keywords soil salinity deep percolation ridge furrow irrigation plastic mulching water useefficiency 1 introduction the hetao irrigation district is one of the main grain production areas in northwest china comprising of about 2 8 105 ha irrigated cropland on saline soils zhao et al 2014 irrigation with the yellow river water plays an important role in crop production and salt leaching because of low precipitation about 160 mm per year and high pan evaporation ren et al 2016 however excessive application of the yellow river water and inappropriate drainage management of irrigation water have resulted in rising groundwater levels which have the potential to bring about salt accumulation in the upper soil layer sharma and minhas 2005 qadir et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 meanwhile with increasing water demand of the yellow river basin the amount of water diverted from the yellow river to the hetao irrigation district will be reduced from 5 0 to 4 0 billion m3 per year in the following decade zhang et al 2017 therefore efficient water saving techniques should be developed to cope with the water reduction and soil salinization problems spring maize is a major grain crop and feed resource in the hetao irrigation district due to the sunlight heat resources e g temperature and breeding requirements the cultivated area of spring maize accounts for more than 30 of the total arable land in this area ren et al 2016 liu et al 2017 spring maize has an high irrigation water demand during the total growing season because of the high ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation in hetao irrigation district and thus the combined application of basin flood irrigation and transparent plastic mulching is commonly used for spring maize fields zhang et al 2017 however about 150 mm water is lost from 500 mm of irrigation water through deep percolation caused by basin flood irrigation xu et al 2010 liu et al 2017 meanwhile spring maize is more sensitive to soil salinity at the seeding stage tong et al 2012 and control of root zone salinity in saline fields is considered beneficial to seed emergence and stand establishment meiri and plaut 1985 abd ei mageed et al 2016 therefore reducing irrigation amount within a suitable soil salinity level and increasing water use efficiency without a crop yield decrease are the primary goals of soil and water management in hetao irrigation district currently mulched drip irrigation and mulched ridge furrow irrigation with transparent plastic film are utilized in the arid and semiarid regions of northwest china plastic mulching can efficiently conserve soil water reduce evaporation losses increase soil temperature reduce salt accumulation within the shallow soil depth and enhance biological activity and crop yield pang et al 2010 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 mulched drip irrigation with transparent plastic film is an effective method to reduce irrigation amount without decreasing crop yield in arid and semiarid regions wang et al 2015 liu et al 2013 however the application of mulched drip irrigation in hetao irrigation district may be subject to emitter clogging induced by the yellow river water with high sediment concentration ridge furrow irrigation with plastic mulch is currently the most common irrigation practice in northwest china compared with border irrigation ridge furrow irrigation can significantly improve water use efficiency wu et al 2015 but salts tend to accumulate in surface soil layers below the ridges because leaching occurs primarily below the furrows saggu and kaushal 1991 plastic mulching may induce pronounced changes in soil water flow and salt transfer paths and the mulched treatments can retain 40 60 more water than the un mulched treatment humberto and lal 2007 zhou et al 2009 bezborodov et al 2010 chen et al 2015 however no research has been conducted to study the combined effect of plastic mulching and ridge furrow irrigation on water saving and salt leaching in hetao irrigation district therefore this modified soil and water environment caused by plastic mulching and ridge furrow irrigation needs to be recognized when reducing irrigation amount and changing local irrigation method in this study we assume that the dynamics of soil water and salinity and their distributions in the soil profile as well as water use efficiency of spring maize would be affected by ridge furrow irrigation method and plastic mulching modes therefore the objectives of this research are 1 to determine the effect of ridge furrow irrigation and plastic mulching on soil water and salt content 2 to investigate how spring maize yield and water use efficiency are affected by plastic mulching and ridge furrow irrigation method in hetao irrigation district 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted from april 2015 to september 2016 at the shuguang experimental station in hetao irrigation district western inner mongolia autonomous region china latitude 40 46 n longitude 107 24 e and altitude 1039 m the area has a typical arid continental climate with an annual precipitation of 105 mm occurring mainly between may and september wang et al 2014 and the mean annual pan evaporation exceeds 2000 mm hao et al 2015 the mean annual temperature is 7 8 c and the mean annual total sunshine duration is 3156 h wang et al 2014 the groundwater level varies from 1 7 to 2 8 m below the soil surface during the two crop growth seasons the soils are alluvial silt sediments with an upper layer 0 60 cm of silt loam a lower layer 60 100 cm of sand and sandy loam and a sand layer of about 30 cm thick between 60 and 90 cm below the soil surface the climate and special geographical conditions of this region make it liable for salt accumulation on the soil surface the physical and chemical properties of the soil at the experimental site are summarized in table 1 weather data for the two growing seasons were obtained from the standard meteorological observation station located approximately 150 m from the experiment 2 2 experimental design and field management ridge furrow irrigation system and border irrigation system were used to apply the yellow river water this experiment included four treatments i border irrigation partially mulched by plastic film with full irrigation amount ck ii ridge furrow irrigation not mulched by plastic film with high irrigation amount nrf iii ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with high irrigation amount prf iv ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation with low irrigation amount prl the four treatments were replicated three times in a completely randomized block design each plot consisted of 8 rows of spring maize planted on a flat ground mulched by plastic film ck or four raised ridges nrf prf and prl for the two experimental years each plot was 4 8 m í 45 m and each ridge furrow was 1 2 m í 45 m fig 1 the ridge and furrow for any group were 50 cm wide 20 cm high and 70 cm wide 20 cm high respectively the furrows were closed at the end of the plot to withhold the irrigation water irrigation is important for spring maize in this rainfall scare region the amounts and dates of irrigation for spring maize plants table 2 were applied during the two growing seasons depending on climatic condition plant growth water allocation for irrigation managed by hetao irrigation district authority and the previous publications duan et al 2005 xu et al 2010 miao et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in both years the total n application rate was 300 kg n ha 1 for all treatments before sowing p2o5 diammonium phosphate was spread at level of 600 kg ha 1 as a base fertilizer and n was broadcast at levels of 150 kg n ha 1 urea as a base fertilizer before mulching in both years the remaining 150 kg n ha 1 urea was evenly applied at the tasseling and filling stages in both years the plots were manually covered with a transparent plastic film of 140 cm wide on any ridge and the flat ground was covered with a transparent plastic film of 70 cm wide the plastic film was joined at the bottom of the furrow and a 50 cm space without plastic film was maintained for water infiltration fig 1 seeds of maize zea mays l hybrid ximeng no 6 were sown using a hole sowing machine at a 5 cm depth on april 28 and april 30 and corresponding harvested on september 11 and september 16 in the 2015 and 2016 experiments respectively plants were seeded in double rows on ridges with a row space of 40 cm fig 1a and the wide narrow rows pattern with wide and narrow rows spaces of 80 and 40 cm was applied in ck fig 1b for both years thinning operations were performed on the 28th day after planting at a planting spacing of 30 cm resulting in a population density of 55 000 plants per hectare 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water and salinity during the spring maize growing seasons soil samples were collected every 10 cm for the top 20 cm and every 20 cm from 20 to 120 cm soil samples were obtained from the center of ridge narrow row in ck shown in fig 1 and the center of furrow wide row in ck shown in fig 1 at the top one quarter middle three quarters and bottom of one ridge furrow wide narrow row at each plot respectively with an auger at 1 day before seeding 1 day before and 5 days after irrigation and 1 day before harvest time in 2015 and 2016 respectively all soil samples were divided into two parts one part was used to measure soil water contents by the gravimetric method and the other part was used to prepare dilute soil extract solutions samples for the solutions were air dried and sieved through a 1 mm mesh soluble salt estimates were based on extracts with a 1 5 soil water ratio determined using a conductivity meter ec 1 5 ds m 1 soil samples with a wide range of ec 1 5 values were selected to measure the conductivity of saturated paste extract ece and the relationship between ece and ec 1 5 was developed subsequently the conductivities were highly correlated r 2 0 914 thus ece was estimated for all samples using the following formula 1 e c e 5 880 e c 1 5 1 331 2 3 2 plant measurements grain yield was determined by hand harvesting the two adjacent center rows 45 m in length in each plot at maturity the harvest samples were sun dried for 4 5 days and weighed after threshing then the kernel number per ear was counted the grain yield of maize was calculated when the water content in sun dried grain was about 15 measured by oven drying method at harvest three plants were selected at the top middle and bottom of each ridge or narrow row twelve plant samples for each plot respectively to investigate maize harvest factors including grain weight dry aboveground biomass and hundred grain weight biomass was dried at the 105 c about 10 min for de enzyme then 75 c to a constant weight 2 3 3 actual evapotranspiration and water use efficiency in the two experimental seasons actual crop evapotranspiration eta was calculated by using the soil water balance equation 2 e t a i p e r q δ w where i is the irrigation depth mm pe is effective rainfall mm r is runoff loss from ground surface mm q is vertical soil water exchange at the depth of 100 cm positive downward negative upward mm and dw is the difference in soil water storage in the 100 cm soil layer between the two soil water measurements at begin and end seasons mm the effective rainfall pe can be estimated as 40 2 of rainfall amount during the growing season of spring maize liu et al 2017 r was neglected because of the small amount rainfall during the two growing seasons generally maize roots are mainly distributed in the 100 cm of soil layer under surface irrigation condition yang et al 2010 wang et al 2013 the 100 cm soil layer is considered to be the depth at which soil water flows into or out the root zone to calculate the soil water flux the water contents at depth intervals of 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 and 100 120 cm were converted to volumetric water content using the bulk densities listed in table 1 the soil water exchange q at the 100 cm soil depth was determined using the darcy s equation ma et al 2011 liu et al 2017 3 q k θ d ϕ d z 1 k θ ϕ 120 ϕ 80 z 120 z 80 1 4 k θ k s s e 1 2 1 1 s

exchange was estimated daily using measured and interpolated data soil water was measured about 10 days considering there was no great variation for soil water content in soil layer of 80 120 cm because of less rainfall and the controlled irrigation depths soil water contents in days between two measurements was linearly interpolated using the two measured soil water contents liu et al 2017

analyses were performed using the spss statistical package multiple comparisons of annual mean values were performed using least significant difference lsd method in all analyses p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate and irrigation mean daily air temperature relative humidity and wind speed in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons are presented in table 3 the precipitation and irrigation distributions during the spring maize growing seasons are provided in fig 2 these data indicated that climatic condition was different in the two growing seasons the rainfall during the spring maize growth stage in 2015 and 2016 were about 15 mm and 122 mm respectively the annual rainfall during the spring maize growth stage was 105 mm which indicated that 2015 was a dry growing season and 2016 was a wet growing season the monthly temperature presented the similar trend during the two growing seasons increasing from may to july and decreasing from august to september however the monthly temperature in 2015 growing season was lower than that in 2016 growing season the monthly relative humidity also showed a similar trend during the two growing seasons but was lower in 2015 growing season than that in 2016 the monthly wind speed presented the variable of the trend alternate in 2015 growing season and decreased from may to september in 2016 growing season however wind speed was much higher in 2016 than that in 2015 this was because drought occurred in 2015 but relatively humid was in 2016 which resulted in the different wind speed in both years pan evaporation also varied greatly between the two experimental seasons fig 2 the total pan evaporation was 925 mm in 2015 and 865 mm in 2016 during the experimental period daily fluctuations in pan evaporation were large ranging from 1 mm to 18 mm generally the pan evaporation declined during the experimental period and a higher evaporation occurred during the first half of the spring maize growing season therefore more water loss to soil evaporation occurred in the early experimental period the total precipitation during the experimental period was about 15 mm in 2015 28 april 11 september and 122 mm in 2016 30 april 16 september respectively however these rainfall amounts could not satisfy the water requirement of spring maize for acceptable grain yields especially during the critical growth period from elongation to milking stages in july and august the total rainfall was about 6 and 84 mm in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively therefore the appropriate irrigation amounts in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons were used according to the different climatic conditions and water saving requirements tables 2 and 3 fig 2 the seasonal irrigation depth in 2015 growing season was 360 mm under border irrigation condition full irrigation which was calculated according to the results of miao et al 2015 of 300 mm under ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation condition high irrigation and of 240 mm under ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation condition low irrigation indicating a great water saving potential using ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation the irrigation amounts were reduced in 2016 growing season according to rainfall and water saving requirements 3 2 dynamics of soil water soil water content in the 0 120 cm soil profile of narrow row fig 1 for four treatments at harvest in both years are shown in fig 3 as compared at the seeding period the data of init on fig 3 soil water content in four treatments decreased at harvest and mainly changed in the upper root zone of 0 80 cm soil layer indicating soil water content decreased after a spring maize growing season because of low precipitation high evaporation and plant transpiration spring maize roots absorbed water in the upper 80 cm soil layer and resulted in greater soil water variation because of more than 80 of plant root located in the upper 50 cm soil layer jiang et al 2013 gao et al 2014 in soil layer deeper than 80 cm for narrow row soil water content in four treatments changed little indicating soil water content at 80 120 cm soil depth may not be affected by precipitation evaporation irrigation and plant transpiration soil water content at the 100 cm soil depth were much lower than those at the 80 cm soil depth and 120 cm soil depth for narrow row this soil water pattern is result of having more than 80 sand portion in the 70 100 cm soil layer for narrow row which had a low water holding capacity and resulted in low soil water content spring maize mainly used soil water in the 0 60 cm soil layer and soil water in the 60 120 cm soil layer showed only a minor variation in both years fig 4 soil water content before the first irrigation was the lowest in nrf at the 0 120 cm soil depth of narrow row fig 4 indicating plastic mulching could reduce soil evaporation and improve water use in the root zone soil water variation between 50 dasm 5 days after the first irrigation and 77 dasm 1 day before the second irrigation in 2015 was the highest in prl 14 11 g g 1 followed by nrf 6 46 g g 1 ck 6 26 g g 1 and then prf 5 02 g g 1 at the 0 60 cm soil depth fig 4a and soil water content at 47 74 and 109 dasm in 2016 were lower in prl and nrf than in prf and ck at the 0 60 cm soil depth fig 4c indicating ridge furrow irrigation in prf could improve soil water use and save irrigation water soil water contents were higher in prf and lower in nrf than in ck indicating ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation having the strong ability of saving irrigation water the amounts of seasonal deep percolation induced by border furrow irrigation for ck prf prl and nrf in 2015 were 106 66 22 and 44 mm while in 2016 the values were 97 62 24 and 48 mm respectively the amounts of deep percolation for four treatments declined with the order of ck prf nrf and prl during the two experiments these findings implied that the amount of deep percolation was affected by irrigation amounts and plastic mulch ratios and low irrigation amount prl and no plastic mulching nrf resulting in a reduction in deep percolation the proportion of the amount of deep percolation in the total irrigation amount ranged from 9 3 to 29 5 these findings implied that the application of high irrigation amount can cause a higher proportion of irrigation water to be subject to deep percolation the amount of deep percolation was lower in 2016 than in 2015 despite high precipitation was in 2016 this may have been due to the low irrigation amount and high evaporation in 2016 table 2 and fig 2 which resulted in less water available for deep percolation compared with the ck treatment prf nrf and prl may have less effect on the water table depth and could substantially reduce the risk of secondary salinization in this area therefore it is crucial to control irrigation amount and find a suitable irrigation method in hetao irrigation district to reduce the risk of further salt accumulation and soil degradation 3 3 dynamics of soil salinity the distribution of ec e in the 0 120 cm soil profile of narrow row for four treatments at harvest in 2015 and 2016 are illustrated in fig 5 compared with the initial values at the seeding stage ec e in most treatments increased at harvest fig 5 indicating soil salt content increased after a maize season under irrigation precipitation and plant transpiration conditions these results were in agreement with findings of ren et al 2016 and liu et al 2017 among the four treatments ec e was the highest in prl followed by nrf prf and ck indicating that low irrigation amount prl and no plastic mulching nrf generally resulted in a higher salt accumulation in the root zone generally crops absorbed water from deeper soil layers when low irrigation amount could not satisfy crop water requirement thus soil water in deeper soil layer could move up to the upper soil layer and lastly result in a higher salt accumulation in the upper soil layer liu et al 2017 in this study soil salt increased mainly in the upper 80 cm soil layer fig 5 this region was similar to the soil water dynamic zone fig 3 indicating a coupling movement of water and salt soil salt at the 0 80 cm soil depth was even higher in prl than in the other treatments this was due to plant root absorbing water but leaving salt at the 0 80 cm soil depth in prl resulting in a higher salt accumulation in this soil layer which could explain why rebound in salinity was even greater in prl than in the other treatments at the 0 80 cm soil depth during the irrigation period salts moved downward with irrigation water and upward with soil evaporation and plant transpiration fig 6 ec e at 45 dasm in 2015 was the highest in nrf 8 69 ds m 1 at the 0 60 cm soil depth fig 6a indicating plastic mulching significantly affected soil salt variation ec e increased from 50 to 77 dasm in 2015 and was greater at the 0 60 cm soil depth than at the 60 120 cm soil depth because of soil water moving up from the 60 120 cm soil layer and salt also moving up to the upper 60 cm soil layer fig 6a and b ec e from 47 to 139 dasm in 2016 was the highest in prl 7 91 ds m 1 followed by nrf 7 34 ds m 1 prf 5 31 ds m 1 and ck 5 19 ds m 1 at the 0 60 cm soil depth whereas the highest in nrf 5 58 ds m 1 followed by ck 5 32 ds m 1 prf 4 96 ds m 1 and prl 4 94 ds m 1 at the 60 120 cm soil depth fig 6c and d this indicated that ridge with plastic mulch furrow with a suitable irrigation amount about 300 mm could enhance the ability of alleviating soil salinity and improving spring maize growth environment in hetao irrigation district in this study ec e in most treatments were higher than 10 0 ds m 1 in the upper 20 cm soil layer at harvest in 2015 whereas the reverse occurred in 2016 this may be due to the low precipitation amount about 15 mm and no irrigation at harvest in 2015 and high precipitation amount 122 mm in 2016 however ec e in all treatments were lower than 6 2 ds m 1 in the 20 120 cm soil layer in both years this may be due to the high groundwater level and the low salt content in the irrigation water 0 5 g l 1 this phenomenon was in agreement with the previous reports in which ec e decreased with the groundwater level increasing yu et al 2010 liu et al 2017 for prf ec e was basically less than the other treatments and irrigation amount was less than 60 mm than that in ck therefore prf was recommended with the objective of alleviating soil salinity and saving irrigation water 3 4 spring maize yield dry matter and water use efficiency the maize yields ranged from 10611 to 15578 kg ha 1 in the two seasons table 4 which were similar to the results found by ren et al 2016 and wang et al 2015 in the same region which had similar soil salinity levels and climatic conditions meanwhile the average ece at the 0 120 cm soil depth ranged from 4 1 to 5 2 ds m 1 in 2015 and from 4 2 to 6 1 ds m 1 in 2016 figs 5 and 6 and the surface soil salt 0 20 cm was higher than 7 2 ds m 1 before each irrigation event and at harvest this indicated that spring maize yields were not seriously affected by soil salinity which is because that high salinity only appeared in the 0 20 cm soil layer before each irrigation event and at harvest due to no irrigation and decayed maize leaves at harvest for the same treatment spring maize yields in 2016 were higher than that in 2015 this may be due to the different climatic conditions irrigation amounts fig 2 and table 3 and soil salinity levels figs 5 and 6 compared with the ck treatment the average grain yields in the prf prl and nrf treatments were increased by 29 6 12 2 and 14 4 in 2015 and increased by 5 5 4 2 and 2 5 in 2016 respectively one reason may be that plastic mulching on ridge can reduce soil evaporation increase topsoil temperature retain soil water and ridge furrow irrigation can improve the environment of sunlight temperature and wind among the spring maize rows the other reason may be that the coupling of water and nitrogen enhance maize growth and grain yield under ridge furrow irrigation the traditional basin border irrigation generally used more irrigation which caused further deep seepage and nitrogen leaching xu et al 2012 ren et al 2016 and may negatively affect spring maize yield grain yield in prf was higher by 2 9 13 5 in 2015 and 1 3 3 0 in 2016 than that in nrf and prl respectively this may be mainly due to prf changing the soil water redistribution decreasing the soil salt concentration improving the balance of soil water salt and nitrogen and applying more irrigation water than prl did under the same irrigation amount conditions hundred grain weight hgw was higher in prf than in nrf under plastic mulching conditions hgw increased with the order of ck prl and prf in 2015 and 2016 perhaps as a result of sufficient n conservation and appropriate soil temperature in the ridge furrow irrigation treatments the high surface soil temperature that results from mulching may cause a shorter lag phase in grain filling and reduce photoassimilate production per unit of thermal time which may result in kernel abortion cantarero et al 1999 however hgm under mulched drip irrigation zhou et al 2017 liu et al 2017 was lower than hgw in this study this was mainly due to different irrigation methods irrigation amounts climatic conditions and planting densities dry matter dm exhibited different results for spring maize yields in both years fig 4 dm was higher in prf and lower in prl than in ck and nrf which indicated that irrigation amount and irrigation method affected plant height and leaf area index of spring maize this was because ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation improved the environment of wind sunlight and temperature among the crop rows which could enhance the productivity of spring maize in relation to the full irrigation in ck the mean depths of saved water were 60 mm 17 4 saving in prf and 120 mm 34 8 saving in prl in both years thus irrigation savings were low with prf which could enhance the productivity of spring maize and resulted in high dm and grain yield however irrigation conservation was very high with prl and resulted in severe water stress and reduced the dm of spring maize in addition hgw exhibited a close relationship with yield and dm in both years it can be concluded that yield variation was primarily attributable to hgw water use efficiencies wues ranged from 2 46 to 3 75 kg m 3 and irrigation water use efficiencies iwues ranged from 2 95 to 6 83 kg m 3 the highest wue was found in the treatment with prf in 2015 and in the treatment with prl in 2016 drought occurred in hetao irrigation district in 2015 and spring maize suffered severe water stress resulting in low grain yields for four experimental treatments however prf presented the greater ability for soil water conservation and evaporation loss reduction therefore wue was higher in prf than in ck prf and nrf in 2015 due to the high precipitation and shallow ground water level the water demand of spring maize was satisfied in 2016 and grain yields were not significantly different p 0 05 among the four treatments therefore the treatment with low irrigation amount prl had the higher wue than that with high irrigation amount ck prf and nrf in 2016 irrigation water use efficiency iwue was closely related with maize yields and irrigation amount iwue was lower in ck than in prl prf and nrf indicating ridge furrow irrigation affected plant growth and yield formation of spring maize in hetao irrigation district iwue was lower in prf than in prl whereas higher than in nrf no significant difference of iwue was found between nrf and prf in 2016 whereas the inverse situation was found in 2015 this may be due to the different climatic condition such as precipitation and soil environment which resulted in the abovementioned phenomenon the other reason may be that high irrigation amount decreased irrigation water use efficiency and ridge not covered by plastic film negatively affected spring maize yield 4 conclusions soil water and salt mainly changed in the upper 80 cm soil layer under ridge furrow irrigation and border irrigation the amount of deep percolation in the total irrigation amount ranged from 9 3 to 29 5 and the highest deep percolation amount occurred in ck less amount of irrigation prl resulted in a reduction in deep percolation and a higher salt accumulation in the upper 40 cm soil layer at harvest the highest salt accumulation appeared in prl and the lowest salt accumulation appeared in prf among the three ridge furrow irrigation treatments grain yields under the three ridge furrow irrigation treatments were higher by 12 2 29 6 in 2015 and 2 5 5 6 in 2016 than that in ck respectively grain yield in prf was higher by 2 9 13 5 in 2015 and 1 3 3 0 in 2016 than that in nrf and prl respectively the highest wue was found in the treatment with prf in 2015 and in the treatment with prl in 2016 iwue was lower in ck than in prl nrf and prf indicating ridge furrow irrigation affected plant growth and yield formation of spring maize in hetao irrigation district iwue was lower in prf than in prl whereas higher than in ck and nrf this study region is characterized by low rainfall and high evaporative potential contrary it is the main grain production region in china because of the rich water resources from the yellow river with the increasing water demand to support the development of economy water allocation for irrigation is decreasing in the subsequent years xu et al 2010 therefore traditional basin flood irrigation practice with the objective of maximum yield should be changed to a scheduling with the objective of achieving both high yield and wue while controlling soil salinity when the discharge of yellow river is not enough to satisfy the agricultural water demand and economic water demand in hetao irrigation district ridge with plastic mulch furrow irrigation method with about 300 mm of irrigation is recommend for spring maize to produce the optimal grain yield and water use efficiency without inducing soil salinization problem caused by salt accumulation acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key research and development program of china

11547,plastic film mulching pfm plays a critical role in improving crop production and sustainable development of agroecosystem in semiarid agriculture arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf can form a mutualistic symbiosis with the vast majority of plant roots and have been shown to contribute to host growth in harsh conditions yet whether the integrated application of pfm and amf inoculation have an interactive effect on crop growth and production in semiarid regions with poor soil nutrients and water shortage has received rather less attention therefore we performed a two year field study to investigate the effects of pfm and amf inoculation on spring maize growth yield and water use efficiency wue four treatments including non mulching and non amf inoculation ck plastic film mulching pfm arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation amf and combination of plastic film mulching and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation pamf were compared in 2014 and 2015 at shenmu country on the semiarid loess plateau of northwest china our results indicated that amf inoculation contributed to increased plant biomass and height although its effectiveness was lower than pfm alone or combined practice compared with the non mulched control ck the mulched treatments significantly increased the average soil water content by 43 2 at the depth of 0 60 cm in 2014 and by 30 3 at the depth of 0 30 cm in 2015 the combination of pfm and amf inoculation had the greatest soil water content at different soil depths in both years amf inoculation significantly improved root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length in both years meanwhile mycorrhizal plants under pfm had significantly greater root tip number and surface area when compared with the control pamf treatment had the highest yield and wue among all treatments compared with the ck pamf treatment increased the yield and wue by55 6 and 43 1 in 2014 and by 39 3 and 45 6 in 2015 respectively moreover the mycorrhizal dependency of maize yield was more notable in mycorrhizal plants grown in mulched soils than in bare soils in conclusion the combined application of pfm and amf inoculation is an effective and favorable agricultural practice in nutrition deficiency soil in semiarid regions of china because of improved root morphological traits and enhanced topsoil water content that increase crop productivity keywords plastic film mulching arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi root mycorrhizal colonization root morphology mycorrhizal dependency water use efficiency 1 introduction soil mulching with plastic film is an important agricultural practice that has been widely adopted in the semiarid 200 400 mm annual rainfall agricultural system in china li et al 2004a b zhou et al 2009 this agricultural practice has been proved to be beneficial both directly and indirectly to crop growth such as increasing soil moisture temperature zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 enhancing water use efficiency wang et al 2011 improving nutrient availability in soils fang et al 2011 weed control steinmetz et al 2016 and promoting higher agricultural production zhou et al 2009 gao et al 2014 with relatively low investment costs zhu et al 2017 spring maize zea mays l is one of the main grain crops traditionally planted in the semiarid loess plateau of northwestern china but both nutrient deficiency and drought in april may constitute a major obstacle to maize growth and yield liu et al 2009 wang et al 2011 since plastic film mulching pfm has been introduced crops in this region have received great benefits of improved water use efficiency and high quality yields hence it is considered a promising agricultural practice especially in rain fed regions zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 wang et al 2016 so far numerous studies on cultivation of crops under pfm have focused on water use efficiency and yield between different film mulching patterns gao et al 2014 such as full plastic film mulching with traditional flat planting or with ridge and furrow zhou et al 2009 and or only covering the ridges with plastic film mulching but not furrows zhao et al 2014 especially in combination with tillage liu et al 2009 irrigation amount du et al 2006 liu et al 2011 and mulching duration li et al 2004b hou et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 however the above practice may not last for a long term pathway to sustain the succeeding growth and high production of crops there have been substantial adverse effects of pfm over the long term for example pfm can accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter li et al 2004a and change soil structure liu et al 2012b thereby affecting root development and reducing yield therefore farmers need to invest more inorganic fertilizers which poses a risk to agricultural environmental sustainability arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf are the most widespread mutualistic symbionts that form symbiosis with host plant roots hart et al 2003 amf have received increasing attention worldwide because of their noteworthy contribution to the enhancement of nutrients availability especially p and water uptake veresoglou et al 2012 as well as improving tolerance towards environmental stress augé 2001 rillig and steinberg 2002 wu and xia 2006 considering the major benefits of amf symbiosis under adverse environmental conditions nutrient deficiency drought or degraded soils requena et al 2001 al karaki et al 2004 taheri and bever 2010 enhancement of amf symbiosis is often sought in most agricultural systems through the application of amf agents beneficial plant amf interactions have been reported for maize liu et al 2002 wheat al karaki et al 2004 zhu et al 2017 onion bolandnazar et al 2007 and watermelon mo et al 2016 however whether pfm in combination with amf inoculum can increase nutrient and water use efficiency has received little attention here we studied the effects of an integrated pfm and amf inoculation farming practice on maize growth yield and water use efficiency two year field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 on the semiarid loess plateau of china plant height and biomass root morphology i e tip number length volume surface area and diameter of root soil water content and yield were investigated in this study specifically the aims of this study were to examine the effects of amf inoculation on growth performance water use efficiency and yield of maize under pfm condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were carried out in 2014 and 2015 at daliuta experimental station shenmu country

to cultivate spring maize in 2014 and 2015 in an effort to reduce the interference of indigenous mycorrhizal fungi and the decomposition of root debris in both years a completely randomized block design with a split plot arrangement for the treatments was used with three replicates the main plot included two plastic film mulching patterns plastic film mulching and non mulching and the subplot included two amf inoculation levels amf inoculation and non inoculation therefore four treatments were applied in this study namely non mulching with non amf inoculation as the control ck plastic film mulching pfm arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation amf and combination of plastic film mulching and arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation pamf for the mulched plots small holes were made in the film to sow seeds and then heaped with a handful of soil there was no gap between the films and the edges were tied tightly under the soil the transparent polyethylene plastic film of 0 008 mm thickness and 80 cm width was adopted over maize growth period in both years for the mycorrhizal treatment an amount of 110 g amf inoculum was placed into the corresponding hole for each plant at planting the amf inoculum funneliformis mosseae bgc xj01 were provided by beijing academy of agriculture and forestry science and cultivated in sterile sand with maize as host plant for three months the amf inoculum consisted of spores 3850 spores per 100 g soil external mycelium and infected root fragments 90 root mycorrhizal colonization plots were prepared by plowing and harrowing by rotary tilling raker machine and fertilizer application the amounts of n p and k applied were 158 7 kg n ha 1 42 3 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 59 1 kg k2o ha 1 seeds were sown hole by hole manually at a 5 cm depth maize cv zhedan no 7 was planted on april 27 and harvested on september 28 in 2014 the corresponding dates in 2015 were may 13 and september 26 in 2014 each treatment plot was 2 4 m wide by 5 4 m long with 6 plant rows and a planting density of 50 000 plants ha while each treatment plot in 2015 was designed as 2 m 5 m with 4 plant rows and a planting density of 36 000 plants ha all the experimental plots were irrigated with 50 mm water on june 16 and 50 mm water on august 2 in 2014 while those in 2015 were irrigated with 50 mm water on june 20 august 10 and august 30 weeds were manually removed at regular intervals 2 3 crop sampling and measurement weather data in 2014 and 2015 were obtained from decagon em50 microclimate monitoring system pullman wa usa at the experimental site fig 1 ten individual plants in an s shape in the center of each plot were chosen so as to reduce the edge effect and marked for measurement of growth parameters at bell mouthing stage july 6 in 2014 and july 15 in 2015 grain filling stage august 10 in 2014 and august 16 in 2015 and maturity stage september 20 in both 2014 and 2015 plant height was measured directly with steel tape at a 15 day interval after harvest aboveground leaf stem and grain and root of maize the depth of about 0 50 cm were dried in an oven at 80 c until the weight is constant the plant biomass was measured meanwhile two groups of 15 randomly selected samples of 1 5 cm long root segments in each plot n 150 were stained with 0 05 trypan blue phillips and hayman 1970 for measuring of root mycorrhizal colonization rmc which was calculated as the number of infected root segments divided by total observed root segments giovannetti and mosse 1980 grains of ten plants in each plot were weighed for yield after threshed manually and dried at 80 c mycorrhizal dependency md was calculated by the maize yields using the following formula m d g r a i n y i e l d a m g r a i n y i e l d a m g r a i n y i l e d a m 100 where am and am stand for maize with amf inoculation and without amf inoculation respectively dynamics of root morphology in 2015 was measured using the ci 600 root observation system cid bio science camas wa usa the device was installed at an angle of 45 with the ground in the center of each plot before sowing during the observation period root scanning images were captured at three crop growth stages and then analyzed and processed into root information i e root tip number root length root volume root surface area and root diameter using the ci 600 rootsnap image analysis software 2 4 soil measurement rhizosphere soil samples were periodically taken from the corresponding harvested plants we used a wide shovel to collect soils surrounding the roots in 0 20 cm soil profile external hyphal length ehl in the rhizosphere soil was measured by method of vacuum pump and membrane filtration jakobsen et al 1992 briefly 2 g soil samples were shaken vigorously with 250 ml distilled water and washed through a 300 mesh sieve into the blender to retain the roots the washings were collected and blended at a high speed for 30 s in a waring blender rapidly transferred to a flask and stirred by hand shaking and placed on the bench for 60 s 10 ml aliquots were pipetted onto a millipore filter in a filtration the filter was covered with lactic glycerol trypan blue for 5 min then cut into halves and transferred to microscope slides to dry the hyphae were measured using a grid intersection method in 25 fields of view at 200 magnification for each half filter two cores in each plot were taken using a soil drill 50 mm diameter 200 mm height for measurement of soil water content swc soil water storage sws was measured gravimetrically at 10 cm intervals down to a depth of 1 m before planting and after harvest groundwater supply below 1 m is negligible because of the lower groundwater table at the experiment site zhu et al 2017 sws was calculated using the following formula s w s s w c ρ h where sws mm is soil water storage swc is soil water content ρ g cm 3 is the soil bulk density which is 1 45 g cm 3 in 0 100 cm on average and h mm is the soil depth therefore evapotranspiration et was calculated using the equation e t p i δ s w s where p mm i mm and sws mm represent total growing season precipitation irrigation water and the difference of sws between sowing and harvest respectively water use efficiency wue was determined by the ratio of grain yield to evapotranspiration over growing season and calculated as follows gholamhoseini et al 2013 w u e y e t where wue kg ha 1 mm 1 is the water use efficiency of grain yield and y kg ha 1 is grain yield 2 5 statistics all data were analyzed statistically using sas vers 8 0 sas institute cary nc usa two way anova analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of pfm and amf inoculation based on the least significant difference lsd test at 5 level excel 2010 was used to process the data and figures 3 results and discussion 3 1 plant height and biomass maize from the mulched plots were significantly taller than those from the non mulched plots 70 days after sowing in both growing seasons fig 2 regardless of the presence or absence of mycorrhizal inoculation p 0 05 there were no differences in plant height between non mycorrhizal plants and mycorrhizal plants in non mulched or mulched plots pfm treatment significantly increased plant height at the early growth period compared with amf treatment p 0 05 but it tended to be similar between the two treatments at maturity the combined application of pfm and amf inoculation showed the highest plant height during both years with increased plant height plant biomass also increased fig 3 compared with the ck plant biomass was markedly higher under pamf treatment in 2014 and under amf pfm and pamf treatments in 2015 p 0 05 among all the plots the pamf plot produced the highest plant biomass in both years with 23 797 kg ha 1 in 2014 and 14 850 kg ha 1 in 2015 interestingly the difference of plant biomass between amf and ck treatment was not significant in 2014 but significant in 2015 in the current study pfm alone or in combination with amf inoculation had positive impacts on crop growth in both years with regard to both plant height and biomass accumulation previous studies have shown that higher soil temperature and improved soil moisture throughout the growth period are two possible explanations for these benefits liu et al 2011 an early study conducted in a nearby site observed that pfm provided higher temperature in each soil layer during the early growing season and promoted seeding germination li et al 2013 our study also found that pfm improved seeding emergence through compensating for low temperature and drought during sowing emergence especially in dry 2015 when there was no rainfall for 10 days after sowing fig 1 the seeding emergence was advanced by 3 5 days in mulched plots than in controls data not shown which thereby promoted the growth and developmental progress of maize thus plant height and biomass accumulation were significantly greater throughout the maize growing season under mulched plots when compared with the controls p 0 05 amf inoculation only displayed a slightly higher plant height and biomass in two growing seasons owing to the contribution of amf colonization and external hyphae in the rhizosphere soil table 1 well formed symbiosis between fungi and the host plants can extend fungal mycelium from mycorrhizal roots and construct a huge mycelium network rillig and steinberg 2002 to take in more mineral nutrients and water from soil and transfer them to the host plant ruth et al 2011 moreover the mycelium also provides a bonding mechanism to stabilize soil aggregates through secreting glomalin for water and nutrients storage rillig 2004 our experiment demonstrated that amf inoculation could improve crop growth although its promoting effect was less than the mulching treatments 3 2 dynamics of soil water content at three crop growth stages the application of pfm and amf inoculum both affected soil water content across the 0 100 cm soil depth during two experimental years and the dynamics varied with soil layers and growth stages fig 4 at bell mouthing and grain filling stages in 2014 the two mulched treatments markedly improved soil water content as compared with the two non mulched treatments at the depths of 0 60 cm fig 4a and b similarly at maturity stage soil water content was significantly higher in mulched plots than in non mulched plots for 0 50 cm soil depth p 0 05 fig 4c averaged across the depth of 0 60 cm the pamf and pfm treatments improved soil water content by 35 1 and 28 7 when compared with the amf treatment and by 46 7 and 39 8 when compared with the ck respectively generally soil water content across three growth stages was the highest in maize under the pamf treatment followed by pfm amf and ck treatments similarly in topsoil soil water content differed significantly between the mulched and non mulched treatments in 2015 while there were no significant differences between the two mulched or non mulched treatments except for that between two non mulched soils 30 40 cm at bell mouthing stage or that between two mulched soils 60 80 cm at maturity stage fig 4d f at the 0 30 cm soil depth the pamf plot contained 33 7 20 1 and 25 4 more water in soil than the pfm amf and ck plots respectively at bell mouthing stage p 0 05 fig 4d at grain filling stage the corresponding values were 5 2 34 9 and 46 7 respectively when compared with the other three treatments p 0 05 fig 4e at maturity the differences in soil water content between the mulched and non mulched treatments were detected at the depth of 0 60 cm where the average soil water content in pamf treatment was 6 2 31 0 and 28 6 higher than that in the pfm amf and ck treatments respectively p 0 05 fig 4f nevertheless there were no significant differences in soil water content among treatments at the 60 100 cm soil depth in 2014 and 2015 likewise mycorrhizal inoculation showed no significant effect on soil water content in either mulched or non mulched plants over two growing seasons as reported previously pfm can greatly improve soil moisture thereby affecting crop growth in dryland agriculture zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 this was also demonstrated in our experiment as both mulched treatments increased soil moisture condition throughout growth period showing a remarkable difference in the shallow soil layer compared with the non mulched treatments but no significant difference in the deep soil layer which was similar to the results of liu et al 2009 for maize and zhao et al 2012 for potato generally water goes into the root zones through the film bore and furrow and thus enhances the retention of soil water in mulched soil thereby increasing the rainfall or irrigation water utilization efficiency in addition the remarkable difference in soil water content between mulched and non mulched plots was mostly in the 0 60 cm layer in 2014 while that was in the 0 30 cm soil layer in 2015 this might be related to different amount of rainfall in this region during the growth period in the two years the precipitation throughout the maize growth period was 348 mm in 2014 while it was 175 mm in 2015 which was a severe dry year our study also found that amf inoculation alone could improve soil water status during the crop growth period but its effectiveness was much less than pfm practice symbiotic relationship can contribute to stable soil aggregation formation and thus enable the storage of more water by the action of mycelia and exudation of glomalin a glycoprotein that acts as a soil particle binding agent wright and anderson 2000 driver et al 2005 although amf had little effect on soil water content in both years the interactive effect of amf and pfm on soil moisture cannot be ignored compared with the ck pamf treated soil had the highest water content among the three treatments this may primarily because pfm enhanced soil water content at different soil depths in dry 2015 and provided a better soil microenvironment to the mycorrhizal formation zhu et al 2017 thereby promoting the development of larger root system in mycorrhizal plants which had a positive impact on soil water availability kirkegaard et al 1997 liu et al 2012a 3 3 root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length across the growing seasons in both years exotic amf inoculation influenced root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length and the effect varied with crop growth stage in the presence or absence of pfm table 1 as expected mycorrhizal infection occurred in plants in all plots due to the presence of indigenous mycorrhizal fungi in soils or the addition of exotic amf inoculum the exotic amf inoculation improved the root mycorrhizal colonization in mycorrhizal plants in 2014 and 2015 regardless of whether covered with film mulching or not for example plants inoculated with amf significantly increased root mycorrhizal colonization by 55 5 52 8 and 71 5 at bell mouthing grain filling and maturity stage p 0 05 respectively in comparison with the ck treatment in 2015 in the meantime amf inoculation also significantly improved the external hyphal length in both experimental years p 0 05 with an exception for amf treatment in 2014 notably both root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length were the highest in pamf treated plants researches on mycorrhizal fungi have been carried out from greenhouse or indoor simulation to field trial in recent years and have achieved some progress jeffries et al 2003 gosling et al 2006 barber et al 2013 however the promotional effect of amf inoculation on crop growth and productivity in most agroecosystems remains uncertain bonanomi et al 2017 because the function of amf symbiosis in the agroecosystems is often influenced by agricultural management practices such as chemical fertilizer tillage and pesticides application etc mathimaran et al 2007 alguacil et al 2008 in this study amf inoculation significantly improved root mycorrhizal colonization in 2015 and external hyphal length in both years showing a good symbiotic relationship between the mycorrhizal fungi and maize roots we found that amf inoculation significantly improved the amount of extraradical hyphae and the maize in amf inoculated soils had better growth performance figs 2 and 3 and yield table 2 indicating that the amf inoculum may play a crucial role in plant growth in the semiarid agricultural system liu et al 2012b reported that the responses of amf symbiosis to the variation of soil properties could be affected by pfm possibly the higher soil temperature or water content by pfm contributed to higher mycorrhizal colonization of roots and external hyphal length mohammad et al 1998 zhu et al 2017 which improved amf growth and mycorrhizal formation in the rhizosphere soil and further resulted in greater improvement of plant growth on the basis of pfm 3 4 root morphological traits the temporal variations of root morphological indices across all treatments at three crop growth stages in 2015 were shown in fig 5 reflecting tip number length volume surface area and diameter of maize root root tip number increased slightly from bell mouthing to grain filling stage and then increased substantially from grain filling to maturity stages fig 5a mycorrhizal plants especially those under pamf treatment showed significantly higher root tip number than the ck treatment at three crop growth stages p 0 05 the root length also increased with maize growth stages but no significant differences between treatments were found in root length at any crop growth stage fig 5b averaged across three growth stages the root length of pamf treated plants was 9 3 and 23 5 greater than that of pfm and ck treatments respectively the root length of amf treated plants was similar to that of pamf treated plants root volume largely mirrors the root length the root volume of pamf treated plants was markedly higher than that of pfm treated or ck plants s at maturity p 0 05 fig 5c unlike the trend of root tip number there was a rapid growth period for root surface area from bell mouthing to grain filling stage while it was slightly decreased at maturity fig 5d pamf treated plants had a similar dynamics of root surface area to that of the amf treated plants at all three growth stages the root surface area of plants under pamf or amf treatment was significantly greater than that of the ck p 0 05 for all treatments root diameter was mostly in the order of pamf amf pfm ck treatment ranging from 0 92 mm to 1 21 mm across three growth stages fig 5e the lowest root diameter was consistently found in ck treatment at three crop growth stages but there were no significant differences when compared with the other three treatments root morphology plays a crucial role in nutrients and water uptake in soils for plant growth in semiarid regions lynch 2007 the vigorous and deeper root system can greatly increase the absorption of nutrients and water and consequently improves crop growth in stress environments in dry 2015 plants colonized with amf or associated with pfm displayed substantial differences than those in the ck treatment with respect to root morphological indices showing a strong fungal inoculation effect on root tip number and surface area across the rooting zones earlier studies found that increased indole 3 butyric acid biosynthesis in mycorrhizal plants plays a major role in root phenotype with increase in branching and fine roots kaldorf and ludwig müller 2000 reduction in root necrosis norman et al 1996 and specific root length espeleta et al 1999 in particular soil in this studied region is characterized by nutrient deficiency amf symbiosis can increase nutrient availability in soils to the rooting zones thus amf inoculation might be beneficial to root development although complex factors such as soil temperature water content nutrient availability and shoot development may greatly affect the development of plant root systems in the soil liedgens and richner 2001 fageria 2005 in addition pfm treated crops had greater root system than ck treated crops in dry 2015 increased soil moisture environment of pfm was considered beneficial for distinct root morphological traits gao et al 2014 kang et al 2000 investigated the root morphology and its distribution in maize treated with different irrigation methods and found noticeable higher primary root number and root density in plants with alternate furrow irrigation when compared with those with conventional furrow irrigation their results agreed with our results that mulched maize had suitable soil moisture for root development overall our data illustrated that variation in root morphological indices of maize especially root tip number and surface area was higher with amf inoculation compared with pfm practice 3 5 yield and wue of maize yield and wue of maize significantly differed between treatments in both growing seasons table 2 maize yield in mulched plots was significantly higher than in non mulched plots during both experimental years p 0 05 the highest maize yield was achieved in pamf treatment in both years and the percentages of increase were 55 6 in 2014 and 39 3 in 2015 compared with the ck treatment the mycorrhizal dependency of mulched plants was 24 7 in 2014 and 3 6 in 2015 showing greater amplifying effect on maize yield when plants were subjected to film mulching condition similar to yield wue of maize was higher in three treatments over two growing seasons compared with the ck treatment table 2 pfm treatment significantly increased the wue by 14 9 in 2014 and 35 2 in 2015 when compared with the ck treatment p 0 05 in particular pamf treatment caused the most significant increases of wue in both years with 43 1 increase in 2014 and 45 6 in 2015 relative to the ck treatment p 0 05 however there were no significant differences in wue between the two mulched or non mulched treatments with an exception for pamf treatment in 2014 which was markedly higher than pfm treatment in the present study the most pronounced beneficial effect on maize yield and wue was observed with combination treatment of pfm and amf inoculation as a result higher wue and the significantly improved root morphology traits especially root surface area might be the most plausible reasons for the highest yield in the pamf treatment on one hand the combined practice had the highest wue in both years which was the key factor in coping with water shortage in semiarid regions to achieve maximum yield film mulching decreased the unproductive evaporation from soil and it might increase vegetation transpiration with the vigorous growth in later growing period consequently leading to relatively higher evapotranspiration in mulched plots but simultaneously significantly higher yield and accordingly increased wue table 2 on the other hand the combined practice had higher root tip number and surface area fig 5a and c across three growth stages thereby contributing to higher nutrients absorption apart from the rhizosphere simple correlation analysis between maize yield and root morphological indices at three growth stages showed that both maize yield and biomass were significantly correlated with root surface area p 0 05 table 3 considering the two aspects above amf inoculation could improve greater root morphology and enhance wue to produce higher yield on the basis of pfm furthermore mycorrhizal dependency of crop was higher in maize grown in mulched plots than in non mulched plots indicating that the performance of amf could be improved under film mulching condition 4 conclusion in summary this study showed that pfm in combination with amf inoculation improved maize growth environment in semiarid regions of china the combined practice significantly improved soil water content in topsoil thus regulating the root distribution improved root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length promoted plant height and biomass accumulation thereby significantly increasing crop yield and water use efficiency when compared with the controls therefore the combined treatment can be considered as an efficient agricultural practice in semiarid regions since the combined practice could result in better performance of maize growth further mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the interaction between plastic film mulching and amf inoculation involving soil nutrient availability acknowledgements

11547,plastic film mulching pfm plays a critical role in improving crop production and sustainable development of agroecosystem in semiarid agriculture arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf can form a mutualistic symbiosis with the vast majority of plant roots and have been shown to contribute to host growth in harsh conditions yet whether the integrated application of pfm and amf inoculation have an interactive effect on crop growth and production in semiarid regions with poor soil nutrients and water shortage has received rather less attention therefore we performed a two year field study to investigate the effects of pfm and amf inoculation on spring maize growth yield and water use efficiency wue four treatments including non mulching and non amf inoculation ck plastic film mulching pfm arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation amf and combination of plastic film mulching and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation pamf were compared in 2014 and 2015 at shenmu country on the semiarid loess plateau of northwest china our results indicated that amf inoculation contributed to increased plant biomass and height although its effectiveness was lower than pfm alone or combined practice compared with the non mulched control ck the mulched treatments significantly increased the average soil water content by 43 2 at the depth of 0 60 cm in 2014 and by 30 3 at the depth of 0 30 cm in 2015 the combination of pfm and amf inoculation had the greatest soil water content at different soil depths in both years amf inoculation significantly improved root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length in both years meanwhile mycorrhizal plants under pfm had significantly greater root tip number and surface area when compared with the control pamf treatment had the highest yield and wue among all treatments compared with the ck pamf treatment increased the yield and wue by55 6 and 43 1 in 2014 and by 39 3 and 45 6 in 2015 respectively moreover the mycorrhizal dependency of maize yield was more notable in mycorrhizal plants grown in mulched soils than in bare soils in conclusion the combined application of pfm and amf inoculation is an effective and favorable agricultural practice in nutrition deficiency soil in semiarid regions of china because of improved root morphological traits and enhanced topsoil water content that increase crop productivity keywords plastic film mulching arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi root mycorrhizal colonization root morphology mycorrhizal dependency water use efficiency 1 introduction soil mulching with plastic film is an important agricultural practice that has been widely adopted in the semiarid 200 400 mm annual rainfall agricultural system in china li et al 2004a b zhou et al 2009 this agricultural practice has been proved to be beneficial both directly and indirectly to crop growth such as increasing soil moisture temperature zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 enhancing water use efficiency wang et al 2011 improving nutrient availability in soils fang et al 2011 weed control steinmetz et al 2016 and promoting higher agricultural production zhou et al 2009 gao et al 2014 with relatively low investment costs zhu et al 2017 spring maize zea mays l is one of the main grain crops traditionally planted in the semiarid loess plateau of northwestern china but both nutrient deficiency and drought in april may constitute a major obstacle to maize growth and yield liu et al 2009 wang et al 2011 since plastic film mulching pfm has been introduced crops in this region have received great benefits of improved water use efficiency and high quality yields hence it is considered a promising agricultural practice especially in rain fed regions zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 wang et al 2016 so far numerous studies on cultivation of crops under pfm have focused on water use efficiency and yield between different film mulching patterns gao et al 2014 such as full plastic film mulching with traditional flat planting or with ridge and furrow zhou et al 2009 and or only covering the ridges with plastic film mulching but not furrows zhao et al 2014 especially in combination with tillage liu et al 2009 irrigation amount du et al 2006 liu et al 2011 and mulching duration li et al 2004b hou et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 however the above practice may not last for a long term pathway to sustain the succeeding growth and high production of crops there have been substantial adverse effects of pfm over the long term for example pfm can accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter li et al 2004a and change soil structure liu et al 2012b thereby affecting root development and reducing yield therefore farmers need to invest more inorganic fertilizers which poses a risk to agricultural environmental sustainability arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf are the most widespread mutualistic symbionts that form symbiosis with host plant roots hart et al 2003 amf have received increasing attention worldwide because of their noteworthy contribution to the enhancement of nutrients availability especially p and water uptake veresoglou et al 2012 as well as improving tolerance towards environmental stress augé 2001 rillig and steinberg 2002 wu and xia 2006 considering the major benefits of amf symbiosis under adverse environmental conditions nutrient deficiency drought or degraded soils requena et al 2001 al karaki et al 2004 taheri and bever 2010 enhancement of amf symbiosis is often sought in most agricultural systems through the application of amf agents beneficial plant amf interactions have been reported for maize liu et al 2002 wheat al karaki et al 2004 zhu et al 2017 onion bolandnazar et al 2007 and watermelon mo et al 2016 however whether pfm in combination with amf inoculum can increase nutrient and water use efficiency has received little attention here we studied the effects of an integrated pfm and amf inoculation farming practice on maize growth yield and water use efficiency two year field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 on the semiarid loess plateau of china plant height and biomass root morphology i e tip number length volume surface

design with a split plot arrangement for the treatments was used with three replicates the main plot included two plastic film mulching patterns plastic film mulching and non mulching and the subplot included two amf inoculation levels amf inoculation and non inoculation therefore four treatments were applied in this study namely non mulching with non amf inoculation as the control ck plastic film mulching pfm arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation amf and combination of plastic film mulching and arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation pamf for the mulched plots small holes were made in the film to sow seeds and then heaped with a handful of soil there was no gap between the films and the edges were tied tightly under the soil the transparent polyethylene plastic film of 0 008 mm thickness and 80 cm width was adopted over maize growth period in both years for the mycorrhizal treatment an amount of 110 g amf inoculum was placed into the corresponding hole for each plant at planting the

were irrigated with 50 mm water on june 16 and 50 mm water on august 2 in 2014 while those in 2015 were irrigated with 50 mm water on june 20 august 10 and august 30 weeds were manually removed at regular intervals 2 3 crop sampling and measurement weather data in 2014 and 2015 were obtained from decagon em50 microclimate monitoring system pullman wa usa at the experimental site fig 1 ten individual plants in an s shape in the center of each plot were chosen so as to reduce the edge effect and marked for measurement of growth parameters at bell mouthing stage july 6 in 2014 and july 15 in 2015 grain filling stage august 10 in 2014 and august 16 in 2015 and maturity stage september 20 in both 2014 and 2015 plant height was measured directly with steel tape at a 15 day interval after harvest aboveground leaf stem and grain and root of maize the depth of about 0 50 cm were dried in an oven at 80 c until the weight is constant the plant biomass was measured meanwhile two groups of 15 randomly selected samples of 1 5 cm long root segments in each plot n 150 were stained with 0 05 trypan blue phillips and hayman 1970 for measuring of root mycorrhizal colonization rmc which was calculated as the number of infected root segments divided by total observed root segments giovannetti and mosse 1980 grains of ten plants in each plot were weighed for yield after threshed manually and dried at 80 c mycorrhizal dependency md was calculated by the maize yields using the following formula m d g r a i n y i e l d a m g r a i n y i e l d a m g r a i n y i l e d a m 100 where am and am stand for maize with amf inoculation and without amf inoculation respectively dynamics of root morphology in 2015 was measured using the ci 600 root observation system cid bio science camas wa usa the device was installed at an angle of 45 with the ground in the center of each plot before sowing during the observation period root scanning images were captured at three crop growth stages and then analyzed and processed into root information i e root tip number root length root volume root surface area and root diameter using the ci 600 rootsnap image analysis software 2 4 soil measurement rhizosphere soil samples were periodically taken from the corresponding harvested plants we used a wide shovel to collect soils surrounding the roots in 0 20 cm soil profile external hyphal length ehl in the rhizosphere soil was measured by method of vacuum pump and membrane filtration jakobsen et al 1992 briefly 2 g soil samples were shaken vigorously with 250 ml distilled water and washed through a 300 mesh sieve into the blender to retain the roots the washings were collected and blended at a high speed for 30 s in a waring blender rapidly transferred to a flask and stirred by hand shaking and placed on the bench for 60 s 10 ml aliquots were pipetted onto a millipore filter in a filtration the filter was covered with lactic glycerol trypan blue for 5 min then cut into halves and transferred to microscope slides to dry the hyphae were measured using a grid intersection method in 25 fields of view at 200 magnification for each half filter two cores in each plot were taken using a soil drill 50 mm diameter 200 mm height for measurement of soil water content swc soil water storage sws was measured gravimetrically at 10 cm intervals down to a depth of 1 m before planting and after harvest groundwater supply below 1 m is negligible because of the lower groundwater table at the experiment site zhu et al 2017 sws was calculated using the following formula s w s s w c ρ h where sws mm is soil water storage swc is soil water content ρ g cm 3 is the soil bulk density which is 1 45 g cm 3 in 0 100 cm on average and h mm is the soil depth therefore evapotranspiration et was calculated using the equation e t p i δ s w s where p mm i mm and sws mm represent total growing season precipitation irrigation water and the difference of sws between sowing and harvest respectively water use efficiency wue was determined by the ratio of grain yield to evapotranspiration over growing season and calculated as follows gholamhoseini et al 2013 w u e y e t where wue kg ha 1 mm 1 is the water use efficiency of grain yield and y kg ha 1 is grain yield 2 5 statistics all data were analyzed statistically using sas vers 8 0 sas institute cary nc usa two way anova analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of pfm and amf inoculation based on the least significant difference lsd test at 5 level excel 2010 was used to process the data and figures 3 results and discussion 3 1 plant height and biomass maize from the mulched plots were significantly taller than those from the non mulched plots 70 days after sowing in both growing seasons fig 2 regardless of the presence or absence of mycorrhizal inoculation p 0 05 there were no differences in plant height between non mycorrhizal plants and mycorrhizal plants in non mulched or mulched plots pfm treatment significantly increased plant height at the early growth period compared with amf treatment p 0 05 but it tended to be similar between the two treatments at maturity the combined application of pfm and amf inoculation showed the highest plant height during both years with increased plant height plant biomass also increased fig 3 compared with the ck plant biomass was markedly higher under pamf treatment in 2014 and under amf pfm and pamf treatments in 2015 p 0 05 among all the plots the pamf plot produced the highest plant biomass in both years with 23 797 kg ha 1 in 2014 and 14 850 kg ha 1 in 2015 interestingly the difference of plant biomass between amf and ck treatment was not significant in 2014 but significant in 2015 in the current study pfm alone or in combination with amf inoculation had positive impacts on crop growth in both years with regard to both plant height and biomass accumulation previous studies have shown that higher soil temperature and improved soil moisture throughout the growth period are two possible explanations for these benefits liu et al 2011 an early study conducted in a nearby site observed that pfm provided higher temperature in each soil layer during the early growing season and promoted seeding germination li et al 2013 our study also found that pfm improved seeding emergence through compensating for low temperature and drought during sowing emergence especially in dry 2015 when there was no rainfall for 10 days after sowing fig 1 the seeding emergence was advanced by 3 5 days in mulched plots than in controls data not shown which thereby promoted the growth and developmental progress of maize thus plant height and biomass accumulation were significantly greater throughout the maize growing season under mulched plots when compared with the controls p 0 05 amf inoculation only displayed a slightly higher plant height and biomass in two growing seasons owing to the contribution of amf colonization and external hyphae in the rhizosphere soil table 1 well formed symbiosis between fungi and the host plants can extend fungal mycelium from mycorrhizal roots and construct a huge mycelium network rillig and steinberg 2002 to take in more mineral nutrients and water from soil and transfer them to the host plant ruth et al 2011 moreover the mycelium also provides a bonding mechanism to stabilize soil aggregates through secreting glomalin for water and nutrients storage rillig 2004 our experiment demonstrated that amf inoculation could improve crop growth although its promoting effect was less than the mulching treatments 3 2 dynamics of soil water content at three crop growth stages the application of pfm and amf inoculum both affected soil water content across the 0 100 cm soil depth during two experimental years and the dynamics varied with soil layers and growth stages fig 4 at bell mouthing and grain filling stages in 2014 the two mulched treatments markedly improved soil water content as compared with the two non mulched treatments at the depths of 0 60 cm fig 4a and b similarly at maturity stage soil water content was significantly higher in mulched plots than in non mulched plots for 0 50 cm soil depth p 0 05 fig 4c averaged across the depth of 0 60 cm the pamf and pfm treatments improved soil water content by 35 1 and 28 7 when compared with the amf treatment and by 46 7 and 39 8 when compared with the ck respectively generally soil water content across three growth stages was the highest in maize under the pamf treatment followed by pfm amf and ck treatments similarly in topsoil soil water content differed significantly between the mulched and non mulched treatments in 2015 while there were no significant differences between the two mulched or non mulched treatments except for that between two non mulched soils 30 40 cm at bell mouthing stage or that between two mulched soils 60 80 cm at maturity stage fig 4d f at the 0 30 cm soil depth the pamf plot contained 33 7 20 1 and 25 4 more water in soil than the pfm amf and ck plots respectively at bell mouthing stage p 0 05 fig 4d at grain filling stage the corresponding values were 5 2 34 9 and 46 7 respectively when compared with the other three treatments p 0 05 fig 4e at maturity the differences in soil water content between the mulched and non mulched treatments were detected at the depth of 0 60 cm where the average soil water content in pamf treatment was 6 2 31 0 and 28 6 higher than that in the pfm amf and ck treatments respectively p 0 05 fig 4f nevertheless there were no significant differences in soil water content among treatments at the 60 100 cm soil depth in 2014 and 2015 likewise mycorrhizal inoculation showed no significant effect on soil water content in either mulched or non mulched plants over two growing seasons as reported previously pfm can greatly improve soil moisture thereby affecting crop growth in dryland agriculture zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 this was also demonstrated in our experiment as both mulched treatments increased soil moisture condition throughout growth period showing a remarkable difference in the shallow soil layer compared with the non mulched treatments but no significant difference in the deep soil layer which was similar to the results of liu et al 2009 for maize and zhao et al 2012 for potato generally water goes into the root zones through the film bore and furrow and thus enhances the retention of soil water in mulched soil thereby increasing the rainfall or irrigation water utilization efficiency in addition the remarkable difference in soil water content between mulched and non mulched plots was mostly in the 0 60 cm layer in 2014 while that was in the 0 30 cm soil layer in 2015 this might be related to different amount of rainfall in this region during the growth period in the two years the precipitation throughout the maize growth period was 348 mm in 2014 while it was 175 mm in 2015 which was a severe dry year our study also found that amf inoculation alone could improve soil water status during the crop growth period but its effectiveness was much less than pfm practice symbiotic relationship can contribute to stable soil aggregation formation and thus enable the storage of more water by the action of mycelia and exudation of glomalin a glycoprotein that acts as a soil particle binding agent wright and anderson 2000 driver et al 2005 although amf had little effect on soil water content in both years the interactive effect of amf and pfm on soil moisture cannot be ignored compared with the ck pamf treated soil had the highest water content among the three treatments this may primarily because pfm enhanced soil water content at different soil depths in dry 2015 and provided a better soil microenvironment to the mycorrhizal formation zhu et al 2017 thereby promoting the development of larger root system in mycorrhizal plants which had a positive impact on soil water availability kirkegaard et al 1997 liu et al 2012a 3 3 root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length across the growing seasons in both years exotic amf inoculation influenced root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length and the effect varied with crop growth stage in the presence or absence of pfm table 1 as expected mycorrhizal infection occurred in plants in all plots due to the presence of indigenous mycorrhizal fungi in soils or the addition of exotic amf inoculum the exotic amf inoculation improved the root mycorrhizal colonization in mycorrhizal plants in 2014 and 2015 regardless of whether covered with film mulching or not for example plants inoculated with amf significantly increased root mycorrhizal colonization by 55 5 52 8 and 71 5 at bell mouthing grain filling and maturity stage p 0 05 respectively in comparison with the ck treatment in 2015 in the meantime amf inoculation also significantly improved the external hyphal length in both experimental years p 0 05 with an exception for amf treatment in 2014 notably both root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length were the highest in pamf treated plants researches on mycorrhizal fungi have been carried out from greenhouse or indoor simulation to field trial in recent years and have achieved some progress jeffries et al 2003 gosling et al 2006 barber et al 2013 however the promotional effect of amf inoculation on crop growth and productivity in most agroecosystems remains uncertain bonanomi et al 2017 because the function of amf symbiosis in the agroecosystems is often influenced by agricultural management practices such as chemical fertilizer tillage and pesticides application etc mathimaran et al 2007 alguacil et al 2008 in this study amf inoculation significantly improved root mycorrhizal colonization in 2015 and external hyphal length in both years showing a good symbiotic relationship between the mycorrhizal fungi and maize roots we found that amf inoculation significantly improved the amount of extraradical hyphae and the maize in amf inoculated soils had better growth performance figs 2 and 3 and yield table 2 indicating that the amf inoculum may play a crucial role in plant growth in the semiarid agricultural system liu et al 2012b reported that the responses of amf symbiosis to the variation of soil properties could be affected by pfm possibly the higher soil temperature or water content by pfm contributed to higher mycorrhizal colonization of roots and external hyphal length mohammad et al 1998 zhu et al 2017 which improved amf growth and mycorrhizal formation in the rhizosphere soil and further resulted in greater improvement of plant growth on the basis of pfm 3 4 root morphological traits the temporal variations of root morphological indices across all treatments at three crop growth stages in 2015 were shown in fig 5 reflecting tip number length volume surface area and diameter of maize root root tip number increased slightly from bell mouthing to grain filling stage and then increased substantially from grain filling to maturity stages fig 5a mycorrhizal plants especially those under pamf treatment showed significantly higher root tip number than the ck treatment at three crop growth stages p 0 05 the root length also increased with maize growth stages but no significant differences between treatments were found in root length at any crop growth stage fig 5b averaged across three growth stages the root length of pamf treated plants was 9 3 and 23 5 greater than that of pfm and ck treatments respectively the root length of amf treated plants was similar to that of pamf treated plants root volume largely mirrors the root length the root volume of pamf treated plants was markedly higher than that of pfm treated or ck plants s at maturity p 0 05 fig 5c unlike the trend of root tip number there was a rapid growth period for root surface area from bell mouthing to grain filling stage while it was slightly decreased at maturity fig 5d pamf treated plants had a similar dynamics of root surface area to that of the amf treated plants at all three growth stages the root surface area of plants under pamf or amf treatment was significantly greater than that of the ck p 0 05 for all treatments root diameter was mostly in the order of pamf amf pfm ck treatment ranging from 0 92 mm to 1 21 mm across three growth stages fig 5e the lowest root diameter was consistently found in ck treatment at three crop growth stages but there were no significant differences when compared with the other three treatments root morphology plays a crucial role in nutrients and water uptake in soils for plant growth in semiarid regions lynch 2007 the vigorous and deeper root system can greatly increase the absorption of nutrients and water and consequently improves crop growth in stress environments in dry 2015 plants colonized with amf or associated with pfm displayed substantial differences than those in the ck treatment with respect to root morphological indices showing a strong fungal inoculation effect on root tip number and surface area across the rooting zones earlier studies found that increased indole 3 butyric acid biosynthesis in mycorrhizal plants plays a major role in root phenotype with increase in branching and fine roots kaldorf and ludwig müller 2000 reduction in root necrosis norman et al 1996 and specific root length espeleta et al 1999 in particular soil in this studied region is characterized by nutrient deficiency amf symbiosis can increase nutrient availability in soils to the rooting zones thus amf inoculation might be beneficial to root development although complex factors such as soil temperature water content nutrient availability and shoot development may greatly affect the development of plant root systems in the soil liedgens and richner 2001 fageria 2005 in addition pfm treated crops had greater root system than ck treated crops in dry 2015 increased soil moisture environment of pfm was considered beneficial for distinct root morphological traits gao et al 2014 kang et al 2000 investigated the root morphology and its distribution in maize treated with different irrigation methods and found noticeable higher primary root number and root density in plants with alternate furrow irrigation when compared with those with conventional furrow irrigation their results agreed with our results that mulched maize had suitable soil moisture for root development overall our data illustrated that variation in root morphological indices of maize especially root tip number and surface area was higher with amf inoculation compared with pfm practice 3 5 yield and wue of maize yield and wue of maize significantly differed between treatments in both growing seasons table 2 maize yield in mulched plots was significantly higher than in non mulched plots during both experimental years p 0 05 the highest maize yield was achieved in pamf treatment in both years and the percentages of increase were 55 6 in 2014 and 39 3 in 2015 compared with the ck treatment the mycorrhizal dependency of mulched plants was 24 7 in 2014 and 3 6 in 2015 showing greater amplifying effect on maize yield when plants were subjected to film mulching condition similar to yield wue of maize was higher in three treatments over two growing seasons compared with the ck treatment table 2 pfm treatment significantly increased the wue by 14 9 in 2014 and 35 2 in 2015 when compared with the ck treatment p 0 05 in particular pamf treatment caused the most significant increases of wue in both years with 43 1 increase in 2014 and 45 6 in 2015 relative to the ck treatment p 0 05 however there were no significant differences in wue between the two mulched or non mulched treatments with an exception for pamf treatment in 2014 which was markedly higher than pfm treatment in the present study the most pronounced beneficial effect on maize yield and wue was observed with combination treatment of pfm and amf inoculation as a result higher wue and the significantly improved root morphology traits especially root surface area might be the most plausible reasons for the highest yield in the pamf treatment on one hand the combined practice had the highest wue in both years which was the key factor in coping with water shortage in semiarid regions to achieve maximum yield film mulching decreased the unproductive evaporation from soil and it might increase vegetation transpiration with the vigorous growth in later growing period consequently leading to relatively higher evapotranspiration in mulched plots but simultaneously significantly higher yield and accordingly increased wue table 2 on the other hand the combined practice had higher root tip number and surface area fig 5a and c across three growth stages thereby contributing to higher nutrients absorption apart from the rhizosphere simple correlation analysis between maize yield and root morphological indices at three growth stages showed that both maize yield and biomass were significantly correlated with root surface area p 0 05 table 3 considering the two aspects above amf inoculation could improve greater root morphology and enhance wue to produce higher yield on the basis of pfm furthermore mycorrhizal dependency of crop was higher in maize grown in mulched plots than in non mulched plots indicating that the performance of amf could be improved under film mulching condition 4 conclusion in summary this study showed that pfm in combination with amf inoculation improved maize growth environment in semiarid regions of china the combined practice significantly improved soil water content in topsoil thus regulating the root distribution improved root mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal length promoted plant height and biomass accumulation thereby significantly increasing crop yield and water use efficiency when compared with the controls therefore the combined treatment can be considered as an efficient agricultural practice in semiarid regions since the combined practice could result in better performance of maize growth further mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the interaction between plastic film mulching and amf inoculation involving soil nutrient availability acknowledgements

characteristics the objectives were to enhance the water use efficiency wue radiation use efficiency rue and promote the grain filling process and yields of maize the results showed that under the same densities there was no significant differences between the average filling rate gmean and the maximum filling rate gmax p 0 05 during the normal precipitation year 2015 however the gmean and gmax in the rf and fm treatments were significantly higher than the cp treatment in dry year 2016 under the same densities the number of grains per row number of kernels per ear and kernel yield per plant of rf and fm treatments were significantly higher than those of the cp treatment these maize yield components decreased with increased planting densities under the same planting patterns compared to the cp treatment the average annual grain yield under the rf and fm treatments increased by 33 4 and 30 0 respectively compared to the cp treatment the average annual rue in the rf and fm treatments increased by 12 4 and 11 5 before silking and increased 17 7 and 14 7 after silking respectively under the rf system with a middle planting density m rf promoted grain filling rate grain yield yield

and yield components sangoi et al 2002 as planting density increases the number of spikes per unit area increases while the number of grains per ear and 100 kernel weight decreases borrás et al 2003

structure that encompasses desirable leaf area index and makes full use of light energy for improved leaf photosynthetic capacity yang et al 2010 wajid 2004 numerous studies have shown that photosynthetically active radiation ipar interception increases with increasing maize planting density shen et al 1993 yang et al 2010 however if the planting density is too great it will reduce the ability of light to penetrate the lower canopy liu et al 2014 resulting in premature senescence of the lower leaves borrás et al 2003 and reducing the radiation utilization efficiency rue lin et al 2016 ultimately this significantly reduces yield and yield components of maize crop borrás et al 2003 sangoi et al 2002 maddonni and otegui 2004 conversely the use of high density populations induces undesirable phenotypes such as apical dominance barrenness and decreased numbers of ears per plant and kernels set per ear sangoi et al 2000 the optimum sowing density for obtaining the highest maize

2008 alkaisi and yin 2003 another study suggests that maize planting densities at 90 000 plants ha 1 get the highest grain yield in semi arid regions of china huang et al 2012 although there is

ridges and furrows were 60cm wide and 15cm high and they were covered with plastic film 0 9m wide and 0 008mm thick traditional flat planting and plastic film covered furrows of 70cm in width were used for the fm treatment with different planting densities and seeding spacing l 31 8cm m 22 2cm and h 17 1cm an illustration of each treatment is shown in fig 2 maize cultivar dafeng 30 was sown on april 23 in 2015 and on april 21 in 2016 using a hole sowing machine with a seeding depth of 4 5cm a base fertilizer containing 150kgha 1 n and 150kgha 1 p2o5 was spread evenly over the furrow the plots were top dressed with fertilizer containing 150kgha 1 n on july 10 in 2015 and on july 8 in 2016 at the large trumpet stage the fertilizer application was the same for all treatments the crops were harvested on october 10 in 2015 and october 5 in 2016 weeds were controlled manually through by hand and hoe during each growing season 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water content and water use efficiency the soil water content in the 0 200cm soil layer was measured with a soil ferric auger ferraro and ghersa 2007 at sowing and maize 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf silking stage blister and dough stages samples were collected every 10cm at the 0 20cm soil depth and every 20cm at the 20 200cm soil depth the gravimetric soil water content of the 0 200cm profile was measured by taking weights before and after drying the soil at 105 c to a constant weight the soil cores were sampled from the middle of a ridge from the middle of two plants plants in same row and from the middle of a

stages during the two experimental years and used to measure the leaf area ritchie et al 1993 we measure the dry matter with the six typical plants which after measuring the leaf area six typical plants were randomly sampled from each plot at the 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf stage silking blister dough and harvesting stages the dry matter per plant was determined from plants that were oven dried at for a minimum of 48h to constant weight at the end of the season two rows of maize were hand harvested from the middle of each plot the seed and aboveground biomass yield were determined based on a

plot three tagged ears from each plot were sampled at 5 d intervals from silking to maturity sampling the grains of each ear was divided into three measurements the averages were taken for the three samples from each time point first 50 grain was sampled from the middle part of maize ear subsequently measurements were taken of the fresh weight then of the weight after placing the ears in an oven at 70 c to dry to constant weight the grain filling data were fitted using the richards 1959 growth equation 4 w a 1 b e ˆ k t ˆ 1 n the grain filling rate g was calculated as the derivative of eq 4 5

met the assumption of homogeneity of variances and followed normal distribution analysis of variance was performed using spss 13 0 spss inc chicago il usa data from each sampling event were analysed separately means among treatments were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 significance level was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water content during the normal year 2015 no significant difference was observed in the soil water content in any of the treatments at the 3 leaf stage at the same density fig 3 however in the dry year 2016 the soil water content under

slightly decreased under the same planting pattern 3 2 leaf area and dry matter the two year data showed that the maximum leaf area per plant for each treatment was reached at the silking stage and

difference between the low and the middle planting densities in 2016 under the same planting patterns and the hi was significantly higher with the low and middle planting densities compared to the high planting density 3 4 characteristics of grain filling the two year study showed that the gmean and gmax decreased with increased planting density in the same planting patterns table 3 during the normal precipitation year 2015 there was no significant difference in the gmean and gmax of the three planting densities under the rf and fm treatments whereas the gmean and gmax were significantly lower in the high density than in the low density under the cp treatment the gmean and gmax were significantly higher in low density than in high density under the same planting patterns during the dry year 2016 however there was no significant difference between the low and the middle planting under the rf treatment the occurrence time of maximal filling rate tmax of the fm treatment was significantly earlier than in the rf and cp treatments in low and middle densities under both study years however there was no significant difference in agp between the three planting patterns in normal and dry years the agp decreased with increasing planting density in the same planting type the agp was not significantly lower under high planting density compared to the low planting density but neither high nor low planting density was significantly different than the middle planting density 3 5 intercepted photosynthetically active radiation accumulation ipar and radiation use

significant difference in rue at the pre silking stage between any planting patterns however in 2016 the rue at the pre silking stage of rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the cp treatment the two years data showed that the rue at the post silking stage under the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the cp treatment within the middle and high planting

silking stage of the low planting density was significantly higher than that of high planting density but there were no significant differences in the rue at the pre silking stage between any planting densities 3 6 yield components the two year study showed that there was no significant difference between the 100 kernel weights of the three planting patterns at the same planting density table 5 during 2015 however in 2016 the 100 kernel weight of the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the cp treatment at the same planting density the number of grains per row number of kernels per ear and kernel yield per plant of the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than those of the cp treatment at the same planting densities in both years compared to the cp treatment the two year average kernel yield per plant under the rf and fm treatments increased by 35 6 and 27 4 respectively in two years under the rf and fm treatments the 100 kernel weight number of grains

during the both years 4 discussion water scarcity is an essential limiting factor for crop production in the semi arid regions of china gan et al 2008 in these regions the soil water content was mainly affected by precipitation which is the most important water source for agricultural production du et al 2015 in our study we found that the soil water content was remarkably impacted by precipitation and higher maximum soil water content was recorded for the rf treatment than for the fm and the cp treatments plastic film mulching reduces soil evaporation and extends the duration of water accessibility to critical growth stages zhao et al 2014 the ridges covered with plastic film rf can improve the soil water status than that of conventional flat planting without plastic film oweis and hachum 2006 ren et al 2008 reported that under simulated precipitation of 230 340 and 440mm in the rf system the soil water content in the 0 200cm soil depth were 2 3 5 2 and 4 5 greater than in conventional flat planting respectively in our two year study the soil water content of rf treatment was significantly higher than that of fm and cp treatments at the 6 leaf and 11 leaf stages fig 3 and at the silking and blister stages the soil water content of rf treatment was significantly higher than that of fm treatment it is because rf technique can increase moisture contents by accumulated water from light precipitation and preserve runoff from heavy rainfall jia et al 2006 hu et al 2014 showed that the rf system is better for using light rain which is the important reason why the soil water content under the rf system was maximum than in conventional flat planting during the entire growth stages wang et al 2015a also revealed that ridges covered with plastic film can efficiently save more rainwater in the soil than conventional flat planting thereby reducing losses by evaporation from the furrows earlier studies revealed that a plastic film can maintain soil temperature and improve soil water thereby improving crop growth as a result of a significant increase in the leaf area per plant and dry matter accumulation duan et al 2006 lü et al 2008 in our two year study at the same planting density the leaf area per plant of the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the cp treatment at the 6 leaf 11 leaf and silking stages the rf and fm treatments provide favorable conditions for plant growth before the silking stage and we hypothesize that this is due to the film accelerating the crop growth and development as found in previous studies ren et al 2008 gan et al 2013 in the dry year 2016 at the blister and dough stages the leaf area per plant of the rf treatment was significantly higher than that of the cp and fm treatments at three planting densities we believe that the soil water content under the cp and fm treatment is quickly depleted after the silking growth stage fig 3 and causes the premature leaf senescence especially under the high planting density it is well known that crop water consumption is closely related to dry matter accumulation payero et al 2008 earlier studies have suggested that the rf system can increase the soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby increasing the dry matter and grain yield in our study the post silking dry matter and total dry matter under the rf and fm treatments were significantly higher than that of the cp treatment under the middle and high planting densities we speculate that the rf treatment provides good hydrothermal conditions and promote crop growth in rain fed regions of china deng et al 2006 it is known that the fm treatment enhanced accumulation of dry matter by increasing soil water consumption and the sufficient soil temperatures promote early maize growth under fm treatment resulting in the speed up the development for maize emergence to maturity ma et al 2008 however in the dry year 2016 due to soil moisture deficits fig 3 the dry matter per plant under the fm treatment was less than that of the rf treatment table 2 the reason could be that the rf system increases soil moisture by reducing soil evapotranspiration and collecting light rain to penetrate into the soil deeper layer zhang et al 2007 and provided water at critical growth stages for the maize li et al 2004 the soil moisture and temperature are essential for crop development zhou et al 2012 gan et al 2013 also revealed that fm planting significantly improved soil temperature and evaporation but decreased the soil water storage the grain filling rate and active grain filling duration determine the final grain yield this grain filling rate is not only genetically determined but is also influenced by environmental conditions such as cultivation techniques planting density sowing date fertilization level and planting mode li et al 2003 previous studies have suggested that plastic film mulching encourage maize grain filling early compared with conventional flat planting and it increased the grain filling rate and grain weight of maize zhang et al 2010 this is consistent with the results of our study that found fm treatments had an occurrence time of maximal filling rate tmax significantly less than the rf and cp treatments it has been shown that planting techniques with ridges covered in plastic film can significantly increase soil temperature and maintain soil moisture li et al 2013 it has also been suggested that the tmax 100 kernel weight and grain yield at maturity are positively correlated with the soil temperature and soil moisture conditions gao et al 2015 our study found that the rf treatment improved crop growth and development and provided adequate hydrothermal conditions this resulted in improved grain filling and enhanced corn production the gmean and gmax were not significantly different across same planting densities in the normal precipitation year 2015 however the gmean and gmax under the rf and fm treatments during the dry year 2016 were significantly higher than that of the cp treatment we posit that the reason for this is that in the dry years the water deficit seriously affects the grain filling process in the cp treatment fig 3 while the rf treatment has the advantage of collecting and maintaining water and improving soil moisture conditions in turn promoting the corn grain filling process we also found that gmean gmax and agp decreased with increased planting density within the same planting patterns a study by zhang et al 2015 showed that the planting density had no significant effect on the tmax while the maximum and average grain filling rate decreased with increased planting density similarly a research by chen et al 2010 shows that the planting densities have a significant effect on grain filling rate consistent with our results the rf treatment significantly increased the number of grains per row number of kernels per ear and kernel yield per plant compared to the cp treatment there were no significant differences in the 100 kernel weight between the three planting patterns in the normal precipitation year 2015 but in the dry year 2016 among the same planting densities the 100 kernel weight under the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the cp treatment uneven and insufficient precipitation considerably effected crops growth and production therefore it is important to use light rainfall and increase soil water storage liao et al 2003 the ridge furrow with plastic film mulching has been commonly implemented in the semi arid areas of china to preserved rainwater in the root zone of the crop tian et al 2003 the rf system improved the soil moisture which enhanced photosynthesis during the later growth stage and resulted in a higher kernel weight and grain yield zhang et al 2007 we obtained similar results as the rf treatment provided good hydrothermal conditions for later maize growth and improved grain filling rate table 2 thereby increased 100 kernel weight and kernel yield per plant numerous studies have shown that with increased planting density individual plants obtain less light energy and reduced environmental resources resulting in the decreased dry matter number of kernels 100 kernel weight and grain yield borrás et al 2003 echarte et al 2000 sangoi et al 2002 maddonni and otegui 2004 our two year data showed that with increased planting density the number of kernels per ear 100 kernel weight and kernel yield per plant was significantly reduced similar findings have been reported by sharifi et al 2009 showed that the number of kernels per ear was significantly reduced with increased planting density the two year trial showed that the grain yield of the rf treatment at the same planting density were significantly higher than that of the cp treatment table 2 especially in the dry year 2016 this is due to the precipitation during the growth period is only 251 6mm in 2016 and the water deficit severely affected the reproductive growth of maize after silking stage under the conventional planting fig 3 however the rf treatment was less affected by water stress mainly due to the rf system improved soil moisture fig 3 and grain filling rate table 2 delayed leaf senescence fig 4 and increased 100 kernel weight and number of kernels per ear table 5 thereby increased grain yield previous studies have shown that precipitation always positively associates with grain yield ye and liu 2012 the ridge with plastic film mulching has been studied as an extremely effective strategy with great potential for decrease soil evaporation enhance soil water crop yield and wue oweis and hachum 2006 other studies have found that the rf system can improve deep soil water levels and avoid serious drought stress during the key growth stages in corn crops and in turn improve grain yield li et al 2004 our two year study showed that there is no significant difference between the high and middle planting densities this might be due to the low rainfall during the silking and grain filling stages less precipitation cannot meet the higher water demand of maize in the late growth stage at high planting density especially under the cp planting model another reason may be that the drought during the flowering period reduced the pollination rate the rf system can increase soil water storage by allowing runoff through the ridge surface and gathering it in the planting ditches thus promotes crop growth and increases grain yield and wue wu et al 2015 many studies have shown that the rf system can make better use of rainwater as compared to traditional flat planting thereby improving wue ren et al 2008 li et al 2013 our study shows that the wue under the rf treatment is significantly higher than that of the cp treatment over same planting densities in both years compared to the cp treatment the average wue of the rf treatment increased in 2015 by 23 56 and in 2016 by 45 09 respectively the rf system significantly increases the utilization of rainwater improves soil water content and increased wue due to reduce evapotranspiration rate hu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 also found that the rf system improved the soil moisture during the later growth stage and resulted in a higher yield and wue we found that the ipar increased significantly with increased planting density prior to the maize silking stage the planting density significantly affected the maize ipar while the planting patterns had a relatively small effect on it a study by li and li 2004 showed that the planting density has a greater impact on canopy structure and function compared to cultivation methods which is in line with the results of our study our study found that the rf and fm treatments significantly increased rue compared to the rue of the cp treatment especially in the dry year 2016 the main effect of the plastic film mulching is to reduce soil evaporation ren et al 2010 and improve soil temperature wang et al 2015b it has been shown that there is a high correlation between rue and temperature in summer maize crops cui et al 2013 in line with our findings another study showed that soil moisture significantly affects rue stone et al 2000 wajid 2004 revealed that increasing the planting density will reduce the light use efficiency our study also showed that rue decreased with increased planting densities under the same planting patterns we speculate that the planting density mainly affects the ipar and rue by changing the canopy structure of the crop for each production system there is a suitable planting density that maximizes grain yield maize must be grown at high plant densities to maximize solar radiation interception however at high planting densities efficient conversion of intercepted solar radiation to grain may be limited by apical dominance reduced grain filling rates and harvest index the higher ipar obtained under the high planting density also leads to poor canopy ventilation thus obstructing light to the middle and lower leaves causing decreased photosynthetic productivity therefore it is particularly important to construct a highly efficient canopy structure through appropriate planting density in order to obtain a reasonable light distribution for maize crop production 5 conclusion the results of this two year field study showed that the number of grains per row number of kernels per ear kernel yield per plant grain filling rate grain yield rue and wue under the rf and fm treatments were significantly higher than those of the cp treatment at three planting densities under the same planting patterns as planting density increased the 100 kernel weight number of grains per row number of kernels per ear and kernel yield per plant significantly decreased these results indicated that under the rf system with a middle planting density m rf promoted grain filling rate rue wue grain yield and yield components these findings demonstrate that m rf model is an innovative planting treatment that increases maize yield and rue in the semi arid areas in the northwest of china funding this study was supported by the

and yield components sangoi et al 2002 as planting density increases the number of spikes per unit area increases while the number of grains per ear and 100 kernel weight decreases borrás et al 2003

structure that encompasses desirable leaf area index and makes full use of light energy for improved leaf photosynthetic capacity yang et al 2010 wajid 2004 numerous studies have shown that photosynthetically active radiation ipar interception increases with increasing maize planting density shen et al 1993 yang et al 2010 however if the planting density is too great it will reduce the ability of light to penetrate the lower canopy liu et al 2014 resulting in premature senescence of the lower leaves borrás et al 2003 and reducing the radiation utilization efficiency rue lin et al 2016 ultimately this significantly reduces yield and yield components of maize crop borrás et al 2003 sangoi et al 2002 maddonni and otegui 2004 conversely the use of high density populations induces undesirable phenotypes such as apical dominance barrenness and decreased numbers of ears per plant and kernels set per ear sangoi et al 2000 the optimum sowing density for obtaining the highest maize

agriculture yearbook editorial board 2001 these areas lack underground water and have minimal precipitation arid and semi arid environment soils are not conducive to effective water absorption and

period of water accessibility and efficient to optimize crop productivity chakraborty et al 2008 zhou et al 2009 the rf system also significantly increases the utilization of rainwater by accumulated

separately means among treatments were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 significance level was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water content during the normal year 2015 no significant difference was observed in the soil water content in any of the treatments at the 3 leaf stage at the same density fig 3 however in the dry year 2016 the soil water content under the rf treatment was significantly higher than that in the fm and cp treatments at this growth stages at the 6 leaf and 11 leaf stages in 2015 and 2016 the soil water content of rf treatment was significantly higher than that in fm and cp treatments under the three planting densities in both years at the silking and blister stages the soil water content of rf treatment was significantly higher than that in fm treatments under the three planting densities especially in the dry year 2016 these data showed that the soil water content was remarkably impacted by precipitation in the rf system and higher maximum soil water content was recorded for the rf treatment than for the fm and the cp treatments we also found that with the higher planting densities the soil water content slightly decreased under the same planting pattern 3 2 leaf area and dry matter the two year data showed that the maximum leaf area per plant for each treatment was reached at the silking stage and gradually decreased after this stage fig 4 in 2015 and 2016 at the 6 leaf 11 leaf and silking stages the leaf area per plant of the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the cp

matter per plant significantly decreased with the increased planting density under the high and middle planting densities the total dry matter per plant in 2015 decreased by 32 and 18 respectively and by 37 and 25 in 2016 as compared with the low planting density 3 3 grain yield and harvest index in 2015 and 2016 the grain yield of the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the

difference between the low and the middle planting densities in 2016 under the same planting patterns and the hi was significantly higher with the low and middle planting densities compared to the high planting density 3 4 characteristics of grain filling the two year study showed that the gmean and gmax decreased with increased planting density in the same planting patterns table 3 during the normal precipitation year 2015 there was no significant difference in the gmean and gmax of the three planting densities under the rf and fm treatments whereas the gmean and gmax were significantly lower in the high density than in the low density under the cp treatment the gmean and gmax were significantly higher in low density than in high density under the same planting patterns during the dry year 2016 however there was no significant difference between the low and the middle planting under the rf treatment the occurrence time of maximal filling rate tmax of the fm treatment was

normal and dry years the agp decreased with increasing planting density in the same planting type the agp was not significantly lower under high planting density compared to the low planting density but neither high nor low planting density was significantly different than the middle planting density 3 5 intercepted photosynthetically active radiation accumulation ipar and radiation use

significant difference in rue at the pre silking stage between any planting patterns however in 2016 the rue at the pre silking stage of rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the

during 2015 however in 2016 the 100 kernel weight of the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the cp treatment at the same planting density the number of grains per row number of

and 31 2 under h rf and h fm treatments respectively as compared to the h cp treatment under the same planting models there was no significant difference in wue among different planting densities during the both years 4 discussion water scarcity is an essential limiting factor for crop production in the semi arid regions of china gan et al 2008 in these regions the soil water content was mainly affected by precipitation which is the most important water source for agricultural production du et al 2015 in our study we found that the soil water content was remarkably impacted by precipitation and higher maximum soil water content was recorded for the rf treatment than for the fm and the cp treatments plastic film mulching reduces soil evaporation and extends the duration of water accessibility to critical growth stages zhao et al 2014 the ridges covered with plastic film rf can improve the soil water status than that of conventional flat planting without plastic film oweis and hachum 2006 ren et al 2008 reported that under simulated precipitation of 230 340 and 440mm in the rf system the soil water content in the 0 200cm soil depth were 2 3 5 2 and 4 5 greater than in conventional flat planting respectively in our two year study the soil water content of rf treatment was significantly higher than that of fm and cp treatments at the 6 leaf and 11 leaf stages fig 3 and at the silking and blister stages the soil water content of rf treatment was significantly higher than that of fm treatment it is because rf technique can increase moisture contents by accumulated water from light precipitation and preserve runoff from heavy rainfall jia et al 2006 hu et al 2014 showed that the rf system is better for using light rain which is the important reason why the soil water content under the rf system was maximum than in conventional flat planting during the entire growth stages wang et al 2015a also revealed that ridges covered with plastic film can efficiently save more rainwater in the soil than conventional flat planting thereby reducing losses by evaporation from the furrows earlier studies revealed that a plastic film can maintain soil temperature and improve soil water thereby improving crop growth as a result of a significant increase in the leaf area per plant and dry matter accumulation duan et al 2006 lü et al 2008 in our two year study at the same planting density the leaf area per plant of the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the cp treatment at the 6 leaf 11 leaf and silking stages the rf and fm treatments provide favorable conditions for plant growth before the silking stage and we hypothesize that this is due to the film accelerating the crop growth and development as found in previous studies ren et al 2008 gan et al 2013 in the dry year 2016 at the blister and dough stages the leaf area per plant of the rf treatment was significantly higher than that of the cp and fm treatments at three planting densities we believe that the soil water content under the cp and fm treatment is quickly depleted after the silking growth stage fig 3 and causes the premature leaf senescence especially under the high planting density it is well known that crop water consumption is closely related to dry matter accumulation payero et al 2008 earlier studies have suggested that the rf system can increase the soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby increasing the dry matter and grain yield in our study the post silking dry matter and total dry matter under the rf and fm treatments were significantly higher than that of the cp treatment under the middle and high planting densities we speculate that the rf treatment provides good hydrothermal conditions and promote crop growth in rain fed regions of china deng et al 2006 it is known that the fm treatment enhanced accumulation of dry matter by increasing soil water consumption and the sufficient soil temperatures promote early maize growth under fm treatment resulting in the speed up the development for maize emergence to maturity ma et al 2008 however in the dry year 2016 due to soil moisture deficits fig 3 the dry matter per plant under the fm treatment was less than that of the rf treatment table 2 the reason could be that the rf system increases soil moisture by reducing soil evapotranspiration and collecting light rain to penetrate into the soil deeper layer zhang et al 2007 and provided water at critical growth stages for the maize li et al 2004 the soil moisture and temperature are essential for crop development zhou et al 2012 gan et al 2013 also revealed that fm planting significantly improved soil temperature and evaporation but decreased the soil water storage the grain filling rate and active grain filling duration determine the final grain yield this grain filling rate is not only genetically determined but is also influenced by environmental conditions such as cultivation techniques planting density sowing date fertilization level and planting mode li et al 2003 previous studies have suggested that plastic film mulching encourage maize grain filling early compared with conventional flat planting and it increased the grain filling rate and grain weight of maize zhang et al 2010 this is consistent with the results of our study that found fm treatments had an occurrence time of maximal filling rate tmax significantly less than the rf and cp treatments it has been shown that planting techniques with ridges covered in plastic film can significantly increase soil temperature and maintain soil moisture li et al 2013 it has also been suggested that the tmax 100 kernel weight and grain yield at maturity are positively correlated with the soil temperature and soil moisture conditions gao et al 2015 our study found that the rf treatment improved crop growth and development and provided adequate hydrothermal conditions this resulted in improved grain filling and enhanced corn production the gmean and gmax were not significantly different across same planting densities in the normal precipitation year 2015 however the gmean and gmax under the rf and fm treatments during the dry year 2016 were significantly higher than that of the cp treatment we posit that the reason for this is that in the dry years the water deficit seriously affects the grain filling process in the cp treatment fig 3 while the rf treatment has the advantage of collecting and maintaining water and improving soil moisture conditions in turn promoting the corn grain filling process we also found that gmean gmax and agp decreased with increased planting density within the same planting patterns a study by zhang et al 2015 showed that the planting density had no significant effect on the tmax while the maximum and average grain filling rate decreased with increased planting density similarly a research by chen et al 2010 shows that the planting densities have a significant effect on grain filling rate consistent with our results the rf treatment significantly increased the number of grains per row number of kernels per ear and kernel yield per plant compared to the cp treatment there were no significant differences in the 100 kernel weight between the three planting patterns in the normal precipitation year 2015 but in the dry year 2016 among the same planting densities the 100 kernel weight under the rf and fm treatments was significantly higher than that of the cp treatment uneven and insufficient precipitation considerably effected crops growth and production therefore it is important to use light rainfall and increase soil water storage liao et al 2003 the ridge furrow with plastic film mulching has been commonly implemented in the semi arid areas of china to preserved rainwater in the root zone of the crop tian et al 2003 the rf system improved the soil moisture which enhanced photosynthesis during the later growth stage and resulted in a higher kernel weight and grain yield zhang et al 2007 we obtained similar results as the rf treatment provided good hydrothermal conditions for later maize growth and improved grain filling rate table 2 thereby increased 100 kernel weight and kernel yield per plant numerous studies have shown that with increased planting density individual plants obtain less light energy and reduced environmental resources resulting in the decreased dry matter number of kernels 100 kernel weight and grain yield borrás et al 2003 echarte et al 2000 sangoi et al 2002 maddonni and otegui 2004 our two year data showed that with increased planting density the number of kernels per ear 100 kernel weight and kernel yield per plant was significantly reduced similar findings have been reported by sharifi et al 2009 showed that the number of kernels per ear was significantly reduced with increased planting density the two year trial showed that the grain yield of the rf treatment at the same planting density were significantly higher than that of the cp treatment table 2 especially in the dry year 2016 this is due to the precipitation during the growth period is only 251 6mm in 2016 and the water deficit severely affected the reproductive growth of maize after silking stage under the conventional planting fig 3 however the rf treatment was less affected by water stress mainly due to the rf system improved soil moisture fig 3 and grain filling rate table 2 delayed leaf senescence fig 4 and increased 100 kernel weight and number of kernels per ear table 5 thereby increased grain yield previous studies have shown that precipitation always positively associates with grain yield ye and liu 2012 the ridge with plastic film mulching has been studied as an extremely effective strategy with great potential for decrease soil evaporation enhance soil water crop yield and wue oweis and hachum 2006 other studies have found that the rf system can improve deep soil water levels and avoid serious drought stress during the key growth stages in corn crops and in turn improve grain yield li et al 2004 our two year study showed that there is no significant difference between the high and middle planting densities this might be due to the low rainfall during the silking and grain filling stages less precipitation cannot meet the higher water demand of maize in the late growth stage at high planting density especially under the cp planting model another reason may be that the drought during the flowering period reduced the pollination rate the rf system can increase soil water storage by allowing runoff through the ridge surface and gathering it in the planting ditches thus promotes crop growth and increases grain yield and wue wu et al 2015 many studies have shown that the rf system can make better use of rainwater as compared to traditional flat planting thereby improving wue ren et al 2008 li et al 2013 our study shows that the wue under the rf treatment is significantly higher than that of the cp treatment over same planting densities in both years compared to the cp treatment the average wue of the rf treatment increased in 2015 by 23 56 and in 2016 by 45 09 respectively the rf system significantly increases the utilization of rainwater improves soil water content and increased wue due to reduce evapotranspiration rate hu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 also found that the rf system improved the soil moisture during the later growth stage and resulted in a higher yield and wue we found that the ipar increased significantly with increased planting density prior to the maize silking stage the planting density significantly affected the maize ipar while the planting patterns had a relatively small effect on it a study by li and li 2004 showed that the planting density has a greater impact on canopy structure and function compared to cultivation methods which is in line with the results of our study our study found that the rf and fm treatments significantly increased rue compared to the rue of the cp treatment especially in the dry year 2016 the main effect of the plastic film mulching is to reduce soil evaporation ren et al 2010 and improve soil temperature wang et al 2015b it has been shown that there is a high correlation between rue and temperature in summer maize crops cui et al 2013 in line with our findings another study showed that soil moisture significantly affects rue stone et al 2000 wajid 2004 revealed that increasing the planting density will reduce the light use efficiency our study also showed that rue decreased with increased planting densities under the same planting patterns we speculate that the planting density mainly affects the ipar and rue by changing the canopy structure of the crop for each production system there is a suitable planting density that maximizes grain yield maize must be grown at high plant densities to maximize solar radiation interception however at high planting densities efficient conversion of intercepted solar radiation to grain may be limited by apical dominance reduced grain filling rates and harvest index the higher ipar obtained under the high planting density also leads to poor canopy ventilation thus obstructing light to the middle and lower leaves causing decreased photosynthetic productivity therefore it is particularly important to construct a highly efficient canopy structure through appropriate planting density in order to obtain a reasonable light distribution for maize crop production 5 conclusion the results of this two year field study showed that the number of grains per row number of kernels per ear kernel yield per plant grain filling rate grain yield rue and wue under the rf and fm treatments were significantly higher than those of the cp treatment at three planting densities under the same planting patterns as planting density increased the 100 kernel weight number of grains per row number of kernels per ear and kernel yield per plant significantly decreased these results indicated that under the rf system with a middle planting density m rf promoted grain filling rate rue wue grain yield and yield components these findings demonstrate that m rf model is an innovative planting treatment that increases maize yield and rue in the semi arid areas in the northwest of china funding this study was supported by the

11549,in order to find out the appropriate measures for soil water preservation and wheat yield increase a three year field experiment was conducted in yuzhou experimental station of water saving agriculture in the west of henan province china during the growing seasons of 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 to study the effects of different tillage modes and soil mulching measures on dynamics of soil moisture and temperature photosynthetic characteristics and yield of winter wheat triticum aestivum l the results showed that straw coverage and film mulching measures under the conventional tillage and no tillage modes increased soil moisture by 4 4 27 3 13 4 41 8 and 6 2 46 7 2 4 80 2 respectively the treatments of soil surface coverage measures under both conventional tillage and no tillage modes at tillering stage increased the temperature of soil layer at 10cm and 15cm depth by 9 1 18 2 and 10 0 40 0 in 2014 2015 while mulching measures under the conventional tillage obviously increased soil temperature at wintering stage but decreased soil temperature at booting and mature stages in 2016 2017 however mulching measures under no tillage mode reduced soil temperature in shallower layer during seedling establishment stage in the three year period of 2014 2017 moreover the two mulching measures raised net photosynthetic rate pn and water use efficiency wue of functional leaves under the conventional tillage mode and reduced transpiration rate tr at the filling stage except straw coverage measures under no tillage in 2015 2016 the combination of mulching measures under no tillage reduced pn tr and wue of wheat leaves at filling stage as compared to those without mulching measures under the conventional tillage mode straw coverage increased wheat yield by 6 4 9 3 mainly due to the increase in the number of grains per panicle under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures reduced wheat yield to different extents and film mulching measures was more effective than straw coverage the combination of conventional tillage and straw mulching resulted in a yield of 8425 9 8888 9kghm 2 so this combination was recommended as the optimal treatment under the conditions set in this study keywords straw mulching film mulching soil moisture and temperature characteristics winter wheat triticum aestivum l photosynthetic characteristics yield 1 introduction water stress is one of the important and unfavorable factors influencing the growth and development of crops water deficiency has caused agricultural loss as high as 8 billion annually in the world shortage of water resources has become a global problem limiting agricultural development wang et al 2016 qin et al 2015 wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important food crops in the world china is ranked in the first place in term of wheat production and consumption the cultivated area for wheat is 21 33 30 67 million hectare accounting for 19 57 22 07 of the total cultivated area for crops in china qin et al 2015 huanghuai region is suitable for producing strong and moderate gluten wheat grains this region is one of the most important wheat production regions in china and annually has 15 30 million ha of cultivated area for wheat the highly efficient development of wheat with high yield and good quality is of strategic significance for ensuring food safety in china however the unbalance of precipitation supply and demand for crops is the main factor limiting agricultural productivity in this region for winter wheat it is critical to meet water requirement at the period 4 5 months of jointing stage booting stage and filling stage however precipitations in these periods only account for 1 5 1 4 of demanded water of winter wheat and water deficiency can be as high as approximately 200mm xu et al 2014 moreover due to the consecutive rotary cultivation practice the cultivation layer of field soil has become shallower and shallower and soil physicochemical properties including soil gas air permeability ventilation and soil water permeability have become poorer and poorer which significantly reduce soil productivity seriously limit high output of crops and further aggravate the contradiction between water demand and supply this issue has become the spot light drawing the attentions of the agricultural researchers li et al

properties and soil water use efficiency swue bottinelli et al 2017 many studies have indicated that the protective tillage measures could preserve soil water increase soil moisture improve soil quality and increase crop yield and then benefit for the sustainable development of agricultural production bottinelli et al 2017 yang et al 2016 lampurlanés et al 2016 mitchell et al 2017 bhatt and khera 2006 shao et al 2016 for instance it has been shown that 1 no tillage enhanced soil water holding capacity and reduced soil evaporation lampurlanés et al 2016 2 mulching measures was also an effective way to reduce soil water evaporation drove water moving up from lower layer to the upper layer where water was available for crops improved wheat growth and development and increased crop productivity and wue li et al 2016 3 mulching measures under no tillage stimulated the formation of soil aggregates increased soil nitrogen and carbon contents and then enhanced the soil microbial activities mitchell et al 2017 and 4 long term no tillage in the drought region improved the capacity of soil water conservation and storage enhanced winter wheat s net photosynthesis rate pn transient water use efficiency twue and the rates of dry matters accumulation and transportation subsequently coordinated the relationship among various yield components and increased the yield of winter wheat wang et al 2015 straw coverage inhibited flag leaves chlorophyll degradation delayed leaf senescence improved soil moisture status optimized the soil root trails and ultimately enhanced the accumulation of dry matters and wheat yield formation in the drought years wu et al 2015 the increased wheat yield by mulching measures was attributed mainly to its resultant increased soil moisture and temperature cook et al 2006 and changes in soil structure and fertility zhang et al 2011 moreover mulching tillage enriched soil microorganisms and increased urease activity zhao et al 2002 the effects of mulching measures on soil physicochemical properties were found to be dependent on a number of factors such as mulch types and quantity mulching ways and timing etc wu et al 2011 kader et al 2017a zhang et al 2008 currently mulching measures and straw coverage are two measures widely applied in agricultural production application of mulching measures or straw coverage in the hilly dry land of the west of henan province where the seasonal drought is seriously improved soil moisture and farm land fertility stimulated wheat tillering and increased the number of grains per ear and 1000 grain weight wu et al 2011 although mulching tillage cost more and was less friendly to environment than straw coverage kader et al 2017a b it was superior over straw coverage in improving crop s yield zhang et al 2008 currently a majority of studies have focused on the effects of monoculture or mulching measures on soil physicochemical properties and the agronomic trails of crops very few studies have explored on effects of combined tillage modes and mulching measures on swue moreover these studies applied shorter treatment duration which resulted in different effects long term multiple years application of same tillage mode can be more reflective for the actual tillage effects li et al 2006 based on the present studies we conducted experiments in yuzhou experimental station for water saving agriculture in the west of henan province in 2014 to investigate the effects of different tillage modes conventional tillage and no tillage and soil surface coverage treatments straw coverage and mulching measures on soil moisture and temperature photosynthetic characteristics and winter wheat yield aiming to find out the protective tillage mode most suitable for cultivation of wheat with high grain yield and good quality in huanghuai region and to provide a theoretical basis for food safety production and sustainable agriculture development 2

wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 2 2 experimental designs two factor fractional split plot design was applied in this study the experiment area was divided into 18 plots with three replicates namely ct ct s ct m nt nt s and nt m the three plots with ct in their names applied the conventional tillage mode 15cm depth while the other three plots with nt in their names applied no tillage the plots ct s and nt s were covered with 6000kghm 2 straw on soil surface and the plots ct m and nt m were covered with entirely plastic mulch the plots ct and nt without coverage were taken as the controls the area of each plot was 0 006ha 6m 10m the winter wheat triticum aestivum l cultivar kaimai 18 was used in this study its seed were sowed at density of 187 5kghm

stage as the additional application respectively no irrigation was applied during the whole wheat growth period in the three years period of 2014 2017 2 3 assay method 2 3 1 measurement of soil moisture soil samples within 0 100cm layer were collected using soil augers at the tillering stage jointing stage booting stage and filling stage of winter wheat respectively and their moisture contents were measured with oven drying method 2 3 2 measurement of soil temperature the soil temperatures were read at the fixed locations for all the stages using hy 1 right angle geothermometer apresys precision photoelectric co ltd shanghai china in brief five geothermometers per group were penetrated in the middle row of various plots the soil temperatures at 5 10 15 20 and 25cm layers were measured in the morning 7 00 am afternoon 14 00 pm and evening 19 00 pm of the typical sunny days during the tillering stage wintering stage seedling establishment stage booting stage and mature stage the mean value of three readings was taken as the daily mean value of soil temperature 2 3 3 measurement of wheat photosynthetic parameters photosynthesis rate pn and transpiration rate tr of winter wheat leaves at filling stage were measured at 9 30 11 00 am of sunny and windless wind speed was less than 0 2ms 1 days using li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor company lincoln ne usa with open gas circuit at the light intensity of 800 1200μmolm 2 s 1 in leaf chamber 2cm 3cm temperature was set at 25 c and air flow rate was set at 500μmols 1 leaf wue the amount of assimilated co2 by plant divided by per unit mass of water was measured with fischer s and powel s method fischer and turner 1978 powles 1984 and expressed as pn tr μmol co2 mmol 1 h2o 2 3 4 wheat yield and components before harvest the numbers of ear in various representative plots of 1m2 were surveyed and converted into number of ear per unit area at the mature stage all the wheat plants in various plots were harvested their grains were threshed air dried and weighted the 1000 grain weight was measured and converted into the grain yield per unit area a total of 10 wheat plants in each plot were randomly selected and the numbers of grains of all the ears ware counted and converted into number of grains per ear 2 4 statistical analyses of the experimental data for all test data obtained the outlier was eliminated using the grubbs method qi et al 2015 firstly test data sets were arranged from the smallest to the largest one the mean value x and standard deviation s were calculated secondly the difference between the maximum and minimum values and the mean value were calculated respectively the data which had the larger difference as compared to the mean value was considered as the suspicious value then the gi value was calculated as follows gi xi x s where i was the ordinal number of the suspicious value xi x was the residual error and s was the standard deviation gi value and the threshold value gp n given in the grabus table were calculated and when the gi value was larger than the threshold value gp n it was judged as outlier and removed the rest were subjected to analysis of variance and the differences among the mean values of the six treatments in the same growth stage of winter wheat were compared by lsd test at an α level of 0 05 statistical analyses of the data were performed using spss 19 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different tillage modes and soil surface coverage measures on soil moisture our results showed that compared to those in ct group 1 in the year of 2014 2015 the contents of soil moisture in ct s group at tillering stage and filling stage were significantly increased by 27 3 and 5 0 respectively table 1 and those in ct m group at tillering stage and booting stage were significantly increased by 31 2 and 6 2 respectively 2 in the year of 2015 2016 the contents of soil moisture in ct s group at booting stage and filling stage were significantly increased by 19 7 and 9 8 and those in ct m group were significantly increased by 13 9 and 41 2 respectively and 3 in the year of 2016 2017 the contents of soil moisture at jointing stage booting stage and filling stage in ct s and ct m groups were significantly increased by 7 5 4 4 22 2 and 19 9 9 7 46 7 respectively in addition compared with those of nt group 1 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the soil moisture contents of nt s and nt m groups at jointing stage were increased significantly by 41 8 80 2 and 23 4 34 0 respectively 2 in the year of 2015 2016 the soil moisture contents of nt s and nt m groups at booting stage were also significantly increased by 13 4 and 2 4 respectively and 3 in the year of 2016 2017 the soil moisture content of nt m group at jointing stage was significantly increased by 10 8 and that of nt s group at filling stage was significantly increased by 17 0 therefore the results of the three year experiments indicated that both straw coverage and mulching measures under conventional tillage and no tillage modes increased soil moisture contents to different extents and mulching tillage was mainly superior over straw coverage in soil water preservation li and shu 1991 reported that soil moisture during the wheat sowing period might contribute to about 43 of wheat yield the precipitations in this region are low and not intense especially from november to march of the following year fig 1 and can not meet the wheat water requirement the increase in soil moisture caused by mulching measures was beneficial for wheat growth and laid a foundation for increasing wheat yield plastic film mulching was found to increase the soil water storage of 0 200cm soil profile before the jointing stage and the proportion of water consumption after jointing to the total water consumption moreover it also enhanced deep soil water usage in arid years and then enhanced the biomass and grain yield at harvest yang et al 2015 straw mulch served as physical barriers to prevent rainwater from running off or evaporating and thus increased soil water infiltration and storage chen et al 2015 our results were basically consistent with those reported previously chen et al 2015 yang et al 2015 it has been shown that mulching measures increased crop yield through affecting soil heat transfer and water movement liang et al 2017 and increase in soil moisture content by mulching measures was resulted from mulch that blocked the vertical evaporation and turbulent flow of soil water forced the water underneath the mulch to move horizontally and thus reduced effectively water evaporation chen et al 2015 wang et al 2013 saglam et al 2017 and soil water consumption from the root zone kader et al 2017b these may be the reasons for the increased soil moisture under mulching measures and two tillage modes in this study 3 2 effects of different tillage modes and coverage measures on soil temperature soil thermal state is one of the important environmental factors affecting the growth and development of crops within certain temperature range the higher soil temperature will lead to more frequent water movement more water vapors in soil and more rapid crop growth and development xu et al 2014 soil tillage changes the soil physicochemical properties and affects heat movement in soils and subsequently affects soil temperature chen et al 2009 our results showed that compared to those in ct group 1 in the year of 2014 2015 and the temperature of the 10 cm and 15 cm soil layers in ct s group at tillering stage and wintering stage were significantly increased by 9 1 20 0 and 9 1 25 0 and those in ct m group were significantly increased by 9 1 20 0 and 18 2 37 5 respectively 2 in the year of 2015 2016 the soil temperatures of different layers in ct m group at tillering stage were significantly increased by 9 1 150 0 and those at 5 20 and 25 cm soil layers in ct s group were significantly increased by 40 0 42 9 and 16 7 respectively two mulching treatments significantly raised soil temperature at 5 cm soil layer by 10 4 and 8 3 at mature stage significantly reduced soil temperature at 20 and 25 cm soil layers by 14 9 23 5 and 8 5 25 5 respectively 3 in the year of 2016 2017 the soil temperatures of different layers at 0 25cm depth in ct s group at wintering stage were significantly increased by 12 5 42 9 but those at 0 20cm soil depth at booting stage and at 5 25cm soil depth at mature stage were decreased by 3 2 9 4 and 14 5 45 2 respectively the soil temperatures at 5 15 20 and 25 cm soil layers in ct m group at wintering stage were significantly increased 11 1 28 6 25 0 and 25 0 but those at 10 15 and 20 cm soil layers at mature stage were significantly decreased by 7 3 9 8 and 12 9 respectively in addition compared with those of nt group 1 in the year of 2014 2015 and the soil temperatures at 10 cm and 15 cm soil layers in nt s group at tillering stage and wintering stage were significantly increased by 10 0 30 0 and 30 0 71 4 and those in nt m group were significantly increased by 40 0 40 0 and 40 0 42 9 2 in the year of 2015 2016 the soil temperature at 5 cm soil layer in nt s group at seeding establishment stage was significantly decreased by 75 0 and those at 5 and 10 cm soil layers in nt m group were significantly decreased by 50 0 and 62 5 3 in the year of 2016 2017 the soil temperatures at 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm soil layers in nt s group at mature stage were significantly increased by 6 2 14 0 14 8 28 6 and 11 8 respectively therefore the results of the three year experiments indicated that both straw coverage and mulching measures under the conventional tillage and no tillage modes increased the soil temperature at 10 cm and 15 cm soil layers to certain extents at tillering stage and wintering stage in the year of 2014 2015 fig 2 moreover two mulching measures under conventional tillage led to obvious temperature increase at wintering stage and temperature decrease at booting stage and mature stage in the year of 2016 2017 previous studies have indicated that mulching measures and straw coverage caused significant temperature increasing and decreasing effects where the former mainly occurred at the jointing stage and the latter at post jointing stage in addition mulching measures had stronger temperature increasing effects than straw coverage while the straw coverage had better temperature decreasing effects chen et al 2014 the temperature increasing effects of mulching measure at seedling stage and jointing stage were more significant and the temperature difference between the 10cm and 20cm soil depth was the largest li et al 2010 the soil layers in the nt m and ct m groups also displayed the effect of when atmosphere temperature is high the soil temperature is reduced while when atmosphere temperature is low the soil temperature was increased and this effect was gradually reduced with the soil layer deepening wang et al 2010 our results are basically consistent with those reported previously wang et al 2010 chen et al 2014 li et al 2010 it has been reported that the temperature increasing effect of straw coverage was mainly derived from perseveration of soil moisture increase in soil thermal capacity and blockage of long wavelength radiation on the soil surface thus leading to alleviated reduction in soil temperature underneath the coverage at night time and or caused by cold current liang et al 2017 mulching measures eliminated the latent heat exchange in soil alleviated sensible heat transfer in soil inhibited the effective emission and radiation at the night time and thus increased the temperature of soils above and underneath the coverage film however at the later wheat growth stages due to light blockage by the film mulching measures reduced the air flow on the soil surface and evaporation intensity and blocked the transfer of water and heat between soil and atmosphere thus reduced the temperature on soil surface to certain extent xue et al 2012 in this study the effects of two types of coverage measures on soil temperature at different wheat growth stages may be the results of all the above mentioned however whether there is a cooperative effect between tillage modes and soil surface coverage measures on soil temperature is still unclear and remains to be further studied 3 3 effects of different tillage modes and coverage measures on photosynthesis characteristics of wheat our results showed that 1 compared with that of ct group pns in ct s and ct m groups at filling stage in the two year period of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were significantly increased by 42 0 42 4 and 14 1 27 6 respectively additionally compared with that of nt group pns in nt s and nt m groups in the year of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 were significantly decreased by 12 0 33 2 and 16 5 58 3 respectively 2 compared to that in ct trs of wheat leaves in ct s and ct m groups in the two year period of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were significantly decreased by 62 1 8 3 and 46 7 22 2 respectively additionally those in nt s and nt m groups in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 were significantly decreased by 5 3 11 2 and 8 8 25 5 respectively compared to those in nt group 3 leaf wues of ct s and ct m groups were significantly increased by 9 6 275 8 55 4 and 13 8 113 9 64 1 as compared with that of ct group in the three year period of 2014 2017 compared with that of nt group leaf wue of nt s group was significantly decreased by 7 1 and 24 8 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 and that of nt m group was significantly decreased by 8 4 16 4 and 44 0 in the years of 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 altogether the results of three year experiments indicated that under conventional tillage mode straw coverage and mulching measure increased pn and wue of wheat leaves and reduced tr at filling stage under no tillage mode except for nt s group in the year 2015 2016 pn tr and wue of wheat leaves in other groups with two types of mulching measures were reduced at filling stage to different extents compared to that of nt groups previous studies have indicated that the daily changes in pn in winter wheat showed a single peak under both mulching and no mulching conditions and mulching measures significantly increased the peak and average pn in a day by 17 7 and 11 6 respectively moreover instantaneous leaf wue was also increased after film mulching wang et al 2005 treatments of straw mulch and ridge covered with plastic film increased pn at late growth stage of winter wheat and increased leaf wue by reducing tr hou et al 2006 in this study the effects of mulching measures under conventional tillage mode on wheat photosynthesis were basically consistent with those reported previously wang et al 2005 hou et al 2006 however the results of photosynthesis under no tillage treatment were different from those reported previously for instance no tillage increased pn by 9 6 140 8 and increased wheat yield by 15 9 and wue by 32 9 in kaifeng city henan province china yang et al 2014 long term no tillage enhanced wheat pn and transient wue at late growth and development stage and dry matters accumulation and transportation rate in the dry land of south of shanxi province china wang et al 2015 conventional tillage at flowering stage in longkou city shandong province china significantly reduced pn but this difference was gradually eliminated at filling stage jiang et al 2006 by contrast li et al 2006 showed that in luoyang henan province china conventional tillage reduced pn at the middle of filling stage but increased pn at late filling stage our results showed that compared with that of ct group pn of nt group was reduced at filling stage in the first two wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 but increased in the last wheat growing seasons in the years of 2016 2017 fig 3 besides compared with that of nt group pn of nt m group was reduced which may result in the decreased yield however the causes for discrepancies among different studies may be related to soil types and climate but are still unclear and need to be further studied through long term location experiments 3 4 effects of different tillage modes and soil surface coverage measures on wheat yield and components the improved soil water and thermal status due to protective tillage provided a good environment for wheat growth and development and resulted in increased wheat yield it can be seen from table 2 that 1 compared to that of ct group plant weights of ct s and ct m groups were significantly decreased by 5 7 and 1 7 in the first wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2015 but were significantly increased by 4 6 6 2 and 3 5 6 8 in the last two wheat growing seasons in the years of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 compared that with nt group plant weight in nt s group was significantly increased by 5 8 in the years of 2016 2017 but that in nt m group was significantly decreased by 6 8 and 3 7 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 2 the spikelet numbers per panicle of ct m and nt s groups were increased by 5 2 4 7 and 3 7 4 5 as compared with those of ct and nt groups in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively and that of nt m group was higher by 11 9 than that of nt group in the years of 2016 2017 3 the number of grains per panicle of ct s group was significantly increased by 10 2 23 6 as compared to that of ct group in the three year period of 2014 2017 however that of ct m group was significantly decreased by 7 0 in the first wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2015 and gradually increased afterwards compared with that of nt group the number of grains per panicle in nt s group was increased by 25 0 and 7 2 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively and that in nt m group was also increased by 14 1 and 9 5 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively 4 the 1000 grain weight of ct s and ct m groups was significantly higher than that of ct group in the years of 2015 2016 and 2014 2015 respectively the 1000 grain weight of nt m group was decreased by 0 9 5 5 as compared to that of nt group in the three year period of 2014 2017 however that of nt s group was significantly increased by 5 9 in the years of 2014 2015 and significantly decreased by 3 7 and 2 9 in the years of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively 5 compared with that of ct group the wheat yield of ct s group was significantly increased by 6 4 9 3 in the three year period of 2014 2017 and that in ct m was significantly decreased by 3 4 in the years of 2014 2015 but significantly increased by 4 1 and 4 3 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively the wheat yield in nt s group was significantly reduced by 7 9 and 3 1 as compared to that of nt group in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively and that of nt m group was significantly reduced by 3 7 11 9 in the three year period of 2014 2017 to sum up the results of the three year experiments showed that under conventional tillage mode straw coverage increased the number of grains per ear thereby leading to the increased wheat yield mulching measures decreased wheat yield in the first wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2015 but increased wheat yield in last two wheat growing seasons in the years of 2015 2017 table 2 pn is an important factor affecting crop yield and 90 95 of wheat yield comes from photosynthesis hu et al 1986 in this study under the conventional tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures significantly increased pn and wue of wheat leaves and reduced tr at filling stage fig 3 which may lead to the increased wheat yield under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures reduced wheat yields to different extents and mulching measures was more effective than straw coverage in the three wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2017 table 2 the results of photosynthesis indicated that under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures except nt s group in the year 2015 2016 reduced pn tr and wue of wheat leaves at filling stage to different extents fig 3 which may result in the decreased wheat yield previous studies indicated that the decreased soil temperature in shallower layer due to mulching measures under no tillage at seedling establishment stage led to a delay of 7 10days in wheat growing season and affected grain filling thereby resulted in decreased wheat yield dong et al 2007 wang et al 2010 mark and mahdi 2005 in this study the soil temperature in shallower layer due to mulching measures under no tillage mode was basically reduced at seedling establishment stage in the years of 2014 2017 fig 2 the decrease in wheat yield and pn due to mulching measures under no tillage mode in this study may be related to all the reasons mentioned above as a whole the wheat yields in the years of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were lower than those in the years of 2014 2015 table 2 which may be related to the differences in wheat photosynthesis efficiency due to differences in atmosphere temperature and precipitation among the three years comprehensive comparison in changes in moisture and temperature of soils under protective tillage modes revealed that mulching measures under the conventional tillage mode increased wheat yield which is mainly due to the improvement of soil moisture and temperature under the conditions set in this study ct s treatment had the best effect and improved wheat yield to as high as 8425 9 8888 9kghm 2 4 conclusion straw coverage and film mulching under both the conventional tillage and no tillage modes increased soil moisture to a certain extent and mulching tillage was mainly superior over straw coverage in soil water preservation different tillage modes and soil surface coverage measures had somewhat different effects on soil temperature and these regulations were related to cultivation time temperature and precipitation straw coverage and mulching measures under the conventional and no tillage modes increased the temperature of soil layers at 10cm and 15cm depth to certain extend at tillering stage and wintering stage in the first growth year of 2014 2015 however two mulching measures under the conventional tillage obviously decreased soil temperature at booting and mature stages in the third year of 2016 2017 moreover mulching measures under no tillage mode reduced the temperature of soil in shallower layer at the seedling establishment stage during the three year period of 2014 2017 under conventional tillage mode straw coverage and mulching measures significantly increased pn and wue of wheat leaves but reduced tr at filling stage under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures except nt s group in the year 2015 2016 reduced pn tr and wue of wheat leaves at filling stage to different extents the effects of different tillage and mulching measures on wheat photosynthesis led to the difference in wheat yield under the conventional tillage mode straw mulching increased wheat yield by 6 4 9 3 mainly due to increased number of grains per spike under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures reduced wheat yield but mulching measures was more effective than straw coverage these results suggested that the improvement of soil water and thermal status resulted from protective tillage provide a good environment for wheat growth and development thus resulting in increased wheat yield and ct s treatment had the best effect and improved wheat yield to as high as

11549,in order to find out the appropriate measures for soil water preservation and wheat yield increase a three year field experiment was conducted in yuzhou experimental station of water saving agriculture in the west of henan province china during the growing seasons of 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 to study the effects of different tillage modes and soil mulching measures on dynamics of soil moisture and temperature photosynthetic characteristics and yield of winter wheat triticum aestivum l the results showed that straw coverage and film mulching measures under the conventional tillage and no tillage modes increased soil moisture by 4 4 27 3 13 4 41 8 and 6 2 46 7 2 4 80 2 respectively the treatments of soil surface coverage measures under both conventional tillage and no tillage modes at tillering stage increased the temperature of soil layer at 10cm and 15cm depth by 9 1 18 2 and 10 0 40 0 in 2014 2015 while mulching measures under the conventional tillage obviously increased soil temperature at wintering stage but decreased soil temperature at booting and mature stages in 2016 2017 however mulching measures under no tillage mode reduced soil temperature in shallower layer during seedling establishment stage in the three year period of 2014 2017 moreover the two mulching measures raised net photosynthetic rate pn and water use efficiency wue of functional leaves under the conventional tillage mode and reduced transpiration rate tr at the filling stage except straw coverage measures under no tillage in 2015 2016 the combination of mulching measures under no tillage reduced pn tr and wue of wheat leaves at filling stage as compared to those without mulching measures under the conventional tillage mode straw coverage increased wheat yield by 6 4 9 3 mainly due to the increase in the number of grains per panicle under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures reduced wheat yield to different extents and film mulching measures was more effective than straw coverage the combination of conventional tillage and straw mulching resulted in a yield of 8425 9 8888 9kghm 2 so this combination was recommended as the optimal treatment under the conditions set in this study keywords straw mulching film mulching soil moisture and temperature characteristics winter wheat triticum aestivum l photosynthetic characteristics yield 1 introduction water stress is one of the important and unfavorable factors influencing the growth and development of crops water deficiency has caused agricultural loss as high as 8 billion annually in the world shortage of water resources has become a global problem limiting agricultural development wang et al 2016 qin et al 2015 wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important food crops in the world china is ranked in the first place in term of wheat production and consumption the cultivated area for wheat is 21 33 30 67 million hectare accounting for 19 57 22 07 of the total cultivated area for crops in china qin et al 2015 huanghuai region is suitable for producing strong and moderate gluten wheat grains this region is one of the most important wheat production regions in china and annually has 15 30 million ha of cultivated area for wheat the highly efficient development of wheat with high yield and good quality is of strategic significance for ensuring food safety in china however the unbalance of precipitation supply and demand for crops is the main factor limiting agricultural productivity in this region for winter wheat it is critical to meet water requirement at the period 4 5 months of jointing stage booting stage and filling stage however precipitations in these periods only account for 1 5 1 4 of demanded water of winter wheat and water deficiency can be as high as approximately 200mm xu et al 2014 moreover due to the consecutive rotary cultivation practice the cultivation layer of field soil has become shallower and shallower and soil physicochemical properties including soil gas air permeability ventilation and soil water permeability have become poorer and poorer which significantly reduce soil productivity seriously limit high output of crops and further aggravate the contradiction between water demand and supply this issue has become the spot light drawing the attentions of the agricultural researchers li et al 2015 xu et al 2015 soil tillage is an important measure for controlling soil water content fertility gas air and heat improved tillage measures have been shown to improve soil physicochemical properties and soil water use efficiency swue bottinelli et al 2017 many studies have indicated that the protective tillage measures could preserve soil water increase soil moisture improve soil quality and increase crop yield and then benefit for the sustainable development of agricultural production bottinelli et al 2017 yang et al 2016 lampurlanés et al 2016 mitchell et al 2017 bhatt and khera 2006 shao et al 2016 for instance it has been shown that 1 no tillage enhanced soil water holding capacity and reduced soil evaporation lampurlanés et al 2016 2 mulching measures was also an effective way to reduce soil water evaporation drove water moving up from lower layer to the upper layer where water was available for crops improved wheat growth and development and increased crop productivity and wue li et al 2016 3 mulching measures under no tillage stimulated the formation of soil aggregates increased soil nitrogen and carbon contents and then enhanced the soil microbial activities mitchell et al 2017 and 4 long term no tillage in the drought region improved the capacity of soil water conservation and storage enhanced winter wheat s net photosynthesis rate pn transient water use efficiency twue and the rates of dry matters accumulation and transportation subsequently coordinated the relationship among various yield components and increased the yield of winter wheat wang et al 2015 straw coverage inhibited flag leaves chlorophyll degradation delayed leaf senescence improved soil moisture status optimized the soil root trails and ultimately enhanced the accumulation of dry matters and wheat yield formation in the drought years wu et al 2015 the increased wheat yield by mulching measures was attributed mainly to its resultant increased soil moisture and temperature cook et al 2006 and changes in soil structure and fertility zhang et al 2011 moreover mulching tillage enriched soil microorganisms and increased urease activity zhao et al 2002 the effects of mulching measures on soil physicochemical properties were found to be dependent on a number of factors such as mulch types and quantity mulching ways and timing etc wu et al 2011 kader et al 2017a zhang et al 2008 currently mulching measures and straw coverage are two measures widely applied in agricultural production application of mulching measures or straw coverage in the hilly dry land of the west of henan province where the seasonal drought is seriously improved soil moisture and farm land fertility stimulated wheat tillering and increased the number of grains per ear and 1000 grain weight wu et al 2011 although mulching tillage cost more and was less friendly to environment than straw coverage kader et al 2017a b it was superior over straw coverage in improving crop s yield zhang et al 2008 currently a majority of studies have focused on the effects of monoculture or mulching measures on soil physicochemical properties and the agronomic trails of crops very few studies have explored on effects of combined tillage modes and mulching measures on swue moreover these studies applied shorter treatment duration which resulted in different effects long term multiple years application of same tillage mode can be more reflective for the actual tillage effects li et al 2006 based on the present studies we conducted experiments in yuzhou experimental station for water saving agriculture in the west of henan province in 2014 to investigate the effects of different tillage modes conventional tillage and no tillage and soil surface coverage treatments straw coverage and mulching measures on soil moisture and temperature photosynthetic characteristics and winter wheat yield aiming to find out the protective tillage mode most suitable for cultivation of wheat with high grain yield and good quality in huanghuai region and to provide a theoretical basis for food safety production and sustainable agriculture development 2

70kghm 2 p2o5 and 75kghm 2 k2o respectively among them 50 of nitrogen fertilizer was applied as the bottom application and 30 and 20 of nitrogen fertilizer were applied at jointing stage and filling stage as the additional application respectively no irrigation was applied during the whole wheat growth period in the three years period of 2014 2017 2 3 assay method 2 3 1 measurement of soil moisture soil samples within 0 100cm layer were collected using soil augers at the tillering stage jointing stage booting stage and filling stage of winter wheat respectively and their moisture contents were measured with oven drying method 2 3 2 measurement of soil temperature the soil temperatures were read at the fixed locations for all the stages using hy 1 right angle geothermometer apresys precision photoelectric co ltd shanghai china in brief five geothermometers per group were penetrated in the middle row of various plots the soil temperatures at 5 10 15 20 and 25cm layers were measured in the morning 7 00 am afternoon 14 00 pm and evening 19 00 pm of the typical sunny days during the tillering stage wintering stage seedling establishment stage booting stage and mature stage the mean value of three readings was taken as the daily mean value of soil temperature 2 3 3 measurement of wheat photosynthetic parameters photosynthesis rate pn and transpiration rate tr of winter wheat leaves at filling stage were measured at 9 30 11 00 am of sunny and windless wind speed was less than 0 2ms 1 days using li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor company lincoln ne usa with open gas circuit at the light intensity of 800 1200μmolm 2 s 1 in leaf chamber 2cm 3cm temperature was set at 25 c and air flow rate was set at 500μmols 1 leaf wue the amount of assimilated co2 by plant divided by per unit mass of water was measured with fischer s and powel s method fischer and turner 1978 powles 1984 and expressed as pn tr μmol co2 mmol 1 h2o 2 3 4 wheat yield and components before harvest the numbers of ear in various representative plots of 1m2 were surveyed and converted into number of ear per unit area at the mature stage all the wheat plants in various plots were harvested their grains were threshed air dried and weighted the 1000 grain weight was measured and converted into the grain yield per unit area a total of 10 wheat plants in each plot were randomly selected and the numbers of grains of all the ears ware counted and converted into number of grains per ear 2 4 statistical analyses of the experimental data for all test data obtained the outlier was eliminated using the grubbs method qi et al 2015 firstly test data sets were arranged from the smallest to the largest one the mean value x and standard deviation s were calculated secondly the difference between the maximum and minimum values and the mean value were calculated respectively the data which had the larger difference as compared to the mean value was considered as the suspicious value then the gi value was calculated as follows gi xi x s where i was the ordinal number of the suspicious value xi x was the residual error and s was the standard deviation gi value and the threshold value gp n given in the grabus table were calculated and when the gi value was larger than the threshold value gp n it was judged as outlier and removed the rest were subjected to analysis of variance and the differences among the mean values of the six treatments in the same growth stage of winter wheat were compared by lsd test at an α level of 0 05 statistical analyses of the data were performed using spss 19 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different tillage modes and soil surface coverage measures on soil moisture our results showed that compared to those in ct group 1 in the year of 2014 2015 the contents of soil moisture in ct s group at tillering stage and filling stage were significantly increased by 27 3 and 5 0 respectively table 1 and those in ct m group at tillering stage and booting stage were significantly increased by 31 2 and 6 2 respectively 2 in the year of 2015 2016 the contents of soil moisture in ct s group at booting stage and filling stage were significantly increased by 19 7 and 9 8 and those in ct m group were significantly increased by 13 9 and 41 2 respectively and 3 in the year of 2016 2017 the contents of soil moisture at jointing stage booting stage and filling stage in ct s and ct m groups were significantly increased by 7 5 4 4 22 2 and 19 9 9 7 46 7 respectively in addition compared with those of nt group 1 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the soil moisture contents of nt s and nt m groups at jointing stage were increased significantly by 41 8 80 2 and 23 4 34 0 respectively 2 in the year of 2015 2016 the soil moisture contents of nt s and nt m groups at booting stage were also significantly increased by 13 4 and 2 4 respectively and 3 in the year of 2016 2017 the soil moisture content of nt m group at jointing stage was significantly increased by 10 8 and that of nt s group at filling stage was significantly increased by 17 0 therefore the results of the three year experiments indicated that both straw coverage and mulching measures under conventional tillage and no tillage modes increased soil moisture contents to different extents and mulching tillage was mainly superior over straw coverage in soil water preservation li and shu 1991 reported that soil moisture during the wheat sowing period might contribute to about 43 of wheat yield the precipitations in this region are low and not intense especially from november to march of the following year fig 1 and can not meet the wheat water requirement the increase in soil moisture caused by mulching measures was beneficial for wheat growth and laid a foundation for increasing wheat yield plastic film mulching was found to increase the soil water storage of 0 200cm soil profile before the jointing stage and the proportion of water consumption after jointing to the total water consumption moreover it also enhanced deep soil water usage in arid years and then enhanced the biomass and grain yield at harvest yang et al 2015 straw mulch served as physical barriers to prevent rainwater from running off or evaporating and thus increased soil water infiltration and storage chen et al 2015 our results were basically consistent with those reported previously chen et al 2015 yang et al 2015 it has been shown that mulching measures increased crop yield through affecting soil heat transfer and water movement liang et al 2017 and increase in soil moisture content by mulching measures was resulted from mulch that blocked the vertical evaporation and turbulent flow of soil water forced the water underneath the mulch to move horizontally and thus reduced effectively water evaporation chen et al 2015 wang et al 2013 saglam et al 2017 and soil water consumption from the root zone kader et al 2017b these may be the reasons for the increased soil moisture under mulching measures and two tillage modes in this study 3 2 effects of different tillage modes and coverage measures on soil temperature soil thermal state is one of the important environmental factors affecting the growth and development of crops within certain temperature range the higher soil temperature will lead to more frequent water movement more water vapors in soil and more rapid crop growth and development xu et al 2014 soil tillage changes the soil physicochemical properties and affects heat movement in soils and subsequently affects soil temperature chen et al 2009 our results showed that compared to those in ct group 1 in the year of 2014 2015 and the temperature of the 10 cm and 15 cm soil layers in ct s group at tillering stage and wintering stage were significantly increased by 9 1 20 0 and 9 1 25 0 and those in ct m group were significantly increased by 9 1 20 0 and 18 2 37 5 respectively 2 in the year of 2015 2016 the soil temperatures of different layers in ct m group at tillering stage were significantly increased by 9 1 150 0 and those at 5 20 and 25 cm soil layers in ct s group were significantly increased by 40 0 42 9 and 16 7 respectively two mulching treatments significantly raised soil temperature at 5 cm soil layer by 10 4 and 8 3 at mature stage significantly reduced soil temperature at 20 and 25 cm soil layers by 14 9 23 5 and 8 5 25 5 respectively 3 in the year of 2016 2017 the soil temperatures of different layers at 0 25cm depth in ct s group at wintering stage were significantly increased by 12 5 42 9 but those at 0 20cm soil depth at booting stage and at 5 25cm soil depth at mature stage were decreased by 3 2 9 4 and 14 5 45 2 respectively the soil temperatures at 5 15 20 and 25 cm soil layers in ct m group at wintering stage were significantly increased 11 1 28 6 25 0 and 25 0 but those at 10 15 and 20 cm soil layers at mature stage were significantly decreased by 7 3 9 8 and 12 9 respectively in addition compared with those of nt group 1 in the year of 2014 2015 and the soil temperatures at 10 cm and 15 cm soil layers in nt s group at tillering stage and wintering stage were significantly increased by 10 0 30 0 and 30 0 71 4 and those in nt m group were significantly increased by 40 0 40 0 and 40 0 42 9 2 in the year of 2015 2016 the soil temperature at 5 cm soil layer in nt s group at seeding establishment stage was significantly decreased by 75 0 and those at 5 and 10 cm soil layers in nt m group were significantly decreased by 50 0 and 62 5 3 in the year of 2016 2017 the soil temperatures at 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm soil layers in nt s group at mature stage were significantly increased by 6 2 14 0 14 8 28 6 and 11 8 respectively therefore the results of the three year experiments indicated that both straw coverage and mulching measures under the conventional tillage and no tillage modes increased the soil temperature at 10 cm and 15 cm soil layers to certain extents at tillering stage and wintering stage in the year of 2014 2015 fig 2 moreover two mulching measures under conventional tillage led to obvious temperature increase at wintering stage and temperature decrease at booting stage and mature stage in the year of 2016 2017 previous studies have indicated that mulching measures and straw coverage caused significant temperature increasing and decreasing effects where the former mainly occurred at the jointing stage and the latter at post jointing stage in addition mulching measures had stronger temperature increasing effects than straw coverage while the straw coverage had better temperature decreasing effects chen et al 2014 the temperature increasing effects of mulching measure at seedling stage and jointing stage were more significant and the temperature difference between the 10cm and 20cm soil depth was the largest li et al 2010 the soil layers in the nt m and ct m groups also displayed the effect of when atmosphere temperature is high the soil temperature is reduced while when atmosphere temperature is low the soil temperature was increased and this effect was gradually reduced with the soil layer deepening wang et al 2010 our results are basically consistent with those reported previously wang et al 2010 chen et al 2014 li et al 2010 it has been reported that the temperature increasing effect of straw coverage was mainly derived from perseveration of soil moisture increase in soil thermal capacity and blockage of long wavelength radiation on the soil surface thus leading to alleviated reduction in soil temperature underneath the coverage at night time and or caused by cold current liang et al 2017 mulching measures eliminated the latent heat exchange in soil alleviated sensible heat transfer in soil inhibited the effective emission and radiation at the night time and thus increased the temperature of soils above and underneath the coverage film however at the later wheat growth stages due to light blockage by the film mulching measures reduced the air flow on the soil surface and evaporation intensity and blocked the transfer of water and heat between soil and atmosphere thus reduced the temperature on soil surface to certain extent xue et al 2012 in this study the effects of two types of coverage measures on soil temperature at different wheat growth stages may be the results of all the above mentioned however whether there is a cooperative effect between tillage modes and soil surface coverage measures on soil temperature is still unclear and remains to be further studied 3 3 effects of different tillage modes and coverage measures on photosynthesis characteristics of wheat our results showed that 1 compared with that of ct group pns in ct s and ct m groups at filling stage in the two year period of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were significantly increased by 42 0 42 4 and 14 1 27 6 respectively additionally compared with that of nt group pns in nt s and nt m groups in the year of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 were significantly decreased by 12 0 33 2 and 16 5 58 3 respectively 2 compared to that in ct trs of wheat leaves in ct s and ct m groups in the two year period of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were significantly decreased by 62 1 8 3 and 46 7 22 2 respectively additionally those in nt s and nt m groups in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 were significantly decreased by 5 3 11 2 and 8 8 25 5 respectively compared to those in nt group 3 leaf wues of ct s and ct m groups were significantly increased by 9 6 275 8 55 4 and 13 8 113 9 64 1 as compared with that of ct group in the three year period of 2014 2017 compared with that of nt group leaf wue of nt s group was significantly decreased by 7 1 and 24 8 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 and that of nt m group was significantly decreased by 8 4 16 4 and 44 0 in the years of 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 altogether the results of three year experiments indicated that under conventional tillage mode straw coverage and mulching measure increased pn and wue of wheat leaves and reduced tr at filling stage under no tillage mode except for nt s group in the year 2015 2016 pn tr and wue of wheat leaves in other groups with two types of mulching measures were reduced at filling stage to different extents compared to that of nt groups previous studies have indicated that the daily changes in pn in winter wheat showed a single peak under both mulching and no mulching conditions and mulching measures significantly increased the peak and average pn in a day by 17 7 and 11 6 respectively moreover instantaneous leaf wue was also increased after film mulching wang et al 2005 treatments of straw mulch and ridge covered with plastic film increased pn at late growth stage of winter wheat and increased leaf wue by reducing tr hou et al 2006 in this study the effects of mulching measures under conventional tillage mode on wheat photosynthesis were basically consistent with those reported previously wang et al 2005 hou et al 2006 however the results of photosynthesis under no tillage treatment were different from those reported previously for instance no tillage increased pn by 9 6 140 8 and increased wheat yield by 15 9 and wue by 32 9 in kaifeng city henan province china yang et al 2014 long term no tillage enhanced wheat pn and transient wue at late growth and development stage and dry matters accumulation and transportation rate in the dry land of south of shanxi province china wang et al 2015 conventional tillage at flowering stage in longkou city shandong province china significantly reduced pn but this difference was gradually eliminated at filling stage jiang et al 2006 by contrast li et al 2006 showed that in luoyang henan province china conventional tillage reduced pn at the middle of filling stage but increased pn at late filling stage our results showed that compared with that of ct group pn of nt group was reduced at filling stage in the first two wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 but increased in the last wheat growing seasons in the years of 2016 2017 fig 3 besides compared with that of nt group pn of nt m group was reduced which may result in the decreased yield however the causes for discrepancies among different studies may be related to soil types and climate but are still unclear and need to be further studied through long term location experiments 3 4 effects of different tillage modes and soil surface coverage measures on wheat yield and components the improved soil water and thermal status due to protective tillage provided a good environment for wheat growth and development and resulted in increased wheat yield it can be seen from table 2 that 1 compared to that of ct group plant weights of ct s and ct m groups were significantly decreased by 5 7 and 1 7 in the first wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2015 but were significantly increased by 4 6 6 2 and 3 5 6 8 in the last two wheat growing seasons in the years of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 compared that with nt group plant weight in nt s group was significantly increased by 5 8 in the years of 2016 2017 but that in nt m group was significantly decreased by 6 8 and 3 7 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 2 the spikelet numbers per panicle of ct m and nt s groups were increased by 5 2 4 7 and 3 7 4 5 as compared with those of ct and nt groups in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively and that of nt m group was higher by 11 9 than that of nt group in the years of 2016 2017 3 the number of grains per panicle of ct s group was significantly increased by 10 2 23 6 as compared to that of ct group in the three year period of 2014 2017 however that of ct m group was significantly decreased by 7 0 in the first wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2015 and gradually increased afterwards compared with that of nt group the number of grains per panicle in nt s group was increased by 25 0 and 7 2 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively and that in nt m group was also increased by 14 1 and 9 5 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively 4 the 1000 grain weight of ct s and ct m groups was significantly higher than that of ct group in the years of 2015 2016 and 2014 2015 respectively the 1000 grain weight of nt m group was decreased by 0 9 5 5 as compared to that of nt group in the three year period of 2014 2017 however that of nt s group was significantly increased by 5 9 in the years of 2014 2015 and significantly decreased by 3 7 and 2 9 in the years of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively 5 compared with that of ct group the wheat yield of ct s group was significantly increased by 6 4 9 3 in the three year period of 2014 2017 and that in ct m was significantly decreased by 3 4 in the years of 2014 2015 but significantly increased by 4 1 and 4 3 in the years of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively the wheat yield in nt s group was significantly reduced by 7 9 and 3 1 as compared to that of nt group in the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively and that of nt m group was significantly reduced by 3 7 11 9 in the three year period of 2014 2017 to sum up the results of the three year experiments showed that under conventional tillage mode straw coverage increased the number of grains per ear thereby leading to the increased wheat yield mulching measures decreased wheat yield in the first wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2015 but increased wheat yield in last two wheat growing seasons in the years of 2015 2017 table 2 pn is an important factor affecting crop yield and 90 95 of wheat yield comes from photosynthesis hu et al 1986 in this study under the conventional tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures significantly increased pn and wue of wheat leaves and reduced tr at filling stage fig 3 which may lead to the increased wheat yield under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures reduced wheat yields to different extents and mulching measures was more effective than straw coverage in the three wheat growing seasons in the years of 2014 2017 table 2 the results of photosynthesis indicated that under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures except nt s group in the year 2015 2016 reduced pn tr and wue of wheat leaves at filling stage to different extents fig 3 which may result in the decreased wheat yield previous studies indicated that the decreased soil temperature in shallower layer due to mulching measures under no tillage at seedling establishment stage led to a delay of 7 10days in wheat growing season and affected grain filling thereby resulted in decreased wheat yield dong et al 2007 wang et al 2010 mark and mahdi 2005 in this study the soil temperature in shallower layer due to mulching measures under no tillage mode was basically reduced at seedling establishment stage in the years of 2014 2017 fig 2 the decrease in wheat yield and pn due to mulching measures under no tillage mode in this study may be related to all the reasons mentioned above as a whole the wheat yields in the years of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were lower than those in the years of 2014 2015 table 2 which may be related to the differences in wheat photosynthesis efficiency due to differences in atmosphere temperature and precipitation among the three years comprehensive comparison in changes in moisture and temperature of soils under protective tillage modes revealed that mulching measures under the conventional tillage mode increased wheat yield which is mainly due to the improvement of soil moisture and temperature under the conditions set in this study ct s treatment had the best effect and improved wheat yield to as high as 8425 9 8888 9kghm 2 4 conclusion straw coverage and film mulching under both the conventional tillage and no tillage modes increased soil moisture to a certain extent and mulching tillage was mainly superior over straw coverage in soil water preservation different tillage modes and soil surface coverage measures had somewhat different effects on soil temperature and these regulations were related to cultivation time temperature and precipitation straw coverage and mulching measures under the conventional and no tillage modes increased the temperature of soil layers at 10cm and 15cm depth to certain extend at tillering stage and wintering stage in the first growth year of 2014 2015 however two mulching measures under the conventional tillage obviously decreased soil temperature at booting and mature stages in the third year of 2016 2017 moreover mulching measures under no tillage mode reduced the temperature of soil in shallower layer at the seedling establishment stage during the three year period of 2014 2017 under conventional tillage mode straw coverage and mulching measures significantly increased pn and wue of wheat leaves but reduced tr at filling stage under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures except nt s group in the year 2015 2016 reduced pn tr and wue of wheat leaves at filling stage to different extents the effects of different tillage and mulching measures on wheat photosynthesis led to the difference in wheat yield under the conventional tillage mode straw mulching increased wheat yield by 6 4 9 3 mainly due to increased number of grains per spike under no tillage mode both straw coverage and mulching measures reduced wheat yield but mulching measures was more effective than straw coverage these results suggested that the improvement of soil water and thermal status resulted from protective tillage provide a good environment for wheat growth and development thus resulting in increased wheat yield and ct s treatment had the best effect and improved wheat yield to as high as
