22010,stability of the platform is the most fundamental guarantee for floating offshore wind turbines in order to explore hydrodynamics of floating wind turbine spar platform under the coupling effect of wind and wave whole model of floating wind turbine is established based on the oc3 hywind spar buoy platform and the nrel 5 mw wind turbine taking the research experiences of traditional marine engineering this work proposed the structural design method of installing heave plate on main body of spar based on the bladed element momentum theory this paper adopts fortran language to accomplish the secondary development of hydrodynamic software aqwa to establish the coupled aerodynamic hydrodynamic mooring line system model the amplitude frequency curves of the added mass radiation damping wave exciting force and response amplitude operators rao were obtained based on radiation diffraction theory to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of floating wind turbine spar platform in frequency domain in the time domain analysis the three kinds of working conditions include wave only non coupling effect of wind wave and coupling effect of wind wave were conducted comparatively to verify the importance of wind load and wind wave interaction in addition the actual motions of original spar and spar with heave plates were analyzed to explore the effects of the heave plate and its installation position on the nonlinear dynamic response characteristics of spar under the coupling effect of wind and wave the research results indicated that the installation position of the heave plate has little influence on the surge response in view of the actual heave motion the heave plate can play a positive effect no matter where the heave plate is installed when the heave plate is located on the upper part of the platform the pitch response and the intensity of the fluctuation of the platform will be greatly reduced finally time domain mooring analysis for spar platform with and without heave plate is performed to illustrate the feasibility of the present approach for mooring modeling keywords floating wind turbine spar heave plate radiation diffraction theory bladed element momentum 1 introduction from land to sea from shallow to deep and from fixed foundation to floating platform has become an inevitable development trend of future wind farms jeon et al 2013 wang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the offshore wind energy has a very promising future when considering the abundant wind resources as well as the continuous progress of wind turbine technology zhang et al 2018 for example total capacity of the offshore wind energy is expected to reach 40 gw by 2020 and 150 gw by 2030 which could meet 4 and 14 of the whole eu electricity consumption campanile et al 2018 nowadays offshore wind turbines mainly concentrate in shadow water areas but for deep water areas with more abundant and higher quality wind energy floating platform should be used for cost consideration ding et al 2017 li et al 2019 offshore wind turbines have to withstand the effects of waves which is the biggest difference from onshore wind turbines the nonlinear wave excitation would not only affect the normal operation of the drive system in nacelle but also decrease the power generation efficiency and may even lead to the buckling and capsizing of the tower compared with onshore wind turbines floating offshore wind turbines are always in the state of unbalanced force bearing and unsteady motion due to its unstable foundation chen and basu 2018 obviously stability of the floating platform is the basic guarantee for the safe operation of floating offshore wind turbines therefore it s extremely important to explore the dynamic response of floating wind turbine platform under the external excitations at present floating platforms can be mainly divided into four categories according to its methods of achieving stability namely tlp tension leg platform spar semi submersible and barge jonkman and matha 2009 of which the stability comes from pre tension of the tension leg restoring force of the mooring line and water plane area moment compare to the other three platforms spar has the advantages of lower center of gravity high flexibility and lower cost but it still has some shortcomings in practical engineering application namely the large amplitude heave response which would aggravate the fatigue of the mooring line and the riser system or even the eventual failure of whole system at present there mainly exist two approaches to inhibit the large amplitude heave response of spar enlarge the draught of the platform on the one hand there s no doubt that this method can improve the stability of spar but it would dramatically increase the mass of platform and therefore raise the cost of transportation and installation enlarge the heave added mass and damping on the other hand namely installing heave plate the heave plate could efficiently increase the added mass and damping zhu and lim 2017 and therefore achieve the purpose of stability improvement of spar scholars from both academia and industry have already conducted lots of researches on heave plate however i most of them focus on the structural parameters including number shape and spacing etc to its own hydrodynamic characteristics an and faltinsen 2013 thiagarajan and troesch 1998 prislin et al 1998 ii part of them involve effects of heave plate on hydrodynamics on floating structures but the methods adopted are mainly experimental studies such as free decay oscillation method or forced oscillation method which could hardly describe the nonlinear characteristics of spar movements in complex marine environment zhang and ishihara 2018 tao and dray 2008 iii some of them do consider effect of the heave plate on spar platform but their researches mainly focus on the traditional oil gas spar platform of which the load characteristic is quite different from that of floating offshore wind turbine spar platform li et al 2013 lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 ma et al 2019 iv although few researchers consider wind excitation it s just a simplified constant thrust force skaare et al 2007 ding et al 2018 which on one hand is an ideal working condition on the other hand the superposition of wind speed and rotor fore aft motion induced by platform motion will lead to the change of relative wind speed therefore it s inaccurate to simplify the rotor thrust force the modern wind turbine is the largest rotating machinery that human beings have ever created it s quite different from traditional developed offshore oil gas platform because of its great aerodynamic force generated from continuous rotation of the rotor its induction effect on the hydrodynamic loading let alone the loading change during starting process and the overall dynamic instability due to the change of pitch control and brake system at present professional wind turbine simulation software such as bladed and fast already have mature aerodynamic load solving model but its hydrodynamic load calculation model is relatively poor traditional marine engineering hydrodynamic software such as wamit and orcaflex have mature hydrodynamic load computing model but its aerodynamic load solving model is simplified and therefore not suitable for floating offshore wind turbine therefore in order to explore effects of heave plate on dynamic response of floating wind turbine spar platform taking the experiences of traditional marine engineering this paper proposes the structural design method of installing heave plate on the main body of the platform secondly based on the bladed element momentum bem this paper adopts the fortran language to realize the secondary development of hydrodynamic software aqwa finally considering the coupling effect of wind and wave the influence of heave plate and its installation position on floating offshore wind turbine spar platform is explored for the hope of providing a theoretical reference for the design optimization and safety operation of floating wind turbine 2 research object floating offshore wind turbine system contains three parts the wind turbine system which is used to capture the wind energy the floating platform which is for maintaining the whole system on the sea surface the mooring line system which is designed to prevent the whole system from drifting and also provide part of the restoring force research object in this paper is the wind turbine based on a typical spar type platform more specifically the wind turbine is nrel 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 miao et al 2019 while the platform is the oc3 hywind spar buoy major geometry dimensions and structural parameters of the wind turbine and spar are listed in table 1 and table 2 based on parameters of nrel 5 mw wind turbine and oc3 hywind spar three dimensional cad tool nx 9 0 is employed to establish the whole floating offshore wind turbine system which is presented in fig 1 in order to explore the effect of a heave plate and its installation position on hydrodynamics of floating offshore wind turbine spar platform remodeling the whole system by installing the heave plate on main body of spar including three installation position upper part middle part and bottom part which can be seen in fig 2 since researches objects on floating wind turbine are generally the conceptual model proposed by the nrel the upper wind turbine system including tower blade and hub etc has detailed geometry and structural parameters but the detailed information of the platform for example the wall thickness and the mass distribution cannot be found which means that it s impossible to obtain the actual parameters compared with the original spar if doing the improved structural design therefore all the structural parameters of platforms with heave plate are the same with the original floating wind turbine system for the need of quantitative analysis 3 environment load 3 1 wind load there are three kinds of aerodynamic load solution methods at present including vortex wake method based on the potential flow theory bladed element momentum theory bem and computational fluid dynamic cfd method compared with the other two methods bem has the advantage of both simplicity and efficiency but the force calculation of blade element needs reasonable empirical coefficients and a correction for tip and hub losses etc moreover bem cannot deal with the situation of wind turbine entering turbulence and cannot consider the influence of hub and tip vortex structure on induced velocity however in view of its limitations abundant correction methods have been developed in 1957 leishman and beddoes proposed an empirical model to simulate the unsteady aerodynamic performance of airfoils considering the effects of dynamic wake and leading edge separation mahendra et al 2003 in 1991 ϕye 1991 proposed a dynamic wake model for simulating unsteady aerodynamic loads in 1995 snel and schepers 1995 validated the validity of the dynamic wake model in 1999 du 1999 2000 proposed an empirical model for correcting the three dimensional rotation effect therefore the bem theory is still the main calculation method of wind turbine blade aerodynamic load at present this paper mainly studies the dynamic response of floating wind turbine platform under wind and wave coupling the essential requirement is to solve aerodynamic force quickly and efficiently therefore the bem theory is selected to establish the aerodynamic model of the floating wind turbine a section of cross section of the blade that is perpendicular to the pitch axis and has the length d r is taken as the research object the velocity triangle related to the airfoil and force acting on the airfoil can be seen in fig 3 as can be seen from this figure v is the absolute wind velocity w is the relative wind velocity ω is the rotor rotational speed φ is the wind inflow angle β i is the airfoil twist angle α i is the airfoil attack angle a is the axial induction factor b is the tangential induction factor d l and d d are the lift force and drag force components of d r according to fig 3 by applying the bem theory the lift force d l and drag force d d acting on the blade element d r can be written as 1 d l 1 2 c l ρ c w 2 d r 2 d d 1 2 c d ρ c w 2 d r where c l and c d are the lift force coefficient and drag force coefficient respectively c is the airfoil chord length ρ is the air density 1 29 kg m3 the lift force and drag force acting on the blade element can be decomposed according to the in plane direction which is tangential to the rotor rotation plane and out of plane direction which is vertical to the rotor rotation plane namely the axial force df x and the tangential force df y 3 df x 1 2 c x ρ c w 2 d r 4 df y 1 2 c y ρ c w 2 d r 5 c x c l cos φ c d sin φ 6 c y c l sin φ c d cos φ where c x and c y are the axial force coefficient and tangential force coefficient therefore the whole force d t and the torque d m acting on the blade element d r which has a distance of r away from the blade root of all the blades can be written as 7 d t n b 1 2 c l cos φ c d sin φ ρ c w 2 d r 8 d m n b 1 2 c l sin φ c d cos φ ρ c w 2 d r r where n b is the number the blades by integration the force and torque acting on the rotor can be written as 9 t r hub r n b 1 2 c l cos φ c d sin φ ρ c w 2 d r 10 m r hub r n b 1 2 c l sin φ c d cos φ ρ c w 2 r d r where r is the rotor radius r hub is the hub radius according to the vector relations in fig 3 it can be seen the relative wind speed w used in eq 6 10 is relevant to many factors including the absolute wind speed v rotor rotational speed ω lift force coefficient c l drag force coefficient c d axial induction factor a tangential induction factor b pitch angle θ and local blade element twist angle β i in calculation induction factors are solved by iteration algorithm which is given as the following procedure step 1 assume the initial values of axial induction factor and tangential induction factor step 2 calculate the wind inflow angle and the attack angle by eq 11 12 11 φ arctan 1 a v 1 b ω r 12 α φ β θ step 3 calculate the blade tip loss and hub loss according to eq 13 14 13 f tip 2 π arccos exp n b r r 2 r sin φ 14 f hub 2 π arccos exp n b r r hub 2 r hub sin φ step 4 recalculate the axial induction factor and tangential induction factor by invoking the lift force coefficient and drag force coefficient 15 a σ c x 4 f sin 2 φ n b c 2 π r c x 16 b σ c y 4 f sin φ cos φ n b c 2 π r c y 17 f f tip f hub 18 σ n b c 2 π r where σ is the solidity of the blade element when the axial induction factor is greater than 0 4 the original bem theory would be invalid therefore a correction theory to the axial induction factor developed by buhl is applied in this paper buhl 2005 it s written as 19 a 0 5 18 σ c x 36 f 2 sin 2 φ 40 f sin 2 φ 6 18 f sin 2 φ σ c x 36 f 4 sin 4 φ 48 f sin 4 φ 0 5 9 σ c x 50 f sin 2 φ 36 f 2 sin 2 φ based on the above bem theory the induction factors aerodynamic parameters and attack angle for each blade elements can be obtained by the iteration algorithm in calculation both the axial induction factor and tangential induction factor are set to 0 while the error is set to 0 00004 dai et al 2011 in eq 19 the small value of the axial induction factor is adopted that is the minus sign is adopted besides during the actual operation of the wind turbine dynamic stall will be caused by the rotation of blades compared with the static state not only will the stall delay occur on the rotating blades but the flow separation will even be completely eliminated in the boundary layer near the blades root therefore the lift force coefficient on the blade section is much higher than that of the static airfoil the reason is that the existence of coriolis force generates an additional pressure gradient which enables the fluid in the boundary layer to obtain an additional acceleration of flowing towards the trailing edge of the blades in order to more accurately predict the aerodynamic performance of wind turbines in actual operation the du selig stall delay model is employed here to modify the lift force coefficient c l 3 d and the drag force coefficient c d 3 d 20 c l 3 d c l 2 d δ c l 21 c d 3 d c d 2 d δ c d where c l 2 d is the two dimensional lift force coefficient c d 2 d is the two dimensional drag force coefficient δ c l is the increase in the three dimensional lift force coefficient δ c d is the decrease in the three dimensional drag force coefficient 22 δ c l f l c l p c l 2 d 23 δ c d f d c d 2 d c d 0 where c l p 2 π α α 0 α 0 is the angle of attract when the lift force is 0 α is the actual angle of attack c d 0 is the value of c d 2 d when the α is 0 through the correlation between the function and the measured data the following empirical correction relation can be obtained 24 f l 1 2 π 1 6 c r 0 1267 m c r z λ r r 1 c r z λ r r 1 25 f d 1 2 π 1 6 c r 0 1267 m c r z 2 λ r r 1 c r z 2 λ r r 1 where λ λ 1 λ 2 λ is the tip speed ratio the value relation of m and z of empirical correction factor is 26 m 1 0 c r 0 5 1 0 5 4 c r 0 5 2 3 c r 0 5 z 0 5 0 625 c r 1 0 3 2 wave load the wave forces acting on the large scale floating structure can be calculated by employing the radiation diffraction theory referring to fig 4 the whole domain is a semi infinite unbounded flow domain with the boundary s b s d s f and s c where s f indicates the free surface of the water s d indicates the seabed boundary s c indicates the infinite boundary of the flow domain and s b indicates surface of the floating structure respectively by assuming the water to be inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational there would exist a velocity potential ϕ which consists of three parts and can be written as 27 ϕ ϕ i ϕ d j 1 6 ϕ r where ϕ i is the incident potential due to the undisturbed incoming wave ϕ d is the diffraction potential due to the diffraction of the undisturbed incoming wave ϕ r is the radiation potential due to the six degrees of freedom dof motion of the floating structure besides the velocity potential ϕ should meet the following boundary conditions 28 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 29 ϕ z 0 30 g ϕ z 2 ϕ t 2 0 31 ϕ n u n where g is the gravity acceleration t is the time point n is the outward unit vector normal to the structure boundary u is the velocity vector of displacement of floating structure in addition the velocity potential should also meet the radiation condition sommerfeld condition based on the above mentioned boundary conditions the unknown velocity potential can be solved at a discrete number of points on the wetted surface of the floating structure by using green s theorem according to the linearized bernoulli equation the first order water pressure distribution can be obtained from the pressure distribution the various fluid forces may be calculated by integrating the pressure over the whole wetted surface of the floating structure in addition to the wave frequency response which is consistent with the wave frequency there would be a drift motion at a large period for the floating structure because of being subjected to the second order mean drift force the second order mean drift force can be got by the near field solution and the far field solution near field solution could obtain the mean wave force and moment acting on floating structures in all dofs based on the mean wetted surface integration approach expressions of the near field solution of the second order mean drift force are given as follows 32 f s t r c 2 w l 1 2 ρ g ζ r 2 n n 1 2 n 2 2 d l s 0 1 2 ρ φ 2 n d s s 0 ρ x φ t n d s m s r x g 33 m s t r c 2 w l 1 2 ρ g ζ r 2 r n n 1 2 n 2 2 d l s 0 1 2 ρ φ 2 r n d s s 0 ρ x φ t r n d s i s r x g where w l is the waterline along the surface of the floating structure ζ r is the wave height s 0 is the wet surface of the floating structure x is the motion displacement vector of the surface of the floating structure i s is the inertia moment matrix of the floating structure r is the rotation matrix of the floating structure x is the acceleration vector of the point mass of the floating structure the far field solution could be used to calculate the mean drift force in the horizontal plane by considering the rate of change of linear and angular momentum within a prescribed fluid domain expressions of the far field solution of the second order mean drift force are given as follows 34 f x s i n p n 1 ρ v x v n d s d g x d t 35 f y s i n p n 2 ρ v y v n d s d g y d t 36 m z s i n p r n 3 ρ r v 3 v n d s d h z d t where s in is the boundary surface of the fluid area at infinity p is the first order pressure n j is the generalized surface corresponding to the j th freedom ρ is the seawater density g is the momentum of the floating structure h is the angular momentum n is the unit normal vector of a surface element s is the surface of the floating structure 4 motion equation in frequency domain and time domain the motion equation of floating structure in frequency domain takes the following form 37 m m ω x ω c ω x ω k ω x ω f ω where m is the structure mass matrix m ω is the hydrodynamic added mass matrix c ω is the system linear damping matrix k ω is the total system stiffness matrix f ω is the external wave forces on the system per unit wave amplitude x ω is response motions or raos ω is the wave frequency eq 37 can be converted to its counterpart in time domain by transformation such as the convolution integral the external forces can be put to the right side the motion equation in time domain can be written as 38 m m x t c x t k x t 0 t r t τ x τ d τ f t where m is the hydrodynamic added mass at infinite wave frequency r t τ is the velocity impulse function matrix f t is the external forces such as wind force wave force and mooring line force etc under the excitation of external forces floating structure is assumed to be undergoing rigid body motions which can be classified into 6 dofs with the center of gravity as the reference point including three translational motions i e surge sway and heave and three rotational motions i e pitch roll and yaw the 6 dofs rigid body motion of a typical spar type floating wind turbine is presented in fig 5 5 research methods and its reliability verification studies on the dynamic response of floating wind turbines subjected to wind and wave excitations have been conducted experimentally by employing small scale prototypes for example the 47 1 scale model test of a spar type floating wind turbine of hydro oil energy skaare et al 2007 the 1 67 scale model test roddier et al 2010 of a semi submersible platform floating wind turbine of principal power inc and the 1 128 scale model test shin et al 2014 of a spar type floating wind turbine moored by spring tensioned leg there is no doubt that performing the investigations experimentally would be accurate and convincing but it s too dependent on the precision of the equipment and changes in the research objects would result in high costs because it needs to be rebuilt another approach now for the floating wind turbine study is to do the numerical simulation based on the traditional hydrodynamic simulation software wamit orcaflex or based on the professional wind turbine simulation package fast the traditional marine solver has a reliable hydrodynamic computation model but its aerodynamic calculation model is simple and not suitable for floating wind turbine the wind turbine simulation package is rather mature in the calculation of aerodynamic load but its hydrodynamic calculation model is quite poor and suitable for certain objects therefore most of studies conducted at present are normally with the simplified wind turbine geometry and analytically derived wind or wave loads in views of numerical simulation direct solving of 3 d navier stokes equations is rarely used since it s too time consuming therefore in order to explore the dynamic response of floating wind turbine under the external excitations with both mature aerodynamic and hydrodynamic calculation models the bem theory is adopted to establish the aerodynamic calculation model firstly and then the dynamic link library is compiled to realize the secondary development of ansys aqwa based on the fortran language based on this effects of heave plate on dynamic response of floating wind turbine spar platform are studied the detailed procedures are given in section 5 1 5 1 aerodynamic loads calculation model and its verification aerodynamic loads acting on the floating wind turbine include two parts one is the rotor thrust force resulting from the rotor rotation and the other is the wind drag force in views of the rotor thrust force first taking the speed of center of gravity as the reference the hub speed is then obtained based on the transformation matrix second the hub speed is set as the fluctuation wind speed and then superimposed with the inflow wind speed then the rotor thrust force is calculated at each time step based on the bem theory the nrel 5 mw wind turbine blade was designed based on five du airfoils and one naca airfoil including 17 sections coefficients of lift force and drag force was obtained by using xfoil at small attack angles and then extrapolated to 180 180 the aerodynamic coefficient of the five du airfoils and one naca airfoil is presented in fig 6 and would be invoked during the calculation process the nrel 5 mw wind turbine adopts a conventional variable blade pitch control strategy consequence of which is that rotor thrust force would be reduced with the increasing wind speed above rated therefore the designed pitch angle jonkman et al 2009 provided by jonkman was used in this paper to realize the pitch control the designed pitch angles at different wind speeds can be seen in fig 7 in order to verify the accuracy and reliability of calculation model of aerodynamic load in this paper the calculated rotor thrust force based on the fast was also given to do the comparison work which can be seen in fig 8 according to fig 8 the rotor thrust force calculated is highly consistent with that of nrel fast therefore it verifies the accuracy of the wind load calculation model and provides the guarantee for the following research in view of the drag force acting on the tower and the upper part of the platform according to ref ye et al 2017 for nrel 5 mw wind turbine the drag force is about 30 kn when at rated wind speed so the drag force solution model in aqwa which is given as eq 39 is employed to calculate the drag force coefficient 39 f w d r a g 1 2 ρ a i r c d r a g a v 2 where c d r a g is the wind drag force coefficient a is the area of the structure in the inflow wind direction 5 2 wave loads calculation mesh generation and its verification at present the wave load calculation mainly includes two different methods the first method is the morison equation and its correction which is mainly used to calculate wave force acting on small scale structures when viscous effect cannot be neglected the other method is the diffraction radiation theory which is mainly used to calculate the wave force acting on large scale structures when diffraction effect account for a large proportion the basis for judging whether the structure is a large scale structure or a small scale structure is whether the characteristic length of the structure is greater than 0 2 times of the wave length the main part of the research objects in this paper is modeled based on the surface element while the rod used to connect the heave plates with the platform is modeled based on the morison element for aqwa mesh generation is mainly based on the following principles the area ratio of adjacent grid cells should not exceed 3 besides characteristic dimensions of every grid cell should be less than 1 7th of the incident wave length ding et al 2018 furthermore for 32 bit version of aqwa solver number of the panels is limited to 18000 of which 12000 may be diffracting while the 64 bite version of aqwa solver is limited to 40000 of which 32000 may be diffracting the smaller the maximum panel size the more accurate the results would be yet more calculation resources would be needed according to the mentioned principles above mesh generation work was conducted with the maximum size of 1 2 m while the diffraction panel under the waterline is 1 m and the morison element is 0 5 m results of the mesh generation are shown in fig 9 total number of panels is about 16000 of which number of diffraction panels is about 8000 and morison elements are 120 normally verification of whether the meshing generation could satisfy the need of hydrodynamic calculation is based on the haskind relationship journée and massie 2000 but this method does not exist in aqwa therefore in this paper the closeness of the results of second order mean drift force calculated based on the far field method and near field method was used to verify the reliability of mesh generation the results of the second order mean drift force of the four groups of research objects are shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 it can be observed that when wave frequency is smaller than 1 0 rad s the second order mean drift force keeps zero while it shows trend of increase with the increase of the wave frequency when wave frequency exceeds 1 0 rad s more importantly the second order mean drift force calculated based on the near field method is highly consistent with that calculated based on the far field method accordingly mesh generation can be considered to meet the requirements of hydrodynamic calculation accuracy the reason why the closeness of the solutions to the second order mean drift force could be employed to judge the reasonability of mesh generation is that the near field method solves the second order wave force by integrating pressure on the average wet surface of the floating structure which depends on mesh generation different from near field method far field method is to obtain the second order mean drift force by solving the momentum and angle momentum equation which has nothing to do with the mesh generation therefore when the two solutions are closer to each other it can be considered that the mesh generation could satisfy the calculation accuracy requirements 6 results and discussions 6 1 the calculation of viscous damping due to the fact that potential theory is based on the inviscid assumption and the effects of viscous damping cannot be considered which may overestimate the calculation results and affect the accuracy of calculation therefore the viscous damping matrix is added to the hydrodynamic calculation in this paper the surge roll and yaw motion are influenced by the characteristics of mooring system significantly which make it difficult to calculate the viscous damping while the heave and pitch motion are related to the restoring force in water and can be obtained according to the added mass and static stiffness of the system equivalent viscous damping is calculated in proportion to critical damping which calculated by 40 β 0 2 m m a c i where m is the mass or moment of inertia of floating foundation the m a is the added mass of floating foundation and the c i is the static water recovery stiffness based on the existing research experience of considering the effect of viscous damping zhao et al 2012 the heave viscous damping was considered by adding 10 β 0 of the heave motion rho et al 2002 pointed out that the heave plate has little effect on the pitching motion of the floating platforms therefore the pitch viscous damping was considered by adding 0 5 β 0 of the pitch motion the calculation results are shown in table 3 6 2 response in frequency and its verification before conducting the investigation on global performance of floating wind turbine spar platform with heave plate the hydrodynamics of the original spar platform was performed and in order to verify accuracy and reliability of the simulation results comparison work was compared with the results of experimental study which was conducted by the korea ocean research and development institute kordi 2012 the experimental study was taken from the shi kordi cooperative research project of which the full scale water depth is about 144 m and the scale ratio is 45 1 besides waves used in the experiment are regular waves under head sea conditions and the wave frequency range is from 0 1 to 1 5 rad s therefore only the surge heave and pitch responses were analyzed in this paper because of the head sea condition surge heave and pitch rao in frequency domain can be seen in fig 11 in fig 11 surge rao shows the trend of decrease with the increase of wave frequency while the heave and pitch rao show the trend of first increase and then decrease peak wave frequency of heave rao is about 0 2 rad s while it s about 0 22 rad s for pitch rao although there exist slight differences for surge and pitch rao compared with the experimental studies it could still be thought that the simulation results show quite good agreements with the kordi experimental results because of the effect of viscous damping as well as test errors therefore the accuracy and reliability of the hydrodynamic calculation model could be verified to a quite large extent after installing heave plate characteristics of rao in frequency domain of floating wind turbine spar platforms are shown in fig 12 since there are lots of superposition for heave rao scatter plot method is used to better display the differences according to fig 12 it can be seen that surge rao in frequency domain shows the trend of decrease when the wave frequency increases after applying the heave plates but at the low wave frequency range about 0 15 0 3 rad s there exists a trend of first decrease and then decrease besides the local peak frequency is the largest when heave plate is installed at the bottom part of the platform while it s the smallest when the heave plate is located at the upper part of the platform but in general surge rao in frequency domain still shows the trend of decrease with the increase of wave frequency and it s not sensitive to the attachment of heave plate therefore it can be concluded that surge response of spar is not sensitive to both the first order wave excitation and the heave plate regarding the heave rao in frequency domain it keeps the trend of increasing first and then decreasing which means that the heave plates doesn t change the tendency of heave rao when the wave frequency changes compared with fig 11 peak frequency of original spar is about 0 2 rad s peak value of rao is about 7 m after installing heave plate peak frequency of heave rao decreases to around 0 191 rad s peak value of spar with heave plate installation at the bottom is about 5 2 m peak value is about 5 75 m while peak value of the spar platform with heave plate at the upper is about 6 25 m in summary the heave plate changes the peak frequency of spar and it would achieve the best inhibition effect when installed at the bottom regarding to pitch rao in frequency domain compared with fig 11 it can be observed that heave plate doesn t change the tendency of pitch rao which is quite similar with the heave rao case both having the trend of first increase and then decrease besides peak frequency of pitch rao of original spar is approximately 0 22 rad s while the peak value is about 2 6 after installing the heave plate the peak frequency of pitch rao of platform with heave plate attachment at the bottom is about 0 25 rad s peak frequency of pitch rao of spar with heave plate at the middle is about 0 20 rad s peak frequency of pitch rao of spar with heave plate at the upper is about 0 165 rad s as per the peak value the bottom attached is 4 5 the middle attached and top attached is about 4 8 but the top attached is a bit larger than the middle attached the results show that heave plate changes the peak frequency and increases the peak value of pitch rao besides compared rao of original spar with those of platform with heave plate installation it can be seen that the closer the heave plate attached to the bottom the higher of the peak frequency of the pitch rao the lower the peak value of the rao the closer the heave plates are attached to the top of the platform the less obvious the increase of the peak frequency of the pitch rao of the platform the closer it draws to the original spar and at the same time the more obvious the increase of the peak value is in summary effect of heave plates on surge rao is small while the inhibition effect on heave rao is large however it increases the pitch rao in some extent the increase of the stability of the spar platform with the bottom attached heave plate is most obvious effect of heave plate on first order wave exciting force in frequency domain is shown in fig 13 according to fig 13 trend of four curves in surge heave and pitch are almost the same amplitudes at different frequencies of first order wave exciting force are almost same for original spar and platforms with heave plate installed at the middle and bottom part however the platform experiences a smaller first wave exciting force when the heave plate is installed at the upper part it is because the first order excitation force is mainly acting on the floating structures at the free surface the bottom and middle installation cases are all far away from the free surface so their influence on first order wave excitation force can be neglected the reason why heave plate could reduce the first wave exciting force when it s installed at the upper is that the first wave exciting force is the result of the pressure integration on the average wet surface of spar therefore when installing heave plate by cutting main body of spar whole area close to the average wet surface would reduce that s why the wave excitation force on spar with heave plate installed at the upper becomes smaller effect of heave plate on added mass in frequency domain is shown in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 that surge added mass decreases after installing heave plate however it s not that much sensitive to its installation position it means though the installation position has little effect on the added mass it still can be observed that the added mass is relatively larger when heave plate is installed at the bottom part in view of heave added mass it s much larger for platforms with heave plate than that of original spar regarding to the effect of installation position the added mass is the largest when heave plate is installed at the middle while it s the smallest when the heave plate is installed at the bottom but overall the position has little effect on added mass since the curves are so close to each other in view of pitch added mass the original spar has the largest added mass when the have plate is installed at the upper the added mass is the smallest and much smaller than the other three platforms when the heave plate is installed at the middle and bottom the added mass are almost the same as that of original spar therefore the reason why the pitch rao of spar with heave plate at the upper is much larger may be that the heave plate reduces the pitch added mass effect of the heave plate on radiation damping in frequency domain is shown in fig 15 according to fig 15 heave plate could hardly affect the surge and heave radiation damping in frequency domain the radiation damping is just a bit smaller than that of platforms with heave plate at the upper in view of pitch radiation damping when heave plate is at the middle position its value is consistent with the original spar when heave plate is at the bottom position it s a bit larger than that of the original spar however when heave plate is at the upper position it s much smaller than that of the other platforms 6 3 verification of importance of the coupling effect of wind and wave main purpose of this section is to verify the importance of wind load as well as the coupling effect of wind and wave in order to conduct the verification work the hydrodynamic performance of the original spar under three different working conditions was conducted the three kinds of working conditions include wave only non coupling effect of wind wave and coupling effect of wind wave non coupling effect of wind wave refers to change of the relative wind speed caused by the wave induced platform motion is not taken into consideration the essential wind is generated by the nrel turbsim based on the kaimal wind spectrum the average wind speed is 11 4 m s which is the rated wind speed for nrel 5 mw wind turbine the obtained time series of wind speed is shown in fig 16 the wave is generated based on the p m wave spectrum for a given wave spectrum the time series of irregular wave can be generated by linear superposition of harmonic wave components fig 17 shows a typical energy distribution when the significant wave height and the crossing zero period are 3 0 m and 7 0s respectively normally it s needed to perform at least 2 h simulation in offshore engineering but this section is mainly to capture the response differences for original spar under different working conditions so a 180 s simulation is conducted here which is enough to display the differences between the calculation results actual surge heave and pitch response is presented in fig 18 actual surge acceleration of the nacelle is given in fig 19 it can be seen from fig 18 that actual response of the original spar would be quite small if the wind load is ignored when compared with the wind being taken into consideration case according to previous calculation results the rotor thrust force is about 780 kn when at rated speed which is quite closer to the first order exciting force whole external load only increases by no more than 50 when wind load is taken into consideration but the actual response increases by several times therefore it can be concluded that wind load cannot be neglected in the explorations on floating offshore wind turbine system and it can also be concluded that the hydrodynamic characteristics of the floating wind turbine spar platform are quite different from that of the traditional oil gas spar platform according to the comparison of actual response of original spar platform under the non coupling effect of wind wave and coupling effect of wind wave it can be observed that although the coupling effect has little impact on magnitude of the response however the response characteristics are completely different especially for surge motion which can also be concluded from the calculation results of the nacelle surge acceleration in fig 19 hence it can be concluded that ignoring wind load simplifying wind load or ignoring the coupling effect of wind and wave is extremely inaccurate to study the floating wind turbine 6 4 nonlinear response in time domain the free decay tests of original spar spar with bottom middle and upper position heave plate were performed at given initial positions without considering external loads the natural frequencies of four spar platforms were calculated by fast fourier transform fft analysis of time series data the results are shown in fig 20 as can be seen from fig 20 the natural frequencies of surge heave and pitch of original spar are 0 050 rad s 0 200 rad s and 0 223 rad s the natural frequencies of surge heave and pitch of spar with bottom heave plate are 0 044 rad s 0 195 rad s and 0 253 rad s the natural frequencies of surge heave and pitch of spar with middle heave plate are 0 044 rad s 0 195 rad s and 0 201 rad s and the natural frequencies of surge heave and pitch of spar with upper heave plate are 0 044 rad s 0 195 rad s and 0 170 rad s by comparison with original spar we can conclude that the installation of heave plate will reduce the natural frequencies of surge and heave while it is not affected by installation positions however the pitch natural frequencies were significantly influenced by installation position of heave plate and the closer the heave plate is the bottom part of spar platform the larger the pitch natural frequencies main purpose of this part is to analyze the effect of the heave plate and its installation position on the nonlinear dynamic response characteristics of spar under the coupling effect of wind and wave the extreme sea condition in the south china sea once in a century was adopted the wind is generated by the nrel turbsim based on the kaimal wind spectrum the average wind speed is 21 m s namely the rated wind speed the wave is generated based on the p m wave spectrum the significant wave height is 13 m while the crossing zero period is 18s the obtained time series of the wave height and energy density are shown in fig 21 in order to verify that the above calculation results are convincing different random wave seed including 1 100 1000 2000 5000 and 10000 are adopted to generate the irregular wave the whole simulation time is 8000s while the time step is 0 1 s 6 4 1 analysis result of motion performance under the coupling effect of wind and wave actual motions of original spar and platforms with heave plates are shown in fig 22 since there are too many data points in order to better display the motion characteristics of the platforms certain time intervals here are cut out besides the fluctuation ranges and the standard deviations are also provided for a quantitative description according to fig 22a compared with the original spar the heave plate increases the actual surge motion which is also sensitive to the installation position from the fluctuation range value it can be seen the fluctuation range of surge motion for bottom position heave plate is 20 24 m while it s around 19 23 m when the heave plate is installed at the middle part of the platform and the fluctuation range of surge motion is about 18 98 m when the heave plate is installed at the upper part of the platform furthermore it can be seen from the picture that the closer the installation position is to the upper part of the platform the smaller the standard deviation but in all compared with the whole surge value the surge motion differences between the original spar and the platforms with heave plate can be neglected therefore it can be concluded that the installation position of heave plates has small impact on platform surge motion in view of the actual heave motion it can be seen from fig 22b that heave plate decreased actual heave motion however their inhibition effects are quite different from each other the fluctuation range of heave motion is around 10 07 m when it s installed at the upper part of the platform while it s about 9 5 m when it s located at the bottom and the middle part of the platform although the fluctuation ranges are almost the same when the heave plates are installed at the bottom and the middle part of the platform the standard deviation is bigger when it s installed at the middle part of the platform but all of the three cases are lower than the original spar therefore it can be concluded that it s better to install the heave plates at the bottom part of the platform as can be seen from fig 22c heave plates have a greater influence on the pitch response of the platform when the plates are installed at the bottom part of the platform the heave plate obviously aggravates the pitch motion when it s installed at the middle part of the platform the heave plate slightly decreases the pitch motion however the pitch fluctuation could be significantly decreased when it s installed at the upper part of the platform according to the stand deviation values for the pitch response the trend of the four cases is almost the same with pitch fluctuation the maximum standard deviation can be observed when it s installed at the bottom part of the platform followed by middle upper part of the platform when the wind speed reaches to 25 m s the wind turbine operates under the standstill condition according to zambrano et al 2006 the average pitch of the floating wind turbine platform should be less than 5 and the dynamic pitch fluctuation range should be less than 15 in this case the turbine can generate electricity normally as we can be seen from fig 23 a the maximum fluctuation of the pitch response curve occurs when heave plate mounted on the bottom part of the platform which ranging from 12 67 to 8 96 and the mean values of all cases are less than 5 while under extreme sea condition the maximum surge fluctuation is from 20 18 m to 0 06 m zambrano et al 2006 also pointed out that the surge response was not considered a critical factor only if the loads of the mooring line system stayed within half of the breaking strength the analysis of mooring line tension under extreme sea conditions will be discussed in next subsection in order to display the frequency dynamic characteristics of the platforms motion data under extreme sea condition in time domain are transformed to frequency domain by adopting fft method under the coupling effect of wind and wave the frequency response characteristics of the original spar and platforms with heave plate are shown in fig 24 according to fig 24 regarding to surge motion it can be seen that there exists obvious two peak response intervals the first peak frequencies of spectrum are all around 0 05 rad s which is the platform natural frequency while peak value is 0 36 0 57 0 42 and 0 41 respectively corresponding to the original spar and platforms with heave plate at bottom middle and upper part the heave plate increases the peak value when the frequency is 0 06 rad s while it has little effects on other frequency interval in view of the heave response it can be seen from the pictures that for all platforms there exists one peak response values and two frequency interval which has peak responses frequency of the first peak value is around 0 2 rad s which corresponding to the platform natural frequency frequency of the first interval is from 0 to 0 18 rad s which corresponding to the surge heave coupling motion frequency while the second frequency interval is from 0 2 to 0 6 rad s which corresponding to the wave frequency internal resulting in the wave frequency motion in addition it can also be found that the peak values of the wave frequency motion and the coupling surge heave motion of all platforms keep unchanged which indicates that wave frequency motion and coupling surge heave motion aren t affected by the heave plate and its installation position however peak values in platform natural frequencies are quite different from each other peak value in the natural frequency of the original spar is about 1 12 while it s 1 20 1 21 and 1 27 respectively for the platforms with heave plate at the bottom middle and upper part therefore it s better to install the heave plate at the bottom part of the platform this is consistent with the time domain analysis in view of the pitch response it can be observed that pitch motion curves in frequency domain share almost the same trend namely first increase then decrease with the increase of the frequency similar to the heave response there also exist one peak response values and two frequency interval which has peak responses the first frequency interval corresponds to the coupling surge pitch low frequency response the second frequency interval corresponds to the platform natural frequency response the third frequency interval corresponds to the wave frequency response besides it can be observed the peak values of in the wave frequency interval keep unchanged which indicates that heave plate has no effect on pitch wave frequency response peak frequency value of the four platforms is 0 21 rad s 0 245 rad s 0 208 rad s and 0 17 rad s respectively the corresponding peak response value of the above mentioned four frequencies is 0 98 1 02 0 98 and 0 55 which means that heave plate decreases the peak response values significantly when it s installed at the upper part of the platform this may be the reason why the pitch response is smaller than other cases when the heave plate is installed at the bottom and middle part of the platform in addition although the peak response value remains unchanged when it is installed at the middle part of the platform when compared with the original spar its peak response values in the low frequency region are smaller than those of the original spar which may be the reason why the time domain pitch response of platform with middle heave plate is slightly smaller than that of the original spar 6 4 2 analysis result of mooring system mooring system is one of the key technologies to ensure the safety reliability of the floating wind turbine therefore in this subsection the performance of mooring system of floating wind turbine spar platform with heave plate proposed in this paper was investigated fig 25 shows the top view of the mooring line system under the coupling effect of wind and wave mooring tensions in time domain are shown in fig 26 since line no 2 and no 3 are arranged symmetrically relative to the direction of wind and wave therefore only time series of line no 1 and no 2 were presented according to fig 26 mooring line tension of platforms with heave plate are significantly reduced when compared with those of the original spar especially for line no 2 of which the reduction extent is almost 57 however changes of installation position have little effect on the mooring tension the reason why mooring tension of line no 2 is reduced is that surge displacement of the platform increases resulting in an increase in mooring length of the lying part so that the tension is significantly reduced although the mooring tension of line no 1 of spar platform with heave plate are smaller than original spar but the reduction is not obvious the reason why the tension of line no 1 is reduced is that the draught of platform increases after the installation of heave plate resulting in an increase of line laid length which however would be decreased because of the increase of surge displacement therefore it can be concluded that the decreased laid length is smaller than the increased laid length the statistical results of mooring tension are summarized in table 4 according to api rp 2sk criteria the limit of mooring tension is usually expressed by the percentage of minimum breaking strength mbs the mbs is usually measured by the mooring line experiment and provided by the manufacturers table 5 lists the criteria and safety factor of mooring line tension limit provided in api rp 2sk therefore the equivalent factor of safety is 1 67 with the dynamic analysis method in the case that the mooring system is intact as can be seen from table 4 the minimum safety factor is 3 36 which meets the requirements of operating state therefore the mooring system of floating wind turbine spar platform proposed in this paper is safe and reliable 7 conclusions based on the research experience of traditional oil gas platforms this paper proposed the structural design method of equipping the heave plate on the main body of the platform using the bladed element momentum bem the fortran language was adopted to realize the secondary development of hydrodynamic software aqwa considering the coupling effect of wind and wave effect of heave plate and its installation position on the dynamic response of the floating wind turbine spar platform was studied the following conclusions are drawn 1 the effects of heave plate on the frequency domain rao of the floating wind turbine spar platform is mainly concentrated on the low frequency band the heave plate reduced the heave rao in frequency domain but did not change the peak frequency value and its inhibition effect is most obvious when it s located at the bottom part of the platform while the pitch rao could be significantly increased in frequency domain and the peak frequency value changed simultaneously 2 the heave plate has little effect on surge added mass the heave plate increases the heave added mass significantly while it decreases the pitch added mass when the heave plate is located at the middle and bottom part of the platform it has less effect on the first order wave force and when it is located on the upper part of the platform it reduces the first order wave force acting on the platform the heave plate and its installation position have little effect on the radiation damping 3 the wind load and the coupling effect of wind and wave cannot be neglected and the induction effect of platform motion on relative wind speed must be considered 4 in the time domain analysis surge movement of the platform increases significantly when considering the coupling effects of wind and wave and the effects of mooring line system what s more heave motion is sensitive to the installation position of heave plate in view of pitch movement heave plate inhibits its response to some extent but exacerbates its response when it s installed at the bottom part of the platform 5 the heave plate could significantly reduce the mooring tension under extreme sea condition but the change of heave plate installation position has little effect on it the safety factor of all mooring lines are larger than 1 67 therefore the floating foundation and its mooring system have enough ability to resist extreme sea conditions acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the national natural science

22010,stability of the platform is the most fundamental guarantee for floating offshore wind turbines in order to explore hydrodynamics of floating wind turbine spar platform under the coupling effect of wind and wave whole model of floating wind turbine is established based on the oc3 hywind spar buoy platform and the nrel 5 mw wind turbine taking the research experiences of traditional marine engineering this work proposed the structural design method of installing heave plate on main body of spar based on the bladed element momentum theory this paper adopts fortran language to accomplish the secondary development of hydrodynamic software aqwa to establish the coupled aerodynamic hydrodynamic mooring line system model the amplitude frequency curves of the added mass radiation damping wave exciting force and response amplitude operators rao were obtained based on radiation diffraction theory to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of floating wind turbine spar platform in frequency domain in the time domain analysis the three kinds of working conditions include wave only non coupling effect of wind wave and coupling effect of wind wave were conducted comparatively to verify the importance of wind load and wind wave interaction in addition the actual motions of original spar and spar with heave plates were analyzed to explore the effects of the heave plate and its installation position on the nonlinear dynamic response characteristics of spar under the coupling effect of wind and wave the research results indicated that the installation position of the heave plate has little influence on the surge response in view of the actual heave motion the heave plate can play a positive effect no matter where the heave plate is installed when the heave plate is located on the upper part of the platform the pitch response and the intensity of the fluctuation of the platform will be greatly reduced finally time domain mooring analysis for spar platform with and without heave plate is performed to illustrate the feasibility of the present approach for mooring modeling keywords floating wind turbine spar heave plate radiation diffraction theory bladed element momentum 1 introduction from land to sea from shallow to deep and from fixed foundation to floating platform has become an inevitable development trend of future wind farms jeon et al 2013 wang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the offshore wind energy has a very promising future when considering the abundant wind resources as well as the continuous progress of wind turbine technology zhang et al 2018 for example total capacity of the offshore wind energy is expected to reach 40 gw by 2020 and 150 gw by 2030 which could meet 4 and 14 of the whole eu electricity consumption campanile et al 2018 nowadays offshore wind turbines mainly concentrate in shadow water areas but for deep water areas with more abundant and higher quality wind energy floating platform should be used for cost consideration ding et al 2017 li et al 2019 offshore wind turbines have to withstand the effects of waves which is the biggest difference from onshore wind turbines the nonlinear wave excitation would not only affect the normal operation of the drive system in nacelle but also decrease the power generation efficiency and may even lead to the buckling and capsizing of the tower compared with onshore wind turbines floating offshore wind turbines are always in the state of unbalanced force bearing and unsteady motion due to its unstable foundation chen and basu 2018 obviously stability of the floating platform is the basic guarantee for the safe operation of floating offshore wind turbines therefore it s extremely important to explore the dynamic response of floating wind turbine platform under the external excitations at present floating platforms can be mainly divided into four categories according to its methods of achieving stability namely tlp tension leg platform spar semi submersible and barge jonkman and matha 2009 of which the stability comes from pre tension of the tension leg restoring force of the mooring line and water plane area moment compare to the other three platforms spar has the advantages of lower center of gravity high flexibility and lower cost but it still has some shortcomings in practical engineering application namely the large amplitude heave response which would aggravate the fatigue of the mooring line and the riser system or even the eventual failure of whole system at present there mainly exist two approaches to inhibit the large amplitude heave response of spar enlarge the draught of the platform on the one hand there s no doubt that this method can improve the stability of spar but it would dramatically increase the mass of platform and therefore raise the cost of transportation and installation enlarge the heave added mass and damping on the other hand namely installing heave plate the heave plate could efficiently increase the added mass and damping zhu and lim 2017 and therefore achieve the purpose of stability improvement of spar scholars from both academia and industry have already conducted lots of researches on heave plate however i most of them focus on the structural parameters including number shape and spacing etc to its own hydrodynamic characteristics an and faltinsen 2013 thiagarajan and troesch 1998 prislin et al 1998 ii part of them involve effects of heave plate on hydrodynamics on floating structures but the methods adopted are mainly experimental studies such as free decay oscillation method or forced oscillation method which could hardly describe the nonlinear characteristics of spar movements in complex marine environment zhang and ishihara 2018 tao and dray 2008 iii some of them do consider effect of the heave plate on spar platform but their researches mainly focus on the traditional oil gas spar platform of which the load characteristic is quite different from that of floating offshore wind turbine spar platform li et al 2013 lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 ma et al 2019 iv although few researchers consider wind excitation it s just a simplified constant thrust force skaare et al 2007 ding et al 2018 which on one hand is an ideal working condition on the other hand the superposition of wind speed and rotor fore aft motion induced by platform motion will lead to the change of relative wind speed therefore it s inaccurate to simplify the rotor thrust force the modern wind turbine is the largest rotating machinery that human beings have ever created it s quite different from traditional developed offshore oil gas platform because of its great aerodynamic force generated from continuous rotation of the rotor its induction effect on the hydrodynamic loading let alone the loading change during starting process and the overall dynamic instability due to the change of pitch control and brake system at present professional wind turbine simulation software such as bladed and fast already have mature aerodynamic load solving model but its hydrodynamic load calculation model is relatively poor traditional marine engineering hydrodynamic software such as wamit and orcaflex have mature hydrodynamic load computing model but its aerodynamic load solving model is simplified and therefore not suitable for floating offshore wind turbine therefore in order to explore effects of heave plate on dynamic response of floating wind turbine spar platform taking the experiences of traditional marine engineering this paper proposes the structural design method of installing heave plate on the main body of the platform secondly based on the bladed element momentum bem this paper adopts the fortran language to realize the secondary development of hydrodynamic software aqwa finally considering the coupling effect of wind and wave the influence of heave plate and its installation position on floating offshore wind turbine spar platform is explored for the hope of providing a theoretical reference for the design optimization and safety operation of floating wind turbine 2 research object floating offshore wind turbine system contains three parts the wind turbine system which is used to capture the wind energy the floating platform which is for maintaining the whole system on the sea surface the mooring line system which is designed to prevent the whole system from drifting and also provide part of the restoring force research object in this paper is the wind turbine based on a typical spar type platform more specifically the wind turbine is nrel 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 miao et al 2019 while the platform is the oc3 hywind spar buoy major geometry dimensions and structural parameters of the wind turbine and spar are listed in table 1 and table 2 based on parameters of nrel 5 mw wind turbine and oc3 hywind spar three dimensional cad tool nx 9 0 is employed to establish the whole floating offshore wind turbine system which is presented in fig 1 in order to explore the effect of a heave plate and its installation position on hydrodynamics of floating offshore wind turbine spar platform remodeling the whole system by installing the heave plate on main body of spar including three installation position upper part middle part and bottom part which can be seen in fig 2 since researches objects on floating wind turbine are generally the conceptual model proposed by the nrel the upper wind turbine system including tower blade and hub etc has detailed geometry and structural parameters but the detailed information of the platform for example the wall thickness and the mass distribution cannot be found which means that it s impossible to obtain the actual parameters compared with the original spar if doing the improved structural design therefore all the structural parameters of platforms with heave plate are the same with the original floating wind turbine system for the need of quantitative analysis 3 environment load 3 1 wind load there are three kinds of aerodynamic load solution methods at present including vortex wake method based on the potential flow theory bladed element momentum theory bem and computational fluid dynamic cfd method compared with the other two methods bem has the advantage of both simplicity and efficiency but the force calculation of blade element needs reasonable empirical coefficients and a correction for tip and hub losses etc moreover bem cannot deal with the situation of wind turbine entering turbulence and cannot consider the influence of hub and tip vortex structure on induced velocity however in view of its limitations abundant correction methods have been developed in 1957 leishman and beddoes proposed an empirical model to simulate the unsteady aerodynamic performance of airfoils considering the effects of dynamic wake and leading edge separation mahendra et al 2003 in 1991 ϕye 1991 proposed a dynamic wake model for simulating unsteady aerodynamic loads in 1995 snel and schepers 1995 validated the validity of the dynamic wake model in 1999 du 1999 2000 proposed an empirical model for correcting the three dimensional rotation effect therefore the bem theory is still the main calculation method of wind turbine blade aerodynamic load at present this paper mainly studies the dynamic response of floating wind turbine platform under wind and wave coupling the essential requirement is to solve aerodynamic force quickly and efficiently therefore the bem theory is selected to establish the aerodynamic model of the floating wind turbine a section of cross section of the blade that is perpendicular to the pitch axis and has the length d r is taken as the research object the velocity triangle related to the airfoil and force acting on the airfoil can be seen in fig 3 as can be seen from this figure v is the absolute wind velocity w is the relative wind velocity ω is the rotor rotational speed φ is the wind inflow angle β i is the airfoil twist angle α i is the airfoil attack angle a is the axial induction factor b is the tangential induction factor d l and d d are the lift force and drag force components of d r according to fig 3 by applying the bem theory the lift force d l and drag force d d acting on the blade element d r can be written as 1 d l 1 2 c l ρ c w 2 d r 2 d d 1 2 c d ρ c w 2 d r where c l and c d are the lift force coefficient and drag force coefficient respectively c is the airfoil chord length ρ is the air density 1 29 kg m3 the lift force and drag force acting on the blade element can be decomposed according to the in plane direction which is tangential to the rotor rotation plane and out of plane direction which is vertical to the rotor rotation plane namely the axial force df x and the tangential force df y 3 df x 1 2 c x ρ c w 2 d r 4 df y 1 2 c y ρ c w 2 d r 5 c x c l cos φ c d sin φ 6 c y c l sin φ c d cos φ where c x and c y are the axial force coefficient and tangential force coefficient therefore the whole force d t and the torque d m acting on the blade element d r which has a distance of r away from the blade root of all the blades can be written as 7 d t n b 1 2 c l cos φ c d sin φ ρ c w 2 d r 8 d m n b 1 2 c l sin φ c d cos φ ρ c w 2 d r r where n b is the number the blades by integration the force and torque acting on the rotor can be written as 9 t r hub r n b 1 2 c l cos φ c d sin φ ρ c w 2 d r 10 m r hub r n b 1 2 c l sin φ c d cos φ ρ c w 2 r d r where r is the rotor radius r hub is the hub radius according to the vector relations in fig 3 it can be seen the relative wind speed w used in eq 6 10 is relevant to many factors including the absolute wind speed v rotor rotational speed ω lift force coefficient c l drag force coefficient c d axial induction factor a tangential induction factor b pitch angle θ and local blade element twist angle β i in calculation induction factors are solved by iteration algorithm which is given as the following procedure step 1 assume the initial values of axial induction factor and tangential induction factor step 2 calculate the wind inflow angle and the attack angle by eq 11 12 11 φ arctan 1 a v 1 b ω r 12 α φ β θ step 3 calculate the blade tip loss and hub loss according to eq 13 14 13 f tip 2 π arccos exp n b r r 2 r sin φ 14 f hub 2 π arccos exp n b r r hub 2 r hub sin φ step 4 recalculate the axial induction factor and tangential induction factor by invoking the lift force coefficient and drag force coefficient 15 a σ c x 4 f sin 2 φ n b c 2 π r c x 16 b σ c y 4 f sin φ cos φ n b c 2 π r c y 17 f f tip f hub 18 σ n b c 2 π r where σ is the solidity of the blade element when the axial induction factor is greater than 0 4 the original bem theory would be invalid therefore a correction theory to the axial induction factor developed by buhl is applied in this paper buhl 2005 it s written as 19 a 0 5 18 σ c x 36 f 2 sin 2 φ 40 f sin 2 φ 6 18 f sin 2 φ σ c x 36 f 4 sin 4 φ 48 f sin 4 φ 0 5 9 σ c x 50 f sin 2 φ 36 f 2 sin 2 φ based on the above bem theory the induction factors aerodynamic parameters and attack angle for each blade elements can be obtained by the iteration algorithm in calculation both the axial induction factor and tangential induction factor are set to 0 while the error is set to 0 00004 dai et al 2011 in eq 19 the small value of the axial induction factor is adopted that is the minus sign is adopted besides during the actual operation of the wind turbine dynamic stall will be caused by the rotation of blades compared with the static state not only will the stall delay occur on the rotating blades but the flow separation will even be completely eliminated in the boundary layer near the blades root therefore the lift force coefficient on the blade section is much higher than that of the static airfoil the reason is that the existence of coriolis force generates an additional pressure gradient which enables the fluid in the boundary layer to obtain an additional acceleration of flowing towards the trailing edge of the blades in order to more accurately predict the aerodynamic performance of wind turbines in actual operation the du selig stall delay model is employed here to modify the lift force coefficient c l 3 d and the drag force coefficient c d 3 d 20 c l 3 d c l 2 d δ c l 21 c d 3 d c d 2 d δ c d where c l 2 d is the two dimensional lift force coefficient c d 2 d is the two dimensional drag force coefficient δ c l is the increase in the three dimensional lift force coefficient δ c d is the decrease in the three dimensional drag force coefficient 22 δ c l f l c l p c l 2 d 23 δ c d f d c d 2 d c d 0 where c l p 2 π α α 0 α 0 is the angle of attract when the lift force is 0 α is the actual angle of attack c d 0 is the value of c d 2 d when the α is 0 through the correlation between the function and the measured data the following empirical correction relation can be obtained 24 f l 1 2 π 1 6 c r 0 1267 m c r z λ r r 1 c r z λ r r 1 25 f d 1 2 π 1 6 c r 0 1267 m c r z 2 λ r r 1 c r z 2 λ r r 1 where λ λ 1 λ 2 λ is the tip speed ratio the value relation of m and z of empirical correction factor is 26 m 1 0 c r 0 5 1 0 5 4 c r 0 5 2 3 c r 0 5 z 0 5 0 625 c r 1 0 3 2 wave load the wave forces acting on the large scale floating structure can be calculated by employing the radiation diffraction theory referring to fig 4 the whole domain is a semi infinite unbounded flow domain with the boundary s b s d s f and s c where s f indicates the free surface of the water s d indicates the seabed boundary s c indicates the infinite boundary of the flow domain and s b indicates surface of the floating structure respectively by assuming the water to be inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational there would exist a velocity potential ϕ which consists of three parts and can be written as 27 ϕ ϕ i ϕ d j 1 6 ϕ r where ϕ i is the incident potential due to the undisturbed incoming wave ϕ d is the diffraction potential due to the diffraction of the undisturbed incoming wave ϕ r is the radiation potential due to the six degrees of freedom dof motion of the floating structure besides the velocity potential ϕ should meet the following boundary conditions 28 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 29 ϕ z 0 30 g ϕ z 2 ϕ t 2 0 31 ϕ n u n where g is the gravity acceleration t is the time point n is the outward unit vector normal to the structure boundary u is the velocity vector of displacement of floating structure in addition the velocity potential should also meet the radiation condition sommerfeld condition based on the above mentioned boundary conditions the unknown velocity potential can be solved at a discrete number of points on the wetted surface of the floating structure by using green s theorem according to the linearized bernoulli equation the first order water pressure distribution can be obtained from the pressure distribution the various fluid forces may be calculated by integrating the pressure over the whole wetted surface of the floating structure in addition to the wave frequency response which is consistent with the wave frequency there would be a drift motion at a large period for the floating structure because of being subjected to the second order mean drift force the second order mean drift force can be got by the near field solution and the far field solution near field solution could obtain the mean wave force and moment acting on floating structures in all dofs based on the mean wetted surface integration approach expressions of the near field solution of the second order mean drift force are given as follows 32 f s t r c 2 w l 1 2 ρ g ζ r 2 n n 1 2 n 2 2 d l s 0 1 2 ρ φ 2 n d s s 0 ρ x φ t n d s m s r

height s 0 is the wet surface of the floating structure x is the motion displacement vector of the surface of the floating structure i s is the inertia moment matrix of the floating structure r is the rotation matrix of the floating structure x is the acceleration vector of the point mass of the floating structure the far field solution could be used to calculate the mean drift force in the horizontal plane by considering the rate of change of linear and angular momentum within a prescribed fluid domain expressions of the far field solution of the second order mean drift force are given as follows 34 f x s i n p n 1 ρ v x v n d s d g x d t 35 f y s i n p n 2 ρ v y v n d s d g y d t 36 m z s i n p r n 3 ρ r v 3 v n d s d h z d t where s in is the boundary surface of the fluid area at infinity p is the first order pressure n j is the generalized surface corresponding to the j th freedom ρ is the seawater density g is the momentum of the floating structure h is the angular momentum n is the unit normal vector of a surface element s is the surface of the floating structure 4 motion equation in frequency domain and time domain the motion equation of floating structure in frequency domain takes the following form 37 m m ω x ω c ω x ω k ω x ω f ω where m is the structure mass matrix m ω is the hydrodynamic added mass matrix c ω is the system linear damping matrix k ω is the total system stiffness matrix f ω is the external wave forces on the system per unit wave amplitude x ω is response motions or raos ω is the wave frequency eq 37 can be converted to its counterpart in time domain by transformation such as the convolution integral the external forces can be put to the right side the motion equation in time domain can be written as 38 m m x t c x t k x t 0 t r t τ x τ d τ f t where m is the hydrodynamic added mass at infinite wave frequency r t τ is the velocity impulse function matrix f t is the external forces such as wind force wave force and mooring line force etc under the excitation of external forces floating structure is assumed to be undergoing rigid body motions which can be classified into 6 dofs with the center of gravity as the reference point including three translational motions i e surge sway and heave and three rotational motions i e pitch roll and yaw the 6 dofs rigid body motion of a typical spar type floating wind turbine is presented in fig 5 5 research methods and its reliability verification studies on the dynamic response of floating wind turbines subjected to wind and wave excitations have been conducted experimentally by employing small scale prototypes for example the 47 1 scale model test of a spar type floating wind turbine of hydro oil energy skaare et al 2007 the 1 67 scale model test roddier et al 2010 of a semi submersible platform floating wind turbine of principal power inc and the 1 128 scale model test shin et al 2014 of a spar type floating wind turbine moored by spring tensioned leg there is no doubt that performing the investigations experimentally would be accurate and convincing but it s too dependent on the precision of the equipment and changes in the research objects would result in high costs because it needs to be rebuilt another approach now for the floating wind turbine study is to do the numerical simulation based on the traditional hydrodynamic simulation software wamit orcaflex or based on the professional wind turbine simulation package fast the traditional marine solver has a reliable hydrodynamic computation model but its aerodynamic calculation model is simple and not suitable for floating wind turbine the wind turbine simulation package is rather mature in the calculation of aerodynamic load but its hydrodynamic calculation model is quite poor and suitable for certain objects therefore most of studies conducted at present are normally with the simplified wind turbine geometry and analytically derived wind or wave loads in views of numerical simulation direct solving of 3 d navier stokes equations is rarely used since it s too time consuming therefore in order to explore the dynamic response of floating wind turbine under the external excitations with both mature aerodynamic and hydrodynamic calculation models the bem theory is adopted to establish the aerodynamic calculation model firstly and then the dynamic link library is compiled to realize the secondary development of ansys aqwa based on the fortran language based on this effects of heave plate on dynamic response of floating wind turbine spar platform are studied the detailed procedures are given in section 5 1 5 1 aerodynamic loads calculation model and its verification aerodynamic loads acting on the floating wind turbine include two parts one is the rotor thrust force resulting from the rotor rotation and the other is the wind drag force in views of the rotor thrust force first taking the speed of center of gravity as the reference the hub speed is then obtained based on the transformation matrix second the hub speed is set as the fluctuation wind speed and then superimposed with the inflow wind speed then the rotor thrust force is calculated at each time step based on the bem theory the nrel 5 mw wind turbine blade was designed based on five du airfoils and one naca airfoil including 17 sections coefficients of lift force and drag force was obtained by using xfoil at small attack angles and then extrapolated to 180 180 the aerodynamic coefficient of the five du airfoils and one naca airfoil is presented in fig 6 and would be invoked during the calculation process the nrel 5 mw wind turbine adopts a conventional variable blade pitch control strategy consequence of which is that rotor thrust force would be reduced with the increasing wind speed above rated therefore the designed pitch angle jonkman et al 2009 provided by jonkman was used in this paper to realize the pitch control the designed pitch angles at different wind speeds can be seen in fig 7 in order to verify the accuracy and reliability of calculation model of aerodynamic load in this paper the calculated rotor thrust force based on the fast was also given to do the comparison work which can be seen in fig 8 according to fig 8 the rotor thrust force calculated is highly consistent with that of nrel fast therefore it verifies the accuracy of the wind load calculation model and provides the guarantee for the following research in view of the drag force acting on the tower and the upper part of the platform according to ref ye et al 2017 for nrel 5 mw wind turbine the drag force is about 30 kn when at rated wind speed so the drag force solution model in aqwa which is given as eq 39 is employed to calculate the drag force coefficient 39 f w d r a g 1 2 ρ a i r c d r a g a v 2 where c d r a g is the wind drag force coefficient a is the area of the structure in the inflow wind direction 5 2 wave loads calculation mesh generation and its verification at present the wave load calculation mainly includes two different methods the first method is the morison equation and its correction which is mainly used to calculate wave force acting on small scale structures when viscous effect cannot be neglected the other method is the diffraction radiation theory which is mainly used to calculate the wave force acting on large scale structures when diffraction effect account for a large proportion the basis for judging whether the structure is a large scale structure or a small scale structure is whether the characteristic length of the structure is greater than 0 2 times of the wave length the main part of the research objects in this paper is modeled based on the surface element while the rod used to connect the heave plates with the platform is modeled based on the morison element for aqwa mesh generation is mainly based on the following principles the area ratio of adjacent grid cells should not exceed 3 besides characteristic dimensions of every grid cell should be less than 1 7th of the incident wave length ding et al 2018 furthermore for 32 bit version of aqwa solver number of the panels is limited to 18000 of which 12000 may be diffracting while the 64 bite version of aqwa solver is limited to 40000 of which 32000 may be diffracting the smaller the maximum panel size the more accurate the results would be yet more calculation resources would be needed according to the mentioned principles above mesh generation work was conducted with the maximum size of 1 2 m while the diffraction panel under the waterline is 1 m and the morison element is 0 5 m results of the mesh generation are shown in fig 9 total number of panels is about 16000 of which number of diffraction panels is about 8000 and morison elements are 120 normally verification of whether the meshing generation could satisfy the need of hydrodynamic calculation is based on the haskind relationship journée and massie 2000 but this method does not exist in aqwa therefore in this paper the closeness of the results of second order mean drift force calculated based on the far field method and near field method was used to verify the reliability of mesh generation the results of the second order mean drift force of the four groups of research objects are shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 it can be observed that when wave frequency is smaller than 1 0 rad s the second order mean drift force keeps zero while it shows trend of increase with the increase of the wave frequency when wave frequency exceeds 1 0 rad s more importantly the second order mean drift force calculated based on the near field method is highly consistent with that calculated based on the far field method accordingly mesh generation can be considered to meet the requirements of hydrodynamic calculation accuracy the reason why the closeness of the solutions to the second order mean drift force could be employed to judge the reasonability of mesh generation is that the near field method solves the second order wave force by integrating pressure on the average wet surface of the floating structure which depends on mesh generation different from near field method far field method is to obtain the second order mean drift force by solving the momentum and angle momentum equation which has nothing to do with the mesh generation therefore when the two solutions are closer to each other it can be considered that the mesh generation could satisfy the calculation accuracy requirements 6 results and discussions 6 1 the calculation of viscous damping due to the fact that potential theory is based on the inviscid assumption and the effects of viscous damping cannot be considered which may overestimate the calculation results and affect the accuracy of calculation therefore the viscous damping matrix is added to the hydrodynamic calculation in this paper the surge roll and yaw motion are influenced by the characteristics of mooring system significantly which make it difficult to calculate the viscous damping while the heave and pitch motion are related to the restoring force in water and can be obtained according to the added mass and static stiffness of the system equivalent viscous damping is calculated in proportion to critical damping which calculated by 40 β 0 2 m m a c i where m is the mass or moment of inertia of floating foundation the m a is the added mass of floating foundation and the c i is the static water recovery stiffness based on the existing research experience of considering the effect of viscous damping zhao et al 2012 the heave viscous damping was considered by adding 10 β 0 of the heave motion rho et al 2002 pointed out that the heave plate has little effect on the pitching motion of the floating platforms therefore the pitch viscous damping was considered by adding 0 5 β 0 of the pitch motion the calculation results are shown in table 3 6 2 response in frequency and its verification before conducting the investigation on global performance of floating wind turbine spar platform with heave plate the hydrodynamics of the original spar platform was performed and in order to verify accuracy and reliability of the simulation results comparison work was compared with the results of experimental study which was conducted by the korea ocean research and development institute kordi 2012 the experimental study was taken from the shi kordi cooperative research project of which the full scale water depth is about 144 m and the scale ratio is 45 1 besides waves used in the experiment are regular waves under head sea conditions and the wave frequency range is from 0 1 to 1 5 rad s therefore only the surge heave and pitch responses were analyzed in this paper because of the head sea condition surge heave and pitch rao in frequency domain can be seen in fig 11 in fig 11 surge rao shows the trend of decrease with the increase of wave frequency while the heave and pitch rao show the trend of first increase and then decrease peak wave frequency of heave rao is about 0 2 rad s while it s about 0 22 rad s for pitch rao although there exist slight differences for surge and pitch rao compared with the experimental studies it could still be thought that the simulation results show quite good agreements with the kordi experimental results because of the effect of viscous damping as well as test errors therefore the accuracy and reliability of the hydrodynamic calculation model could be verified to a quite large extent after installing heave plate characteristics of rao in frequency domain of floating wind turbine spar platforms are shown in fig 12 since there are lots of superposition for heave rao scatter plot method is used to better display the differences according to fig 12 it can be seen that surge rao in frequency domain shows the trend of decrease when the wave frequency increases after applying the heave plates but at the low wave frequency range about 0 15 0 3 rad s there exists a trend of first decrease and then decrease besides the local peak frequency is the largest when heave plate is installed at the bottom part of the platform while it s the smallest when the heave plate is located at the upper part of the platform but in general surge rao in frequency domain still shows the trend of decrease with the increase of wave frequency and it s not sensitive to the attachment of heave plate therefore it can be concluded that surge response of spar is not sensitive to both the first order wave excitation and the heave plate regarding the heave rao in frequency domain it keeps the trend of increasing first and then decreasing which means that the heave plates doesn t change the tendency of heave rao when the wave frequency changes compared with fig 11 peak frequency of original spar is about 0 2 rad s peak value of rao is about 7 m after installing heave plate peak frequency of heave rao decreases to around 0 191 rad s peak value of spar with heave plate installation at the bottom is about 5 2 m peak value is about 5 75 m while peak value of the spar platform with heave plate at the upper is about 6 25 m in summary the heave plate changes the peak frequency of spar and it would achieve the best inhibition effect when installed at the bottom regarding to pitch rao in frequency domain compared with fig 11 it can be observed that heave plate doesn t change the tendency of pitch rao which is quite similar with the heave rao case both having the trend of first increase and then decrease besides peak frequency of pitch rao of original spar is approximately 0 22 rad s while the peak value is about 2 6 after installing the heave plate the peak frequency of pitch rao of platform with heave plate attachment at the bottom is about 0 25 rad s peak frequency of pitch rao of spar with heave plate at the middle is about 0 20 rad s peak frequency of pitch rao of spar with heave plate at the upper is about 0 165 rad s as per the peak value the bottom attached is 4 5 the middle attached and top attached is about 4 8 but the top attached is a bit larger than the middle attached the results show that heave plate changes the peak frequency and increases the peak value of pitch rao besides compared rao of original spar with those of platform with heave plate installation it can be seen that the closer the heave plate attached to the bottom the higher of the peak frequency of the pitch rao the lower the peak value of the rao the closer the heave plates are attached to the top of the platform the less obvious the increase of the peak frequency of the pitch rao of the platform the closer it draws to the original spar and at the same time the more obvious the increase of the peak value is in summary effect of heave plates on surge rao is small while the inhibition effect on heave rao is large however it increases the pitch rao in some extent the increase of the stability of the spar platform with the bottom attached heave plate is most obvious effect of heave plate on first order wave exciting force in frequency domain is shown in fig 13 according to fig 13 trend of four curves in surge heave and pitch are almost the same amplitudes at different frequencies of first order wave exciting force are almost same for original spar and platforms with heave plate installed at the middle and bottom part however the platform experiences a smaller first wave exciting force when the heave plate is installed at the upper part it is because the first order excitation force is mainly acting on the floating structures at the free surface the bottom and middle installation cases are all far away from the free surface so their influence on first order wave excitation force can be neglected the reason why heave plate could reduce the first wave exciting force when it s installed at the upper is that the first wave exciting force is the result of the pressure integration on the average wet surface of spar therefore when installing heave plate by cutting main body of spar whole area close to the average wet surface would reduce that s why the wave excitation force on spar with heave plate installed at the upper becomes smaller effect of heave plate on added mass in frequency domain is shown in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 that surge added mass decreases after installing heave plate however it s not that much sensitive to its installation position it means though the installation position has little effect on the added mass it still can be observed that the added mass is relatively larger when heave plate is installed at the bottom part in view of heave added mass it s much larger for platforms with heave plate than that of original spar regarding to the effect of installation position the added mass is the largest when heave plate is installed at the middle while it s the smallest when the heave plate is installed at the bottom but overall the position has little effect on added mass since the curves are so close to each other in view of pitch added mass the original spar has the largest added mass when the have plate is installed at the upper the added mass is the smallest and much smaller than the other three platforms when the heave plate is installed at the middle and bottom the added mass are almost the same as that of original spar therefore the reason why the pitch rao of spar with heave plate at the upper is much larger may be that the heave plate reduces the pitch added mass effect of the heave plate on radiation damping in frequency domain is shown in fig 15 according to fig 15 heave plate could hardly affect the surge and heave radiation damping in frequency domain the radiation damping is just a bit smaller than that of platforms with heave plate at the upper in view of pitch radiation damping when heave plate is at the middle position its value is consistent with the original spar when heave plate is at the bottom position it s a bit larger than that of the original spar however when heave plate is at the upper position it s much smaller than that of the other platforms 6 3 verification of importance of the coupling effect of wind and wave main purpose of this section is to verify the importance of wind load as well as the coupling effect of wind and wave in order to conduct the verification work the hydrodynamic performance of the original spar under three different working conditions was conducted the three kinds of working conditions include wave only non coupling effect of wind wave and coupling effect of wind wave non coupling effect of wind wave refers to change of the relative wind speed caused by the wave induced platform motion is not taken into consideration the essential wind is generated by the nrel turbsim based on the kaimal wind spectrum the average wind speed is 11 4 m s which is the rated wind speed for nrel 5 mw wind turbine the obtained time series of wind speed is shown in fig 16 the wave is generated based on the p m wave spectrum for a given wave spectrum the time series of irregular wave can be generated by linear superposition of harmonic wave components fig 17 shows a typical energy distribution when the significant wave height and the crossing zero period are 3 0 m and 7 0s respectively normally it s needed to perform at least 2 h simulation in offshore engineering but this section is mainly to capture the response differences for original spar under different working conditions so a 180 s simulation is conducted here which is enough to display the differences between the calculation results actual surge heave and pitch response is presented in fig 18 actual surge acceleration of the nacelle is given in fig 19 it can be seen from fig 18 that actual response of the original spar would be quite small if the wind load is ignored when compared with the wind being taken into consideration case according to previous calculation results the rotor thrust force is about 780 kn when at rated speed which is quite closer to the first order exciting force whole external load only increases by no more than 50 when wind load is taken into consideration but the actual response increases by several times therefore it can be concluded that wind load cannot be neglected in the explorations on floating offshore wind turbine system and it can also be concluded that the hydrodynamic characteristics of the floating wind turbine spar platform are quite different from that of the traditional oil gas spar platform according to the comparison of actual response of original spar platform under the non coupling effect of wind wave and coupling effect of wind wave it can be observed that although the coupling effect has little impact on magnitude of the response however the response characteristics are completely different especially for surge motion which can also be concluded from the calculation results of the nacelle surge acceleration in fig 19 hence it can be concluded that ignoring wind load simplifying wind load or ignoring the coupling effect of wind and wave is extremely inaccurate to study the floating wind turbine 6 4 nonlinear response in time domain the free decay tests of original spar spar with bottom middle and upper position heave plate were performed at given initial positions without considering external loads the natural frequencies of four spar platforms were calculated by fast fourier transform fft analysis of time series data the results are shown in fig 20 as can be seen from fig 20 the natural frequencies of surge heave and pitch of original spar are 0 050 rad s 0 200 rad s and 0 223 rad s the natural frequencies of surge heave and pitch of spar with bottom heave plate are 0 044 rad s 0 195 rad s and 0 253 rad s the natural frequencies of surge heave and pitch of spar with middle heave plate are 0 044 rad s 0 195 rad s and 0 201 rad s and the natural frequencies of surge heave and pitch of spar with upper heave plate are 0 044 rad s 0 195 rad s and 0 170 rad s by comparison with original spar we can conclude that the installation of heave plate will reduce the natural frequencies of surge and heave while it is not affected by installation positions however the pitch natural frequencies were significantly influenced by installation position of heave plate and the closer the heave plate is the bottom part of spar platform the larger the pitch natural frequencies main purpose of this part is to analyze the effect of the heave plate and its installation position on the nonlinear dynamic response characteristics of spar under the coupling effect of wind and wave the extreme sea condition in the south china sea once in a century was adopted the wind is generated by the nrel turbsim based on the kaimal wind spectrum the average wind speed is 21 m s namely the rated wind speed the wave is generated based on the p m wave spectrum the significant wave height is 13 m while the crossing zero period is 18s the obtained time series of the wave height and energy density are shown in fig 21 in order to verify that the above calculation results are convincing different random wave seed including 1 100 1000 2000 5000 and 10000 are adopted to generate the irregular wave the whole simulation time is 8000s while the time step is 0 1 s 6 4 1 analysis result of motion performance under the coupling effect of wind and wave actual motions of original spar and platforms with heave plates are shown in fig 22 since there are too many data points in order to better display the motion characteristics of the platforms certain time intervals here are cut out besides the fluctuation ranges and the standard deviations are also provided for a quantitative description according to fig 22a compared with the original spar the heave plate increases the actual surge motion which is also sensitive to the installation position from the fluctuation range value it can be seen the fluctuation range of surge motion for bottom position heave plate is 20 24 m while it s around 19 23 m when the heave plate is installed at the middle part of the platform and the fluctuation range of surge motion is about 18 98 m when the heave plate is installed at the upper part of the platform furthermore it can be seen from the picture that the closer the installation position is to the upper part of the platform the smaller the standard deviation but in all compared with the whole surge value the surge motion differences between the original spar and the platforms with heave plate can be neglected therefore it can be concluded that the installation position of heave plates has small impact on platform surge motion in view of the actual heave motion it can be seen from fig 22b that heave plate decreased actual heave motion however their inhibition effects are quite different from each other the fluctuation range of heave motion is around 10 07 m when it s installed at the upper part of the platform while it s about 9 5 m when it s located at the bottom and the middle part of the platform although the fluctuation ranges are almost the same when the heave plates are installed at the bottom and the middle part of the platform the standard deviation is bigger when it s installed at the middle part of the platform but all of the three cases are lower than the original spar therefore it can be concluded that it s better to install the heave plates at the bottom part of the platform as can be seen from fig 22c heave plates have a greater influence on the pitch response of the platform when the plates are installed at the bottom part of the platform the heave plate obviously aggravates the pitch motion when it s installed at the middle part of the platform the heave plate slightly decreases the pitch motion however the pitch fluctuation could be significantly decreased when it s installed at the upper part of the platform according to the stand deviation values for the pitch response the trend of the four cases is almost the same with pitch fluctuation the maximum standard deviation can be observed when it s installed at the bottom part of the platform followed by middle upper part of the platform when the wind speed reaches to 25 m s the wind turbine operates under the standstill condition according to zambrano et al 2006 the average pitch of the floating wind turbine platform should be less than 5 and the dynamic pitch fluctuation range should be less than 15 in this case the turbine can generate electricity normally as we can be seen from fig 23 a the maximum fluctuation of the pitch response curve occurs when heave plate mounted on the bottom part of the platform which ranging from 12 67 to 8 96 and the mean values of all cases are less than 5 while under extreme sea condition the maximum surge fluctuation is from 20 18 m to 0 06 m zambrano et al 2006 also pointed out that the surge response was not considered a critical factor only if the loads of the mooring line system stayed within half of the breaking strength the analysis of mooring line tension under extreme sea conditions will be discussed in next subsection in order to display the frequency dynamic characteristics of the platforms motion data under extreme sea condition in time domain are transformed to frequency domain by adopting fft method under the coupling effect of wind and wave the frequency response characteristics of the original spar and platforms with heave plate are shown in fig 24 according to fig 24 regarding to surge motion it can be seen that there exists obvious two peak response intervals the first peak frequencies of spectrum are all around 0 05 rad s which is the platform natural frequency while peak value is 0 36 0 57 0 42 and 0 41 respectively corresponding to the original spar and platforms with heave plate at bottom middle and upper part the heave plate increases the peak value when the frequency is 0 06 rad s while it has little effects on other frequency interval in view of the heave response it can be seen from the pictures that for all platforms there exists one peak response values and two frequency interval which has peak responses frequency of the first peak value is around 0 2 rad s which corresponding to the platform natural frequency frequency of the first interval is from 0 to 0 18 rad s which corresponding to the surge heave coupling motion frequency while the second frequency interval is from 0 2 to 0 6 rad s which corresponding to the wave frequency internal resulting in the wave frequency motion in addition it can also be found that the peak values of the wave frequency motion and the coupling surge heave motion of all platforms keep unchanged which indicates that wave frequency motion and coupling surge heave motion aren t affected by the heave plate and its installation position however peak values in platform natural frequencies are quite different from each other peak value in the natural frequency of the original spar is about 1 12 while it s 1 20 1 21 and 1 27 respectively for the platforms with heave plate at the bottom middle and upper part therefore it s better to install the heave plate at the bottom part of the platform this is consistent with the time domain analysis in view of the pitch response it can be observed that pitch motion curves in frequency domain share almost the same trend namely first increase then decrease with the increase of the frequency similar to the heave response there also exist one peak response values and two frequency interval which has peak responses the first frequency interval corresponds to the coupling surge pitch low frequency response the second frequency interval corresponds to the platform natural frequency response the third frequency interval corresponds to the wave frequency response besides it can be observed the peak values of in the wave frequency interval keep unchanged which indicates that heave plate has no effect on pitch wave frequency response peak frequency value of the four platforms is 0 21 rad s 0 245 rad s 0 208 rad s and 0 17 rad s respectively the corresponding peak response value of the above mentioned four frequencies is 0 98 1 02 0 98 and 0 55 which means that heave plate decreases the peak response values significantly when it s installed at the upper part of the platform this may be the reason why the pitch response is smaller than other cases when the heave plate is installed at the bottom and middle part of the platform in addition although the peak response value remains unchanged when it is installed at the middle part of the platform when compared with the original spar its peak response values in the low frequency region are smaller than those of the original spar which may be the reason why the time domain pitch response of platform with middle heave plate is slightly smaller than that of the original spar 6 4 2 analysis result of mooring system mooring system is one of the key technologies to ensure the safety reliability of the floating wind turbine therefore in this subsection the performance of mooring system of floating wind turbine spar platform with heave plate proposed in this paper was investigated fig 25 shows the top view of the mooring line system under the coupling effect of wind and wave mooring tensions in time domain are shown in fig 26 since line no 2 and no 3 are arranged symmetrically relative to the direction of wind and wave therefore only time series of line no 1 and no 2 were presented according to fig 26 mooring line tension of platforms with heave plate are significantly reduced when compared with those of the original spar especially for line no 2 of which the reduction extent is almost 57 however changes of installation position have little effect on the mooring tension the reason why mooring tension of line no 2 is reduced is that surge displacement of the platform increases resulting in an increase in mooring length of the lying part so that the tension is significantly reduced although the mooring tension of line no 1 of spar platform with heave plate are smaller than original spar but the reduction is not obvious the reason why the tension of line no 1 is reduced is that the draught of platform increases after the installation of heave plate resulting in an increase of line laid length which however would be decreased because of the increase of surge displacement therefore it can be concluded that the decreased laid length is smaller than the increased laid length the statistical results of mooring tension are summarized in table 4 according to api rp 2sk criteria the limit of mooring tension is usually expressed by the percentage of minimum breaking strength mbs the mbs is usually measured by the mooring line experiment and provided by the manufacturers table 5 lists the criteria and safety factor of mooring line tension limit provided in api rp 2sk therefore the equivalent factor of safety is 1 67 with the dynamic analysis method in the case that the mooring system is intact as can be seen from table 4 the minimum safety factor is 3 36 which meets the requirements of operating state therefore the mooring system of floating wind turbine spar platform proposed in this paper is safe and reliable 7 conclusions based on the research experience of traditional oil gas platforms this paper proposed the structural design method of equipping the heave plate on the main body of the platform using the bladed element momentum bem the fortran language was adopted to realize the secondary development of hydrodynamic software aqwa considering the coupling effect of wind and wave effect of heave plate and its installation position on the dynamic response of the floating wind turbine spar platform was studied the following conclusions are drawn 1 the effects of heave plate on the frequency domain rao of the floating wind turbine spar platform is mainly concentrated on the low frequency band the heave plate reduced the heave rao in frequency domain but did not change the peak frequency value and its inhibition effect is most obvious when it s located at the bottom part of the platform while the pitch rao could be significantly increased in frequency domain and the peak frequency value changed simultaneously 2 the heave plate has little effect on surge added mass the heave plate increases the heave added mass significantly while it decreases the pitch added mass when the heave plate is located at the middle and bottom part of the platform it has less effect on the first order wave force and when it is located on the upper part of the platform it reduces the first order wave force acting on the platform the heave plate and its installation position have little effect on the radiation damping 3 the wind load and the coupling effect of wind and wave cannot be neglected and the induction effect of platform motion on relative wind speed must be considered 4 in the time domain analysis surge movement of the platform increases significantly when considering the coupling effects of wind and wave and the effects of mooring line system what s more heave motion is sensitive to the installation position of heave plate in view of pitch movement heave plate inhibits its response to some extent but exacerbates its response when it s installed at the bottom part of the platform 5 the heave plate could significantly reduce the mooring tension under extreme sea condition but the change of heave plate installation position has little effect on it the safety factor of all mooring lines are larger than 1 67 therefore the floating foundation and its mooring system have enough ability to resist extreme sea conditions acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the national natural science

22011,this paper describes an efficient and applicable approach to decrease the heave motion response of a semi submersible platform by introducing poroelastic layers pels at the bottom of its pontoons this study was carried out utilizing a semi analytical method based on eigenfunction expansion which involves determining the added mass damping related hydrodynamic force and heave motion response the adequacy of the semi analytical method was verified by applying it to a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform whose heave response amplitude operator was extracted and compared with available experimental data the extracted value and available data showed close agreement furthermore the effectiveness of the pels attached at the bottom of the gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform and the effect of pel characteristics such as the thickness intrinsic permeability and elasticity on reducing heave motion response were evaluated comparing the results with the studied gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform without pels indicated that the application of pels could considerably reduce the heave motion response and nearly eliminate the risk of creating a resonance phenomenon in the semi submersible platforms in different sea wave conditions the approach introduced in this study could be a suitable pathway to improve the performance of semi submersible

floating platform which is used predominantly for drilling and extraction of oil and or natural gas from deep waters this platform has a simple geometry consisting of a hull mooring and riser systems the hull is characterized by a deck columns pontoons and braces and plays the main role in wave response the platform can be classified as a particular type of watercraft because 70 85 of its hull is located underwater the distinguishing features of a semi submersible platform are its large deck area payload capacity equal resistance to waves winds and currents and ability to support mooring systems the conventional semi submersible platform offers motion with six degrees of freedom namely surge sway yaw heave pitch and roll its heave motion response is significantly larger than the other platform types such as spar platforms and tension leg platforms due to its small water plane and draft the small damping of this platform which is predominantly hydrodynamic damping due to wave radiation also increases its heave motion response the large heave motion of a semi submersible platform often limits its drilling operations and may damage the risers and mooring systems therefore it is necessary to improve the heave motion responses of such systems and ensure to shift their natural heave frequency away from the frequencies of daily waves many researchers have attempted to improve the heave motion responses of semi submersible platforms by employing different techniques such as optimizing the geometrical shape akagi and ito 1984 clauss and birk 1996 birk and clauss 2001 birk

wang 2003 many types of flexible materials with different properties exist poroelastic materials being one example poroelastic materials are flexible and can be deformed by fluid flow due to their porous structures poroelastic analysis is applicable to isotropic and anisotropic systems containing pores of a variety of shapes and filled with fluids berryman 2010 2011 2013 biot 1941 was the first to theoretically propose soil consolidation models which calculate the settling behaviors of structures in fluid saturated porous systems the application of this theory is mostly wave propagation in geologic structures kanaun et al 2018 the poroelastic materials are generally applied in various fields such as geotechnics dams cavities and cracks hydrology biomechanics tissue mechanics cell mechanics and micromechanics cowin 1999 dormieux et al 2006 cowin and doty 2007 giraud et al 2012 moeendarbary et al 2013 cheng 2016 wang 2017 hadzalic et al 2019 kanaun 2019 in the context of sea hydrology numerous researchers have investigated the effects of wave interactions with poroelastic seabed and breakwaters yamamoto 1983 and lee et al 2002 theoretically investigated sea wave induced behavior of a coulomb damped poroelastic seabed of infinite and finite thicknesses the interaction between a small amplitude water wave propagating in a channel with constant depth and a horizontal poroelastic bed was analytically studied by huang and song 1993 using a methodology employing three decoupled helmholtz equations lee and lan 2002 analytically studied the interactions between waves and a poroelastic seabed of infinite depth jeng and cha 2003 conducted experiments to determine the dynamic soil behavior of a porous seabed with nonlinear waves on wave induced pore pressure in addition they investigated the effective stresses in the porous seabed zhou et al 2011 analytically developed a new solution for the response of a wave induced multi layered poroelastic seabed using biot s equations lan and lee 2010 suggested using biot s theory to determine the behavior of a highly permeable breakwater by considering the breakwater of a single submerged rectangular poroelastic specimen in sea water they analytically evaluated the reflection transmission and energy dissipation caused by monochromatic propagating waves for this breakwater the resulting values of the wave reflection and transmission coefficients agreed well with the experimental data obtained by huang and lin 1997 lan et al 2011 used analyses and experiments to obtain wave scattering results for a series of poroelastic submerged breakwaters they determined the porosities of various elastic materials the analytical and experimental methods yielded values that were in close agreement to comprehend wave transformation and thereby the effects of poroelastic material on wave scattering and energy dissipation lan et al 2012 theoretically discussed wave interactions with two adjacent submerged breakwaters made of poroelastic material using biot s theory and an eigenfunction matching method in addition lan et al 2013 analyzed wave interactions with closely spaced poroelastic submerged breakwaters using a theoretical approach employing the eigenfunction approximation method lan and hsu 2014 analytically investigated wave interactions with a double layer composite poroelastic submerged breakwater based on biot s theory and the eigenfunction matching technique this structure consisted of two layers of different poroelastic materials that were fully attached to each other and the effects of the flexible composite submerged permeable breakwater on the scattering and energy dissipation were evaluated however no research has been reported on systems employing floating platforms containing poroelastic layers pels to minimize their motions therefore this study conducted in an attempt to introduce the novel approach of using pels in a semi submersible platform to decrease its heave motion response to this end a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform modified with pels at the bottom of its pontoons in deep water was considered a semi analytical method utilizing eigenfunction expansion method eem was developed for solving heave motion response problem the exciting forces added mass damping coefficient and stiffness were calculated to determine the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform to estimate these parameters the region around the platform was divided into five separate subregions each subregion had its own governing equations with appropriate boundary conditions bcs the governing equations for the respective subregions could be solved by satisfying the relative dynamic and kinematic bcs the continuity and momentum equations whose formulations were based on related theories served as the governing equations for the pel region these equations were solved simultaneously to satisfy the interface bcs between two adjacent subregions the unknown coefficients derived by using the eem were solved numerically ultimately the one degree of freedom 1 dof equation of heave motion for the modified semi submersible platform was solved and the results were compared with unmodified semi submersible platform moreover the effects of the thickness intrinsic permeability and elasticity of the pel on the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform were investigated to determine whether the proposed approach offers a practical means of reducing the heave motion responses of such systems the remainder of this paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 describe the models and equations employed in this study section 4 presents the results in detail and describes their significance in the context of the research objectives section 5 performs the sensitivity analysis for the modified semi submersible platform in different sea wave conditions section 6 discusses and summarizes the main findings of this study 2 theoretical formulation in this study a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform was modified by introducing a layer of poroelastic in the lower part of its pontoons the semi submersible platform was assumed to be located at a water depth of h 1 under a monochromatic dominant small amplitude wave train propagating in the x direction it was assumed that the fluid was incompressible inviscid and irrotational as well as the pel was homogeneous isotropic and saturated the schematic shape of this completely symmetric semi submersible platform is illustrated in fig 1 the cartesian coordinates were selected on the free surface of the sea and the origin was located at the center of the semi submersible with the z axis oriented vertically upward and the x axis oriented horizontally along the pontoons in this study the problem of the heave motion response was solved semi analytically in order to understand and give physical meaning to the results of the parameters of the pels attached in the semi submersible platform the governing equations for the water waves and the pel were the two sets of equations used to semi analytically solve the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible 2 1 governing equations of water waves the fluid can be described in terms of velocity potential as expressed in eq 1 wu et al 2004 1 φ x y z t re ϕ x y z e i ω t where re is the real part of the complex expression i 1 is the imaginary unit and ϕ is the spatial part of the velocity potential satisfying the laplace equation for three dimensional conditions eq 2 2 2 ϕ 0 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 where x y z in linear problems a fully three dimensional solution is sought by separating the variables eq 3 3 ϕ x y z w x y z z substitution of this form into laplace s equation yields 4 1 w d 2 w d x 2 d 2 w d y 2 1 z d 2 z d z 2 k n 2 d 2 z d z 2 k n 2 z 0 and where k n is an arbitrary parameter that shows the eigenvalues in the relevant region and determined by the bcs 5 1 w d 2 w d x 2 d 2 w d y 2 1 x d 2 x d x 2 k n 2 1 y d 2 y d y 2 ξ n 2 6 d 2 x d x 2 ξ n 2 x 0 and d 2 y d y 2 k n 2 ξ n 2 y 0 since the modified semi submersible is located under a monochromatic small amplitude wave in the x direction the geometry does not vary in the y direction in this case it is necessary to consider a solution that is periodic in the y direction and independent of the geometry we can look for solutions of w x y in the form of eq 7 7 w x y x x e i ℓ y where ℓ k n 2 ξ n 2 for oblique waves ξ n k n cos θ and ℓ k n sin θ thereby k n cos θ k n 2 ℓ 2 linton and mciver 2001 in this study ℓ equals zero because of θ 0 therefore although the semi submersible platform was three dimensional the problem was solved as a two dimensional problem and the effect of the pontoons width and columns diameter in y direction was just considered as a constant value in calculating the added mass damping coefficient and exciting force explained in section 3 in a linear problem for a wave train approaching to a floating structure the fluid structure interaction problem can be divided into two parts one as the diffraction of the incident wave train due to the fixed body which produces a scattered wave field it means that it is partially reflected and partially transmitted and the other as the radiation of the body forced to oscillate in the absence of the incident wave train therefore the velocity potential can be expressed as the summation of the three potentials consisting of incident wave diffracted and radiated potentials linton and mciver 2001 the incident wave potential was calculated assuming a linear harmonic wave in the absence of a platform it was solved using the laplace equation and their related bcs eq 8 8 ϕ i i a g ω cosh k z h 1 cosh k h 1 exp i k x the superposed diffracted waves with the incident waves will develop the scattered wave field which will apply forces on the structure to oscillate thus the radiation potential is calculated by assuming the oscillation of the structure in the absence of waves linton and mciver 2001 due to the small amplitude of the harmonic waves the radiation potential can be expressed using eq 9 9 φ r l re i ω a r l ϕ r l x z where ϕ r l is the spatial part of the velocity potential in the mode l in this study the induced motion of the platform could be assumed to be small because of the small wave amplitude so the interaction between the oscillation modes was ignored therefore only the heave motion response was evaluated and the l index was ignored while calculating the radiation potential to calculate the governing equations of water waves half of the semi submersible platform was considered due to its symmetry and divided into subregions i ii 1 iii and iv the laplace equation served as the governing equation for these subregions this equation was solved by satisfying the bcs illustrated in fig 2 the equation for the radiation potential in each subregion of the modified semi submersible platform was obtained using separation of variables for the laplace equation and their related bcs eq 10 14 10 ϕ 1 r n 1 a 1 n e

be evaluated according to the direction of wave propagation the governing equations of subregion ii 2 fig 2 were solved using the mass conservation and momentum equations of the pel the equation of mass conservation for this material is based on verruijt s equation and the state equation for the pore fluid eq 21 verruijt 1969 21 p t 1 n β u n γ where u d t and d is equal to d ξ i χ j and γ d t d t is the vector of the fluid velocity dependent on the poroelastic material the momentum equations for the pel were obtained using biot s theory biot 1956 and expressed as eqs 22 and 23 22 1 n ρ w τ 1 n n 1 ρ w p 1 n n ρ s ρ w u t c a γ t n ν k p γ n 2 c f k p γ γ and 23 1 ρ w p u t s γ t n ν k p γ n 2 c f k p γ γ where s 1 c a is the virtual mass coefficient and τ was determined using hook s law eq 24 24 τ σ x τ z x τ x z σ z 2 g ξ x μ 1 2 μ ε g χ x ξ z g χ x ξ z 2 g χ z μ 1 2 μ ε furthermore ε d is the volume strain of the elastic solid and g is expressed as follows the right hand sides of eqs 22 and 23 include four component forces where the first two are inertial forces the third is proportional to the relative velocity of the pore fluid and is known as the laminar resistance force and the final component is the turbulent resistance force the term γ γ represents a nonlinear mechanism that can be replaced by a linear mechanism that consumes the same value of energy in one wave period according to lorentz s supposition of equivalent work as reported by sollitt and cross 1973 eq 25 25 t t t f ω γ γ d t d t t t n ν k p γ n 2 c f k p γ γ γ d t d therefore for a homogenous and isotropic pel the linear friction factor can be expressed as eq 26 26 f n υ ω k p n 2 c f ω k p t t t γ γ γ d t d t t t γ γ d t d where is the volume of the pel by substituting eq 26 into eqs 22 and 23 the momentum conservation of the pel can be expressed as shown in eqs 27 and 28 27 1 n ρ w τ 1 n n 1 ρ w p 1 n n ρ s ρ w u t c a γ t ω f γ and 28 1 ρ w p u t s γ t f ω γ due to the periodic wave motion the response of the semi submersible platform induced by waves can be presented as a periodic function thus γ is given by eq 29 29 γ 1 i ω ρ w q p ω 2 ρ w d q s i f consequently the equations for the submerged pel can be converted into three partial differential equations pdes with respect to ξ χ and p respectively eq 30 and 31 30 2 ϑ 1 2 ϑ 2 2 ϑ 3 ξ χ 0 and 31 2 ϑ 1 2 ϑ 2 p 0 here 32 ϑ 1

remaining unknown coefficients appearing in all the equations were calculated with the aid of their related bcs illustrated in fig 3 and the eigenfunction expansion method described in section 3 3 solving procedure as seen in section 2 the simultaneous equations contained a total of 19 unknown coefficients including a 1 n a 4 n b 2 n b 4 n c 2 n d 1 n a d 6 n a and d 1 n b d 6 n b these coefficients were determined by applying matrix equations obtained using the interface bcs between two adjacent subregions fig 3 the developed eigenfunction theory was used to estimate the coefficients of the pdes this technique is commonly used to solve wave radiation and scattering problems linton and mciver 2001 this method is related to the fourier integral and involves applying infinite series of separated eigenfunctions for the velocity potential to find a particular solution of a differential equation according to this theory if there are two pdes such that z n θ n z n 0 and z m θ m z m 0 on one boundary h j z h j 1 so that both satisfy the same bcs while they are not equal to each other θ n θ m then the pdes are orthogonal eq 46 46 z n z m h j h j 1 z n z z m z d z 0 integrating the inner product of two orthogonal eigenfunctions on the common boundary constitutes the eem in the present study the unknown coefficients of the simultaneous equations were first derived using the eem and the related vertical bcs then the coefficient matrix was formed eq 47 the unknown coefficient matrix were solved numerically using the lower upper decomposition method 47 s i j n a 1

motion response 3 1 linear friction coefficient the linear friction coefficient is another important parameter that must be determined after calculating the unknown coefficients in this study it was computed using a flowchart fig 4 firstly an initial value of the linear friction coefficient was considered next by solving the unknown coefficients the vectors of the fluid velocity and pressure of the pel were calculated and their real parts were substituted into eq 26 last the difference between the two linear friction coefficients in the consecutive process was computed if their relative difference had the required accuracy the calculation process was complete otherwise the computations were repeated a 1 relative residual was considered to be a significant difference between the linear friction coefficients 3 2 heave motion equation the approach employed in this study involved calculating the heave motion of the modified semi submersible platform the heave motion was calculated by solving the 1 dof equation eq 48 the components of the 1 dof equation were the exciting force added mass coefficient damping coefficient and stiffness 48 m m ω ℑ c ω ℑ k ℑ f e ω where f e ω is the exacting force and ℑ is rigid body motion to calculate the exciting force haskind s method can be applied according to this method the summation of the diffracted and incident wave

y z s 1 the hydrodynamic stiffness of the semi submersible platform can be defined by eq 57 57 k ρ g a w 4 convergence and verification since the eem applies infinite series of eigenvalues first of all the convergence of the modified semi submersible platform with pel should essentially be investigated then its heave motion response is estimated using the developed method and the adequacy of the analytical model is verified against available experimental data 4 1 evaluation of solution convergence due to the evanescent wave series the convergence of problem solved using the eem needed to be evaluated by determining the number of modes for this purpose the added mass and damping coefficient of the modified gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform with pels were evaluated for two wave

intrinsic permeabilities including k p 2 28 10 6 and k p 2 28 10 8 m2 as seen in table 1 and figs 5 and 6 the convergence was observed to occur for approximately 20 modes in each case 4 2 verification of developed analytical solution to verify the adequacy of the analytical model the mentioned input parameters of the gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform without pels were substituted into the extracted equations the analytical results obtained for the response amplitude operator rao of the heave motions were compared with the available experimental data reported by clauss et al 2002 the experimental data were achieved using a model on a 1 81 scale in a wave flume with a length of 80 m width of 4 m and water depth of 1 5 m under rogue and monochromatic waves comparison of the heave rao for both the analytical solution and the experimental data are shown in fig 7 the numerical simulations obtained using the timit software developed by clauss et al 2002 are also plotted in this figure demonstrating close agreement among the results 5 numerical results and discussion in the next step the effectiveness of pels installed at the bottom of the gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform on decreasing heave motion response were evaluated which are described in the following sections 5 1 pel in this study the effects of flexibility permeability and thickness of the pel installed at the bottom of the pontoons of the gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform were investigated it was assumed that the platform s center of mass center of buoyancy and deck area were always constant and that it was stable firstly the effect of the linear friction coefficient of the pel on the heave motion of the mentioned platform was evaluated then the behaviors of the added mass damping coefficient and exciting force were determined for different shear modulus and intrinsic permeability values subsequently the heave rao and heave motion response eq 58 were computed for all cases listed in table 2 and under random waves with the jonswap spectrum eq 59 a significant wave height of 11 92 m a zero up crossing period of 10 8 s with a maximum height of 25 63 m and a crest

the effectiveness of pels to improve the performance of the semi submersible platform the reduction ratio was introduced as eq 61 61 ℜ ℏ o r i g i n ℏ p e l ℏ o r i g i n 100 where ℏ o r i g i n is the heave motion response of the semi submersible platform without pels and ℏ p e l is the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform with pels 5 1 1 effect of linear friction coefficient to determine the effect of the linear friction coefficient of the pel on the behavior of the heave motion for the semi submersible platform three linear friction coefficients were considered in the extracted equations a linear friction coefficient when the turbulent drag is 0 2 c f 0 2 a linear friction when the turbulent drag is zero c f 0 and a linear friction coefficient with a constant value of 1 0 f 1 it was assumed that g 5 104 n m2 k p 2 28 10 8 m2 the thickness was 0 5 m and the values of the other parameters were the same as those listed in table 2 to investigate the effect of this parameter the heave rao curve was evaluated because this curve is extracted by the parameters such as added mass damping coefficient and exciting force so it would be a suitable assessment fig 8 illustrates the variation in the heave rao with respect to the angular wave frequency for all three cases it was obvious that the difference between c f 0 and c f 0 2 only occurred for the peak value of the heave rao while a significant difference was noted between the case with the linear friction coefficient 1 0 and the other cases thus in this study the linear friction coefficient with turbulence drag of 0 2 was taken into account in the equations in order to more accuracy of the results 5 1 2 added mass damping and exciting force the behaviors of the added mass damping coefficient and exciting force of the modified semi submersible platform were evaluated fig 9 illustrates the variation in the non dimensional added mass with respect to the non dimensional angular wave frequency for the modified semi submersible platform for varying shear modulus and permeability values it is clear that the added mass increases upon the introduction of the pel in addition the values of the added mass for the modified semi submersible platform with various kinds of pel are nearly the same for non dimensional angular frequencies higher than approximately 0 45 according to eq 62 the natural frequency of the modified semi submersible platform is decreased by increasing the added mass so it makes far off from the dominant wave frequencies 62 ω n k m m ω the variation in the non dimensional damping coefficient with the non dimensional angular wave frequency for the modified semi submersible platform with various kinds of pels is illustrated in fig 10 it is evident that the properties of the pels affect the damping coefficient the damping coefficient for the pels with a shear modulus of 5 104 n m2 and permeability of 2 28 10 8 m2 is almost zero because of the small motions of the pore fluid with increasing shear modulus or permeability the damping coefficient increases compared to that of the unmodified semi submersible platform in addition a sudden decrease in the damping coefficient is evident for all pels after which the damping coefficients equal zero fig 11 shows the variation in the non dimensional of exciting force with respect to the non dimensional angular wave frequency for the modified platform with various pels it is obvious that the force increases after introducing the pels for non dimensional angular wave frequencies higher than 0 18 0 3 however the trend differs for lower frequencies moreover the forces of the modified semi submersible platform with various pels are approximately the same for non dimensional angular frequencies higher than approximately 0 58 5 1 3 effect of pel shear modulus figs 12 and 13 illustrate the heave motion rao versus the angular wave frequency for four kinds of materials with shear moduli g of 5 107 5 106 5 105 and 5 104 n m2 and permeabilities of k p 2 28 10 6 and 2 28 10 8 m2 it is clear that utilizing the pels in the semi submersible platform reduces the resonance frequency compared with the unmodified semi submersible platform for a shear modulus of less than 5 105 n m2 g 5 105 n m2 the decrease in the resonance frequency is evident for both permeabilities because of the increased motion of the elastic solid pore fluid and frictional resistance in addition the peak value of the rao increases due to the decreased compression of the pore fluid and consequently the decreased damping moreover for shear moduli greater than 5 106 g 5 106 n m2 the peak value of the rao is nearly equal for both permeabilities the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform with aforementioned pel properties category a is compared with the unmodified semi submersible platform in table 3 which shows that the heave motion response and resonance frequency of the modified semi submersible platforms decreased compared to the unmodified semi submersible platform in addition the pels with shear moduli greater than 5 105 g 5 105 n m2 and k p of 2 28 10 6 m2 show the minimum heave motion response 5 1 4 effect of pel intrinsic permeability to determine the effect of the permeability on the heave motion five permeability pel values were considered k p 2 28 10 5 2 28 10 6 2 28 10 7 2 28 10 8 and 2 28 10 9 m2 with shear moduli of g 5 106 and 5 105 n m2 figs 14 and 15 illustrate the effect of the pel permeability on the heave rao of the modified semi submersible platform the results reveal that alteration of the intrinsic permeability decreases the resonance frequency for permeabilities less than k p 2 28 10 7 m2 k p 2 28 10 7 m2 the peak value of the rao increases because of the decrease in the velocity of the pore fluid moreover the effect of reduced permeability of the material with a softer shear modulus on the curves obtained for the heave rao fig 14 is more visible than in the case of the material with a stiffer shear modulus fig 15 table 4 also shows the heave motion responses of the modified semi submersible platform with various pels category b and semi submersible without pels it is clear that the heave motion response and resonance frequency of the modified semi submersible platform decreased compared with unmodified semi submersible platform the minimum heave motion response for the modified semi submersible platform occurred at permeabilities exceeding 2 28 10 7 m2 k p 2 28 10 7 m2 5 1 5 effect of pel thickness to estimate the effect of the pel thickness on the heave motion response four thicknesses were selected d pel 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 m figs 16 and 17 and table 5 on increasing the thickness of the pel with a stiff shear modulus and a high permeability g 5 106 n m2 and k p 2 28 10 6 m2 the peak value of the rao decreased slightly while for the pels with a soft shear modulus and low permeability g 5 104 n m2 and k p 2 28 10 8 m2 the peak value of the rao increased table 5 also shows the heave motion responses and resonance frequency of the modified semi submersible platforms with various pels in category c and the unmodified semi submersible it is clear that the heave motion response and resonant frequency of the modified semi submersible platform decreased compared with unmodified semi submersible moreover the heave motion response did not change with the change in layer thickness it can be concluded that a small thickness is more suitable for the modified semi submersible platform because of its lighter weight and lower cost the summary of the analysis results showed that using a layer of pel at the bottom of the pontoons of the semi submersible platform reduces the heave motion response for all of the considered states moreover the resonance frequency ω ω n of rao curves of the modified semi submersible platform occurs in the range of 0 1 0 21 rad s wherein these ranges the values of jonswap spectrum with the aforementioned characteristics are zero thus the risk of creating a resonance phenomenon in the modified semi submersible platforms are eliminated from the heave response spectrum ensuring the safety of the platform fig 18 depicts an example of a heave response spectrum for the modified semi submersible platform when d pel 0 5 m k p 2 28 10 6 m2 and g 5 106 n m2 6 sensitivity analysis to determine the performance of the modified semi submersible platform in different sea conditions its heave response spectrum was estimated under six different sea wave conditions as presented in table 6 the wave load was expressed using the jonswap spectrum fig 19 liu et al 2016 travanca and hao 2017 the modified semi submersible platform with pel of d pel 0 5 m k p 2 28 10 6 m2 and g 5 106 n m2 was considered and the results were compared with the unmodified semi submersible platform figs 20 25 the percentage of the heave motion response reduction of the modified semi submersible platform under different wave conditions compared to the unmodified semi submersible platform is graphically illustrated in fig 26 it can be seen that by attaching pels at the bottom of the pontoons of the semi submersible platform the heave motion response can be further improved by 33 06 for load case c2 to 47 9 for load case c1 therefore the pel is an appropriate system to reduce heave motion response and increase of the safety of the semi submersible platform under the different wave conditions 7 conclusion semi submersible platforms are among the main types of floating platforms in offshore structures being developed globally to obtain oil and gas resources in deeper waters the conventional semi submersible platforms experience large heave motion responses which can limit drilling operations and damage risers and mooring systems therefore the main objective of the present study was to investigate a new approach for reducing the heave motion response of a semi submersible platform for this purpose poroelastic layers pels were added to the bottom of the pontoons of a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform referred to as a modified semi submersible platform while the deck area draught center of mass and center of buoyancy of the platform maintained unchanged the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform was solved semi analytically using the eigenfunction expansion method eem the adequacy of the semi analytically method was verified against experimental data available for a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform comparing the results with the heave motion response of the unmodified semi submersible platform demonstrated a significant reduction in the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform indeed the pels not only reduced the heave motion response but also lowered the resonant frequency moreover the effects of the permeability shear modulus and thickness of the pels on the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform were evaluated as a result the pel characteristics showed an effective influence on the heave motion response behavior overall the introduced approach can offer a worthy way of reducing the heave motion responses of semi submersible platforms considering the pel s low weight and low cost in addition it is recommended that further studies be conducted that investigate pel s ease of operability in applications this paper can serve as a benchmark for future work that consists of validating the proposed approach by applying to either further floating platform such as spar or tension leg platforms tlp in order to reduce their motions it is also desirable to extend the study to include the application of similar materials such as styrene butadiene rubber sbr and nitrile butadiene rubber nbr as they are suitable materials for sea water nearly low cost and low weight it should be noted that in this study only the semi analytical studies were performed to further show the effectiveness of the proposed approach it is recommended that the experimental and numerical studies are

22011,this paper describes an efficient and applicable approach to decrease the heave motion response of a semi submersible platform by introducing poroelastic layers pels at the bottom of its pontoons this study was carried out utilizing a semi analytical method based on eigenfunction expansion which involves determining the added mass damping related hydrodynamic force and heave motion response the adequacy of the semi analytical method was verified by applying it to a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform whose heave response amplitude operator was extracted and compared with available experimental data the extracted value and available data showed close agreement furthermore the effectiveness of the pels attached at the bottom of the gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform and the effect of pel characteristics such as the thickness intrinsic permeability and elasticity on reducing heave motion response were evaluated comparing the results with the studied gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform without pels indicated that the application of pels could considerably reduce the heave motion response and nearly eliminate the risk of creating a resonance phenomenon in the semi submersible platforms in different sea wave conditions the approach introduced in this study could be a suitable pathway to improve the performance of semi submersible

floating platform which is used predominantly for drilling and extraction of oil and or natural gas from deep waters this platform has a simple geometry consisting of a hull mooring and riser systems the hull is characterized by a deck columns pontoons and braces and plays the main role in wave response the platform can be classified as a particular type of watercraft because 70 85 of its hull is located underwater the distinguishing features of a semi submersible platform are its large deck area payload capacity equal resistance to waves winds and currents and ability to support mooring systems the conventional semi submersible platform offers motion with six degrees of freedom namely surge sway yaw heave pitch and roll its heave motion response is significantly larger than the other platform types such as spar platforms and tension leg platforms due to its small water plane and draft the small damping of this platform which is predominantly hydrodynamic damping due to wave radiation also increases its heave motion response the large heave motion of a semi submersible platform often limits its drilling operations and may damage the risers and mooring systems therefore it is necessary to improve the heave motion responses of such systems and ensure to shift their natural heave frequency away from the frequencies of daily waves many researchers have attempted to improve the heave motion responses of semi submersible platforms by employing different techniques such as optimizing the geometrical shape akagi and ito 1984 clauss and birk 1996 birk and clauss 2001 birk

wang 2003 many types of flexible materials with different properties exist poroelastic materials being one example poroelastic materials are flexible and can be deformed by fluid flow due to their porous structures poroelastic analysis is applicable to isotropic and anisotropic systems containing pores of a variety of shapes and filled with fluids berryman 2010 2011 2013 biot 1941 was the first to theoretically propose soil consolidation models which calculate the settling behaviors of structures in fluid saturated porous systems the application of this theory is mostly wave propagation in geologic structures kanaun et al 2018 the poroelastic materials are generally applied in various fields such as geotechnics dams cavities and cracks hydrology biomechanics tissue mechanics cell mechanics and micromechanics cowin 1999 dormieux et al 2006 cowin and doty 2007 giraud et al 2012 moeendarbary et al 2013 cheng 2016 wang 2017 hadzalic et al 2019 kanaun 2019 in the context of sea hydrology numerous researchers have investigated the effects of wave interactions with poroelastic seabed and breakwaters yamamoto 1983 and lee et al 2002 theoretically investigated sea wave induced behavior of a coulomb damped poroelastic seabed of infinite and finite thicknesses the interaction between a small amplitude water wave propagating in a channel with constant depth and a horizontal poroelastic bed was analytically studied by huang and song 1993 using a methodology employing three decoupled helmholtz equations lee and lan 2002 analytically studied the interactions between waves and a poroelastic seabed of infinite depth jeng and cha 2003 conducted experiments to determine the dynamic soil behavior of a porous seabed with nonlinear waves on wave induced pore pressure in addition they investigated the effective stresses in the porous seabed zhou et al 2011 analytically developed a new solution for the response of a wave induced multi layered poroelastic seabed using biot s equations lan and lee 2010 suggested using biot s theory to determine the behavior of a highly permeable breakwater by considering the breakwater of a single submerged rectangular poroelastic specimen in sea water they analytically evaluated the reflection transmission and energy dissipation caused by monochromatic propagating waves for this breakwater the resulting values of the wave reflection and transmission coefficients agreed well with the experimental data obtained by huang and lin 1997 lan et al 2011 used analyses and experiments to obtain wave scattering results for a series of poroelastic submerged breakwaters they determined the porosities of various elastic materials the analytical and experimental methods yielded values that were in close agreement to comprehend wave transformation and thereby the effects of poroelastic material on wave scattering and energy dissipation lan et al 2012 theoretically discussed wave interactions with two adjacent submerged breakwaters made of poroelastic material using biot s theory and an eigenfunction matching method in addition lan et al 2013 analyzed wave interactions with closely spaced poroelastic submerged breakwaters using a theoretical approach employing the eigenfunction approximation method lan and hsu 2014 analytically investigated wave interactions with a double layer composite poroelastic submerged breakwater based on biot s theory and the eigenfunction matching technique this structure consisted of two layers of different poroelastic materials that were fully attached to each other and the effects of the flexible composite submerged permeable breakwater on the scattering and energy dissipation were evaluated however no research has been reported on systems employing floating platforms containing poroelastic layers pels to minimize their motions therefore this study conducted in an attempt to introduce the novel approach of using pels in a semi submersible platform to decrease its heave motion response to this end a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform modified with pels at the bottom of its pontoons in deep water was considered a semi analytical method utilizing eigenfunction expansion method eem was developed for solving heave motion response problem the exciting forces added mass damping coefficient and stiffness were calculated to determine the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform to estimate these parameters the region around the platform was divided into five separate subregions each subregion had its own governing equations with appropriate boundary conditions bcs the governing equations for the respective subregions could be solved by satisfying the relative dynamic and kinematic bcs the continuity and momentum equations whose formulations were based on related theories served as the governing equations for the pel region these equations were solved simultaneously to satisfy the interface bcs between two adjacent subregions the unknown coefficients derived by using the eem were solved numerically ultimately the one degree of freedom 1 dof equation of heave motion for the modified semi submersible platform was solved and the results were compared with unmodified semi submersible platform moreover the effects of the thickness intrinsic permeability and elasticity of the pel on the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform were investigated to determine whether the proposed approach offers a practical means of reducing the heave motion responses of such systems the remainder of this paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 describe the models and equations employed in this study section 4 presents the results in detail and describes their significance in the context of the research objectives section 5 performs the sensitivity analysis for the modified semi submersible platform in different sea wave conditions section 6 discusses and summarizes the main findings of this study 2 theoretical formulation in this study a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform was modified by introducing a layer of poroelastic in the lower part of its pontoons the semi submersible platform was assumed to be located at a water depth of h 1 under a monochromatic dominant small amplitude wave train propagating in the x direction it was assumed that the fluid was incompressible inviscid and irrotational as well as the pel was homogeneous isotropic and saturated the schematic shape of this completely symmetric semi submersible platform is illustrated in fig 1 the cartesian coordinates were selected on the free surface of the sea and the origin was located at the center of the semi submersible with the z axis oriented vertically upward and the x axis oriented horizontally along the pontoons in this study the problem of the heave motion response was solved semi analytically in order to understand and give physical meaning to the results of the parameters of the pels attached in the semi submersible platform the governing equations for the water waves and the pel were the two sets of equations used to semi analytically solve the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible 2 1 governing equations of water waves the fluid can be described in terms of velocity potential as expressed in eq 1 wu et al 2004 1 φ x y z t re ϕ x y z e i ω t where re is the real part of the complex expression i 1 is the imaginary unit and ϕ is the spatial part of the velocity potential satisfying the laplace equation for three dimensional conditions eq 2 2 2 ϕ 0 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 where x y z in linear problems a fully three dimensional solution is sought by separating the variables eq 3 3 ϕ x y z w x y z z substitution of this form into laplace s equation yields 4 1 w d 2 w d x 2 d 2 w d y 2 1 z d 2 z d z 2 k n 2 d 2 z d z 2 k n 2 z 0 and where k n is an arbitrary parameter that shows the eigenvalues in the relevant region and determined by the bcs 5 1 w d 2 w d x 2 d 2 w d y 2 1 x d 2 x d x 2 k n 2 1 y d 2 y d y 2 ξ n 2 6 d 2 x d x 2 ξ n 2 x 0 and d 2 y d y 2 k n 2 ξ n 2 y 0 since the modified semi submersible is located under a monochromatic small amplitude wave in the x direction the geometry does not vary in the y direction in this case it is necessary to consider a solution that is periodic in the y direction and independent of the geometry we can look for solutions of w x y in the form of eq 7 7 w x y x x e i ℓ y where ℓ k n 2 ξ n 2 for oblique waves ξ n k n cos θ and ℓ k n sin θ thereby k n cos θ k n 2 ℓ 2 linton and mciver 2001 in this study ℓ equals zero because of θ 0 therefore although the semi submersible platform was three dimensional the problem was solved as a two dimensional problem and the effect of the pontoons width and columns diameter in y direction was just considered as a constant value in calculating the added mass damping coefficient and exciting force explained in section 3 in a linear problem for a wave train approaching to a floating structure the fluid structure interaction problem can be divided into two parts one as the diffraction of the incident wave train due to the fixed body which produces a scattered wave field it means that it is partially reflected and partially transmitted and the other as the radiation of the body forced to oscillate in the absence of the incident wave train therefore the velocity potential can be expressed as the summation of the three potentials consisting of incident wave diffracted and radiated potentials linton and mciver 2001 the incident wave potential was calculated assuming a linear harmonic wave in the absence of a platform it was solved using the laplace equation and their related bcs eq 8 8 ϕ i i a g ω cosh k z h 1 cosh k h 1 exp i k x the superposed diffracted waves with the incident waves will develop the scattered wave field which will apply forces on the structure to oscillate thus the radiation potential is calculated by assuming the oscillation of the structure in the absence of waves linton and mciver 2001 due to the small amplitude of the harmonic waves the radiation potential can be expressed using eq 9 9 φ r l re i ω a r l ϕ r l x z where ϕ r l is the spatial part of the velocity potential in the mode l in this study the induced motion of the platform could be assumed to be small because of the small wave amplitude so the interaction between the oscillation modes was ignored therefore only the heave motion response was evaluated and the l index was ignored while calculating the radiation potential to calculate the governing equations of water waves half of the semi submersible platform was considered due to its symmetry and divided into subregions i ii 1 iii and iv the laplace equation served as the governing equation for these subregions this equation was solved by satisfying the bcs illustrated in fig 2 the equation for the radiation potential in each subregion of the modified semi submersible platform was obtained using separation of variables for the laplace equation and their related bcs eq 10 14 10 ϕ 1 r n 1 a 1 n e

be evaluated according to the direction of wave propagation the governing equations of subregion ii 2 fig 2 were solved using the mass conservation and momentum equations of the pel the equation of mass conservation for this material is based on verruijt s equation and the state equation for the pore fluid eq 21 verruijt 1969 21 p t 1 n β u n γ where u d t and d is equal to d ξ i χ j and γ d t d t is the vector of the fluid velocity dependent on the poroelastic material the momentum equations for the pel were obtained using biot s theory biot 1956 and expressed as eqs 22 and 23 22 1 n ρ w τ 1 n n 1 ρ w p 1 n n ρ s ρ w u t c a γ t n ν k p γ n 2 c f k p γ γ and 23 1 ρ w p u t s γ t n ν k p γ n 2 c f k p γ γ where s 1 c a is the virtual mass coefficient and τ was determined using hook s law eq 24 24 τ σ x τ z x τ x z σ z 2 g ξ x μ 1 2 μ ε g χ x ξ z g χ x ξ z 2 g χ z μ 1 2 μ ε furthermore ε d is the volume strain of the elastic solid and g is expressed as follows the right hand sides of eqs 22 and 23 include four component forces where the first two are inertial forces the third is proportional to the relative velocity of the pore fluid and is known as the laminar resistance force and the final component is the turbulent resistance force the term γ γ represents a nonlinear mechanism that can be replaced by a linear mechanism that consumes the same value of energy in one wave period according to lorentz s supposition of equivalent work as reported by sollitt and cross 1973 eq 25 25 t t t f ω γ γ d t d t t t n ν k p γ n 2 c f k p γ γ γ d t d therefore for a homogenous and isotropic pel the linear friction factor can be expressed as eq 26 26 f n υ ω k p n 2 c f ω k p t t t γ γ γ d t d t t t γ γ d t d where is the volume of the pel by substituting eq 26 into eqs 22 and 23 the momentum conservation of the pel can be expressed as shown in eqs 27 and 28 27 1 n ρ w τ 1 n n 1 ρ w p 1 n n ρ s ρ w u t c a γ t ω f γ and 28 1 ρ w p u t s γ t f ω γ due to the periodic wave motion the response of the semi submersible platform induced by waves can be presented as a periodic function thus γ is given by eq 29 29 γ 1 i ω ρ w q p ω 2 ρ w d q s i f consequently the equations for the submerged pel can be converted into three partial differential equations pdes with respect to ξ χ and p respectively eq 30 and 31 30 2 ϑ 1 2 ϑ 2 2 ϑ 3 ξ χ 0 and 31 2 ϑ 1 2 ϑ 2 p 0 here 32 ϑ 1

remaining unknown coefficients appearing in all the equations were calculated with the aid of their related bcs illustrated in fig 3 and the eigenfunction expansion method described in section 3 3 solving procedure as seen in section 2 the simultaneous equations contained a total of 19 unknown coefficients including a 1 n a 4 n b 2 n b 4 n c 2 n d 1 n a d 6 n a and d 1 n b d 6 n b these coefficients were determined by applying matrix equations obtained using the interface bcs between two adjacent subregions fig 3 the developed eigenfunction theory was used to estimate the coefficients of the pdes this technique is commonly used to solve wave radiation and scattering problems linton and mciver 2001 this method is related to the fourier integral and involves applying infinite series of separated eigenfunctions for the velocity potential to find a particular solution of a differential equation according to this theory if there are two pdes such that z n θ n z n 0 and z m θ m z m 0 on one boundary h j z h j 1 so that both satisfy the same bcs while they are not equal to each other θ n θ m then the pdes are orthogonal eq 46 46 z n z m h j h j 1 z n z z m z d z 0 integrating the inner product of two orthogonal eigenfunctions on the common boundary constitutes the eem in the present study the unknown coefficients of the simultaneous equations were first derived using the eem and the related vertical bcs then the coefficient matrix was formed eq 47 the unknown coefficient matrix were solved numerically using the lower upper decomposition method 47 s i j n a 1

motion response 3 1 linear friction coefficient the linear friction coefficient is another important parameter that must be determined after calculating the unknown coefficients in this study it was computed using a flowchart fig 4 firstly an initial value of the linear friction coefficient was considered next by solving the unknown coefficients the vectors of the fluid velocity and pressure of the pel were calculated and their real parts were substituted into eq 26 last the difference between the two linear friction coefficients in the consecutive process was computed if their relative difference had the required accuracy the calculation process was complete otherwise the computations were repeated a 1 relative residual was considered to be a significant difference between the linear friction coefficients 3 2 heave motion equation the approach employed in this study involved calculating the heave motion of the modified semi submersible platform the heave motion was calculated by solving the 1 dof equation eq 48 the components of the 1 dof equation were the exciting force added mass coefficient damping coefficient and stiffness 48 m m ω ℑ c ω ℑ k ℑ f e ω where f e ω is the exacting force and ℑ is rigid body motion to calculate the exciting force haskind s method can be applied according to this method the summation of the diffracted and incident wave

y z s 1 the hydrodynamic stiffness of the semi submersible platform can be defined by eq 57 57 k ρ g a w 4 convergence and verification since the eem applies infinite series of eigenvalues first of all the convergence of the modified semi submersible platform with pel should essentially be investigated then its heave motion response is estimated using the developed method and the adequacy of the analytical model is verified against available experimental data 4 1 evaluation of solution convergence due to the evanescent wave series the convergence of problem solved using the eem needed to be evaluated by determining the number of modes for this purpose the added mass and damping coefficient of the modified gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform with pels were evaluated for two wave frequencies of 0 19 and 0 3 rad s the peak frequencies of the modified semi submersible platform which were selected as examples of the wave frequencies in interval 0 1 to 1 2 against mode numbers of 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 the input information for the modified gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform with pels were substituted into the extracted equations the relevant quantities are h 1 1000 m d 22 5 m s 20 5 m s 1 13 m a 40 28 m r c 6 45 m l c 27 36 m l p 20 91 m c f 0 2 c a 0 015 μ 0 333 ρ s 2650 kg m3 ρ w 1010 kg m3 ν 1 12 10 6 m2 s and β 4 35 10 10 m2 n g 5 106 n m2 and two intrinsic permeabilities including k p 2 28 10 6 and k p 2 28 10 8 m2 as seen in table 1 and figs 5 and 6 the convergence was observed to occur for approximately 20 modes in each case 4 2 verification of developed analytical solution to verify the adequacy of the analytical model the mentioned input parameters of the gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform without pels were substituted into the extracted equations the analytical results obtained for the response amplitude operator rao of the heave motions were compared with the available experimental data reported by clauss et al 2002 the experimental data were achieved using a model on a 1 81 scale in a wave flume with a length of 80 m width of 4 m and water depth of 1 5 m under rogue and monochromatic waves comparison of the heave rao for both the analytical solution and the experimental data are shown in fig 7 the numerical simulations obtained using the timit software developed by clauss et al 2002 are also plotted in this figure demonstrating close agreement among the results 5 numerical results and discussion in the next step the effectiveness of pels installed at the bottom of the gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform on decreasing heave motion response were evaluated which are described in the following sections 5 1 pel in this study the effects of flexibility permeability and thickness of the pel installed at the bottom of the pontoons of the gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform were investigated it was assumed that the platform s center of mass center of buoyancy and deck area were always constant and that it was stable firstly the effect of the linear friction coefficient of the pel on the heave motion of the mentioned platform was evaluated then the behaviors of the added mass damping coefficient and exciting force were determined for different shear modulus and intrinsic permeability values subsequently the heave rao and heave motion response eq 58 were computed for all cases listed in table 2 and under random waves with the jonswap spectrum eq 59 a significant wave height of 11 92 m a zero up crossing period of 10 8 s with a maximum height of 25 63 m and a crest elevation of 18 5 m 58 s s ω r a o 2 s j m 0 s 0 s s ω d ω a n d 2 s s 4 m 0 s 59 s j ω a ˆ h s 2 ω 5 ω p 4 exp 1 25 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 τ 2 ω p 2 where s j is the jonswap spectrum in this spectrum if ω ω p then τ is equal to 0 07 otherwise τ is equal to 0 09 and a ˆ is given by 60 a ˆ 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 where γ in this study is equal to 3 3 chakrabarti 1987 to examine the effectiveness of pels to improve the performance of the semi submersible platform the reduction ratio was introduced as eq 61 61 ℜ ℏ o r i g i n ℏ p e l ℏ o r i g i n 100 where ℏ o r i g i n is the heave motion response of the semi submersible platform without pels and ℏ p e l is the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform with pels 5 1 1 effect of linear friction coefficient to determine the effect of the linear friction coefficient of the pel on the behavior of the heave motion for the semi submersible platform three linear friction coefficients were considered in the extracted equations a linear friction coefficient when the turbulent drag is 0 2 c f 0 2 a linear friction when the turbulent drag is zero c f 0 and a linear friction coefficient with a constant value of 1 0 f 1 it was assumed that g 5 104 n m2 k p 2 28 10 8 m2 the thickness was 0 5 m and the values of the other parameters were the same as those listed in table 2 to investigate the effect of this parameter the heave rao curve was evaluated because this curve is extracted by the parameters such as added mass damping coefficient and exciting force so it would be a suitable assessment fig 8 illustrates the variation in the heave rao with respect to the angular wave frequency for all three cases it was obvious that the difference between c f 0 and c f 0 2 only occurred for the peak value of the heave rao while a significant difference was noted between the case with the linear friction coefficient 1 0 and the other cases thus in this study the linear friction coefficient with turbulence drag of 0 2 was taken into account in the equations in order to more accuracy of the results 5 1 2 added mass damping and exciting force the behaviors of the added mass damping coefficient and exciting force of the modified semi submersible platform were evaluated fig 9 illustrates the variation in the non dimensional added mass with respect to the non dimensional angular wave frequency for the modified semi submersible platform for varying shear modulus and permeability values it is clear that the added mass increases upon the introduction of the pel in addition the values of the added mass for the modified semi submersible platform with various kinds of pel are nearly the same for non dimensional angular frequencies higher than approximately 0 45 according to eq 62 the natural frequency of the modified semi submersible platform is decreased by increasing the added mass so it makes far off from the dominant wave frequencies 62 ω n k m m ω the variation in the non dimensional damping coefficient with the non dimensional angular wave frequency for the modified semi submersible platform with various kinds of pels is illustrated in fig 10 it is evident that the properties of the pels affect the damping coefficient the damping coefficient for the pels with a shear modulus of 5 104 n m2 and permeability of 2 28 10 8 m2 is almost zero because of the small motions of the pore fluid with increasing shear modulus or permeability the damping coefficient increases compared to that of the unmodified semi submersible platform in addition a sudden decrease in the damping coefficient is evident for all pels after which the damping coefficients equal zero fig 11 shows the variation in the non dimensional of exciting force with respect to the non dimensional angular wave frequency for the modified platform with various pels it is obvious that the force increases after introducing the pels for non dimensional angular wave frequencies higher than 0 18 0 3 however the trend differs for lower frequencies moreover the forces of the modified semi submersible platform with various pels are approximately the same for non dimensional angular frequencies higher than approximately 0 58 5 1 3 effect of pel shear modulus figs 12 and 13 illustrate the heave motion rao versus the angular wave frequency for four kinds of materials with shear moduli g of 5 107 5 106 5 105 and 5 104 n m2 and permeabilities of k p 2 28 10 6 and 2 28 10 8 m2 it is clear that utilizing the pels in the semi submersible platform reduces the resonance frequency compared with the unmodified semi submersible platform for a shear modulus of less than 5 105 n m2 g 5 105 n m2 the decrease in the resonance frequency is evident for both permeabilities because of the increased motion of the elastic solid pore fluid and frictional resistance in addition the peak value of the rao increases due to the decreased compression of the pore fluid and consequently the decreased damping moreover for shear moduli greater than 5 106 g 5 106 n m2 the peak value of the rao is nearly equal for both permeabilities the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform with aforementioned pel properties category a is compared with the unmodified semi submersible platform in table 3 which shows that the heave motion response and resonance frequency of the modified semi submersible platforms decreased compared to the unmodified semi submersible platform in addition the pels with shear moduli greater than 5 105 g 5 105 n m2 and k p of 2 28 10 6 m2 show the minimum heave motion response 5 1 4 effect of pel intrinsic permeability to determine the effect of the permeability on the heave motion five permeability pel values were considered k p 2 28 10 5 2 28 10 6 2 28 10 7 2 28 10 8 and 2 28 10 9 m2 with shear moduli of g 5 106 and 5 105 n m2 figs 14 and 15 illustrate the effect of the pel permeability on the heave rao of the modified semi submersible platform the results reveal that alteration of the intrinsic permeability decreases the resonance frequency for permeabilities less than k p 2 28 10 7 m2 k p 2 28 10 7 m2 the peak value of the rao increases because of the decrease in the velocity of the pore fluid moreover the effect of reduced permeability of the material with a softer shear modulus on the curves obtained for the heave rao fig 14 is more visible than in the case of the material with a stiffer shear modulus fig 15 table 4 also shows the heave motion responses of the modified semi submersible platform with various pels category b and semi submersible without pels it is clear that the heave motion response and resonance frequency of the modified semi submersible platform decreased compared with unmodified semi submersible platform the minimum heave motion response for the modified semi submersible platform occurred at permeabilities exceeding 2 28 10 7 m2 k p 2 28 10 7 m2 5 1 5 effect of pel thickness to estimate the effect of the pel thickness on the heave motion response four thicknesses were selected d pel 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 m figs 16 and 17 and table 5 on increasing the thickness of the pel with a stiff shear modulus and a high permeability g 5 106 n m2 and k p 2 28 10 6 m2 the peak value of the rao decreased slightly while for the pels with a soft shear modulus and low permeability g 5 104 n m2 and k p 2 28 10 8 m2 the peak value of the rao increased table 5 also shows the heave motion responses and resonance frequency of the modified semi submersible platforms with various pels in category c and the unmodified semi submersible it is clear that the heave motion response and resonant frequency of the modified semi submersible platform decreased compared with unmodified semi submersible moreover the heave motion response did not change with the change in layer thickness it can be concluded that a small thickness is more suitable for the modified semi submersible platform because of its lighter weight and lower cost the summary of the analysis results showed that using a layer of pel at the bottom of the pontoons of the semi submersible platform reduces the heave motion response for all of the considered states moreover the resonance frequency ω ω n of rao curves of the modified semi submersible platform occurs in the range of 0 1 0 21 rad s wherein these ranges the values of jonswap spectrum with the aforementioned characteristics are zero thus the risk of creating a resonance phenomenon in the modified semi submersible platforms are eliminated from the heave response spectrum ensuring the safety of the platform fig 18 depicts an example of a heave response spectrum for the modified semi submersible platform when d pel 0 5 m k p 2 28 10 6 m2 and g 5 106 n m2 6 sensitivity analysis to determine the performance of the modified semi submersible platform in different sea conditions its heave response spectrum was estimated under six different sea wave conditions as presented in table 6 the wave load was expressed using the jonswap spectrum fig 19 liu et al 2016 travanca and hao 2017 the modified semi submersible platform with pel of d pel 0 5 m k p 2 28 10 6 m2 and g 5 106 n m2 was considered and the results were compared with the unmodified semi submersible platform figs 20 25 the percentage of the heave motion response reduction of the modified semi submersible platform under different wave conditions compared to the unmodified semi submersible platform is graphically illustrated in fig 26 it can be seen that by attaching pels at the bottom of the pontoons of the semi submersible platform the heave motion response can be further improved by 33 06 for load case c2 to 47 9 for load case c1 therefore the pel is an appropriate system to reduce heave motion response and increase of the safety of the semi submersible platform under the different wave conditions 7 conclusion semi submersible platforms are among the main types of floating platforms in offshore structures being developed globally to obtain oil and gas resources in deeper waters the conventional semi submersible platforms experience large heave motion responses which can limit drilling operations and damage risers and mooring systems therefore the main objective of the present study was to investigate a new approach for reducing the heave motion response of a semi submersible platform for this purpose poroelastic layers pels were added to the bottom of the pontoons of a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform referred to as a modified semi submersible platform while the deck area draught center of mass and center of buoyancy of the platform maintained unchanged the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform was solved semi analytically using the eigenfunction expansion method eem the adequacy of the semi analytically method was verified against experimental data available for a typical gva4000 drilling semi submersible platform comparing the results with the heave motion response of the unmodified semi submersible platform demonstrated a significant reduction in the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform indeed the pels not only reduced the heave motion response but also lowered the resonant frequency moreover the effects of the permeability shear modulus and thickness of the pels on the heave motion response of the modified semi submersible platform were evaluated as a result the pel characteristics showed an effective influence on the heave motion response behavior overall the introduced approach can offer a worthy way of reducing the heave motion responses of semi submersible platforms considering the pel s low weight and low cost in addition it is recommended that further studies be conducted that investigate pel s ease of operability in applications this paper can serve as a benchmark for future work that consists of validating the proposed approach by applying to either further floating platform such as spar or tension leg platforms tlp in order to reduce their motions it is also desirable to extend the study to include the application of similar materials such as styrene butadiene rubber sbr and nitrile butadiene rubber nbr as they are suitable materials for sea water nearly low cost and low weight it should be noted that in this study only the semi analytical studies were performed to further show the effectiveness of the proposed approach it is recommended that the experimental and numerical studies are

22012,this paper addresses a filter backstepping based neural adaptive formation control of leader following auvs with model uncertainties and external disturbances in three dimensional space for this purpose a formation control strategy is proposed by employing filter backstepping technique to avoid the explosion of complexity in the standard backstepping design this technique can not only significantly simplify the design process of the backstepping controller but also reduce the influence of high frequency measurement noise then multi layer neural networks are incorporated with an adaptive robust technique to deal with the uncertain dynamics approximation errors and nonlinear disturbances induced by the waves and ocean currents a lyapunov based stability analysis is provided to guarantee that the tracking errors for all the auvs are uniformly ultimately bounded uub finally simulation results for a group of auvs are provided to demonstrate the tracking performance of the designed formation controller keywords autonomous underwater vehicles formation control adaptive control filter backstepping neural network 1 introduction in recent years considerable effort has concentrated on the motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs due to their extensive applications in ocean engineering such as autonomous exploration geological sampling surveillance oceanographic mapping rescue operations minesweeping and deep sea archaeology aguiar and hespanha 2007 many different solutions have also been designed for navigation and motion control of a single auv to increase the degree of autonomy elhaki and shojaei 2018 2019 wang et al 2019a in elhaki and shojaei 2018 a target tracking control strategy has been proposed for underactuated auvs with a prescribed performance reference elhaki and shojaei 2019 designed a robust neural network approximation based output feedback tracking control scheme for auvs with actuators saturation then a command flter based adaptive neural tracking control algorithm has been introduced in wang et al 2019a however the formation control of multiple auvs is more constructive in the actual applications due to its greater robustness and higher efficiency compared with a single vehicle in fact the aim of formation control of multiple auvs is to design the tracking controller to let each auv maintain relative distance from its neighbors from a review of the literature there exist numerous popular methods about the formation control of auvs including the behavior based control takahashi et al 2004 virtual structure technique beard et al 2001 and leader following strategies das et al 2002 fahimi 2007 luca et al 2008 through the investigation of available works it turns out that the leader following strategy was widely employed in the design of vehicles formation due to its reliability and simplicity cui et al 2010 shojaei 2015 based on available existing works attractive results on the formation tracking control of multiple leader following auvs have been proposed in yang and gu 2007 breivik et al 2008 do 2012 peng et al 2011 2013 shojaei 2016a millan et al 2014 yan et al 2019 reference yang and gu 2007 has designed a nonlinear formation keeping and mooring control scheme for multiple auvs in breivik et al 2008 a guided leader following formation control strategy has been proposed by utilizing the integrator backstepping method and cascade theory reference do 2012 has presented a formation control scheme for the underactuated surface ships with elliptical shape approximation and limited communication ranges a robust adaptive formation control scheme has been proposed in peng et al 2011 where the neural networks have been employed to deal with the model uncertainties and environmental disturbances in order to reduce computational complexities in peng et al 2011 a dynamic surface based leader follower formation control scheme has been proposed in peng et al 2013 then an observer based adaptive formation control scheme for a group of underactuated surface vehicles usvs with limited torque was presented in shojaei 2016a where a nonlinear saturated observer is designed to estimate the velocities of the followers attractive results on formation control of multiple underactuated auvs with communication delays have been introduced in millan et al 2014 yan et al 2019 recently the sliding mode control technique has been very popular and widely applied in the area of formation control owing to its strong robustness and simplicity in meng et al 2012 a robust adaptive sliding mode controller was designed by utilizing the lyapunov s direct approach reference wu et al 2015 has proposed a mixed fuzzy sliding mode formation controller for multiple auvs where a backstepping based fuzzy logic system was designed to deal with uncertainties then an integral terminal sliding mode formation controller was proposed in asif et al 2016 using leader following strategy to reduce the chattering of control system reference sun et al 2018 designed a parameter estimation based formation controller by adopting a continuous pi function to replace the signum function further a neuro based sliding mode control strategy without needing the velocities of leader was designed in wang et al 2019b other recent reviews of the sliding mode formation control can be founded in zhao et al 2019 wang et al 2019c although many good results on the formation control have been obtained it is very essential to point out that most of the aforementioned works focus on the formation control problem only in the horizontal plane however in three dimensional space the number of degree of freedom without control inputs increases and the kinetic model of auvs is more complex which makes the design of formation controller for multiple auvs more challenging as a result there exist only a few works related to this control problem in ma and zeng 2015 a distributed formation control strategy has been designed however it is not suitable for the underactuated vehicles which restricts its real application reference qi and cai 2018 proposed a three dimensional formation controller by employing the nonlinear small gain method for multiple underactuated auvs but both the model uncertainties and external disturbances were not taken into consideration in order to handle the uncertain dynamics and unknown disturbances a kind of neural adaptive formation controllers was designed in shojaei 2016b 2019 for underactuated auvs in three dimensional space however it is very complicated to compute the derivative of virtual control variables then a three dimensional formation control strategy by utilizing first order filter was proposed in qi and cai 2017 but the first order filter has a certain amplification effect on the noise which may reduce the stability of control system thus motivated by the above presented discussion a three dimensional formation control strategy for leader following multiple auvs is proposed by employing filter backstepping approach multi layer neural networks and adaptive technique the main novelties and contributions of this paper are listed as follows i this paper addresses the formation control problem for multiple underactuated auvs in three dimensional space which is rarely investigated in the previous works ii filter backstepping technique is utilized in the design of proposed formation controller to reduce the computational complexities of the standard backstepping approach and filter out the high frequency measurement noise iii multi layer neural networks and adaptive techniques are incorporated to deal with the uncertain dynamics external disturbances and approximation errors the rest of this paper is organized as follows the problem formulation is presented in the next section in section 3 the design of a neural adaptive formation controller is proposed section 4 states the main result of this paper then section 5 provides simulation examples to the demonstrate effectiveness of the designed formation controller finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 problem formulation 2 1 model

formation control system from a review of anderson et al 2009 and references therein this technique has been widely applied to estimate nonlinear functions due to its easy adjustment and fast update

the three dimensional formation controller is proposed by utilizing the filter backstepping approach neural networks and an adaptive technique to avoid the complex derivative operations in the standard backstepping approach the control signals are passed through the following filter farrell et al 2009 11b κ c f 2 ζ ω n κ c f ω n 2 κ c f κ c where κ c u i c q i c r i c t denotes the vector of the desired control signals and κ c f u i c f q i c f r i c f t is the vector of filtered control signals ω n and ζ are the parameters of filter where ω n 0 and 0 ζ 1 then we consider the tracking

learning ability therefore the controller parameters are set to k i ξ 50 k i α 30 k i β 30 k i u 20 k i q 20 k i r 20 γ w i u 120 γ w i q 120 γ w i r 120 γ v i u 100 γ v i q 100 γ v i r 100 γ ρ i u 100 γ ρ i q 100 γ ρ i r 100 δ w i u δ w i q δ w i r 0 05 δ w i r 0 05 δ v i q δ v i r 0 02 δ ρ i u δ ρ i r δ ρ i r 0 02 furthermore it is essential to note that although large control gains can improve the tracking performance they can not be infinite due to the fact that the large control gains will cause large initial control signals which may reduce the system stability secondly the number of neurons are determined by the method of multiple attempts which is introduced in ma and zeng 2015 as a result we select 8 neurons in this simulation and the nn activation function is selected as σ x 1 1 e x where the initial values of nn estimated matrices w ˆ i k and v ˆ i k k u q r are set to zero thirdly to filter out the high frequency noise in the designed formation control system the shear frequency parameter is provided as ω n 2 π f 20 r a d s where f is the operation frequency of a real auv which is usually 3 4 h z and the damping ratio is given by ζ 0 95 to ensure that the formation control system is overdamped 5 1 control performance the simulation results are shown as figs 5 9 fig 5 shows the formation tracking results and it can be observed that the desired formation is well established although suffering from unmodeled dynamics and unknown disturbances figs 6 and 7 show that all formation tracking errors smoothly converge to a small neighborhood of the origin which verifies the effectiveness of the designed formation controller fig 8 depicts the learning performance of multi layer nn it can be observed that the uncertainties can be accurately compensated by the proposed nn technique at last the control inputs are illustrated in fig 9 which indicates that the high frequency measurement noise can be effectively filtered out by using the filter backstepping technique and the system chattering can be suppressed in the presented controller 5 2 comparative analysis in this section a comparison with a backstepping method qi and cai 2017 and a sliding mode controller smc bian and xiang 2019 is proposed in addition to comprehensively evaluate control performance of the designed controller we choose two disturbance models one is a frequently used bias model shown as 57 the other is the following low frequency deterministic signal peng et al 2011 2013 59 τ e u i t 3 cos 0 4 t cos t 0 3 sin 0 3 t cos 0 8 t 3 τ e v i t 0 4 cos 0 1 t τ e w i t 0 4 sin 0 1 t τ e q i t 2 sin 0 8 t cos 0 2 t τ e r i t 2 sin 0 6 t cos 0 4 t remark 3 there are mainly two approaches to establish the disturbance model τ e k i t one is a frequently used bias model such as first order markov process shown as 57 this model can be employed to describe external disturbances owing to the second order wave drift ocean currents wind unmodeled dynamics and measurement noise the other is a sum of some sinusoidal signals such as 59 which are usually employed to describe slowly time varying disturbances far from the water surface both the above disturbance models are widely applied in the area of motion control for auvs simulation results are illustrated as figs 10 13 figs 10 and 12 depict the ranges and bearing errors between leader and follower 1 which illustrates that the proposed controller has better tracking performance than backstepping algorithm and smc whether under disturbance models 57 or 59 figs 11 and 13 show comparisons of the control inputs under two disturbance models it can be observed that the control system chattering can be suppressed especially in fig 11 the designed controller is robustest owing to the fact that the high frequency measurement noise is eliminated by command filter which can improve the stability of control system in addition the proposed algorithm does not rely on any hydrodynamic damping information which is more easily implemented into actual applications compared with methods in qi and cai 2017 and bian and xiang 2019 6 conclusion in this brief the three dimensional formation control of leader following multiple auvs has been addressed a filter backstepping technique has been effectively utilized to design a formation tracking controller it can not only greatly reduce the inherent computational explosion in standard backstepping method but also filter out the effects of high frequency noise furthermore all the model uncertainties are compensated by multi layer nns and adaptive control techniques the closed loop stability of the formation control system is demonstrated by using lyapunov s direct approach then simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the designed three dimensional formation control strategy in addition comparative analysis evaluated the superiority of the proposed controller compared with current algorithms ultimately it is necessary to point out that the practical experiment is not carried out owing to the limitation of our existing experimental condition for the future work a real experimental verification of the designed controller should be implemented and it is of great interest to extend this work to the distributed cooperative control peng et al 2014a 2014b 2014c 2017 acknowledgments the authors acknowledge

22012,this paper addresses a filter backstepping based neural adaptive formation control of leader following auvs with model uncertainties and external disturbances in three dimensional space for this purpose a formation control strategy is proposed by employing filter backstepping technique to avoid the explosion of complexity in the standard backstepping design this technique can not only significantly simplify the design process of the backstepping controller but also reduce the influence of high frequency measurement noise then multi layer neural networks are incorporated with an adaptive robust technique to deal with the uncertain dynamics approximation errors and nonlinear disturbances induced by the waves and ocean currents a lyapunov based stability analysis is provided to guarantee that the tracking errors for all the auvs are uniformly ultimately bounded uub finally simulation results for a group of auvs are provided to demonstrate the tracking performance of the designed formation controller keywords autonomous underwater vehicles formation control adaptive control filter backstepping neural network 1 introduction in recent years considerable effort has concentrated on the motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs due to their extensive applications in ocean engineering such as autonomous exploration geological sampling surveillance oceanographic mapping rescue operations minesweeping and deep sea archaeology aguiar and hespanha 2007 many different solutions have also been designed for navigation and motion control of a single auv to increase the degree of autonomy elhaki and shojaei 2018 2019 wang et al 2019a in elhaki and shojaei 2018 a target tracking control strategy has been proposed for underactuated auvs with a prescribed performance reference elhaki and shojaei 2019 designed a robust neural network approximation based output feedback tracking control scheme for auvs with actuators saturation then a command flter based adaptive neural tracking control algorithm has been introduced in wang et al 2019a however the formation control of multiple auvs is more constructive in the actual applications due to its greater robustness and higher efficiency compared with a single vehicle in fact the aim of formation control of multiple auvs is to design the tracking controller to let each auv maintain relative distance from its neighbors from a review of the literature there exist numerous popular methods about the formation control of auvs including the behavior based control takahashi et al 2004 virtual structure technique beard et al 2001 and leader following strategies das et al 2002 fahimi 2007 luca et al 2008 through the investigation of available works it turns out that the leader following strategy was widely employed in the design of vehicles formation due to its reliability and simplicity cui et al 2010 shojaei 2015 based on available existing works attractive results on the formation tracking control of multiple leader following auvs have been proposed in yang and gu 2007 breivik et al 2008 do 2012 peng et al 2011 2013 shojaei 2016a millan et al 2014 yan et al 2019 reference yang and gu 2007 has designed a nonlinear formation keeping and mooring control scheme for multiple auvs in breivik et al 2008 a guided leader following formation control strategy has been proposed by utilizing the integrator backstepping method and cascade theory reference do 2012 has presented a formation control scheme for the underactuated surface ships with elliptical shape approximation and limited communication ranges a robust adaptive formation control scheme has been proposed in peng et al 2011 where the neural networks have been employed to deal with the model uncertainties and environmental disturbances in order to reduce computational complexities in peng et al 2011 a dynamic surface based leader follower formation control scheme has been proposed in peng et al 2013 then an observer based adaptive formation control scheme for a group of underactuated surface vehicles usvs with limited torque was presented in shojaei 2016a where a nonlinear saturated observer is designed to estimate the velocities of the followers attractive results on formation control of multiple underactuated auvs with communication delays have been introduced in millan et al 2014 yan et al 2019 recently the sliding mode control technique has been very popular and widely applied in the area of formation control owing to its strong robustness and simplicity in meng et al 2012 a robust adaptive sliding mode controller was designed by utilizing the lyapunov s direct approach reference wu et al 2015 has proposed a mixed fuzzy sliding mode formation controller for multiple auvs where a backstepping based fuzzy logic system was designed to deal with uncertainties then an integral terminal sliding mode formation controller was proposed in asif et al 2016 using leader following strategy to reduce the chattering of control system reference sun et al 2018 designed a parameter estimation based formation controller by adopting a continuous pi function to replace the signum function further a neuro based sliding mode control strategy without needing the velocities of leader was designed in wang et al 2019b other recent reviews of the sliding mode formation control can be founded in zhao et al 2019 wang et al 2019c although many good results on the formation control have been obtained it is very essential to point out that most of the aforementioned works focus on the formation control problem only in the horizontal plane however in three dimensional space the number of degree of freedom without control inputs increases and the kinetic model of auvs is more complex which makes the design of formation controller for multiple auvs more challenging as a result there exist only a few works related to this control problem in ma and zeng 2015 a distributed formation control strategy has been designed however it is not suitable for the underactuated vehicles which restricts its real application reference qi and cai 2018 proposed a three dimensional formation controller by employing the nonlinear small gain method for multiple underactuated auvs but both the model uncertainties and external disturbances were not taken into consideration in order to handle the uncertain dynamics and unknown disturbances a kind of neural adaptive formation controllers was designed in shojaei 2016b 2019 for underactuated auvs in three dimensional space however it is very complicated to compute the derivative of virtual control variables then a three dimensional formation control strategy by utilizing first order filter was proposed in qi and cai 2017 but the first order filter has a certain amplification effect on the noise which may reduce the stability of control system thus motivated by the above presented discussion a three dimensional formation control strategy for leader following multiple auvs is proposed by employing filter backstepping approach multi layer neural networks and adaptive technique the main novelties and contributions of this paper are listed as follows i this paper addresses the formation control problem for multiple underactuated auvs in three dimensional space which is rarely investigated in the previous works ii filter backstepping technique is utilized in the design of proposed formation controller to reduce the computational complexities of the standard backstepping approach and filter out the high frequency measurement noise iii multi layer neural networks and adaptive techniques are incorporated to deal with the uncertain dynamics external disturbances and approximation errors the rest of this paper is

the three dimensional formation controller is proposed by utilizing the filter backstepping approach neural networks and an adaptive technique to avoid the complex derivative operations in the standard backstepping approach the control signals are passed through the following filter farrell et al 2009 11b κ c f 2 ζ ω n κ c f ω n 2 κ c f κ c where κ c u i c q i c r i c t denotes the vector of the desired control signals and κ c f u i c f q i c f r i c f t is the vector of filtered control signals ω n and ζ are the parameters of filter where ω n 0 and 0 ζ 1 then we consider the tracking

substituting 17 and 18 into 16 signal ξ i e can be finally rewritten as 19 ξ i e k i ξ ξ i e e x i ξ i u i e next to stabilize the error signal ξ i e we select a lyapunov function as v i ξ ξ i e 2 2 whose derivative satisfies 20 v i ξ ξ i e ξ i e k i ξ ξ i e 2 e x i ξ i ξ i e u i e and the error dynamics in surge direction for i th auv can be constructed as 21 m 11 i u i e m 11 i u i e χ i u m 22

of the designed controller in 44 is that it relies on the auv masses m 11 i m 55 i and m 66 i which are very difficult to be accurately measured in real time under the complex underwater environments this point will be discussed in the future remark 2 the adaptive law 45 based on tracking errors may lead to poor transient one effective solution is to employ the predictor based control technique

environment and proposed in this section to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed formation control strategy for this simulation model parameters of followers are given in wang et al 2018 meanwhile we assume that the auv parameters are completely unknown and auvs are affected by the following ocean disturbances takahashi et al 2004 57 d t t d t k ω here d t τ e u i t τ e v i t τ e w i t τ e q i t τ e r i t t is the vector of ocean disturbances t diag 100 100 100 100 100 is the time constant matrix k diag 8 3 3 4 4 denotes gain parameter matrix and ω denotes the white noise whose largest amplitude is ω 1 then we suppose that there exist five auvs governed to compose a formation and four auvs are defined as followers i 1 2 3 4 the other one i 5 is defined as leader which is commanded to track the following trajectory 58 x d t x g r cos ω r t y d t y g r sin ω r t z d t z g ω r t where r 20 ω r π 25 x g y g 0 and z g 5 the desired formation is 1 3 π 12 π 6 t 2 3 π 12 π 6 t 3 3 π 12 π 6 t 4 3 π 12 π 6 t the initial positions of followers are given by x 1 0 30 m y 1 0 15 m z 1 0 0 m x 2 0 30 m y 2 0 5 m z 2 0 0 m x 3 0 30 m y 3 0 5 m z 3 0 0 m x 4 0 30 m y 4 0 15 m z 4 0 0 m and the initial orientations of all followers are set to zero here a design guideline is provided to choose the controller parameters firstly fast tracking performance can be obtained by increasing the control gains k i ξ k i α k i β k i u k i q and k i r at the same time the adaptive gains γ w i k γ v i k and γ ρ i k k u q r should be larger than control gains to realize the fast learning ability therefore the controller parameters are set to k i ξ 50 k i α 30 k i β 30 k i u 20 k i q 20 k i r 20 γ w i u 120 γ w i q 120 γ w i r 120 γ v i u 100 γ v i q 100 γ v i r 100 γ ρ i u 100 γ ρ i q 100 γ ρ i r 100 δ w i u δ w i q δ w i r 0 05 δ w i r 0 05 δ v i q δ v i r 0 02 δ ρ i u δ ρ i r δ ρ i r 0 02 furthermore it is essential to note that although large control gains can improve the tracking performance they can not be infinite due to the fact that the large control gains will cause large initial control signals which may reduce the system stability secondly the number of neurons are determined by the method of multiple attempts which is introduced in ma and zeng 2015 as a result we select 8 neurons in this simulation and the nn activation function is selected as σ x 1 1 e x where the initial values of nn estimated matrices w ˆ i k and v ˆ i k k u q r are set to zero thirdly to filter out the high frequency noise in the designed formation control system the shear frequency parameter is provided as ω n 2 π f 20 r a d s where f is the operation frequency of a real auv which is usually 3 4 h z and the damping ratio is given by ζ 0 95 to ensure that the formation control system is overdamped 5 1 control performance the simulation results are shown as figs 5 9 fig 5 shows the formation tracking results and it can be observed that the desired formation is well established although suffering from unmodeled dynamics and unknown disturbances figs 6 and 7 show that all formation tracking errors smoothly converge to a small neighborhood of the origin which verifies the effectiveness of the designed formation controller fig 8 depicts the learning performance of multi layer nn it can be observed that the uncertainties can be accurately compensated by the proposed nn technique at last the control inputs are illustrated in fig 9 which indicates that the high frequency measurement noise can be effectively filtered out by using the filter backstepping technique and the system chattering can be suppressed in the presented controller 5 2 comparative analysis in this section a comparison with a backstepping method qi and cai 2017 and a sliding mode controller smc bian and xiang 2019 is proposed in addition to comprehensively evaluate control performance of the designed controller we choose two disturbance models one is a frequently used bias model shown as 57 the other is the following low frequency deterministic signal peng et al 2011 2013 59 τ e u i t 3 cos 0 4 t cos t 0 3 sin 0 3 t cos 0 8 t 3 τ e v i t 0 4 cos 0 1 t τ e w i t 0 4 sin 0 1 t τ e q i t 2 sin 0 8 t cos 0 2 t τ e r i t 2 sin 0 6 t cos 0 4 t remark 3 there are mainly two approaches to establish the disturbance model τ e k i t one is a frequently used bias model such as first order markov process shown as 57 this model can be employed to describe external disturbances owing to the second order wave drift ocean currents wind unmodeled dynamics and measurement noise the other is a sum of some sinusoidal signals such as 59 which are usually employed to describe slowly time varying disturbances far from the water surface both the above disturbance models are widely applied in the area of motion control for auvs simulation results are illustrated as figs 10 13 figs 10 and 12 depict the ranges and bearing errors between leader and follower 1 which illustrates that the proposed controller has better tracking performance than backstepping algorithm and smc whether under disturbance models 57 or 59 figs 11 and 13 show comparisons of the control inputs under two disturbance models it can be observed that the control system chattering can be suppressed especially in fig 11 the designed controller is robustest owing to the fact that the high frequency measurement noise is eliminated by command filter which can improve the stability of control system in addition the proposed algorithm does not rely on any hydrodynamic damping information which is more easily implemented into actual applications compared with methods in qi and cai 2017 and bian and xiang 2019 6 conclusion in this brief the three dimensional formation control of leader following multiple auvs has been addressed a filter backstepping technique has been effectively utilized to design a formation tracking controller it can not only greatly reduce the inherent computational explosion in standard backstepping method but also filter out the effects of high frequency noise furthermore all the model uncertainties are compensated by multi layer nns and adaptive control techniques the closed loop stability of the formation control system is demonstrated by using lyapunov s direct approach then simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the designed three dimensional formation control strategy in addition comparative analysis evaluated the superiority of the proposed controller compared with current algorithms ultimately it is necessary to point out that the practical experiment is not carried out owing to the limitation of our existing experimental condition for the future work a real experimental verification of the designed controller should be implemented and it is of great interest to extend this work to the distributed cooperative control peng et al 2014a 2014b 2014c 2017 acknowledgments the authors acknowledge

22013,pile driving procedure and efficiency is not only affected by soil parameters but also by pile geometry including the pile shape and taper angle several important effective factors in pile driving are hammer blow counts penetration and velocity developed in the pile during driving in this paper the drivability of different pile geometries was investigated by performing field tests and numerical analyses based on finite difference method four steel piles have driven by hammer blows and pile driving analyser pda was used to record the pile dynamic responses the time histories of the pile head force settlement and velocity have been continuously monitored under each hammer blow during the driving tests the numerical analysis with simulating the soil pile system in the driving process has been also investigated and compared with the obtained results from the field tests parametric studies have been performed on effective parameters on driving such as pile geometry and embedded length the results indicate that the pile geometry such as tapered and semi tapered can offer better drivability performance with decreasing cumulative hammer blow counts increasing the piles velocity and settlement and the efficiency of the driving operation these are remarkable in pile driving scenario keywords pile driving pile geometry field tests tapered pile finite difference method 1 introduction the advantageous of the tapered piles have been known for many years which applied both in the various offshore and onshore projects including structures bridges harbors ports etc to transfer different types of loads to the ground due to their efficiency simplicity and mainly driven to the certain designed depths using hammers in these situations it is of interest to drive piles more easily and efficiently into the ground in addition to soil properties the pile driving procedure is also affected by the pile geometry including the taper angle the pile shape can be varied from a straight sided cylindrical shape to a conical type which is required to develop an accurate and practical model for recognition and investigation of factors affecting pile driving the velocity settlement and stresses developed in the pile during driving due to the hammer impact are important to be controlled and understood in recent decades different studies have been performed to evaluate the advantages of tapered piles form the bearing capacity viewpoints in comparison to the cylindrical piles which is more important for engineering practice the results of these researches indicated that the tapered piles can resist more loads than the cylindrical piles ghazavi et al 1997 wei and el naggar 1998 paik et al 2003 ghazavi 2007 2008 ghazavi and ahmadi 2008 liu et al 2012 using wave equation analysis and laboratory tests sakr et al 2007 studied the comparison of frp reinforced concrete piles with conventional pile materials during pile driving and bearing capacity and stated that the tapered geometry had considerable effects on drivability efficiency and static resistance ghazavi and tavasoli 2012 have performed numerical analysis by flac3d 2004 to study the effects of the taper angle and geometry on pile driving based on mabsout and tassoulas 1994 and mabsout et al 1995 which increased the velocity and settlement of piles to investigate how the bearing capacity of tapered piles varies with the soil condition and the taper angle of the piles the chamber tests on the cylindrical and tapered piles with taper angles of 1⁰ and 1 5⁰ have been performed by paik et al 2013 han et al 2016 performed static and dynamic load tests on a closed ended steel pipe pile driven in a multilayered soil to understand the responses of such pile subjected to axial loads and examined the performance of existing pile design methods determined the ultimate base and limit shaft resistances of the test pile measured in the static load test and estimated from dynamic load tests tavasoli and ghazavi 2016 performed experimental and numerical analyses on the drivability of hollow piles with different geometries and proved that driving hollow tapered piles was easier due to better drivability performance and lower energy consumption than concrete filled piles of the same volume and length by the application of the theoretical method based on cavity expansion method cem in conjunction with the wave equation sormeie and ghazavi 2018 evaluated the behavior of driven tapered piles into cohesive soils indicating that tapered piles were driven easier than cylindrical piles of the same length and volume additionally tavasoli and ghazavi 2018 investigated the wave propagation and ground vibrations due to the drivability of non uniform cross section piles using field testing and numerical analysis and concluded that the application of such piles decreases the noise pollution applying of tapered piles considered in practice from the viewpoint of allowable ground vibrations most of the above studies compared the bearing capacity of tapered and cylindrical piles in the present paper the drivability of four different pile geometries including tapered and semi tapered piles has been investigated by field tests and numerical analyses using finite difference method parametric studies have been also performed on pile geometry and embedded length to determine how effective it was on the offshore pile driving performance the results measured from field tests and predicted by numerical analyses have been compared and discussed 2 field testing on tapered pile driving the drivability of four piles with a length of 2 50 m and different geometries was considered in the field testing the geometries of these piles having an equal material volume and the driving setup in the field tests are represented in figs 1 and 2 pile t is fully tapered with 1 12 taper angle and pile c is cylindrical pile c t has a top cylindrical part with 1 m followed by a tapered part with 1 5 m length pile t c consists of a top tapered segment with 1 m length and a lower cylindrical segment with 1 5 m length these closed ended piles were made of st37 steel astm a252 2001 and the geometry and their properties are presented in table 1 not only the embedded depth to pile diameter ratio is more than 10 df dp 10 but also the length to diameter ratio of each pile is greater than 10 lp dp 10 where df dp and lp are respectively the depth of foundation and the diameter and length of the pile thus these pre casted piles can be assumed to behave as deep foundations it is important to mention that minimum necessary conditions for their behavior as piles were satisfied which they can be applied in both offshore and onshore projects and as these ratios increase their behavior tends to be more realistic moreover these filed tests are only real available tests in the literature which were performed on the drivability of tapered and semi tapered piles and the obtained results may be extended to real piles and used in practice to perform the tests all closed ended piles were first driven in the soil by several hammer striking up to a depth of 0 5 m and then hit by a hammer continuously the single acting hammer with a 2 95 kn weight falling from a distance of 1 m was used to install all piles to the embedded length of 0 5 m 2 m the pile driver was made by different parts such as a mounting frame hammer and electric motor which lifted the ram to the selected falling height and the hammerhead fell to induce an impact on the hammer components the site of field testing was located in the vicinity of the vardavard river tehran iran in order to recognize soil characteristics and parameters including soil gradation and classification shear strength parameters relative density etc the site investigation was performed prior to the beginning of the field tests by drilling some boreholes up to 10 m depth fig 3 the soil classified as the poorly graded sand sp according to the unified classification system was homogeneous figs 4 and 5 the results of several preformed in situ and laboratory tests including spt soil gradation size moisture water content relative density and direct shear test for determining internal friction angle and cohesion were presented in table 2 the pile driving analyzer pda with two accelerometers and strain transducers was used to record induced pile velocity and strain the pda has recorded the pile dynamic responses per blow such as velocity and force signals obtained by sensors attached to the pile to measure forces and velocities in the pile sensors were attached along the pile shaft at 0 324m from the pile head in two opposite directions during pile driving and under each hammer blow the time histories of the pile head force and velocity were monitored continuously to investigate the drivability of such piles of the same length and volume with various geometries including tapered cylindrical and t c and c t forms under hammer blows all tests were repeated several times and compared with each other to control the results of the experiments and prevent and reduce any uncertainties and errors in the tests the driving records for all piles in terms of cumulative hammer blow counts versus the penetration depth are illustrated in fig 6 the cumulative hammer blow counts for pile c and pile t were 206 and 132 respectively also t c and c t piles were penetrated with 153 blows and 139 respectively it was observed that among all tests the cylindrical pile required more blow counts for installation and the tapered and semi tapered pile had driven by lower hammer impacts to better explain this problem it can be attributed to the shape of the pile geometry so that the normal and shear stiffnesses of the pile s toe and shaft are reduced by the inclined tapered angle with decreasing the shaft stiffness of piles the soil resistance around the piles also decreases and the pile penetrates the soil better also in cylindrical piles the end resistance of the pile is concentrated together at the tip of the pile whereas in tapered and semi tapered piles the resistance is distributed according to the pile geometry as the pile penetrates the soil this resistance increases but it is lower than that of the cylindrical pile in pile driving analysis some parameters such as velocity and settlement must be measured for further calculations and signal matching for this purpose it is important to check the agreement between the measured force and the velocity impedance equals to v ep a cp where cp is wave velocity a is the cross sectional area of the pile and ep is the elastic modulus of pile material fig 7 represents the signal matching results for piles c t c t and t c as seen the force and velocity impedance at the beginning of impact agreed well for both piles and the reasonable signal matching between measured velocity impedance and force for all piles was obtained up to about 22 ms the force and velocity impedance signals have been deviated after the first reflection of the wave because of stress waves reflecting along the pile shaft due to geometry effect and soil parameters such as taper soil pile interface properties soil elastic modulus etc therefore the deviation has occurred between the force and velocity impedance after reaching the first peak the variation of the pile velocity versus time is indicated in fig 8 for the final hammer blow demonstrating an interesting phenomenon when the hammer strikes the pile head a compressive stress wave travels down and up its shaft at the speed which is a function of the elastic modulus and mass density the impact induces a force and a particle velocity at the pile top this wave is dissipated during the time because of material and radiation damping based on obtained results the settling times in which the velocity of piles t and c starts to dissipate are 23 8 and 26 4 ms respectively in fact piles t and t c have greater radiation damping than piles c and c t this is because of greater pile soil surface areas existing around the top parts of piles t and t c it could be noticed that the oscillation of tapered pile is greater than other piles and the wave propagation in piles are disappeared at earlier times in the current field tests penetration values per blow for all piles were recorded while each pile was installed to the different depths the effects of embedded length on the piles settlement and velocity results for piles c t and c t at depths of 1 1 5 and 2 m are presented in figs 9 and 10 the residual settlements of piles c t t c and c t are 9 59 11 17 10 21 and 10 80 mm respectively as a result the settlement and velocity of piles t and t c are greater than those of piles c and c t the increase of velocity and residual set per blow results in better pile penetration and economical saving this is because of the toe resistance decreases and shaft damping increases with increasing the taper angle the only source of deformation in the cylindrical pile is normal deformation whereas due to the wedging effect of tapered and semi tapered piles energy dissipation occurs through both shear and normal deformation in the soil the effect of pile geometry on the drivability performance is investigated by comparing the measured data from field tests first the required cumulative hammer blows are calculated for each pile driven into the ground to a certain depth fig 11 then the pile blow counts are divided by the number of blows required to drive pile c to the same depth this ratio states that tapered and semi tapered piles have a better drivability performance with an energy reduction ranging 25 60 compared with the cylindrical pile of the same volume and length it is noted that the pile toe cross section of cylindrical pile is constant and thus the tip resistance remains approximately constant while the pile is penetrating into the ground in tapered piles the pile shaft gradually expands the cavity and thus a gradual soil resistance increase exists with the pile penetration into the ground sormeie and ghazavi 2018 also due to the increase in efficiency the noise and air pollution caused by the operation of the pile driving machines have also decreased tavasoli and ghazavi 2018 3 tapered pile driving analysis by finite difference method in this section the tapered and cylindrical piles tested in the field are simulated using flac3d based on finite difference method this simulation was described by ghazavi and tavasoli 2012 all piles have identical material volumes and been driven to different penetration depths up to 2 m the three dimensional pile soil system has been modeled with 517492 grids fig 12 the roller supports and quiet boundary conditions were used in distance of 10d from the pile axis to have free movement in the vertical direction and absorb transmitting waves in the model boundaries as mentioned by kulhmeyer and lysmer 1973 also the interface elements were used at the pile soil border to allow slip between the pile and the soil along the shaft and toe due to attaching sensors along the pile shaft at 0 324 m from the pile head in the field tests this point was selected to monitor and measure time histories of the pile force settlement and velocity the dynamic responses of piles were calculated and compared with the measured field testing results during the analysis for the last hammer blow the pile driving analysis is performed to control the pile driving process which applied for dynamic pile monitoring and dynamic load testing the main purpose of the numerical simulation in pile driving is the contribution of the safety and economical installation and the assessment of the pile bearing capacity with capwap based on the theory of stress wave propagation in piles in this case the outputs of the pile driving analyses are considered as inputs to the capwap the numerical simulation of pile driving can be modeled and performed from the beginning to the end of the pile driving process however since the bearing capacity calculation is performed after the final pile installation the last strike is of particular importance and its results are the basis for subsequent analysis therefore the numerical analysis of the pile driving is usually performed for the last single strike the pile mechanical properties and soil parameters used in numerical analyses are presented in table 2 the pile behaviour is elastic the soil is assumed to obey the mohr coulomb failure criteria it is important to mention that the various nonlinear models built into flac3d are intended primarily for use in quasi static loading or in dynamic situations where the response is mainly monotonic an appropriate model for dynamic soil structure interaction would capture the hysteresis curves and energy absorbing characteristics of real soil in particular energy should be absorbed from each component of a complex waveform composed of many component frequencies such a model may not yet exist in full three dimensional form however even standard elastic plastic models such as mohr coulomb can produce curves of apparent damping and modulus versus cyclic strain that resemble results from laboratory tests over limited strain ranges it can be seen that such a model exhibits an evolution of modulus and damping that can be matched to experimental results over limited ranges of cyclic strain itasca 2002 therefore based on the above explanations and the results of the numerical verification of pile driving process with flac3d carried out by ghazavi and tavasoli 2012 tavasoli and ghazavi 2016 2018 2019a b it can be represented that the application of this model has concluded the accurate and reasonable results and can be used to model the pile driving process also the properties of interface elements such as strength and deformation parameters are presented in table 3 where ϕs and cs are internal friction angle and cohesion of soil pile interface elements ks and kn are shear and normal stiffness of soil pile contact surface flac3d provides interfaces that are characterized by coulomb sliding and or tensile and shear bonding which have the properties of friction cohesion dilation and normal and shear stiffnesses tensile and shear bond strength the constitutive model is defined by a linear coulomb shear strength criterion that limits the shear force acting at an interface node normal and shear stiffnesses tensile and shear bond strengths and a dilation angle that causes an increase in effective normal force on the target face after the shear strength limit is reached it is important to note that these parameters are considered based on the proportion of surrounding soil properties by conducting different try and error analysis to achieve the best satisfactory agreement between the measured and calculated results the field tests on driving were simulated using flac3d model and the results were calculated figs 13 and 14 indicate the results of pile head behavior such as force settlement and velocity time history computed for cylindrical and tapered piles and compared with measured results the calculated results were evaluated assuming certain soil parameters along the pile shaft and toe in order to get a reasonable quality of verification between measured and calculated results of tapered and cylindrical pile driving therefore the process of pile driving was modeled in a three dimensional environment using flac3d and a satisfactory fit between predicted numerical data and measured data was obtained in this section the effect of geometric parameters of non uniformly shaped piles on driving has been investigated on pile t and pile c t these piles were fully embedded with the lengths of 16 m for comparison all piles have the same lengths and material volumes fig 15 all piles geometry and soil properties initial and boundary conditions interface elements parameters hammer force function were assumed and considered based on ghazavi and tavasoli 2012 in the pile driving process the load due to hammer impacts is fast enough to create an undrained behavior in the clay layers therefore the short term clay parameters in undrained conditions were considered in the numerical analysis based on ghazavi and tavasoli 2012 and tavasoli and ghazavi 2016 2018 and 2019 here the variation of geometric parameters and its effects on pile driving responses such as the diameter of the tip db the taper angle a the length of the pile lp and the length of the tapered section lt have been investigated the effective parameters used in the analysis of piles t and c t are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively the method of selecting parameters in each step was based on the fact that one of the factors such as length diameter and the angle was constant and other parameters were calculated assuming that the volume was constant the purpose of this study was to investigate and determine the optimum parameters in the design of the pile geometry in pile driving procedure for performing parametric analysis on the tapered and semi tapered pile driving two cases were considered a the length of all piles was the same equal to 16 m and the bottom diameter was 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 m thus by considering the tapered angles equal to 1 0 7 and 0 4 the top diameters of piles were respectively calculated b the pile tip diameter 0 20 m with the tapered angle equal to 1 was assumed to be constant for all piles thus the lengths of piles were considered 10 8 13 2 and 21 0 m respectively according to this description and the variation of the pile parameters the results of the velocity and settlement of pile t are illustrated in figs 16 and 17 as observed the settlement and velocity of the pile decrease by increasing the average diameter of the pile and constant pile length this is due to the taper angle reduction it is noted that by decreasing the pile tapered angle the shear and normal stiffness increase along the pile shaft and at the toe as reported by sormeie and ghazavi 2018 thus the pile soil interaction along the shaft and at the toe was added this increases the soil resistance to the pile penetration and thus the velocity and settlement of the pile decrease also with increasing the taper angle the settling time decreases and it does not take a long time to reduce the velocity in fact the amplitude vibrations and oscillation of the pile are more with increasing of the pile taper angle therefore assuming the volume is uniform the obtained results indicate that as the diameter of the pile toe decreases or the pile tapered angle increases the velocity and ultimate penetration of the pile also increase figs 18 and 19 illustrate the time variation of pile settlement and velocity for various pile lengths in case b as seen with increasing the pile length the velocity and settlement of piles decrease this is due to increasing of the contact surface between the pile and soil thereby the soil mobilized resistance against the pile penetration increases by increasing the pile fixity in the soil therefore the pile velocity and penetration decrease when the pile length becomes longer the results of parametric studies on pile c t with a tip diameter of 0 20 and 0 30 m are shown in figs 20 23 all 16 m long piles have a variation of tapered section length lt to the total pile length lp is 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 by comparing the calculated results it is concluded that the velocity and settlement of the pile with a diameter of 0 20 m were more than the pile diameter of a 0 30 m in fact by decreasing the pile tip diameter in piles c t the velocity and settlement increase also by increasing lt lp the settlement and velocity increase and the results approach the velocity and final penetration of the fully tapered pile therefore compared with a cylindrical pile the use tapered pile the velocity and settlement increase resulting in increasing the efficiency of pile driving as mentioned before piles c t and c t were installed from o 5 m 2 m under multi hammer blows in the field tests and their responses were recorded and presented in figs 9 13 in this section the effect of embedded length on tapered pile driving behavior is investigated using numerical analyses to do that it is assumed that values of embedded length lem of pile t are 0 5 and 0 75 of lp and then piles are subjected to a hammer blow figs 24 and 25 present the variation of settlement time and velocity time of pile t for various lem lp the residual set of pile t is 0 409 m and 0 289 m for lem lp 1 2 and 3 4 respectively both of which are greater than those of fully embedded condition 4 conclusions the drivability of various pile geometries was studied by performing field tests and numerical analyses the piles with the same volume and length were driven into the ground by hammer impacts to record induced pile velocity and strain the pda was used with two accelerometers and strain transducers attached to the pile shaft beneath the pile head the time histories of the pile head force and velocity were recorded continuously during the driving tests and under each hammer blow then the pile soil system was modeled for cylindrical and tapered pile using flac3d and the results were compared with those of field tests parametric studies have been performed on different effective parameters on driving such as pile geometry and embedded length the results indicate that 1 in terms of ease in pile driving efficient various piles are ranked t c t t c and c the velocity and settlement of the pile t are greater than those of c t t c and c 2 piles t c t and t c require lower cumulative hammer blow counts and energy consumption from 25 to 60 than those required for pile c to be fully driven 3 with increasing the pile embedded length the settlement and velocity of driven piles decrease as expected 4 having piles of the same volume and length for piles t with decreasing the pile tip diameter which corresponds to increasing the taper angle the velocity and ultimate settlement of piles also increase in general due to easy penetration lower hammer counts time saving and lower driving stress tapered and semi tapered piles may be superior to cylindrical piles of the same lengths and material volumes also the main purpose of this research was to investigate the drivability of tapered and semi tapered piles in comparison to the cylindrical piles with field testing in the sandy zone and numerical modeling in the sandy and clayey soils based on obtained results it is reasonable that the results are on the safe side for driven piles increasing the driving efficiency and can be

22013,pile driving procedure and efficiency is not only affected by soil parameters but also by pile geometry including the pile shape and taper angle several important effective factors in pile driving are hammer blow counts penetration and velocity developed in the pile during driving in this paper the drivability of different pile geometries was investigated by performing field tests and numerical analyses based on finite difference method four steel piles have driven by hammer blows and pile driving analyser pda was used to record the pile dynamic responses the time histories of the pile head force settlement and velocity have been continuously monitored under each hammer blow during the driving tests the numerical analysis with simulating the soil pile system in the driving process has been also investigated and compared with the obtained results from the field tests parametric studies have been performed on effective parameters on driving such as pile geometry and embedded length the results indicate that the pile geometry such as tapered and semi tapered can offer better drivability performance with decreasing cumulative hammer blow counts increasing the piles velocity and settlement and the efficiency of the driving operation these are remarkable in pile driving scenario keywords pile driving pile geometry field tests tapered pile finite difference method 1 introduction the advantageous of the tapered piles have been known for many years which applied both in the various offshore and onshore projects including structures bridges harbors ports etc to transfer different types of loads to the ground due to their efficiency simplicity and mainly driven to the certain designed depths using hammers in these situations it is of interest to drive piles more easily and efficiently into the ground in addition to soil properties the pile driving procedure is also affected by the pile geometry including the taper angle the pile shape can be varied from a straight sided cylindrical shape to a conical type which is required to develop an accurate and practical model for recognition and investigation of factors affecting pile driving the velocity settlement and stresses developed in the pile during driving due to the hammer impact are important to be controlled and understood in recent decades different studies have been performed to evaluate the advantages of tapered piles form the bearing capacity viewpoints in comparison to the cylindrical piles which is more important for engineering practice the results of these researches indicated that the tapered piles can resist more loads than the cylindrical piles ghazavi et al 1997 wei and el naggar 1998 paik et al 2003 ghazavi 2007 2008 ghazavi and ahmadi 2008 liu et al 2012 using wave equation analysis and laboratory tests sakr et al 2007 studied the comparison of frp reinforced concrete piles with conventional pile materials during pile driving and bearing capacity and stated that the tapered geometry had considerable effects on drivability efficiency and static resistance ghazavi and tavasoli 2012 have performed numerical analysis by flac3d 2004 to study the effects of the taper angle and geometry on pile driving based on mabsout and tassoulas 1994 and mabsout et al 1995 which increased the velocity and settlement of piles to investigate how the bearing capacity of tapered piles varies with the soil condition and the taper angle of the piles the chamber tests on the cylindrical and tapered piles with taper angles of 1⁰ and 1 5⁰ have been performed by paik et al 2013 han et al 2016 performed static and dynamic load tests on a closed ended steel pipe pile driven in a multilayered soil to understand the responses of such pile subjected to axial loads and examined the performance of existing pile design methods determined the ultimate base and limit shaft resistances of the test pile measured in the static load test and estimated from dynamic load tests tavasoli and ghazavi 2016 performed experimental and numerical analyses on the drivability of hollow piles with different geometries and proved that driving hollow tapered piles was easier due to better drivability performance and lower energy consumption than concrete filled piles of the same volume and length by the application of the theoretical method based on cavity expansion method cem in conjunction with the wave equation sormeie and ghazavi 2018 evaluated the behavior of driven tapered piles into cohesive soils indicating that tapered piles were driven easier than cylindrical piles of the same length and volume additionally tavasoli and ghazavi 2018 investigated the wave propagation and ground vibrations due to the drivability of non uniform cross section piles using field testing and numerical analysis and concluded that the application of such piles decreases the noise pollution applying of tapered piles considered in practice from the viewpoint of allowable ground vibrations most of the above studies compared the bearing capacity of tapered and cylindrical piles in the present paper the drivability of four different pile geometries including tapered and semi tapered piles has been investigated by field tests and numerical analyses using finite difference method parametric studies have been also performed on pile geometry and embedded length to determine how effective it was on the offshore pile driving performance the results measured from field tests and predicted by numerical analyses have been compared and discussed 2 field testing on tapered pile driving the drivability of four piles with a length of 2 50 m and different geometries was considered in the field testing the geometries of these piles having an equal material volume and the driving setup in the field tests are represented in figs 1 and 2 pile t is fully tapered with 1 12 taper angle and pile c is cylindrical pile c t has a top cylindrical part with 1 m followed by a tapered part with 1 5 m length pile t c consists of a top tapered segment with 1 m length and a lower cylindrical segment with 1 5 m length these closed ended piles were made of st37 steel astm a252 2001 and the geometry and their properties are presented in table 1 not only the embedded depth to pile diameter ratio is more than 10 df dp 10 but also the length to diameter ratio of each pile is greater than 10 lp dp 10 where df dp and lp are respectively the depth of foundation and the diameter and length of the pile thus these pre casted piles can be assumed to behave as deep foundations it is important to mention that minimum necessary conditions for their behavior as piles were satisfied which they can be applied in both offshore and onshore projects and as these ratios increase their behavior tends to be more realistic moreover these filed tests are only real available tests in the literature which were performed on the drivability of tapered and semi tapered piles and the obtained results may be extended to real piles and used in practice to perform the tests all closed ended piles were first driven in the soil by several hammer striking up to a depth of 0 5 m and then hit by a hammer continuously the single acting hammer with a 2 95 kn weight falling from a distance of 1 m was used to install all piles to the embedded length of 0 5 m 2 m the pile driver was made by different parts such as a mounting frame hammer and electric motor which lifted the ram to the selected falling height and the hammerhead fell to induce an impact on the hammer components the site of field testing was located in the vicinity of the vardavard river tehran iran in order to recognize soil characteristics and parameters including soil gradation and classification shear strength parameters relative density etc the site investigation was performed prior to the beginning of the field tests by drilling some boreholes up to 10 m depth fig 3 the soil classified as the poorly graded sand sp according to the unified classification system was homogeneous figs 4 and 5 the results of several preformed in situ and laboratory tests including spt soil gradation size moisture water content relative density and direct shear test for determining internal friction angle and cohesion were presented in table 2 the pile driving analyzer pda with two accelerometers and strain transducers was used to record induced pile velocity and strain the pda has recorded the pile dynamic responses per blow such as velocity and force signals obtained by sensors attached to the pile to measure forces and velocities in the pile sensors were attached along the pile shaft at 0 324m from the pile head in two opposite directions during pile driving and under each hammer blow the time histories of the pile head force and velocity were monitored continuously to investigate the drivability of such piles of the same length and volume with various geometries including tapered cylindrical and t c and c t forms under hammer blows all tests were repeated several times and compared with each other to control the results of the experiments and prevent and reduce any uncertainties and errors in the tests the driving records for all piles in terms of cumulative hammer blow counts versus the penetration depth are illustrated in fig 6 the cumulative hammer blow counts for pile c and pile t were 206 and 132 respectively also t c and c t piles were penetrated with 153 blows and 139 respectively it was observed that among all tests the cylindrical pile required more blow counts for installation and the tapered and semi tapered pile had driven by lower hammer impacts to better explain this problem it can be attributed to the shape of the pile geometry so that the normal and shear stiffnesses of the pile s toe and shaft are reduced by the inclined tapered angle with decreasing the shaft stiffness of piles the soil resistance around the piles also decreases and the pile penetrates the soil better also in cylindrical piles the end resistance of the pile is concentrated together at the tip of the pile whereas in tapered and semi tapered piles the resistance is distributed according to the pile geometry as the pile penetrates the soil this resistance increases but it is lower than that of the cylindrical pile in pile driving analysis some parameters such as velocity and settlement must be measured for further calculations and signal matching for this purpose it is important to check the agreement between the measured force and the velocity impedance equals to v ep a cp where cp is wave velocity a is the cross sectional area of the pile and ep is the elastic modulus of pile material fig 7 represents the signal matching results for piles c t c t and t c as seen the force and velocity impedance at the beginning of impact agreed well for both piles and the reasonable signal matching between measured velocity impedance and force for all piles was obtained up to about 22 ms the force and velocity impedance signals have been deviated after the first reflection of the wave because of stress waves reflecting along the pile shaft due to geometry effect and soil parameters such as taper soil pile interface properties soil elastic modulus etc therefore the deviation has occurred between the force and velocity impedance after reaching the first peak the variation of the pile velocity versus time is indicated in fig 8 for the final hammer blow demonstrating an interesting phenomenon when the hammer strikes the pile head a compressive stress wave travels down and up its shaft at the speed which is a function of the elastic modulus and mass density the impact induces a force and a particle velocity at the pile top this wave is dissipated during the time because of material and radiation damping based on obtained results the settling times in which the velocity of piles t and c starts to dissipate are 23 8 and 26 4 ms respectively in fact piles t and t c have greater radiation damping than piles c and c t this is because of greater pile soil surface areas existing around the top parts of piles t and t c it could be noticed that the oscillation of tapered pile is greater than other piles and the wave propagation in piles are disappeared at earlier times in the current field tests penetration values per blow for all piles were recorded while each pile was installed to the different depths the effects of embedded length on the piles settlement and velocity results for piles c t and c t at depths of 1 1 5 and 2 m are presented in figs 9 and 10 the residual settlements of piles c t t c and c t are 9 59 11 17 10 21 and 10 80 mm respectively as a result the settlement and velocity of piles t and t c are greater than those of piles c and c t the increase of velocity and residual set per blow results in better pile penetration and economical saving this is because of the toe resistance decreases and shaft damping increases with increasing the taper angle the only source of deformation in the cylindrical pile is normal deformation whereas due to the wedging effect of tapered and semi tapered piles energy dissipation occurs through both shear and normal deformation in the soil the effect of pile geometry on the drivability performance is investigated by comparing the measured data from field tests first the required cumulative hammer blows are calculated for each pile driven into the ground to a certain depth fig 11 then the pile blow counts are divided by the number of blows required to drive pile c to the same depth this ratio states that tapered and semi tapered piles have a better drivability performance with an energy reduction ranging 25 60 compared with the cylindrical pile of the same volume and length it is noted that the pile toe cross section of cylindrical pile is constant and thus the tip resistance remains approximately constant while the pile is penetrating into the ground in tapered piles the pile shaft gradually expands the cavity and thus a gradual soil resistance increase exists with the pile penetration into the ground sormeie and ghazavi 2018 also due to the increase in efficiency the noise and air pollution caused by the operation of the pile driving machines have also decreased tavasoli and ghazavi 2018 3 tapered pile driving analysis by finite difference method in this section the tapered

jetting formed by the surface closure of the first sphere more kinematic energy is transmitted to the flow forming a significantly large cavity behind the second sphere as the second sphere descends into water the cavity is elongated with a widely open water splash for different impact velocities of the second sphere the water splash shapes are obviously different owing to the pressure drop across the splash curtain after the cavity deep seal an interesting multi section cavity appears behind the second sphere due to disturbance of the bubbly wake by the first sphere when the second sphere penetrates the bubbly flow caused by the cavity collapse of the first sphere it moves relatively faster than a single sphere with the same initial impact velocity by reason of the bubble drag reduction effect which is also verified by the quantitative data of accelerations for the spheres by a digital image correlation method graphical abstract image 1 keywords two tandem spheres water entry cavity bubbles drag reduction 1 introduction water entry has been studied for several decades it is very significant in many engineering applications may 1951 may and woodhull 1948 may and woodhull 1950 richardson 1948 although water entry has been extensively investigated many problems have not been solved yet and many flow phenomena have not been revealed as well the impact of water entry causes splash on water surface and evolution of the splash depends on the object s shape atmospheric pressure surface tension etc vincent et al 2018 studied the impact force and splash evolution of diving wedges as a function of wedge opening angle a one dimensional model of the splash was proposed with gravity surface tension and aerodynamics forces being taken into account the shape of splashing was mainly related to the destabilizing venturi suction force and stabilizing force owing to surface tension marston et al 2016 studied the shape of splashing after the water entry of spheres at different atmospheric pressures gekle and gordillo 2010 described the formation of worthington jets after the water entry of circular disk and found that the velocity of ejected jets can be predicted in sphere water entry the cavity evolution after sphere water entry is varied and becomes complex due to the diversity of the interaction between the sphere and water to explore the mechanism of cavitation evolution extensive studies have been performed in this field gekle et al 2008 2010 may 1952 evaluated the effects of density and pressure of atmosphere above the water as well as the effects of velocity size and nose shape of missile on the cavity shape and energy loss shi and takuyatakami 2001 predicted the cavity evolution of water entry using a theoretical model gilbarg and anderson 1948 evaluated the effect of atmospheric pressure on cavity closure and found that surface seal mainly depends on atmospheric density and projectile velocity yan et al 2009 evaluated the cavity of water entry by combining theory calculation and experiment and complemented the asymptotic theory shi et al 2000 observed the motion of water surface splash and underwater bubbly flow by conducting experiments on high speed water entry bergmann et al 2009 investigated the collapse of cavity created by a disk impact on water surface and presented a simple model for the dynamics of cavity wei and hu 2014 2015 studied the evolution of cavity and variation in force caused by the water entry of circular cylinders with different inclined angles changes of surface characteristics of the sphere usually lead to some different interactions during water entry li et al 2019 investigated the multiphase flow during water entry of spheres with different surface wettability mansoor et al 2014 reported the cavity formation of hydrophobic sphere water entry by conducting an experiment and evaluated the effect of increasing wall on impact cavities marston et al 2012 studied the cavity variation of a heated sphere water entry and compared the difference in cavity between a heated sphere surrounded by steam and a hydrophobic sphere a theoretical description was developed by ristoff and bush 2009 to describe cavity evolution combined with experimental and theoretical investigation of the water entry of hydrophobic spheres a sphere will be subjected to tremendous unstable impact force when it first reaches a horizontal liquid surface besides the evolution of a cavity affects the motion of sphere by influencing the force on the sphere in the literature on water entry force analysis of sphere during water entry has been widely reported abraham s group abraham et al 2014 gorman et al 2014 schwalbach et al 2014 shepard et al 2014 studied the effect of impact velocity sphere density and surface wettability on the cavity evolution and impact force though the experiments of sphere water entry they found that drag coefficient is independent of sphere velocity surface tension and flow regime laminar or turbulent in the early stage of sphere water entry through numerical simulations the momentum transfer from the sphere to the adjacent liquid is the main reason of drag force truscott and techet 2009 studied the unsteady force of projectile with or without cavity formation and evaluated the lift and drag forces on spinning sphere after impact porfiri s group jalalisendi et al 2015 panciroli and porfiri 2013 verified the accuracy of particle image velocimetry piv of indirect pressure measurement in water entry and experimentally studied the three dimensional hydrodynamic loading of a rigid wedge impacting vertically on quiescent water surface compared with the hydrodynamic characteristics of single object water entry those of water entry with two objects have significant differences due to the existence of interactions between the objects a few studies have been proposed to investigate the phenomena of twin objects entering water side by side wang and wang 2010 yousefnezhad and zeraatgar 2014 lu et al 2019 more recently yun et al 2020 reported a study on oblique water entry of two tandem spheres and detailed a very interesting collision effect between the two spheres however little research has been published on vertical water entry of tandem objects so far while it is not hard to imagine that the wake of the first object will more or less affect the movement of the second one to clarify the effects between two tandem water entry objects a series of experiments on vertical water entry of two tandem spheres are conducted in present study with detailed investigation on cavity evolution movement characteristics of the two spheres 2 experimental methods the water entry experiments are carried out in a transparent water tank located in a closed laboratory free of airflow disturbance during the experiment the temperature of laboratory is maintained between 25 c and 29 c the size of water tank is 1000 mm length 700 mm width 1000 mm depth and the water depth is set as 870 mm as shown in fig 1 to ensure adequate light transmission and reduce the experimental error caused by light loss and deformation of water tank caused by static water pressure the tank is made from 15 mm thick tempered glass the spheres are launched through a direct current powered electromagnetic launcher including induction coils photoelectric gates capacitances circuit boards a voltage indicator a voltage regulator and a rail as shown in fig 2 when a sphere reaches a photoelectric gate the adjacent induction coil is triggered to be powered by the connected capacitance generating a magnetic field to drive the sphere the sphere moves forward due to gravity and inertia until it reaches the next photoelectric gate and gets accelerated again in this manner the sphere is accelerated for a few times by the induction coils and finally achieves a desired velocity the velocity of sphere is controlled by mean voltage of the capacitor group which is directly displayed on the voltage indicator the rail that used to guide the sphere s movement is calibrated to be perpendicular to the water surface using a laser level the experimental cases are listed in table 1 for cases 1 to 5 sphere i with initial impact velocity u 10 at the quiescent water surface and sphere ii with velocity u 20 upon impact on the upward jetting caused by sphere i are the first sphere and the second one in the two tandem configuration respectively the velocity of sphere i is kept around 31 0 m s and that of sphere ii varies from 44 6 m s to 16 6 m s corresponding to a velocity ratio defined as χ u u 20 u 10 varies from 1 41 to 0 54 notably cases 6 to 10 are conducted for a single sphere with initial impact velocity u 0 and use as control cases for cases 1 to 5 respectively furthermore all spheres used in the experiment are made from high carbon chromium bearing steel and their surfaces are all smooth the physical parameters of the sphere are as following density ρ s 7778 6 kg m 3 mass m 1 4 g diameter d 7 0 mm and static contact angle of water on the surface α 80 10 two high speed digital video cameras a phantom veo410l and b phantom lc111 are used to capture high quality images of whole cavity evolution and sphere trajectory till cavity pitch off to capture sufficiently crisp images for accurate analysis the trajectory of spheres the frame rate and exposure time for both cameras are set as 10 000 fps and 10 μs respectively the maximum displacement of spheres within 10 μs is 4 5 10 5 m during present experiments which is less than 1 150 of the sphere diameter the image resolutions of camera a with a 105 mm fixed focus nikon lens and camera b with a 24 85 mm nikon lens are set as 1280 400 pixels and 768 200 pixels respectively to meet the high speed acquisition both of the two cameras are set as high as the water surface and the horizontal distance from the two camera lens to the axis of the electromagnetic launcher are 2 5 m and 1 5 m respectively as shown in fig 1 note that camera a is used to capture whole cavity formation and sphere trajectory at the front view whereas camera b is used to reveal cavity formation at the side view and to confirm that the two spheres in selected tandem cases are entering into water at the same position to capture the deformation of water surface the two cameras are slightly tilted downward with a degree of about 4 fig 3 shows the cavity formation for the tandem spheres of case 3 from two different views of front and side respectively with the two high speed cameras it is found that the sphere trajectories and cavity evolutions from side view and front view are almost the same to each other and the two spheres successively enter into water almost at the same position of the initially quiescent water surface furthermore the time point when sphere i for cases 1 to 5 reaches the quiescent water surface is set as t 1 0 and the time point when sphere ii for cases 1 to 5 and the single sphere for cases 6 to 10 reach the initially quiescent water surface is set as t 2 0 arrangement of lighting sources is important for acquiring high quality photographs with high speed camera during the high speed photography experiments six lamps of jinbei ef 200 led are used as the lighting source two lamps are located behind the water tank as backlighting to provide a uniform white backdrop through light boxes the presence of backlighting specially helps to provide clear profiles of sphere and cavity furthermore other four lamps are arranged in front and side of the water tank as the foreground lighting source to illuminate the shadows formed by backlighting attention should be paid to arrangement of the foreground lighting to ensure uniform distribution of light at the trajectory as shown in fig 1 sufficient lightings with skillful arrangement during the experiments make it possible for the cameras to record very crisp images with very low exposure time and high frame rate position data of the spheres are read from each frame image using a digital image correlation dic method epps et al 2010 to acquire the position with sub pixel accuracy the translational information is fitted with a gaussian fitting curve thus an optimal solution is obtained considering both accuracy and smoothness simultaneously then velocity and acceleration of the sphere are obtained by the derivation of displacement curve for dic first a template is made using the image where the sphere is above the water surface and the size of template is about twice the diameter of the sphere then position of the sphere is extracted from the image by the cross correlation method using the template owing to lighting refraction the translational error is 0 5 pixel at the vertical direction and the error at the horizontal direction is almost negligible the shooting accuracy is 4 933 10 4 m pixel the first and second derivatives of the raw position data extracted from the high speed photography images are evaluated using a quintic spline based scheme similar to that used by epps et al 2010 the scheme weighs the roughness and error of raw position data curves as shown in fig 4 the critical error tolerance of sphere ⅰ and sphere ⅱ in typical case 3 are 5 01 10 9 and 10 8 respectively the corresponding measurement errors for two spheres are ε 1 0 24 mm and ε 2 0 33 mm respectively the error analysis process is same as that described by yun et al 2020 note that 0 24 mm 0 45 pixel so the experimental procedure has about half pixel accuracy in addition to more accurately determine the peak force during the initial impact of sphere the trajectory data of sphere before their impact on water are directly calculated using the free falling equation and those after the impact are obtained by evaluating the high speed photography images by combining the two parts of trajectories the derivatives can be evaluated again 3 results and discussion 3 1 typical cavity dynamics of two tandem spheres a typical case i e case 5 is selected to illustrate the cavity dynamics of two tandem spheres as shown in fig 5 and effect of the cavity wake by sphere i on the cavity of sphere ii are discussed fig 5 a l shows the selected image sequence for cavity formation of sphere i entering water with an initial velocity of u 10 30 6 m s in case 5 it is found that the cavity is elongated as the sphere descends into the pool because kinetic energy is transmitted from the sphere to water the cavity wall continues to expand as sphere i moves downwards the maximum cavity width appears roughly at t 1 2 5 ms and the surface curtain is also closed at this time because of a lower air pressure inside the cavity note that an upward jetting and a downward jetting inside the cavity can be observed owing to the surface closure as shown in the close up image in fig 5 c after that although the cavity continues to be elongated the width gradually shrinks because of hydrostatic pressure similar to the cavity flow phenomenon described by may 1952 the cavity gradually collapses into several feature cavity clouds at the rear end and each of them cloud subsequently evolves into a ball of bubbles with slightly downward movement as shown in fig 5 h k fig 5 l v shows the movement of sphere ii and corresponding cavity evolution in case 5 before reaching the initially quiescent water surface at about 23 6 ms later than sphere i sphere ii with u 20 16 6 m s impacts on the upward jetting water column generated by cavity deep seal of sphere i as a consequence a remarkably funnel shaped splash curtain is formed fig 5 l and m as descends under the water surface sphere ii generates a smooth cavity with the splash curtain opened widely as shown in fig 5 n and o the cavity configuration significantly changes when sphere ii passes through the region seeded with a larger number of bubbles generated by the cavity collapse of sphere i and the cavity wall of sphere ii becomes very rippled irregularly due to the complicate interaction with bubbles as shown in fig 5 p r with the descending of sphere ii and the increase of bubble disturbance distortion of the cavity increases gradually and the cavity eventually breaks in the middle as shown in fig 5 s and t after that a new cavity continues to form following sphere ii and still interacts with several clouds of bubbles left by sphere i fig 5 u and v and finally collapses several times at the rear end notably as a result of disturbance of bubble region and the randomness of sphere s falling in the water the trajectory of sphere ii is offset as shown in fig 5 v in addition it is found that an upward jetting appears in the upper half of the big cavity similar to that of deep seal for a single sphere with hydrophobic coatings aristoff et al 2010 3 2 differences in cavity configurations between sphere ii and single sphere in this section configuration of the cavity formed by sphere ii in case 1 is compared with that by a single sphere in case 6 as shown in fig 6 note that sphere ii impacts the upward jetting caused by sphere i above the water surface with an initial velocity of u 20 44 6 m s and the velocity of the single sphere impact on the quiescent water surface is u 0 44 0 m s as shown in fig 6 the cavity configurations for the two spheres are significantly different the water splash curtain formed by the single sphere is much smaller than that of spheres ii and shows a remarkable surface closure whereas the water splash curtain for sphere ii is especially large as shown in fig 6 a and b this interesting phenomenon arises from the interaction between sphere ii and the water jetting of sphere i when the single sphere impacts the quiescent water surface the initial impact jetting occurs in approximately tangential direction of lower surface of the sphere with energy transition from the kinetic energy of the sphere as sketched in fig 7 a however when sphere ii impacts on the upward jetting water column caused by sphere i the initial impact jetting occurs in approximately tangential direction of lateral surface the sphere with energy transmission from the kinetic energy of both the sphere and upward water jetting as shown in fig 7 b undoubtedly the latter impact leads to transmission of more energy to the flow splash and the water is more prone to separation from the surface of sphere forming a wide splash curtain and a big cavity moreover the flow splash continues to expand because of inertia and gravity this phenomenon is similar to that described by vincent et al 2018 where the water splash upon water entry always goes along the wedges surface and forming a wide cavity as well in addition the splash curtain of sphere ii gradually expands due to the impact of the sphere on the upward jetting and inertia of splash curtain which is much larger than that of single sphere as shown in fig 6 a and b it can be seen clearly that obvious cavity wakes and bubbles caused by sphere i are in front of the motion direction of sphere ii fig 6 b quite different with the quiescent flow operating on single sphere fig 6 a in contrast the cavity shapes under water surface caused by the two spheres are similar to each other and the cavity walls are both smooth at the early stage i e t 2 ms during water entry furthermore as shown in fig 6 a d the displacement of sphere ii is less than that of single sphere owing to the effect of upward jetting caused by sphere i moreover as sphere ii impacted on the upward jetting above the water surface the velocity of sphere ii decreases obviously due to the energy loss during the impact as a result the velocity of sphere ii decreases from 44 6 m s above water jetting to 37 0 m s at the initially quiescent water surface less than that of single sphere u 0 44 0 m s at quiescent water surface however it is found that sphere ii overtakes the single sphere in depth finally as shown in fig 6 e j the main factor of this phenomenon may be the drag reduction effect of bubbles acting on sphere ii accompanied by the spheres descending under the surface the cavity of single sphere collapses rapidly in fig 6 c e different with that of single sphere the cavity of sphere ii continues to be elongated and gradually expands horizontally consequently air continues entering the cavity from the splash at the water surface as shown in fig 6 d f in addition the cavity wall of sphere ii becomes very rough because of the interaction of the cavity wall with the air bubbles associated with the cavity collapse of sphere i although the cavity wall for sphere ii is significantly deformed due to the interaction with bubbles it continues to shrink as the sphere reaches a certain depth and pinches off eventually as shown in fig 6 f h mainly driven by hydrostatic pressure and surface tension differing from the cavity evolution of sphere ii the cavity of single sphere collapses from the whole wall surface and shows a multiple pinch off regime as shown in fig 6 g when cavity of sphere ii completely breaks the upward jetting occurs simultaneously at this moment an interesting multi section cavity appears in which the cavity wall is squeezed regularly by the bubbly wake and the cavity shows a multi segment structure as depicted in fig 6 h this phenomenon can also be found in the other cases of tandem water entry local image sequence for case 3 is selected to describe the evolution of such multi section cavity as shown in fig 8 after the deep seal fig 8 a1 at t 2 34 ms the cavity wall nearby sphere ii is squeezed by the bubbly wakes of sphere i fig 8 b1 after that multi ring joints appear at the cavity wall owing to the squeeze caused by the bubbly wake of sphere ii fig 8 c1 as sphere ii continues downwards the ring joint occurs in succession nearby the sphere and the cavity collapses at the rear end as indicated in fig 8 d1 f1 after the cavity collapse of sphere ii a big bubble appears behind the cavity as shown in fig 8 g1 h1 differing from the wake with small bubbles caused by the cavity collapse of single sphere in fig 6 i the main reason of this phenomenon is that the air entrainment in the cavity of sphere ii is much higher than that of the single sphere fig 8 a2 h2 show the side view of the evolution of multi section cavity from the views of both front and side it can be found that the cavity wake of sphere i disturbs at only one side of the cavity however the cavity wall at the position of ring joint shrinks evenly from outside to inside which may be caused by surface tension of the cavity and high hydrostatic pressure around according to the principle of independence of cavity expansion logvinovich 1969 serebryakov 2009 vasin 2001 each section of the cavity expands closely related to the local water flow condition and behaves independently of the neighboring ones therefore it is reasonable that the ring joints occur and persist almost at fixed depths as the sphere moved downwards as shown in fig 8 b2 h2 3 3 cavity configurations by sphere ii with different velocities fig 9 shows the cavity formation of sphere ii at three different time points i e t 2 2 ms 15 ms and 34 ms for cases 1 to 5 as shown in fig 9 a1 e1 the wake caused by cavity collapse of sphere i have few influences on the cavities of which the walls were smooth at t 2 2 ms similar to the cavity formation of single water entry furthermore at t 2 15 ms the effect of bubbles disturbance on the cavities can be observed obviously for the five cases as shown in fig 9 a2 e2 it is obvious that configurations of the cavities are similar when the bubbles eroded the cavity walls besides it is found that the deep seals occurred almost at the same time point t 2 34 ms to further investigate the special phenomenon of a funnel shaped splash curtain caused by sphere ii the images of splash curtain evolution in case 3 are shown in fig 10 it is found that as sphere ⅱ moves down the splash curtain continues to expand around in case 3 furthermore in order to research the influence of impact velocity on the splash curtain images of the splash curtain caused by sphere ii for the five typical cases are shown in fig 11 a e the images of splash curtain are selected according to h d 0 3 which is defined as the ratio of the cavity depth h and the cavity diameter d at the water surface owing to the similar initial impact velocity of sphere i and time interval the heights of the upward jetting caused by the cavity surface closure of sphere i are almost the same when the sphere ii first came into contact with the upward jetting for all the five cases shown in fig 11 a e the upward jets caused by the cavity deep seal of sphere ii are observed obviously by comparing the selected images it can be found that the splash curtains above the water surface were different distinctly for example the splash curtain of case 1 moves toward to the upward jet quite different from the splash curtains expanding outward for cases 3 to 5 furthermore the splash curtain for case 2 u 20 39 0 m s is basically perpendicular to the water surface as shown in fig 11 b to detail the mechanism of above phenomenon the pressure drop across the splash curtain is evaluated with atmosphere effect being taken in account according to the study of yakimov 1973 the pressure drop across the splash curtain that is the pressure difference between the outside and inside of the curtain can be expressed as 1 δ p p outside p inside 1 2 ρ a v 0 2 2 v 0 v 1 where ρ a 1 293 kg m3 is the density of the air above the water surface v 0 is the velocity of the air inside the cavity relative to the sphere assumed to be the same as the initial impact velocity of sphere ii that is v 0 u 20 and v 1 is the velocity of the initial jetting moving up away from the sphere as sketched in fig 7 velocities of the initial jetting for cases 1 to 5 are v 1 32 8 m s 23 9 m s 18 7 m s 10 9 m s and 8 4 m s respectively therefore the pressure drop across the splash curtain can be roughly estimated as 7033 pa 4953 pa 3105 pa 1530 pa and 965 pa for cases 1 to 5 respectively notably the pressure drop for case 1 is the highest and those for cases 1 to 5 are gradually decreasing leading to an obvious expansion of the splash curtain as sketched in fig 11 f for example the splash curtain of case 1 contracts toward to the center of the upward jet owing to a high pressure difference while that of case 5 expands away from the center of the upward jet under a much lower pressure difference it should be noted that the initial jetting velocity of the single sphere is much higher than its impact velocity at quiescent water surface which has been explained in detail by thoroddsen et al 1999 therefore the pressure drops for present single water entries are much higher than those for sphere ii and will certainly lead to surface closure for cases 6 to 10 further proving yakimov 1973 prediction of the pressure difference with formula 1 3 4 motion trajectory and force analysis the difference between sphere i and sphere ii during water entry is not only reflected in their cavity configurations but also in their trajectories in this section the displacement y velocity u acceleration a of sphere ii descending in water are discussed to evaluate the effect of bubbly wake due to cavity collapse the five cases of sphere ii in tandem water entry are compared with their control group cases 6 to 10 with similar initial velocity i e case 1 case 6 case 2 case 7 case 3 case 8 case 4 case 9 case 5 case 10 note that the origin of cartesian coordinate is set on the quiescent water surface for convenient analysis as demonstrated in fig 1 y axis is oriented vertically and the upward direction is positive the data for single sphere cases are represented by dashed lines and the data for sphere ii in tandem cases are represented by solid lines as shown in fig 12 in addition the two curves with the same color show the data of sphere ii and the single one with similar velocities i e u 20 44 6 m s u 0 44 0 m s as shown in fig 12 a displacements for the two spheres in single configuration and tandem configuration are obviously different in the initial stage of water entry the single sphere reaches at a deeper position than sphere ii because the velocity of sphere ii at the initially quiescent water surface is less than that of the single sphere subsequently the relative distances between the two spheres gradually decrease for case 1 and 6 case 2 and 7 case 5 and 10 and eventually sphere ii overtakes the single sphere at t 2 24 ms t 2 30 ms and t 2 38 ms respectively as shown in fig 12 a the relative distances for the other two groups gradually decrease as well though the overtaking don t happen before t 2 60 ms furthermore the slopes of displacement curves those are velocities of the spheres gradually decrease for the selected cases owing to the drag of water fig 12 b shows the variation of velocity for the two spheres before the spheres reach the initially quiescent water surface at t 2 0 ms the velocities of sphere ii have begun to decrease upon the impact of upward jetting while the single sphere is only accelerated by gravity until t 2 0 ms therefore the velocity of sphere ii is less than that of single sphere at t 2 0 ms as shown in fig 12 b subsequently the velocity of single sphere sharply decreases upon water entry and gradually decreases as it submerges in water the velocity of sphere ii decreases slower than that of the single sphere with remarkable lower accelerations upon water impact as demonstrated in fig 12 c vertical acceleration curves in fig 12 c show that the peak value appears at the initial stage when the spheres reach the initially quiescent water surface around t 2 0 ms and then decrease gradually similar to the trend described by moghisi and squire 1981 and abraham et al 2014 the acceleration curves in fig 12 c also indicate that higher initial velocity leads to higher peak value of acceleration for both single sphere and sphere ii a closer inspection of the acceleration curves shows that the peaks for single sphere cases are apparently higher than those for sphere ii with a similar initial impact velocity and this also can be seen obviously from the curves of maximum accelerations via the initial impact velocity as detailed in fig 12 c consequently a conclusion can be drawn that the impact force of sphere ii in present study is obviously less than that acting on the single sphere with similar impact velocities the main reason of the phenomenon is that sphere ⅱ has collided with the upward jetting caused by sphere ⅰ before reaching the free surface the variation of the impact acceleration of sphere ⅱ is similar with that of the water entry of a sphere in a jet described by speirs et al 2019 fig 12 d shows the variation tendency which the maximum diameter of the cavity d max caused by sphere ii varied with the initial impact velocity u 20 the black square scatter curve represents the maximum diameter of the cavity before deep seal and the red circle scatter curve represents that after the deep seal it can be found that the maximum diameter of the cavity increased with the increase of the initial impact velocity of sphere ii both before and after deep seal of the cavity 4 conclusions in this study the cavity configurations and motion characteristics of water entry with two tandem spheres are experimentally investigated in the two tandem configuration the first spheres entries into water with a velocity around 31 m s and the second one entries into water in a velocity vary from 44 6 m s to 16 6 m s results from high speed photography show that the cavity configurations and motion characteristics between the second sphere in two tandem configuration and the single sphere are quite different due to the wake effect of cavity collapse by the first sphere the splash curtain of the second sphere in the two tandem spheres shows a significantly wide opened configuration without surface closure while that of the single sphere closes quickly in the early stage of water entry furthermore the splash curtains caused by the second spheres get expanded obviously as the decrease of impact velocity due to the decrease of pressure drop between outside and inside for the water splash in addition because of the interaction with air bubble caused by the cavity collapse of first sphere the cavity of second sphere becomes significantly deformed and deep seal occurs eventually after the deep seal a new cavity form multi section cavity appeared owing to the disturbance of eddies quantitative results about motion of the spheres show that the upward jetting of the first sphere slow the second one down while the bubbly wake of the first sphere enable the second sphere to overtake the single sphere in depth it is also found that the impact accelerations of the second sphere in present study are obviously less than those of the single sphere with similar impact

22014,in this study the vertical water entry of two tandem spheres is experimentally evaluated through high speed photography it is found that because of the impact of the second sphere on the upward jetting formed by the surface closure of the first sphere more kinematic energy is transmitted to the flow forming a significantly large cavity behind the second sphere as the second sphere descends into water the cavity is elongated with a widely open water splash for different impact velocities of the second sphere the water splash shapes are obviously different owing to the pressure drop across the splash curtain after the cavity deep seal an interesting multi section cavity appears behind the second sphere due to disturbance of the bubbly wake by the first sphere when the second sphere penetrates the bubbly flow caused by the cavity collapse of the first sphere it moves relatively faster than a single sphere with the same initial impact velocity by reason of the bubble drag reduction effect which is also verified by the quantitative data of accelerations for the spheres by a digital image correlation method graphical abstract image 1 keywords two tandem spheres water

woodhull 1950 richardson 1948 although water entry has been extensively investigated many problems have not been solved yet and many flow phenomena have not been revealed as well the impact of water entry causes splash on water surface and evolution of the splash depends on the object s shape atmospheric pressure surface tension etc vincent et al 2018 studied the impact force and splash evolution of diving wedges as a function of wedge opening angle a one dimensional model of the splash was proposed with gravity surface tension and aerodynamics forces being taken into account the shape of splashing was mainly related to the destabilizing venturi suction force and stabilizing force owing to surface tension marston et al 2016 studied the shape of splashing after the water entry of spheres at different atmospheric pressures gekle and gordillo 2010 described the formation of worthington jets after the water entry of circular disk and found that the velocity of ejected jets can be predicted in sphere water entry the cavity evolution after sphere water entry is varied and becomes complex due to the diversity of the interaction between the sphere and water to explore the mechanism of cavitation evolution extensive studies have been performed in this field gekle et al 2008 2010 may 1952 evaluated the effects of density and pressure of atmosphere above the water as well as the effects of velocity size and nose shape of missile on the cavity shape and energy loss shi and takuyatakami 2001 predicted the cavity evolution of water entry using a theoretical model gilbarg and anderson 1948 evaluated the effect of atmospheric pressure on cavity closure and found that surface seal mainly depends on atmospheric density and projectile velocity yan et al 2009 evaluated the cavity of water entry by combining theory calculation and experiment and complemented the asymptotic theory shi et al 2000 observed the motion of water surface splash and underwater bubbly flow by conducting experiments on high speed water entry bergmann et al 2009 investigated the collapse of cavity created by a disk impact on water surface and presented a simple model for the dynamics of cavity wei and hu 2014 2015 studied the evolution of cavity and variation in force caused by the water entry of circular cylinders with different inclined angles changes of surface characteristics of

variation of a heated sphere water entry and compared the difference in cavity between a heated sphere surrounded by steam and a hydrophobic sphere a theoretical description was developed by ristoff and bush 2009 to describe cavity evolution combined with experimental and theoretical investigation of the water entry of hydrophobic spheres a sphere will be subjected to tremendous unstable impact force when it first reaches a horizontal liquid surface besides the evolution of a cavity affects the motion of sphere by influencing the force on the sphere in the literature on water entry force analysis of sphere during water entry has been widely reported abraham s group abraham et al 2014 gorman et al 2014 schwalbach et al 2014 shepard et al 2014 studied the effect of impact velocity sphere density and surface wettability on the cavity evolution and impact force though the experiments of sphere water entry they found that drag coefficient is independent of sphere velocity surface tension and flow regime laminar or turbulent in the early stage of sphere water entry through numerical simulations the momentum transfer from the sphere to the adjacent liquid is the main reason of drag force truscott and techet 2009 studied the unsteady force of projectile with or without cavity formation and evaluated the lift and drag forces on spinning sphere after impact porfiri s group jalalisendi et al 2015 panciroli and porfiri 2013 verified the accuracy of particle image velocimetry piv of indirect pressure measurement in water entry and experimentally studied the three dimensional hydrodynamic loading of a rigid wedge impacting vertically on quiescent water surface compared with the hydrodynamic characteristics of single object water entry those of water entry with two objects have significant differences due to the existence of interactions between the objects a few studies have been proposed to investigate the phenomena of twin objects entering water side by side wang and wang 2010 yousefnezhad and zeraatgar 2014 lu et al 2019 more recently yun et al 2020 reported a study on oblique water entry of two tandem spheres and detailed a very interesting collision effect between the two spheres however little research has been published on vertical water entry of tandem objects so far while it is not hard to imagine that the wake of the first object will more or less affect the movement of the second one to clarify the effects between two tandem water entry objects a series of experiments on vertical water entry of two tandem spheres are conducted in present study with detailed investigation on cavity evolution movement characteristics of the two spheres 2 experimental methods the water entry experiments are carried out in a transparent water tank located in a closed laboratory free of airflow disturbance during the experiment the temperature of laboratory is maintained between 25 c and 29 c the size of water tank is 1000 mm length 700 mm width 1000 mm depth and the water depth is set as 870 mm as shown in fig 1 to ensure adequate light transmission and reduce the experimental error caused by light loss and deformation of water tank caused by static water pressure the tank is made from 15 mm thick tempered glass the spheres are launched through a direct current powered electromagnetic launcher including induction coils photoelectric gates capacitances circuit boards a voltage indicator a voltage regulator and a rail as shown in fig 2 when a sphere reaches a photoelectric gate the adjacent induction coil is triggered to be powered by the connected capacitance generating a magnetic field to drive the sphere the sphere moves forward due to gravity and inertia until it reaches the next photoelectric gate and gets accelerated again in this manner the sphere is accelerated for a few times by the induction coils and finally achieves a desired velocity the velocity of sphere is controlled by mean voltage of the capacitor group which is directly displayed on the voltage indicator the rail that used to guide the sphere s movement is calibrated to be perpendicular to the water surface using a laser level the experimental cases are listed in table 1 for cases 1 to 5 sphere i with initial impact velocity u 10 at the quiescent water surface and sphere ii with velocity u 20 upon impact on the upward jetting caused by sphere i are the first sphere and the second one in the two tandem configuration respectively the velocity of sphere i is kept around 31 0 m s and that of sphere ii varies from 44 6 m s to 16 6 m s corresponding to a velocity ratio defined as χ u u 20 u 10 varies from 1 41 to 0 54 notably cases 6 to 10 are conducted for a single sphere with initial impact velocity u 0 and use as control cases for cases 1 to 5 respectively furthermore all spheres used in the experiment are made from high carbon chromium bearing steel and their surfaces are all smooth the physical parameters of the sphere are as following density ρ s 7778 6 kg m 3 mass m 1 4 g diameter d 7 0 mm and static contact angle of water on the surface α 80 10 two high speed digital video cameras a phantom veo410l and b phantom lc111 are used to capture high quality images of whole cavity evolution and sphere trajectory till cavity pitch off to capture sufficiently crisp images for accurate analysis the trajectory of spheres the frame rate and exposure time for both cameras are set as 10 000 fps and 10 μs respectively the maximum displacement of spheres within 10 μs is 4 5 10 5 m during present experiments which is less than 1 150 of the sphere diameter the image resolutions of camera a with a 105 mm fixed focus nikon lens and camera b with a 24 85 mm nikon lens are set as 1280 400 pixels and 768 200 pixels respectively to meet the high speed acquisition both of the two cameras are set as high as the water surface and the horizontal distance from the two camera lens to the axis of the electromagnetic launcher are 2 5 m and 1 5 m respectively as shown in fig 1 note that camera a is used to capture whole cavity formation and sphere trajectory at the front view whereas camera b is used to reveal cavity formation at the side view and to confirm that the two spheres in selected tandem cases are entering into water at the same position to capture the deformation of water surface the two cameras are slightly tilted downward with a degree of about 4 fig 3 shows the cavity formation for the tandem spheres of case 3 from two different views of front and side respectively with the two high speed cameras it is found that the sphere trajectories and cavity evolutions from side view and front view are almost the same to each other and the two spheres successively enter into water almost at the same position of the initially quiescent water surface furthermore the time point when sphere i for cases 1 to 5 reaches the quiescent water surface is set as t 1 0 and the time point when sphere ii for cases 1 to 5 and the single sphere for cases 6 to 10 reach the initially quiescent water surface is set as t 2 0 arrangement of lighting sources is important for acquiring high quality photographs with high speed camera during the high speed photography experiments six lamps of jinbei ef 200 led are used as the lighting source two lamps are located behind the water tank as backlighting to provide a uniform white backdrop through light boxes the presence of backlighting specially helps to provide clear profiles of sphere and cavity furthermore other four lamps are arranged in front and side of the water tank as the foreground lighting source to illuminate the shadows formed by backlighting attention should be paid to arrangement of the foreground lighting to ensure uniform distribution of light at the trajectory as shown in fig 1 sufficient lightings with skillful arrangement during the experiments make it possible for the cameras to record very crisp images with very low exposure time and high frame rate position data of the spheres are read from each frame image using a digital image correlation dic method epps et al 2010 to acquire the position with sub pixel accuracy the translational information is fitted with a gaussian fitting curve thus an optimal solution is obtained considering both accuracy and smoothness simultaneously then velocity and acceleration of the sphere are obtained by the derivation of displacement curve for dic first a template is made using the image where the sphere is above the water surface and the size of template is about twice the diameter of the sphere then position of the sphere is extracted from the image by the cross correlation method using the template owing to lighting refraction the translational error is 0 5 pixel at the vertical direction and the error at the horizontal direction is almost negligible the shooting accuracy is 4 933 10 4 m pixel the first and second derivatives of the raw position data extracted from the high speed photography images are evaluated using a quintic spline based scheme similar to that used by epps et al 2010 the scheme weighs the roughness and error of raw position data curves as shown in fig 4 the critical error tolerance of sphere ⅰ and sphere ⅱ in typical case 3 are 5 01 10 9 and 10 8 respectively the corresponding measurement errors for two spheres are ε 1 0 24 mm and ε 2 0 33 mm respectively the error analysis process is same as that described by yun et al 2020 note that 0 24 mm 0 45 pixel so the experimental procedure has about half pixel accuracy in addition to more accurately determine the peak force during the initial impact of sphere the trajectory data of sphere before their impact on water are directly calculated using the free falling equation and those after the impact are obtained by evaluating the high speed photography images by combining the two parts of trajectories the derivatives can be evaluated again 3 results and discussion 3 1 typical cavity dynamics of two tandem spheres a typical case i e case 5 is selected to illustrate the cavity dynamics of two tandem spheres as shown in fig 5 and effect of the cavity wake by sphere i on the cavity of sphere ii are discussed fig 5 a l shows the selected image sequence for cavity formation of sphere i entering water with an initial velocity of u 10 30 6 m s in case 5 it is found that the cavity is elongated as the sphere descends into the pool because kinetic energy is transmitted from the sphere to water the cavity wall continues to expand as sphere i moves downwards the maximum cavity width appears roughly at t 1 2 5 ms and the surface curtain is also closed at this time because of a lower air pressure inside the cavity note that an upward jetting and a downward jetting inside the cavity can be observed owing to the surface closure as shown in the close up image in fig 5 c after that although the cavity continues to be elongated the width gradually shrinks because of hydrostatic pressure similar to the cavity flow phenomenon described by may 1952 the cavity gradually collapses into several feature cavity clouds at the rear end and each of them cloud subsequently evolves into a ball of bubbles with slightly downward movement as shown in fig 5 h k fig 5 l v shows the movement of sphere ii and corresponding cavity evolution in case 5 before reaching the initially quiescent water surface at about 23 6 ms later than sphere i sphere ii with u 20 16 6 m s impacts on the upward jetting water column generated by cavity deep seal of sphere i as a consequence a remarkably funnel shaped splash curtain is formed fig 5 l and m as descends under the water surface sphere ii generates a smooth cavity with the splash curtain opened widely as shown in fig 5 n and o the cavity configuration significantly changes when sphere ii passes through the region seeded with a larger number of bubbles generated by the cavity collapse of sphere i and the cavity wall of sphere ii becomes very rippled irregularly due to the complicate interaction with bubbles as shown in fig 5 p r with the descending of sphere ii and the increase of bubble disturbance distortion of the cavity increases gradually and the cavity eventually breaks in the middle as shown in fig 5 s and t after that a new cavity continues to form following sphere ii and still interacts with several clouds of bubbles left by sphere i fig 5 u and v and finally collapses several times at the rear end notably as a result of disturbance of bubble region and the randomness of sphere s falling in the water the trajectory of sphere ii is offset as shown in fig 5 v in addition it is found that an upward jetting appears in the upper half of the big cavity similar to that of deep seal for a single sphere with hydrophobic coatings aristoff et al 2010 3 2 differences in cavity configurations between sphere ii and single sphere in this section configuration of the cavity formed by sphere ii in case 1 is compared with that by a single sphere in case 6 as shown in fig 6 note that sphere ii impacts the upward jetting caused by sphere i above the water surface with an initial velocity of u 20 44 6 m s and the velocity of the single sphere impact on the quiescent water surface is u 0 44 0 m s as shown in fig 6 the cavity configurations for the two spheres are significantly different the water splash curtain formed by the single sphere is much smaller than that of spheres ii and shows a remarkable surface closure whereas the water splash curtain for sphere ii is especially large as shown in fig 6 a and b this interesting phenomenon arises from the interaction between sphere ii and the water jetting of sphere i when the single sphere impacts the quiescent water surface the initial impact jetting occurs in approximately tangential direction of lower surface of the sphere with energy transition from the kinetic energy of the sphere as sketched in fig 7 a however when sphere ii impacts on the upward jetting water column caused by sphere i the initial impact jetting occurs in approximately tangential direction of lateral surface the sphere with energy transmission from the kinetic energy of both the sphere and upward water jetting as shown in fig 7 b undoubtedly the latter impact leads to transmission of more energy to the flow splash and the water is more prone to separation from the surface of sphere forming a wide splash curtain and a big cavity moreover the flow splash continues to expand because of inertia and gravity this phenomenon is similar to that described by vincent et al 2018 where the water splash upon water entry always goes along the wedges surface and forming a wide cavity as well in addition the splash curtain of sphere ii gradually expands due to the impact of the sphere on the upward jetting and inertia of splash curtain which is much larger than that of single sphere as shown in fig 6 a and b it can be seen clearly that obvious cavity wakes and bubbles caused by sphere i are in front of the motion direction of sphere ii fig 6 b quite different with the quiescent flow operating on single sphere fig 6 a in contrast the cavity shapes under water surface caused by the two spheres are similar to each other and the cavity walls are both smooth at the early stage i e t 2 ms during water entry furthermore as shown in fig 6 a d the displacement of sphere ii is less than that of single sphere owing to the effect of upward jetting caused by sphere i moreover as sphere ii impacted on the upward jetting above the water surface the velocity of sphere ii decreases obviously due to the energy loss during the impact as a result the velocity of sphere ii decreases from 44 6 m s above water jetting to 37 0 m s at the initially quiescent water surface less than that of single sphere u 0 44 0 m s at quiescent water surface however it is found that sphere ii overtakes the single sphere in depth finally as shown in fig 6 e j the main factor of this phenomenon may be the drag reduction effect of bubbles acting on sphere ii accompanied by the spheres descending under the surface the cavity of single sphere collapses rapidly in fig 6 c e different with that of single sphere the cavity of sphere ii continues to be elongated and gradually expands horizontally consequently air continues entering the cavity from the splash at the water surface as shown in fig 6 d f in addition the cavity wall of sphere ii becomes very rough because of the interaction of the cavity wall with the air bubbles associated with the cavity collapse of sphere i although the cavity wall for sphere ii is significantly deformed due to the interaction with bubbles it continues to shrink as the sphere reaches a certain depth and pinches off eventually as shown in fig 6 f h mainly driven by hydrostatic pressure and surface tension differing from the cavity evolution of sphere ii the cavity of single sphere collapses from the whole wall surface and shows a multiple pinch off regime as shown in fig 6 g when cavity of sphere ii completely breaks the upward jetting occurs simultaneously at this moment an interesting multi section cavity appears in which the cavity wall is squeezed regularly by the bubbly wake and the cavity shows a multi segment structure as depicted in fig 6 h this phenomenon can also be found in the other cases of tandem water entry local image sequence for case 3 is selected to describe the evolution of such multi section cavity as shown in fig 8 after the deep seal fig 8 a1 at t 2 34 ms the cavity wall nearby sphere ii is squeezed by the bubbly wakes of sphere i fig 8 b1 after that multi ring joints appear at the cavity wall owing to the squeeze caused by the bubbly wake of sphere ii fig 8 c1 as sphere ii continues downwards the ring joint occurs in succession nearby the sphere and the cavity collapses at the rear end as indicated in fig 8 d1 f1 after the cavity collapse of sphere ii a big bubble appears behind the cavity as shown in fig 8 g1 h1 differing from the wake with small bubbles caused by the cavity collapse of single sphere in fig 6 i the main reason of this phenomenon is that the air entrainment in the cavity of sphere ii is much higher than that of the single sphere fig 8 a2 h2 show the side view of the evolution of multi section cavity from the views of both front and side it can be found that the cavity wake of sphere i disturbs at only one side of the cavity however the cavity wall at the position of ring joint shrinks evenly from outside to inside which may be caused by surface tension of the cavity and high hydrostatic pressure around according to the principle of independence of cavity expansion logvinovich 1969 serebryakov 2009 vasin 2001 each section of the cavity expands closely related to the local water flow condition and behaves independently of the neighboring ones therefore it is reasonable that the ring joints occur and persist almost at fixed depths as the sphere moved downwards as shown in fig 8 b2 h2 3 3 cavity configurations by sphere ii with different velocities fig 9 shows the cavity formation of sphere ii at three different time points i e t 2 2 ms 15 ms and 34 ms for cases 1 to 5 as shown in fig 9 a1 e1 the wake caused by cavity collapse of sphere i have few influences on the cavities of which the walls were smooth at t 2 2 ms similar to the cavity formation of single water entry furthermore at t 2 15 ms the effect of bubbles disturbance on the cavities can be observed obviously for the five cases as shown in fig 9 a2 e2 it is obvious that configurations of the cavities are similar when the bubbles eroded the cavity walls besides it is found that the deep seals occurred almost at the same time point t 2 34 ms to further investigate the special phenomenon of a funnel shaped splash curtain caused by sphere ii the images of splash curtain evolution in case 3 are shown in fig 10 it is found that as sphere ⅱ moves down the splash curtain continues to expand around in case 3 furthermore in order to research the influence of impact velocity on the splash curtain images of the splash curtain caused by sphere ii for the five typical cases are shown in fig 11 a e the images of splash curtain are selected according to h d 0 3 which is defined as the ratio of the cavity depth h and the cavity diameter d at the water surface owing to the similar initial impact velocity of sphere i and time interval the heights of the upward jetting caused by the cavity surface closure of sphere i are almost the same when the sphere ii first came into contact with the upward jetting for all the five cases shown in fig 11 a e the upward jets caused by the cavity deep seal of sphere ii are observed obviously by comparing the selected images it can be found that the splash curtains above the water surface were different distinctly for example the splash curtain of case 1 moves toward to the upward jet quite different from the splash curtains expanding outward for cases 3 to 5 furthermore the splash curtain for case 2 u 20 39 0 m s is basically perpendicular to the water surface as shown in fig 11 b to detail the mechanism of above phenomenon the pressure drop across the splash curtain is evaluated with atmosphere effect being taken in account according to the study of yakimov 1973 the pressure drop across the splash curtain that is the pressure difference between the outside and inside of the curtain can be expressed as 1 δ p p outside p inside 1 2 ρ a v 0 2 2 v 0 v 1 where ρ a 1 293 kg m3 is the density of the air above the water surface v 0 is the velocity of the air inside the cavity relative to the sphere assumed to be the same as the initial impact velocity of sphere ii that is v 0 u 20 and v 1 is the velocity of the initial jetting moving up away from the sphere as sketched in fig 7 velocities of the initial jetting for cases 1 to 5 are v 1 32 8 m s 23 9 m s 18 7 m s 10 9 m s and 8 4 m s respectively therefore the pressure drop across the splash curtain can be roughly estimated as 7033 pa 4953 pa 3105 pa 1530 pa and 965 pa for cases 1 to 5 respectively notably the pressure drop for case 1 is the highest and those for cases 1 to 5 are gradually decreasing leading to an obvious expansion of the splash curtain as sketched in fig 11 f for example the splash curtain of case 1 contracts toward to the center of the upward jet owing to a high pressure difference while that of case 5 expands away from the center of the upward jet under a much lower pressure difference it should be noted that the initial jetting velocity of the single sphere is much higher than its impact velocity at quiescent water surface which has been explained in detail by thoroddsen et al 1999 therefore the pressure drops for present single water entries are much higher than those for sphere ii and will certainly lead to surface closure for cases 6 to 10 further proving yakimov 1973 prediction of the pressure difference with formula 1 3 4 motion trajectory and force analysis the difference between sphere i and sphere ii during water entry is not only reflected in their cavity configurations but also in their trajectories in this section the displacement y velocity u acceleration a of sphere ii descending in water are discussed to evaluate the effect of bubbly wake due to cavity collapse the five cases of sphere ii in tandem water entry are compared with their control group cases 6 to 10 with similar initial velocity i e case 1 case 6 case 2 case 7 case 3 case 8 case 4 case 9 case 5 case 10 note that the origin of cartesian coordinate is set on the quiescent water surface for convenient analysis as demonstrated in fig 1 y axis is oriented vertically and the upward direction is positive the data for single sphere cases are represented by dashed lines and the data for sphere ii in tandem cases are represented by solid lines as shown in fig 12 in addition the two curves with the same color show the data of sphere ii and the single one with similar velocities i e u 20 44 6 m s u 0 44 0 m s as shown in fig 12 a displacements for the two spheres in single configuration and tandem configuration are obviously different in the initial stage of water entry the single sphere reaches at a deeper position than sphere ii because the velocity of sphere ii at the initially quiescent water surface is less than that of the single sphere subsequently the relative distances between the two spheres gradually decrease for case 1 and 6 case 2 and 7 case 5 and 10 and eventually sphere ii overtakes the single sphere at t 2 24 ms t 2 30 ms and t 2 38 ms respectively as shown in fig 12 a the relative distances for the other two groups gradually decrease as well though the overtaking don t happen before t 2 60 ms furthermore the slopes of displacement curves those are velocities of the spheres gradually decrease for the selected cases owing to the drag of water fig 12 b shows the variation of velocity for the two spheres before the spheres reach the initially quiescent water surface at t 2 0 ms the velocities of sphere ii have begun to decrease upon the impact of upward jetting while the single sphere is only accelerated by gravity until t 2 0 ms therefore the velocity of sphere ii is less than that of single sphere at t 2 0 ms as shown in fig 12 b subsequently the velocity of single sphere sharply decreases upon water entry and gradually decreases as it submerges in water the velocity of sphere ii decreases slower than that of the single sphere with remarkable lower accelerations upon water impact as demonstrated in fig 12 c vertical acceleration curves in fig 12 c show that the peak value appears at the initial stage when the spheres reach the initially quiescent water surface around t 2 0 ms and then decrease gradually similar to the trend described by moghisi and squire 1981 and abraham et al 2014 the acceleration curves in fig 12 c also indicate that higher initial velocity leads to higher peak value of acceleration for both single sphere and sphere ii a closer inspection of the acceleration curves shows that the peaks for single sphere cases are apparently higher than those for sphere ii with a similar initial impact velocity and this also can be seen obviously from the curves of maximum accelerations via the initial impact velocity as detailed in fig 12 c consequently a conclusion can be drawn that the impact force of sphere ii in present study is obviously less than that acting on the single sphere with similar impact velocities the main reason of the phenomenon is that sphere ⅱ has collided with the upward jetting caused by sphere ⅰ before reaching the free surface the variation of the impact acceleration of sphere ⅱ is similar with that of the water entry of a sphere in a jet described by speirs et al 2019 fig 12 d shows the variation tendency which the maximum diameter of the cavity d max caused by sphere ii varied with the initial impact velocity u 20 the black square scatter curve represents the maximum diameter of the cavity before deep seal and the red circle scatter curve represents that after the deep seal it can be found that the maximum diameter of the cavity increased with the increase of the initial impact velocity of sphere ii both before and after deep seal of the cavity 4 conclusions in this study the cavity configurations and motion characteristics of water entry with two tandem spheres are experimentally investigated in the two tandem configuration the first spheres entries into water with a velocity around 31 m s and the second one entries into water in a velocity vary from 44 6 m s to 16 6 m s results from high speed photography show that the cavity configurations and motion characteristics between the second sphere in two tandem configuration and the single sphere are quite different due to the wake effect of cavity collapse by the first sphere the splash curtain of the second sphere in the two tandem spheres shows a significantly wide opened configuration without surface closure while that of the single sphere closes quickly in the early stage of water entry furthermore the splash curtains caused by the second spheres get expanded obviously as the decrease of impact velocity due to the decrease of pressure drop between outside and inside for the water splash in addition because of the interaction with air bubble caused by the cavity collapse of first sphere the cavity of second sphere becomes significantly deformed and deep seal occurs eventually after the deep seal a new cavity form multi section cavity appeared owing to the disturbance of eddies quantitative results about motion of the spheres show that the upward jetting of the first sphere slow the second one down while the bubbly wake of the first sphere enable the second sphere to overtake the single sphere in depth it is also found that the impact accelerations of the second sphere in present study are obviously less than those of the single sphere with similar impact
