18450,ultraviolet and ultrasound based advanced oxidation processes aops are gaining considerable research attention for water treatment and disinfection compared to low frequency ultrasound lfus 100 khz high frequency ultrasound hfus 100 khz and mhz range for water disinfection remains much less investigated the present review aims at surveying and discussing literature data on microbial inactivation in non food aqueous media using hfus alone and with aops more specifically the review covers sonophotolytic us uv processes under sequential and simultaneous modes as well as sonophotochemical processes where both low and high frequencies were applied addressing a state of the art biomedical research we have attempted to provide more insight into mechanical and sonochemical mechanisms of inactivation under ultrasonic exposure sonoporation intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species ros energy stimulation of aquaporins to deliver ros and injection of extracellular ros into sonoporated cells have all been identified as primary ways of inactivation application of ultrasound in the 0 2 2 mhz range and mercury free light sources to support the minamata convention on mercury is an ongoing challenge for effective elimination of microbial pathogens from water and wastewater through sonophotolytic and sonophotochemical aops graphical abstract image 1 keywords water disinfection microbial inactivation high frequency ultrasound ultraviolet radiation sonoporation aquaporins 1 introduction ultrasound and ultraviolet uv irradiation have been known as some of the most effective reagent free methods for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms in aqueous media to date uv treatment has become a widely used technology for water and wastewater disinfection however uv disinfection is easily affected by water quality and has other limitations which are noncritical for ultrasound disinfection therefore ultrasonication can be considered as an alternative individual method or in combination with uv radiation for improving its performance upon sonication the acoustic cavitation produces collapsing micro bubbles in water leading to extremely high local temperatures and pressures in supercritical regions hot spots after collapsing the microbubbles generate h2o2 and reactive oxygen species ros such as oh ho2 and o which are responsible for oxidation processes mark et al 1998 furuta et al 2004 sathishkumar et al 2016 and capable of inactivating enzymes and damaging membranes dna rna proteins and lipids riesz and kondo 1992 cabiscol et al 2000 ultrasound cavitation also induces physical or mechanical effects such as shock waves shear forces and micro jets which lead to mechanical disruption of the cell membrane and lysis jyoti and pandit 2001 ananta et al 2005 gao et al 2014a historically the influence of frequency on the chemical oxidation by ros and mechanical effects has been intensively studied since the 1990s for the degradation of chemical compounds petrier et al 1992 mason et al 1994 portenlänger and heusinger 1997 it is generally accepted that on increasing frequency the mechanical effects decrease and the chemical effects increase mason et al 2011 observed the inverse dependence of mechanical and chemical effects on the frequency 20 1142 khz with respect to the surface modification of a plastic material later tran et al 2014 quantified the mechanical effects in the frequency range from 20 khz to 1 mhz and confirmed that their slowing down with an increasing frequency above 100 khz it is believed that the microbial inactivation by high frequency ultrasound hfus 100 khz and mhz range is mainly via the generation of ros and subsequent chemical reactions while under lower frequencies the inactivation occurs primarily due to direct mechanical effects wu et al 2012 gao et al 2014a b low frequency ultrasound lfus 100 khz typically 20 48 khz has been widely used in inactivation studies both individually and in combination with uv light oxidants or catalysts in sono based advanced oxidation processes aops compared to lfus the potential of hfus for inactivating microorganisms in aqueous media remains much less investigated meanwhile in view of ros production and intensification of inactivation processes hfus appears to be an attractive alternative to the commonly employed lfus the low and high frequency sono based aops especially sonophotocatalysis for organic chemical degradation in water have been extensively studied and comprehensively reviewed ince et al 2001 pang et al 2011 rayaroth et al 2016 sathishkumar et al 2016 chu et al 2017 panda and manickam 2017 yap et al 2019 a literature analysis showed that little research on microbial inactivation which is an equally important field for water treatment applications has been conducted using sono based aops to our knowledge this is the first review that aims at surveying and discussing literature data on the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms in aqueous media using hfus and selected aops namely sonophotolytic us uv and sonophotochemical processes us uv oxidant catalyst mechanisms of inactivation are discussed addressing a state of the art biomedical research research gaps and future research directions are also identified 2 high frequency ultrasonic irradiation pioneering work in the use of hfus for microbial inactivation was conducted by harvey and loomis 1929 who observed the inhibition of light emission from the bioluminescent bacterium bacillus fischeri currently aliivibrio fischeri in seawater exposed to 375 khz hfus since then there have been a limited number of publications on microbial inactivation by hfus for water disinfection purposes table 1 as shown in table 1 most past studies have been comparative and hfus is employed alongside with lfus according to recent studies the favorable resonant ultrasound frequencies for productive sonochemical yield have been considered to be in the mid range of 100 500 khz pokhrel et al 2016 200 600 khz sathishkumar et al 2016 300 500 khz zhou et al 2012 wood et al 2017 this conclusion was based on the earlier studies of sonoluminescence or sonochemical efficiency using chemical dosimetry petrier et al 1992 beckett and hua 2001 koda et al 2003 kanthale et al 2008 however some authors reported frequencies close to 1 mhz entezari and kruus 1994 mark et al 1998 in particular the oh yield was reported to be significant at 585 and 1040 khz mark et al 1998 comparative studies showed that hfus was more effective than lfus against different microorganisms in model aqueous solutions in terms of higher inactivation rates hua and thompson 2000 koda et al 2009 and cell reduction phull et al 1997 park et al 2017 table 1 hfus at 850 khz was also reported to be highly efficient 99 for inactivating bacteria and yeast at different growth phases gao et al 2014a the authors suggested that the mechanism of inactivation was mainly due to generated free radicals and h2o2 however other results on enterobacter aerogenes treatment in milli q water revealed roughly the same log reduction after exposure at 850 and 20 khz gao et al 2014b furthermore hfus did not inactivate bacillus subtilis at 512 and 850 khz joyce et al 2003 nor e coli and klebsiella pneumonia at 580 khz joyce et al 2011 however it resulted in declumping and deagglomeration of cell clusters wu et al 2012 also reported a declumping effect at 1146 khz when treating suspensions of cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa whereas 20 and 580 khz frequencies were effective in terms of inactivation table 1 more recently park et al 2017 obtained the opposite results with regard to m aeruginosa at the same initial concentration of 106 cfu ml but at two orders of magnitude higher acoustic power density in this study 20 and 584 khz were less effective than 869 and 1137 khz for cell reduction and regrowth inhibition in terms of turbidity removal by coagulation the frequency within the limits of 120 and 1120 khz had no significant effect on m aeruginosa removal compared to the power density 0 01 0 09 w ml and the sonication time up to 20 min li et al 2019 however sonication at 430 and 740 khz caused more pronounced cellular damages than at other frequencies furthermore sonication at 612 khz was less effective for inactivating mycobacterium sp 6py1 than at 20 khz al bsoul et al 2010 sonication at 100 khz also performed worse than at 28 khz for inactivating e coli karel et al 2018 such discrepancies in the literature indicate the need for deeper insight into the mechanisms of inactivation by hfus regarding ultrasound in the megahertz range chandler et al 2001 developed a flow through radially focused transducer for biomonitoring applications and showed that 1 and 1 4 mhz can rapidly disrupt bacillus spores and vegetative bacterial cells in small volumes other researchers have used megahertz frequency ultrasound to control pathogenic microorganisms in small volume liquids primarily for therapeutic purposes table 2 early studies were conducted to concentrate and remove different microorganisms from aqueous suspensions by 1 3 mhz standing waves miles et al 1995 limaye and coakley 1998 vollmer et al 1998 revealed the inactivation effect of 1 mhz hfus on e coli using a panel of stress responsive biosensors recent studies by brayman et al 2017 2018 aiming at developing a non invasive technology to treat abscesses have demonstrated the successful scaling up the treatment volume from 0 1 ml to 5 and 10 ml for eradicating e coli by high intensity focused 1 2 mhz ultrasound higher frequencies of 1 6 and 1 7 mhz were also effective against the fungi trichophyton spp at elevated temperatures iwasawa et al 2009 and against the k562 cells model cancer cells in the presence of 5 aminolaevulinic acid he et al 2010 respectively additionally the oh formation positively correlated with the duration of us treatment and water temperature iwasawa et al 2009 it is also worth mentioning the efficiency of 1 mhz us against the important protozoan pathogen cryptosporidium parvum oocysts olvera et al 2008 however 7 44 mhz us pulses did not generate large oscillation and collapse of the bubble compared to the resonant frequency of 300 500 khz zhou et al 2012 in view of the above studies the upper limit of productive frequencies appears to be greater than 500 600 khz and close to 2 mhz for example the sonoxide technology which operates at 1 5 2 mhz under flow through conditions was highly efficient for inactivating bacteria and algae in water systems and was incorporated into different industrial applications mason et al 2003 broekman et al 2010 many studies have focused on the analysis and optimization of sonoreactors basically horn and bath types for water treatment and disinfection specific acoustic energy treatment time and number of passages through the reactor are shown to be crucial parameters of ultrasonic disinfection of water hulsmans et al 2010 for modelling of sonoreactors grčić et al 2012 introduced a global parameter of the ultrasound exploitation which accounts for different reactor parameters such as frequency transducer power the cavitationally active volume and the average temperature vajnhandl et al 2015 characterized low 20 khz and high frequency 279 817 khz sonoreactors and found the most significant inhibition of e coli at 817 khz however scaling up and energy requirements of ultrasound equipment represent a challenge for practical application therefore it is advantageous to apply ultrasound in hybrid techniques 3 sonophotolysis combination of us and uv treatments is regarded as an appropriate solution for reducing energy requirements and overcoming limitations of uv radiation such as light scattering and absorbance cell shading and reactivation effects as well as issues related to organic fouling of uv lamps and mercury disposal moreover since the wavelength of ultrasound is much longer than that of uv radiation ultrasonic waves do not scatter uv in aqueous media due to these advantages sonophotolysis us uv has emerged as an advanced method under sequential us uv or simultaneous us uv schemes for intensifying water and wastewater disinfection however the number of related studies is rather limited table 3 ultrasonication at 20 khz as a pre treatment step was first applied to improve uv disinfection of secondary effluents by changing the particle size distribution and reducing the average size oliver and cosgrove 1975 the reduction of the number of large particles 50 60 μm was also reported in later us uv studies alongside other positive effects such as reduced energy consumption less tailing on uv dose response kinetic curves and less biofouling of the lamps as well as no cell photoreactivation or regeneration table 3 the synergistic effect reported was contrary to the conclusion by vasilyak 2010 however it was also established in a case of simultaneous us uv treatment of influent wastewater with low transmittance naddeo et al 2009 and secondary effluents at a pilot scale ulyanov 2009 zhou et al 2015 2017a b in particular zhou et al 2015 applied us uv and vice versa and us uv methods for inactivating fecal coliforms in secondary effluents using a flow through baffled reactor with three chambers where 28 khz us transducers in all chambers and 254 nm uv lamps in chambers 2 and 3 were located they found that the average log reduction with six us uv scenarios g0 uv uv uv g1 us uv uv g2 uv uv us g3 us uv uv g4 uv us uv and g5 us uv us uv followed the order of g5 g1 g3 g0 g4 g2 fig 1 this indicates an enhancement of uv disinfection by both us pre and simultaneous treatment additionally the most effective mode with two stage simultaneous us uv disinfection was recommended sequential sonophotolysis was also conducted as a part of sonophotochemical experiments in a few studies giannakis et al 2015 gemici et al 2018 rubio clemente et al 2019 which are discussed further in section 4 us uv treatment resulted in a higher rate and lower uv dose of total coliform inactivation in natural water than that observed for individual uv or us irradiation rubio clemente et al 2019 the synergistic action of us and uv processes was also observed for inactivating e coli in a model aqueous solution gemici et al 2018 however it was not evident when treating secondary effluents by simulated solar light and us giannakis et al 2015 thus sonophotolysis in sequential and simultaneous modes is characterized as a well established hybrid method for disinfecting model and real waters which provides a synergistic effect with elevated inactivation rates and energy efficiency worth noting is that this method was also effective at eliminating eukaryotic organisms zooplankton in water from aquaculture systems bazyar lakeh et al 2013 and in ships ballast water sassi et al 2005 overall the discussed studies on water disinfection by us uv processes were conducted using lfus at frequencies in the range of 20 83 khz to the best of our knowledge there are only three related works on sonophotolysis with hfus 100 khz as mentioned above giannakis et al 2015 employed 275 khz us in their investigation of sonophotochemical processes table 4 section 4 and presented results on sonophotolysis as well earlier chrysikopoulos et al 2013 coupled hfus 582 862 and 1142 khz and visible light to inactivate bacteriophages фx4 and ms2 in saline aqueous solutions they observed a faster inactivation of viruses at 582 and 862 khz and more sensitivity of ms2 to sonophotolytic treatment however the applied source of visible light is not detailed in this work us pre treatment of the secondary effluent improved water quality and prevented algae bloom at a field scale using a dual core multi frequency 20 200 khz ultrasonic transducer toscano et al 2013 thus the combination of hfus and uv vis radiation for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms in aqueous media has not been explored yet and represents an alternative hybrid method for chemical free water disinfection 4 sonophotochemical processes sonophotochemical aops which are based on the combined use of us and uv irradiation in the presence of a catalyst or an oxidant are applied in order to further increase the ros production oxidation mineralization efficiency and reduce energy requirements other advantages include relative simplicity availability and high performance of devices for generating light and ultrasound a literature search for publications dealing with sonophotochemical aops to disinfect water revealed only a few investigations table 4 heterogeneous sonophotocatalysis was shown to be an efficient method for enhancing us uv inactivation of e coli in model aqueous solution using zno nanofluids zhang et al 2017 yan et al 2018 tio2 and peracetic acid drosou et al 2010 an antibacterial column with ag also prompted its inactivation in distilled water gemici et al 2018 regarding real water matrices complete inactivation of e coli was attained by sono photo fenton giannakis et al 2015 and us uv h2o2 processes rubio clemente et al 2019 in secondary effluent and natural surface water respectively similar to sonophotolytic studies lfus was used in the aforementioned studies with the exception of the 275 khz employed by giannakis et al 2015 to date sono based aops including hfus based processes for degrading organic micro pollutants pharmaceuticals dyes endocrine disrupting compounds and other emerging contaminants in water have demonstrated much more progress than those for inactivating microorganisms for instance coupling solar photo fenton with 400 khz hfus showed a synergistic effect and decreased the treatment times and h2o2 consumption papoutsakis et al 2015 more recently serna galvis et al 2019 reported the significant enhancement of micropollutant degradation in real wastewater by using 375 khz hfus and photo fenton oxalic acid system furthermore sono based sulfate radical aops namely sono enhanced persulfate peroxomonosulfate oxidation in the absence or presence of light or catalysts such as photo fenton like processes also remain unexplored with respect to microbial inactivation this research gap is also evident from the review on the state of the art research on sulfate radical based inactivation xiao et al 2019 meanwhile these oxidation systems have proven to be effective for degrading organic compounds e g zou et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2017 guerra rodríguez et al 2018 in view of this such hybrid sonophotochemical methods including photo fenton like processes appear to be also potentially effective for eliminating microbial pathogens in water and wastewater recent related studies on organic chemical degradation babu et al 2017 ince 2018 yap et al 2019 serna galvis et al 2019 allow us to identify sonophotochemical processes for water disinfection as one of the emerging research fields regarding light sources low and medium pressure mercury lamps were used in most studies of sonophotolytic and sonophotochemical processes tables 3 and 4 meanwhile the minamata convention on mercury adopted in 2013 aims at providing the gradual phase out of mercury use in a number of products and processes mercury free sources are preferable for water treatment and disinfection via photo induced aops of these uv light emitting diodes leds represent one of the most attractive alternatives and have been recently applied to inactivate e coli in various water matrices by 33 khz us uv treatment zhou et al 2017a summarizing the current literature on microbial inactivation presents evidence for an increase in using hfus and mercury free light sources such as uv leds excilamps solar lamps and natural solar radiation 5 inactivation mechanisms the inactivation mechanism under uv irradiation arises primarily from mutagenic and cytotoxic dna lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6 4 photoproducts sinha and häder 2002 however uv induced lesions are enzymatically repaired in a variety of microorganisms via photoreactivation and excision repair coupling uv and ultrasonication triggers other inactivation mechanisms ultrasound radiation generates ros and increases the cell permeability it is known that acoustic cavitation induces both chemical and physical mechanical effects which are responsible for microbial inactivation as previously mentioned the mechanical effects dominate at low frequencies while under higher frequencies more ros are generated providing chemical oxidative effects ros arise from the collapse of microbubbles which causes high local pressures of 100 mpa and temperatures of 5000 k suslick 1998 specifically the calculated temperatures inside the bubble were in the range of 3400 k at 20 khz 3700 k at 1056 khz and highest of 4300 k at 355 khz ciawi et al 2006 to date cell inactivation by ros is thought to occur by the following mechanism the generated ros oxidize the membrane lipids ma et al 2019 and facilitate their transport to the cell to damage dna specifically oh radicals react with the heterocyclic dna bases and the sugar moiety by various mechanisms dizdaroglu and jaruga 2012 the so4 radical is also responsible for dna damage muller et al 1997 this mechanism is proposed for any aop types including uv and ultrasound based fenton like electrochemical and other processes it is known that ultrasound also causes acoustic streaming around oscillating bubbles which can induce shear stress and damage living cells hughes and nyborg 1962 shear stress above physiological level results in different biological effects including perforation of the membrane wu et al 2002 vanbavel 2007 for example 1 or 2 mhz hfus at 0 1 mpa was capable of inducing sufficient shear stress associated with microstreaming for generating pores on cells wu 2007 pore sizes are dependent on the cell membrane composition as well as on the distance of the bubble from the membrane such perforation increases the membrane permeability and allows the transfer of macromolecules and radicals through the pores into the cell to damage organelles and dna the phenomenon of cell permeabilization by acoustic cavitation during ultrasonic exposure is known as sonoporation lentacker et al 2014 zhou et al 2012 comprehensively studied sonoporation under hfus exposure at 1 5 mhz and reported that the resonant frequencies of the bubble lie in the range of 300 500 khz according to the minneart equation plesset and prosperetti 1977 this implies that the bubbles collapse at these resonant frequencies which can be considered as the most efficient us frequencies for producing pores sonoporation they also demonstrated that under the controlled collapse of a single bubble radius 10 μm and at a short distance 7 5 μm from the membrane of a xenopus oocyte sonication at 1 5 mpa of 1 5 mhz was sufficient to generate a pore with a radius of 0 182 0 052 μm fig 2 sonoporation as a phenomenon and a tool for non invasive delivery of large molecules such as genes into cells for therapeutic and biotechnological applications has been well studied ohl et al 2006 schlincher et al 2006 newman and bettinger 2007 kudo et al 2009 guo et al 2017 particularly deeks et al 2014 in their study of ultrasound enhanced gene transfer in e coli at discrete frequencies proposed that ultrasonication increased the membrane permeability via sonoporation allowing plasmid dna to be injected into the cell however sonoporation with respect to mechanisms of microbial inactivation has still been rarely addressed in the literature zhang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 so far the mechanism of sonophotocatalytic inactivation of e coli based on acoustic cavitation sonocatalytic reactions and sonoporation has been proposed by zhang et al 2017 the authors concluded that sonoporation facilitated penetration of more zno nanoparticles into cell thus contributing to an inactivation effect in case of m aeruginosa extracellular and intracellular oxidation have been found to be the key mechanisms of inactivation by sono fenton process at 20 and 800 khz respectively wu et al 2019 it has been shown that 20 khz at high intensity caused a pore formation fig 3 with a subsequent lethal effect extracellular oxidation with ros participation while 800 khz at low intensity slightly damaged the cell it might be expected that high intensity hfus would have formed pores as well nonetheless the authors reported that the fenton s reagent was delivered into cyanobacterial cells due to sonoporation at 800 khz leading to intracellular oxidation by generated ros alongside extracellular ros they can be generated intracellularly without addition of chemicals as a biological response to sonoporation the physical damage of a cell membrane by ultrasound induces an oxidative stress in cells and stimulates ros production via intracellular biochemical reactions jia et al 2018 showed that the intracellular ros production at 1 5 mhz was positively correlated with the degree of the reversible sonoporation of cancer cells amongst intracellular bioeffects juffermans et al 2009 observed the increase of membrane permeability for ca2 and intracellular levels of h2o2 in endothelial cells exposed to 1 mhz ultrasound and microbubbles recent investigation of us induced oxidative stress on human lens epithelial cells also revealed excessive levels of ros and ca2 per cell upon exposure to 500 khz for 300 s leading to cellular apoptosis rwei et al 2017 it has been known that membrane permeation is regulated by the specific transmembrane channel proteins which are selective toward target substrates klein et al 2019 the channels that facilitate the transmembrane flux of water are called aquaporins aqps agre et al 1998 agre 2004 for example e coli a model bacterium in inactivation studies has the aquaporin aqpz while 13 aqps were identified in humans and up to 30 aqps were described for some plants quigley et al 2001 ishibashi 2009 moreover aqps were also identified for other permeants such as urea nitrate ammonia anions hydrogen peroxide yasui et al 1999 bienert et al 2007 wu and beitz 2007 aqps are capable of transporting ros across phospholipid membranes new insights obtained with molecular dynamics modelling showed that water and ros had similar transport features and h2o2 might be transported by mammalian and plant aqps cordeiro 2015 it was also suggested that oh can enter a pore and oxidize amino acids that are responsible for channel selectivity other authors reported the reversible inhibition of aqps under oh exposure in green algae chara corallina henzler and steudle 2004 and corn roots ye and steudle 2006 via a gating mechanism proposed for plants the mechanisms of ros delivery into microbial cells are still not fully understood however liao et al 2018 recently suggested the us stimulated injection of ros from measurements of intracellular ros level of staphylococcus aureus further this accelerates the oxidation of intracellular biomolecules which leads to cell death in any case ros need to overcome an energy barrier 10 kj mol as assessed by cordeiro 2015 for the plant aquaporin to enter the channel and pass through its structure we believe that ultrasound irradiation transmits the free energy to the aqps thereby increasing the membrane permeability for ros finally existing knowledge provides evidence for a deeper insight into mechanical and sonochemical mechanisms of microbial inactivation under ultrasonic exposure via the following processes sonoporation i e the creation of artificial pores on the cell membrane acoustic cavitation and its associated effects such as streaming and microstreaming shear stress and shock waves cause physical damage of the membrane leading to its poration mechanical rupture and ultimately cell lysis intracellular generation of excessive ros and other internal bioeffects which are induced by shear oxidative stress in cells above the physiological level in turn this triggers the mechanism of cellular apoptosis by oxidative reactions such as lipid peroxidation etc energy stimulation of aquaporins or natural pores on the cell membranes which deliver extracellular ros into cells with subsequent oxidative reactions and cell death injection of extracellular ros into sonoporated cells 6 future research in view of the limited research on microbial inactivation by sonophotochemical aops as well as recent advancements in sonoporation we have elaborated the following recommendations for future research 1 in depth developments in the sono based aops should proceed with using the advanced tools of this cutting edge interdisciplinary research field of sonoporation 2 application of these tools for delivering ros into the cells through the membrane by means of aquaporins and other facilitators would enhance the potential of sono based aops to inactivate pathogenic micro ogranisms 3 to increase the inactivation efficiency reduce energy consumption and simultaneously address many chemical contaminants which may co exist with microorganisms in water to be treated hybrid sonophotochemical aops primarily sonophotocatalysis represent one of the most promising research directions 4 combination of high frequency ultrasound of 0 2 2 mhz range and uv vis radiation is expected to be explored in sonophotolytic and sonophotochemical aops including sono photo fenton like processes 5 supporting the minamata convention on mercury use of mercury free light sources such as uv leds excilamps solar lamps and natural solar radiation is encouraged 7 conclusions sonophotochemical aops for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms in water represent an overlooked research area in comparison with degradation of chemical pollutants we believe that these areas are emerging as promising alternatives for water disinfection and decontamination of other liquids and surfaces such as food and drinks medical instrumentation and food processing equipment the exact mechanisms of microbial inactivation at the molecular level under ultrasonic exposure in aqueous media have not been fully studied however recent developments in the field of sonoporation for biomedical application i e for delivery of target molecules such as ros genes etc into cells have provided deeper insights into possible mechanisms of inactivation and evidence for further research analysis of the research status of transmembrane transport showed that the mechanisms of increasing permeability of the cell membranes could be applied for inactivation

mhz entezari and kruus 1994 mark et al 1998 in particular the oh yield was reported to be significant at 585 and 1040 khz mark et al 1998 comparative studies showed that hfus was more effective than lfus against different microorganisms in model aqueous solutions in terms of higher inactivation rates hua and thompson 2000 koda et al 2009 and cell reduction phull et al 1997 park et al 2017 table 1 hfus at 850 khz was also reported to be highly efficient 99 for inactivating bacteria and yeast at different growth phases gao et al 2014a the authors suggested that the mechanism of inactivation was mainly due to generated free radicals and h2o2 however other results on enterobacter aerogenes treatment in milli q water revealed roughly the same log reduction after exposure at 850 and 20 khz gao et al 2014b furthermore hfus did not inactivate bacillus subtilis at 512 and 850 khz joyce et al 2003 nor e coli and klebsiella pneumonia at 580 khz joyce et al 2011 however it resulted in declumping and deagglomeration of cell clusters wu et al 2012 also reported a declumping effect at 1146 khz when treating suspensions of cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa whereas 20 and 580 khz frequencies were effective in terms of inactivation table 1 more recently park et al 2017 obtained the opposite results with regard to m aeruginosa at the same initial concentration of 106 cfu ml but at two orders of magnitude higher acoustic power density in this study 20 and 584 khz were less effective than 869 and 1137 khz for cell reduction and regrowth inhibition in terms of turbidity removal by coagulation the frequency within the limits of 120 and 1120 khz had no significant effect on m aeruginosa removal compared to the power density 0 01 0 09 w ml and the sonication time up to 20 min li et al 2019 however sonication at 430 and 740 khz caused more pronounced cellular damages than at other frequencies furthermore sonication at 612 khz was less effective for inactivating mycobacterium sp 6py1 than at 20 khz al bsoul et al 2010 sonication at 100 khz also performed worse than at 28 khz for inactivating e coli karel et al 2018 such discrepancies in the literature indicate the need for deeper insight into the mechanisms of inactivation by hfus regarding ultrasound in the megahertz range chandler et al 2001 developed a flow through radially focused transducer for biomonitoring applications and showed that 1 and 1 4 mhz can rapidly disrupt bacillus spores and vegetative bacterial cells in small volumes other researchers have used megahertz frequency ultrasound to control pathogenic microorganisms in small volume liquids primarily for therapeutic purposes table 2 early studies were conducted to concentrate and remove different microorganisms from aqueous suspensions by 1 3 mhz standing waves miles et al 1995 limaye and coakley 1998 vollmer et al 1998 revealed the inactivation effect of 1 mhz hfus on e coli using a panel of stress responsive biosensors recent studies by brayman et al 2017 2018 aiming at developing a non invasive technology to treat abscesses have demonstrated the successful scaling up the treatment volume from 0 1 ml to 5 and 10 ml for eradicating e coli by high intensity focused 1 2 mhz ultrasound higher frequencies of 1 6 and 1 7 mhz were also effective against the fungi trichophyton spp at elevated temperatures iwasawa et al 2009 and against the k562 cells model cancer cells in the presence of 5 aminolaevulinic acid he et al 2010 respectively additionally the oh formation positively correlated with the duration of us treatment and water temperature iwasawa et al 2009 it is also worth mentioning the efficiency of 1 mhz us against the important protozoan pathogen cryptosporidium parvum oocysts olvera et al 2008 however 7 44 mhz us pulses did not generate large oscillation and collapse of the bubble compared to the resonant frequency of 300 500 khz zhou et al 2012 in view of the above studies the upper limit of productive frequencies appears to be greater than 500 600 khz and close to 2 mhz for example the sonoxide technology which operates at 1 5 2 mhz under flow through conditions was highly efficient for inactivating bacteria and algae in water systems and was incorporated into different industrial applications mason et al 2003 broekman et al 2010 many studies have focused on the analysis and optimization of sonoreactors basically horn and bath types for water treatment and disinfection specific acoustic energy treatment time and number of passages through the reactor are shown to be crucial parameters of ultrasonic disinfection of water hulsmans et al 2010 for modelling of sonoreactors grčić et al 2012 introduced a global parameter of the ultrasound exploitation which accounts for different reactor parameters such as frequency transducer power the cavitationally active volume and the average temperature vajnhandl et al 2015 characterized low 20 khz and high frequency 279 817 khz sonoreactors and found the most significant inhibition of e coli at 817 khz however scaling up and energy requirements of ultrasound equipment represent a challenge for practical application therefore it is advantageous to apply ultrasound in hybrid techniques 3 sonophotolysis combination of us and uv treatments is regarded as an appropriate solution for reducing energy requirements and overcoming limitations of uv radiation such as light scattering and absorbance cell shading and reactivation effects as well as issues related to organic fouling of uv lamps and mercury disposal moreover since the wavelength of ultrasound is much longer than that of uv radiation ultrasonic waves do not scatter uv in aqueous media due to these advantages sonophotolysis us uv has emerged as an advanced method under sequential us uv or simultaneous us uv schemes for intensifying water and wastewater disinfection however the number of related studies is rather limited table 3 ultrasonication at 20 khz as a pre treatment step was first applied to improve uv disinfection of secondary effluents by changing the particle size distribution and reducing the average size oliver and cosgrove 1975 the reduction of the number of large particles 50 60 μm was also reported in later us uv studies alongside other positive effects such as reduced energy consumption less tailing on uv dose response kinetic curves and less biofouling of the lamps as well as no cell photoreactivation or regeneration table 3 the synergistic effect reported was contrary to the conclusion by vasilyak 2010 however it was also established in a case of simultaneous us uv treatment of influent wastewater with low transmittance naddeo et al 2009 and secondary effluents at a pilot scale ulyanov 2009 zhou et al 2015 2017a b in particular zhou et al 2015 applied us uv and vice versa and us uv methods for inactivating fecal coliforms in secondary effluents using a flow through baffled reactor with three chambers where 28 khz us transducers in all chambers and 254 nm uv lamps in chambers 2 and 3 were located they found that the average log reduction with six us uv scenarios g0 uv uv uv g1 us uv uv g2 uv uv us g3 us uv uv g4 uv us uv and g5 us uv us uv followed the order of g5 g1 g3 g0 g4 g2 fig 1 this indicates an enhancement of uv disinfection by both us pre and simultaneous treatment additionally the most effective mode with two stage simultaneous us uv disinfection was recommended sequential sonophotolysis was also conducted as a part of sonophotochemical experiments in a few studies giannakis et al 2015 gemici et al 2018 rubio clemente et al 2019 which are discussed further in section 4 us uv treatment resulted in a higher rate and lower uv dose of total coliform inactivation in natural water than that observed for individual uv or us irradiation rubio clemente et al 2019 the synergistic action of us and uv processes was also observed for inactivating e coli in a model aqueous solution gemici et al 2018 however it was not evident when treating secondary effluents by simulated solar light and us giannakis et al 2015 thus sonophotolysis in sequential and simultaneous modes is characterized as a well established hybrid method for disinfecting model and real waters which provides a synergistic effect with elevated inactivation rates and energy efficiency worth noting is that this method was also effective at eliminating eukaryotic organisms zooplankton in water from aquaculture systems bazyar lakeh et al 2013 and in ships ballast water sassi et al 2005 overall the discussed studies on water disinfection by us uv processes were conducted using lfus at frequencies in the range of 20 83 khz to the best of our knowledge there are only three related works on sonophotolysis with hfus 100 khz as mentioned above giannakis et al 2015 employed 275 khz us in their investigation of sonophotochemical processes table 4 section 4 and presented results on sonophotolysis as well earlier chrysikopoulos et al 2013 coupled hfus 582 862 and 1142 khz and visible light to inactivate bacteriophages фx4 and ms2 in saline aqueous solutions they observed a faster inactivation of viruses at 582 and 862 khz and more sensitivity of ms2 to sonophotolytic treatment however the applied source of visible light is not detailed in this work us pre treatment of the secondary effluent improved water quality and prevented algae bloom at a field scale using a dual core multi frequency 20 200 khz ultrasonic transducer toscano et al 2013 thus the combination of hfus and uv vis radiation for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms in aqueous media has not been explored yet and represents an alternative hybrid method for chemical free water disinfection 4 sonophotochemical processes sonophotochemical aops which are based on the combined use of us and uv irradiation in the presence of a catalyst or an oxidant are applied in order to further increase the ros production oxidation mineralization efficiency and reduce energy requirements other advantages include relative simplicity availability and high performance of devices for generating light and ultrasound a literature search for publications dealing with sonophotochemical aops to disinfect water revealed only a few investigations table 4 heterogeneous sonophotocatalysis was shown to be an efficient method for enhancing us uv inactivation of e coli in model aqueous solution using zno nanofluids zhang et al 2017 yan et al 2018 tio2 and peracetic acid drosou et al 2010 an antibacterial column with ag also prompted its inactivation in distilled water gemici et al 2018 regarding real water matrices complete inactivation of e coli was attained by sono photo fenton giannakis et al 2015 and us uv h2o2 processes rubio clemente et al 2019 in secondary effluent and natural surface water respectively similar to sonophotolytic studies lfus was used in the aforementioned studies with the exception of the 275 khz employed by giannakis et al 2015 to date sono based aops including hfus based processes for degrading organic micro pollutants pharmaceuticals dyes endocrine disrupting compounds and other emerging contaminants in water have demonstrated much more progress than those for inactivating microorganisms for instance coupling solar photo fenton with 400 khz hfus showed a synergistic effect and decreased the treatment times and h2o2 consumption papoutsakis et al 2015 more recently serna galvis et al 2019 reported the significant enhancement of micropollutant degradation in real wastewater by using 375 khz hfus and photo fenton oxalic acid system furthermore sono based sulfate radical aops namely sono enhanced persulfate peroxomonosulfate oxidation in the absence or presence of light or catalysts such as photo fenton like processes also remain unexplored with respect to microbial inactivation this research gap is also evident from the review on the state of the art research on sulfate radical based inactivation xiao et al 2019 meanwhile these oxidation systems have proven to be effective for degrading organic compounds e g zou et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2017 guerra rodríguez et al 2018 in view of this such hybrid sonophotochemical methods including photo fenton like processes appear to be also potentially effective for eliminating microbial pathogens in water and wastewater recent related studies on organic chemical degradation babu et al 2017 ince 2018 yap et al 2019 serna galvis et al 2019 allow us to identify sonophotochemical processes for water disinfection as one of the emerging research fields regarding light sources low and medium pressure mercury lamps were used in most studies of sonophotolytic and sonophotochemical processes tables 3 and 4 meanwhile the minamata convention on mercury adopted in 2013 aims at providing the gradual phase out of mercury use in a number of products and processes mercury free sources are preferable for water treatment and disinfection via photo induced aops of these uv light emitting diodes leds represent one of the most attractive alternatives and have been recently applied to inactivate e coli in various water matrices by 33 khz us uv treatment zhou et al 2017a summarizing the current literature on microbial inactivation presents evidence for an increase in using hfus and mercury free light sources such as uv leds excilamps solar lamps and natural solar radiation 5 inactivation mechanisms the inactivation mechanism under uv irradiation arises primarily from mutagenic and cytotoxic dna lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6 4 photoproducts sinha and häder 2002 however uv induced lesions are enzymatically repaired in a variety of microorganisms via photoreactivation and excision repair coupling uv and ultrasonication triggers other inactivation mechanisms ultrasound radiation generates ros and increases the cell permeability it is known that acoustic cavitation induces both chemical and physical mechanical effects which are responsible for microbial inactivation as previously mentioned the mechanical effects dominate at low frequencies while under higher frequencies more ros are generated providing chemical oxidative effects ros arise from the collapse of microbubbles which causes high local pressures of 100 mpa and temperatures of 5000 k suslick 1998 specifically the calculated temperatures inside the bubble were in the range of 3400 k at 20 khz 3700 k at 1056 khz and highest of 4300 k at 355 khz ciawi et al 2006 to date cell inactivation by ros is thought to occur by the following mechanism the generated ros oxidize the membrane lipids ma et al 2019 and facilitate their transport to the cell to damage dna specifically oh radicals react with the heterocyclic dna bases and the sugar moiety by various mechanisms dizdaroglu and jaruga 2012 the so4 radical is also responsible for dna damage muller et al 1997 this mechanism is proposed for any aop types including uv and ultrasound based fenton like electrochemical and other processes it is known that ultrasound also causes acoustic streaming around oscillating bubbles which can induce shear stress and damage living cells hughes and nyborg 1962 shear stress above physiological level results in different biological effects including perforation of the membrane wu et al 2002 vanbavel 2007 for example 1 or 2 mhz hfus at 0 1 mpa was capable of inducing sufficient shear stress associated with microstreaming for generating pores on cells wu 2007 pore sizes are dependent on the cell membrane composition as well as on the distance of the bubble from the membrane such perforation increases the membrane permeability and allows the transfer of macromolecules and radicals through the pores into the cell to damage organelles and dna the phenomenon of cell permeabilization by acoustic cavitation during ultrasonic exposure is known as sonoporation lentacker et al 2014 zhou et al 2012 comprehensively studied sonoporation under hfus exposure at 1 5 mhz and reported that the resonant frequencies of the bubble lie in the range of 300 500 khz according to the minneart equation plesset and prosperetti 1977 this implies that the bubbles collapse at these resonant frequencies which can be considered as the most efficient us frequencies for producing pores sonoporation they also demonstrated that under the controlled collapse of a single bubble radius 10 μm and at a short distance 7 5 μm from the membrane of a xenopus oocyte sonication at 1 5 mpa of 1 5 mhz was sufficient to generate a pore with a radius of 0 182 0 052 μm fig 2 sonoporation as a phenomenon and a tool for non invasive delivery of large molecules such as genes into cells for therapeutic and biotechnological applications has been well studied ohl et al 2006 schlincher et al 2006 newman and bettinger 2007 kudo et al 2009 guo et al 2017 particularly deeks et al 2014 in their study of ultrasound enhanced gene transfer in e coli at discrete frequencies proposed that ultrasonication increased the membrane permeability via sonoporation allowing plasmid dna to be injected into the cell however sonoporation with respect to mechanisms of microbial inactivation has still been rarely addressed in the literature zhang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 so far the mechanism of sonophotocatalytic inactivation of e coli based on acoustic cavitation sonocatalytic reactions and sonoporation has been proposed by zhang et al 2017 the authors concluded that sonoporation facilitated penetration of more zno nanoparticles into cell thus contributing to an inactivation effect in case of m aeruginosa extracellular and intracellular oxidation have been found to be the key mechanisms of inactivation by sono fenton process at 20 and 800 khz respectively wu et al 2019 it has been shown that 20 khz at high intensity caused a pore formation fig 3 with a subsequent lethal effect extracellular oxidation with ros participation while 800 khz at low intensity slightly damaged the cell it might be expected that high intensity hfus would have formed pores as well nonetheless the authors reported that the fenton s reagent was delivered into cyanobacterial cells due to sonoporation at 800 khz leading to intracellular oxidation by generated ros alongside extracellular ros they can be generated intracellularly without addition of chemicals as a biological response to sonoporation the physical damage of a cell membrane by ultrasound induces an oxidative stress in cells and stimulates ros production via intracellular biochemical reactions jia et al 2018 showed that the intracellular ros production at 1 5 mhz was positively correlated with the degree of the reversible sonoporation of cancer cells amongst intracellular bioeffects juffermans et al 2009 observed the increase of membrane permeability for ca2 and intracellular levels of h2o2 in endothelial cells exposed to 1 mhz ultrasound and microbubbles recent investigation of us induced oxidative stress on human lens epithelial cells also revealed excessive levels of ros and ca2 per cell upon exposure to 500 khz for 300 s leading to cellular apoptosis rwei et al 2017 it has been known that membrane permeation is regulated by the specific transmembrane channel proteins which are selective toward target substrates klein et al 2019 the channels that facilitate the transmembrane flux of water are called aquaporins aqps agre et al 1998 agre 2004 for example e coli a model bacterium in inactivation studies has the aquaporin aqpz while 13 aqps were identified in humans and up to 30 aqps were described for some plants quigley et al 2001 ishibashi 2009 moreover aqps were also identified for other permeants such as urea nitrate ammonia anions hydrogen peroxide yasui et al 1999 bienert et al 2007 wu and beitz 2007 aqps are capable of transporting ros across phospholipid membranes new insights obtained with molecular dynamics modelling showed that water and ros had similar transport features and h2o2 might be transported by mammalian and plant aqps cordeiro 2015 it was also suggested that oh can enter a pore and oxidize amino acids that are responsible for channel selectivity other authors reported the reversible inhibition of aqps under oh exposure in green algae chara corallina henzler and steudle 2004 and corn roots ye and steudle 2006 via a gating mechanism proposed for plants the mechanisms of ros delivery into microbial cells are still not fully understood however liao et al 2018 recently suggested the us stimulated injection of ros from measurements of intracellular ros level of staphylococcus aureus further this accelerates the oxidation of intracellular biomolecules which leads to cell death in any case ros need to overcome an energy barrier 10 kj mol as assessed by cordeiro 2015 for the plant aquaporin to enter the channel and pass through its structure we believe that ultrasound irradiation transmits the free energy to the aqps thereby increasing the membrane permeability for ros finally existing knowledge provides evidence for a deeper insight into mechanical and sonochemical mechanisms of microbial inactivation under ultrasonic exposure via the following processes sonoporation i e the creation of artificial pores on the cell membrane acoustic cavitation and its associated effects such as streaming and microstreaming shear stress and shock waves cause physical damage of the membrane leading to its poration mechanical rupture and ultimately cell lysis intracellular generation of excessive ros and other internal bioeffects which are induced by shear oxidative stress in cells above the physiological level in turn this triggers the mechanism of cellular apoptosis by oxidative reactions such as lipid peroxidation etc energy stimulation of aquaporins or natural pores on the cell membranes which deliver extracellular ros into cells with subsequent oxidative reactions and cell death injection of extracellular ros into sonoporated cells 6 future research in view of the limited research on microbial inactivation by sonophotochemical aops as well as recent advancements in sonoporation we have elaborated the following recommendations for future research 1 in depth developments in the sono based aops should proceed with using the advanced tools of this cutting edge interdisciplinary research field of sonoporation 2 application of these tools for delivering ros into the cells through the membrane by means of aquaporins and other facilitators would enhance the potential of sono based aops to inactivate pathogenic micro ogranisms 3 to increase the inactivation efficiency reduce energy consumption and simultaneously address many chemical contaminants which may co exist with microorganisms in water to be treated hybrid sonophotochemical aops primarily sonophotocatalysis represent one of the most promising research directions 4 combination of high frequency ultrasound of 0 2 2 mhz range and uv vis radiation is expected to be explored in sonophotolytic and sonophotochemical aops including sono photo fenton like processes 5 supporting the minamata convention on mercury use of mercury free light sources such as uv leds excilamps solar lamps and natural solar radiation is encouraged 7 conclusions sonophotochemical aops for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms in water represent an overlooked research area in comparison with degradation of chemical pollutants we believe that these areas are emerging as promising alternatives for water disinfection and decontamination of other liquids and surfaces such as food and drinks medical instrumentation and food processing equipment the exact mechanisms of microbial inactivation at the molecular level under ultrasonic exposure in aqueous media have not been fully studied however recent developments in the field of sonoporation for biomedical application i e for delivery of target molecules such as ros genes etc into cells have provided deeper insights into possible mechanisms of inactivation and evidence for further research analysis of the research status of transmembrane transport showed that the mechanisms of increasing permeability of the cell membranes could be applied for inactivation

18451,the processes of enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr have been widely applied in wastewater treatment plants wwtps however meeting the increasingly stringent effluent discharge standards requires a more stable ebpr performance under the circumstances the identification of genus tetrasphaera as potential phosphate accumulating organisms paos has aroused much research interests on them in practice a large biovolume of genus tetrasphaera has been reliably observed in a number up to 80 of wwtps around the world tetrasphaera show a phenotype of aerobic polyphosphate poly p accumulation at the condition of assimilating glucose and or amino acids anaerobically in advance moreover tetrasphaera also present versatile physiologies of which some show no net orthophosphate removal while there are certainly some contradictory results and gaps in our knowledge concerning tetrasphaera this review summarizes the discovery abundance in wwtps functions on ebpr and biochemistry of the genus tetrasphaera in the existing literature it is expected to present the state of art progress about the genus tetrasphaera and to guide future r d work graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos tetrasphaera spp ca accumulibacter amino acids glucose poly β hydroxyalkanoate pha oxidation reduction potential orp 1 introduction high levels of nitrogen n and phosphorus p in surface water can cause eutrophication of which p is particularly a primary cause thus removal of p from wastewater is a key goal of biological nutrient removal bnr and is usually achieved by enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in wastewater treatment plants wwtps compared with the traditional chemical p removal methods ebpr is sustainable and cost effective and also offers an opportunity for p recovery at the start of the process hao and van loosdrecht 2003 associated with microbiology ebpr accomplishes bio p removal by cycling phosphate accumulating organisms paos capable of luxury p uptake between carbon feasting anaerobic and carbon famine aerobic anoxic conditions van loosdrecht et al 1997 after almost 30 years debate ca accumulibacter hereafter referred to as accumulibacter have been generally assumed to be the main functional paos in ebpr seviour and mcilroy 2008 moreover the mathematic models describing the bio p removal processes includingasm2 2d tudp b d and uctpho were all established with the physiology of accumulibacter varga et al 2018 so far these grey and or white box models fit well with full scale ebpr particularly tudp by fully considering the metabolisms of paos and are universally applied to learn design and optimize the bio p processes gernaey et al 2004 however fluctuations in full scale ebpr performance are observed even under seemingly favorable conditions zheng et al 2014 among others shortage of volatile fatty acids vfas and disturbances e g nitrate and or microorganisms were always the major causes oehmen et al 2007 zheng et al 2014 thus improving the stability and reliability of ebpr has been becoming a key objective for ebpr especially at a microbiological level coats et al 2017 a study by kong et al 2005 demonstrated that genus tetrasphaera hereafter referred to as tetrasphaera have the ability of aerobic p uptake following assimilating amino acids anaerobically furthermore this group of bacteria has been consistently detected in large abundance of biomass up to 35 at even higher levels than accumulibacter stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 since then on a series of studies further verified the identity of tetrasphaera as putative paos kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 2011 compared with accumulibacter tetrasphaera are better able to take up complex organics molecules such as amino acids and or glucose despite having no stored pha kristiansen et al 2013 moreover under anaerobic conditions some tetrasphaera are able to excrete vfas via fermentation herbst et al 2019 nguyen et al 2015 which can provide extra carbon sources for ebpr with the adoption of raman spectroscopy technology for in situ intracellular compound quantification fernando et al 2019 found that tetrasphaera could do a comparative or even higher p removal contribution in several full scale wwtps in denmark than accumulibacter this study also endorsed a revision of the established classical paos model based on accumulibacter however there are still some knowledge gaps and or disputes on the physiology metabolic pathway and intracellular compounds of tetrasphaera rubio rincón et al 2019 this review is an attempt to summarize the recent research advances and disputes of tetrasphaera to present a panaromatic overview the review fisrt focuses on sorting out the state of art progress about tetrasphaera by going through the history of studies on them chronologically then the review is to identify key environmental conditions probably associated with tetrasphaera in actual ebpr systems furthermore valuable highlights for future r d work are addressed 2 identification and abundance of tetrasphaera as paos 2 1 research timeline on tetrasphaera regarding the microbiological aspect of ebpr a number of review papers are available summarizing the progress and giving a holistic overview blackall et al 2002 gebremariam et al 2011 oehmen et al 2007 seviour et al 2003 however little review information about tetrasphaera has been presented yet in the course of identifying the microorganisms responsible for p removal in ebpr fig 1 tetrasphaera are one of the most recently confirmed putative paos indeed wagner et al 1994 quantified the acinetobacter population in a full scale wwtp and observed an unexpectedly large abundance 36 of phylum actinobacteria targeted by probe hgc in the system which now has been proved to be covered by tet mix probes designed for tetrasphaera nguyen et al 2011 however this report did not lead to more research on this group of bacteria in ebpr probably because at that period fig 1 the attention of the studies focused on verifying the actual role of accumulibacter as paos bond et al 1995 about 6 years later several isolated paos belonging to phylum actinobacteria were consecusively obtained and defined as tetrasphaera hanada et al 2002 maszenan et al 2000 then kong et al 2005 reported a high abudance of tetraspahera in a full scale wwtp in denmark after the definition of genus tetraspahera and initiated the systematic studies on the abundance physiology and metaobic pathway of them then some sporadic but important studies from japan and australia also reported the high abundance of tetrasphaera in several full scale wwtps beer et al 2006 wong et al 2005 even after these discovery however there was not too many studies focusing on tetrasphaera until 2011 nguyen et al 2011 and hereafter the focus on tetraspahera shifted from the paos identity and microbial abundance to their physiology from then on a multitude of studies tried to explore the carbon sources that tetrasphaera can utilize the intracellular compounds that tetrasphaera can store the metabolic pathways of tetraspahera to exert p release uptake as well as the exact contribution to p removal of tetrasphaera kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 particularly the adoption of genome analysis fish and raman microspectroscopy really advanced our knowledge on tetrasphaera although the studies on tetrasphaera is ongoing a summarization of available information so far can give us a rough picture on tetrasphaera which was also a spur for the current review 2 2 identification and importance of tetrasphaera as putative paos at the first definitation of tetrasphaera hanada et al 2002 maszenan et al 2000 they were cultured statically in prepared medium the experimental results just testified their p accumulating ability and at that moment few studies tried to verify their identidy as paos and the conformity to the classical p removal model then lee et al 2003 ever observed a relatively high correlation between the amount of actinobacteria tetrasphaera related bacteria based on the cumulative information and the p content of biomass the fish mar results in that study also supported the assumption that other paos actinobacteria as well as other betaprotebacteria besides the rhodocyclus related bacteria still most likely exist thus studies were steered toward the verification of pao identity of actinobacteria and to what contribution they could do in ebpr it was kong et al 2005 who firstly and comprehensively verified the p release uptake dynamics of tetrasphaera from a full scale wwtp with fish mar technology the targeted tetrasphaera showed a general feature of p uptake in an aerobic environment but only if they had taken up specific carbon organics oleic acid from wastewater in the previous anaerobic environment for the first time tetrasphaera have been proved in significant amounts and exhibiting paos behavior in full scale wwtps thereafter studies mainly explored the metabolisms besides abundance of tetrasphaera with various organics being their carbon sources although lots of effort had been done with enriched culture genomic analysis and energy balance the experimental results were far from concluding the importance of tetrasphaera in full scale ebpr i e the exact contribution of tetrasphaera to p removal compared with accumulibacter high abundance of tetrasphaera consistently observed in full scale wwtps and lack of in situ verification of the p removal contribution of tetrasphaera could not convince their importance until recently fernando et al 2019 deployed raman spectroscopy to quantify the poly p content of accumulibacter and tetrasphaera in various stages of full scale wwtps the results showed that tetrasphaera contributed a comparable level to p removal higher than accumulibacter although this study was conducted in several wwtps in denmark and biovolum instead of cell number were used for the calculation it really reflected that tetrasphaera could be important to ebpr at least under some favorable conditions based on the research progress so far the information about tetrasphaera are summazired in table 1 see the detailed discussion in section 3 hitherto six species were identified in tetrasphaera all of which were confirmed to be putative paos according to their p uptake property including t australiensis and t japonica maszenan et al 2000 t elongata hanada et al 2002 t jenkinsii t vanveenii and t veronensis mckenzie et al 2006 as summarized in table 1 three separate clades were defined to clearly represent the structure and compositions of tetrasphaera nguyen et al 2011 varieties exist in abundance growth rate morphology and carbon source preferecne among all clades or species kristiansen et al 2013 mckenzie et al 2006 according to kong et al 2005 the cocci in clusters of tetrads and the short rods were much more abundant than the filamentous morphotypes in a full scale wwtp as stated t elongata in clade 1 was the most abundant isolate in full scale wwtps in denmark kristiansen et al 2013 t elongata grew faster compared with others and as a result this isolate was always cultured and studied in pure culture as a representative of tetrasphaera kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 it is worth noting that the preferred carbon sources of each isolate to achieve p release uptake varied a lot and the results are not consistent for example nguyen et al 2015 one study found that some isolates tet3 19 defined populations could take up glucose and glutamic acid under anaerobic condition but were not able to take up p in addition t japonica and some filamentous tetrasphaera could synthesize pha like accumulibacter obviously each isolate of tetrasphaera presented some distinct features and consequently made the interpretation of experimental results more difficult 2 3 abundance of tetrasphaera in full scale wwtps in the past decade substantial efforts have been made to quantify tetrasphaera for justifying their importance in full scale ebpr beer et al 2006 lanham et al 2013 qiu et al 2019 here a summary of the abundance of tetrasphaera reported ever was presented in table 2 although various molecular techniques and or probes were applied in experiments in comparison with the abundance of accumulibacter the biomass quantification results certainly demonstrated that the presence of tetrasphaera should not be overlooked in ebpr from the studies listed in table 2 the abundances of tetrasphaera were detected in a wide range from 1 to 30 5 of the total bacteria even more convincingly a survey across 12 countries from 5 continents showed a high average abundance of tetrasphaera nielsen et al 2019 however the oligonucleotide probes designed and applied for detecting tetrasphaera in the literature were not consistent and the coverage varied considerably for example some detection applied hgc69a for a broad coverage of phylum actinobacteria while some studies used tetmix for the identification of genus tetrasphaera in one study wong et al 2005 the designed actino 1011 probe claimed to target t japonica while in another study this probe was designed for t elongata beer et al 2006 nguyen et al 2011 proposed that probe tet1 266 for clade i tet2 892 and tet2 174 for clade ii and tet3 654 for clade iii are recommended to apply in order to identify the most important tetrasphaera related paos 3 physiology of tetrasphaera 3 1 methodology for physiological and metabolic studies for the microbial physiological study reliable and valid methods or tools to quantify the relevant compounds including extracellular and intracellular products are the key stepping stones by adopting these methods the dynamics and flow of the targeted compounds could be traced and analyzed such as the poly p glycogen and pha in the exploration of tetrasphaera physiology particularly under practical condition with mixed microbial culture a pure culture is of vital importance in studying the biochemical properties of microorganisms as the substrates consumption and storage final products can be directly linked to the specific microorganisms for the isolations of tetrasphaera spp it was difficult to enrich some isolates to a certain amount due to their low growth rate kristiansen et al 2013 moreover a physiological study under practical condition with real wastewater is also necessary especially given that the tetrasphaera have three diverse clades with versatile metabolisms stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the results from a enriched culture with synthetic wastewater are hard to extrapolate into full scale cases as such several technologies have been commonly applied to trace and quantify the storage products poly p glycogen and pha by distinguishing tetrasphaera from accumulibacter including fish mar microautoradiography fish dapi 4 6 diamino 2 phenylindole staining and fish raman technologies fernando et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 however the staining methods can only be interpreted as qualitative information or as relative quantitative estimates moreover the dapi rna complex is known to interfere with poly p fluorometric quantification as highlighted by fernando et al 2019 in addition the conventional glycogen quanfication at a glucose equivalent after acid hydrolysis of cells has long been applied and also received concerns regarding the accuracy and interference from similar sugars then fernando et al 2019 adopted raman microspectroscopy method to quantitatively determine the level and dynamics of intracellular poly p and other storage products in a mixed microbial culture jointly with the help of fish targeting specific bacteria cell this metod allows us to distinguish the poly p or glycogen content in accumulibacter and tetrasphaera respectively and seems a reliable method for future studies however more confirmation may be needed to evaluate any interference to the results for instance from other molecular compounds kumamoto et al 2018 additionally in a measurement targets are hard to detect due to signals from massively existing molecules konorov et al 2011 3 2 key findings about the physiology of tetrasphaera although it has been proved that tetrasphaera have a comparable capability of p removal with accumulibacter in full scale wwtps fernando et al 2019 there is still lack of clear physiology or metabolic model describing their p removal process indeed lots of effort have been done following the definitation of tetrasphaera regarding their favorable carbon sources possible storage products and the conformity to classical ebpr metabolic model the results reported so far have reached some consensuses i tetrasphaera present aeobic p uptake under the premise of organics storage in the prior anaerobic environment ii tetrasphaera have the ability to conduct fermentation botero et al 2018 and iii pha was not detected with the tetrasphaera taking significant p removal under anaerobic aerobic cycle point i showed a similarity in fulfilling p removal with accumulibacter while point ii and point iii were always denoted two distinct differences distinguishing these two group bacteria 3 2 1 fermentation capability of tetrasphaera the fermentation capability of tetrasphaera has been clearly verified by kong et al 2008 and the batch tests with glucose in the anaerobic condition showed that tetrasphaera were mainly responsible for the glucose fermentation not only in ebpr plants but also in n removal wwtps then the fermentation of glucose amino acids and other large molecular carbon were further reported and confirmed by a series of studies kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2011 although the interaction or link between the fermentation ability of tetrasphaera and their p removal is still not clear fermentation provides tetrasphaera with an energy acquisition pathway it would be a supplement or alternative energy supply for maintenance and growth of tetrasphaera to poly p hydrolysis also vice versa and probably the poly p degradation would be frustrated and ceased thereby losing the p removal physiology marques et al 2017 ever reported that in a tetrashpaera enriched culture glucose glutamate asparate and glycine as the sole carbon source did not lead to p release anaerobically but p uptake by calculating the energy balance energy generated from fermentation of these carbon sources could account for about 90 of the energetic demands for p uptake glycogen production and anaerobic maintenance as such the energy from the hydrolysis of poly p was not necessary in addition another study rubio rincón et al 2019 to verify the suitability of lactate as carbon source for ebpr may also support the above assumption in that study changing the carbon souce from a mixed carbon source acetate propionate and lactate to sole lactate led to decrease of accumulibacter population and increase of tetrasphaera the p removal performance of the system also disappeared the authors suggested that the main carbon source stored did not require additional atp from the hydrolysis of poly p and this failure of ebpr was likely to be the metabolic diversion to fermentation it is worth noting that the fermentation capability of tetrasphaera was not always a nuisance and on the one hand allows them to survive under such a dynamic environment in activated sludge systems on the other hand the fermentation capability of tetrasphaera could also do favor to the stability of ebpr for some sewage e g municipal sewage with high percentage of industrial sewage with small quantity of vfas and large proportion of large molecular carbon organics tetrasphaera could contribute to the p removal not only directly but also via their fermentation ability to supply vfas to accumulibacter marques et al 2017 this is the basis for the recently proposed two phosphate accumulating organisms model botero et al 2018 dunlap et al 2016 which needs more studies and verification in addition the negative results of the above two studies were probably associated with the carbon sources used or biased by the experimental methods thus the link between fermentation physiology of tetrasphaera and p removal deserves more exploration 3 2 2 can glucose be the carbon source of tetrasphaera since the first dynamic incubation study under anaerobic aerobic cycle from lee et al 2003 a multitude of studies tried to clarify what kind of carbon sources tetrasphaera could take up for p release and what the storage products were for subsequent aerobic p uptake in terms of the carbon sources carbonhydrates vfas and amino acids representing the most common categories have been tested including acetate glucose glutamate glycine and lactate herein some disputes and inconsistent results always existed on the ability of tetrasphaera to take up these carbon organics for p removal particularly on glucose which was regarded as another distinct feature distinguishing tetrasphaera from accumulibacter kong et al 2005 ever evalutated various organics as carbon sources of tetrasphaera to promote the aerobic p uptake in dynamic feast and famine cycles the organics included formic acid propionate butyric acid pyruvate lactate ethanol glucose oleic acid aspartic acid glutamic acid leucine glycine thymidine and mixed amino acids however fish mar results showed that none of them could be taken up by the tetrasphaera targeted by actino 221 and actino 658 probes except casamino acid and acetate in another study marques et al 2017 glucose aspartate glutamate and glycine were explored with an enriched tetrasphaera culture the results from fish mar showed that tetrasphaera presented p uptake anaerobically with each of these four carbon solely it seemed that glucose cannot support the p removal physiology of tetrasphaera on the contrary kong et al 2005 and nguyen et al 2011 demonstrated that tetrasphaera were able to consume glucose anaerobically to promote p uptake aerobically following a similar experimental prototype with fish mar it is worth noting that all these studies were conducted in a mixed microbial culture and fish mar helped to locate tetrasphaera in addition the incubation period of mar is a critical factor to allow sufficient cellular incorporation of the radioisotope thus the inconsistency regarding the glucose utilization for p removal was probably attributed to the bias from mixed culture and tools used and it is difficult to confirm which results are correct then a genome analysis from kristiansen et al 2013 showed that tetrasphaera have the genes coding the enzymes for glucose assimilation most importanatly an experiment conducted in a pure culture of t elongata explicitly showed a typical pao phenotype with glucose as carbon source as t elgontata represents the most abundant clade in full scale plants in denmark kristiansen et al 2013 thus glucose can support the p removal physiology of tetrasphaera the reason why glucose led to anaerobic p uptake in previous study marques et al 2017 was probably that the tetrasphaera in the enriched culture did not exert p release uptake physiology at all in the enrichement stage calculation based on pha might overestimate the contribution of tetrasphaera as fish staining was not applied directely to confirm that the poly p pool of tetrasphaera was low and resulted in a p uptake anaerobically in the batch test to store energy to response the carbon shift to glucose amino acid as carbon source in culture stage this also reflects that the physiology of p removal on glucose was affected by environmental condition 3 2 3 is glycogen the storage products of tetrasphaera as summarized in table 1 and above statement despite that t japonica and some filamentous tetrasphaera can store pha it is generally accepted that tetrasphaera cannot synthesize and store pha anaerobically to fuel the p uptake aerobically thus it is a high research interest to find out what storage productes will take the role of pha in tetrasphaera for p removal herein glycogen was always regarded as one important energy storage compound in tetrasphaera so were succinate pyruvate and amino acids kristiansen et al 2013 contrary to the anaerobic glycogen consumption in classical paos metabolic model the glycogen replenishment of tetrasphaera occurred in anaerobic condition and then was consumed for p uptake aerobically kristiansen et al 2013 reported that all the genes encoding for enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis were present in tetrasphaera in addition an increase of intracellular glycogen content in the pure t elongata under anaerobic condition was also observed with glucose as carbon source moreover glycogen production in the anaerobic phase was also observed in another study with glucose glutamate and aspartate as carbon source respectively marques et al 2017 glycogen seemed to be an key storage polymer for tetrasphaera to achieve p removal however fernando et al 2019 reported a totally contrary result that no glycogen was detected in pure t elongata or tetrasphaera in activated sludge with glucose as carbon source by raman microspectroscopy the authors assumed that the previous glycogen detection could be wrong due to the in vitro glycogen quantification method used commonly by the contrast raman technology can do the quantification in situ and more accurately in addition this inconsistency was also explained by the versatile metabolic pathways of tetrasphaera and glycogen synthesis in that study was probably not necessary by tracing back to kong et al 2005 inhibiting the glycogen hydrolysis by inhibitor did not suppress the uptake of oleic acid and casamino acids by actinobacteria and the glycogen was not necessary for the energy supply herein the explanation of versatile metabolism seems more justified than attributing to the bias from quantification method raman microspectroscopy has been used to quantify the glycogen in human embryonic stem cells with advantages of time saving konorov et al 2011 while some drawbacks are stated in section 3 1 in addition the conventional glyconge quantification method has long been applied in experiments and the accuracy has been approved lanham et al 2012 worthnoting is that the validation of the raman method on glycogen quantification was via comparision to the conventional method konorov et al 2011 thus it is highly possible that no detection of glycogen demonstrated that glycogen is not always the intracellular storage products and identification of other products needs further studies overall the physiological characteristics of tetrasphaera from the above information are summarized in table 3 in comparison with accumulibacter kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 it is clear now that the tetrasphaera have a highly versatile preference in substrates assimilation and energy provision and compared with accumulibacter have many alternative options to survive in a dynamic environment nielsen et al 2019 all these features make the experimental results inconsistent sometimes and more difficult to interpretate 3 2 4 can tetrasphaera achieve denitrification there is something of a paucity of research addressing the capacity of tetrasphaera to achieve denitrifying ebpr in a dynamic environment but findings on the reduction of no3 n to no2 n by tetrasphaera have been reported marques et al 2018 studied the denitrification capacity of tetrasphaera in a mixed culture 60 of tetrasphaera the results show that tetrasphaera has the capability of denitrification but the specific p uptake rate in anoxic condition was insignificant compared with accumulibacter 0 09 mmol p g vss h compared with 0 58 for accumulibacter 3 2 5 metabolic model proposed for tetrasphaera according to the experimental results several metabolic models regarding the p removal of tetrasphaera have been configured kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 as these models were proposed based on various carbon sources and microbial cultures mixed or pure culture the mass flow varied a lot regarding the storage compounds and flow direction as discussed in section 3 2 3 kristiansen et al 2013 proposed a model describing the metabolism of t elongata as a representative in ebpr with glucose as the substrate in the experiment under anaerobic conditions tetrasphaera take up glucose using poly p as an energy source and glucose can be stored as glycogen in subsequent aerobic conditions the stored glycogen can be used for growth and for replenishing supplies of poly p in the model proposed by nguyen et al 2015 with glycine as carbon source no glycogen but intracellular glycine was accumulated under anaerobic conditions as well as small amounts of glutamine serine and alanine these intracellular metabolites can then be used to power the p uptake aerobically moreover tetrasphaera share some key metabolic pathways with accumulibacter such as tca cycle and poly p degradation synthesis overall tetrasphaera are extremely versatile capable of surviving in highly dynamic environments and in a large abundance this is why there is still lack of a generic model the study on the metabolism of tetrasphaera is still in progress particularly on the storage products in anaerobic stage 4 factors probably influencing tetrasphaera in ebpr in mixed culture 4 1 influent compositions and temperature with the data from table 2 a statistical correlation analysis was then conducted between the abundance of tetrasphaera diameter of the bubbles and the temperature vertical axis industrial wastewater percentage horizontal axis as depicted in fig 2 the bubbles filled with diagonal were from the s2ebpr process which is believed to be advantageous for tetrasphaera proliferation onnis hayden et al 2018 and the remaining circles represents the data from conventional ebpr by excluding the s2ebpr data i e bubbles filled with diagonal as presented in fig 2 a large amount of bubbles were gathered between 10 and 20 c especially the bubbles with large diameter it implies that a temperate environment probably supported the proliferation of tetrasphaera on the other hand the bubbles representing the tetrasphaera abundance from australia and singapore was pinned on the top 20 30 c with a low abundance qualitatively at high temperaturestetrasphaera seemed to be outcompeted by other microorganisms qiu et al 2019 the low abundance of tetrasphaera in wwtps from spain also supported this assumption rey martínez et al 2019 in terms of correlation between tetrasphaera abundance and industrial wastewater percentage fig 2 also presents some significant feature most of the wwtps receiving more industrial wastewater had a high abundance of tetrasphaera while most of the wwtps mainly receiving domestic wastewater had a low tetrasphaera abundance more specifically the bubbles from the same study kong et al 2005 also presented a similar distribution black hollow bubbles mielczarek et al 2013 ever discussed the correlation between the microbial community e g abundance of tetrasphaera and wastewater characteristics process design and operation with the data of over 3 years from 28 danish wwtps the analysis showed that the abundance of tetrasphaera only presented weak correlations with the amount of industrial wastewater due to the spatial limitation the temperature was not considered in their analysis as such all these results qualitatively attested the correlation between tetrasphaera proliferation and the wastewater quality and temperature 4 2 anaerobic conditions as indicated in many publications barnard et al 2017 it appears that the most important parameter for optimal ebpr is to have a deep anaerobic zone a lower oxidation and reduction potential orp level for paos by doing so the anaerobic conditions give a competitive advantage for substrate uptake over other heterotrophic bacteria van loosdrecht et al 1997 thus the stored products power the p uptake aerobically however a concern arises is the biochemistry of p removal of tetrasphaera controlled or influenced by the anaerobic condition it is frustrating that previous studies on tetrasphaera rarely mentioned the exact orp value under the anaerobic condition however some information can also be qualitatively summarized from fig 2 on the left side area with no industrial wastewater flowing in the black bubbles filled with diagonals represent the wwtps with the side stream ebpr s2ebpr process which is believed to conceive a deep anaerobic zone barnard et al 2017 onnis hayden et al 2018 obviously the abundance of tetrasphaera with s2ebpr was higher than others in the same left area in addition barnard et al 2017 presumed that orp 200 mv favors the organisms such as tetrasphaera that can ferment higher carbon compound which was also stated by onnis hayden et al 2018 although many studies have already showed that tetrasphaera can ferment glucose and various amino acid aerobically herbst et al 2019 maszenan et al 2000 herbst et al 2019 verified that the poly p degradation and release from t elongata was enhanced under anaerobic conditions which is believed to be an extra energy supplement for t elongata it would appear that tetrasphaera also require anaerobic conditions to get competitive advantages particularly concentrated anaerobic conditions onnis hayden et al 2018 according to the metabolic models of tetrasphaera in section 3 2 tetrasphaera shows p uptake only when they have taken up organics matter and stored it intracellularly under prior anaerobic conditions kong et al 2005 kristiansen et al 2013 although there is still no consistency on what kinds of storage products are coupled with p uptake herbst et al 2019 the anaerobically stored products are necessary in another study from kong et al 2008 tetrasphaera were able to ferment glucose after 3 days in this condition which suggests that tetrasphaera can benefit from long term anaerobic conditions in order to utilize glucose for subsequent p uptake thus the impact of anaerobic conditions on tetrasphaera requires further study 4 3 the importance of tetrasphaera in ebpr by summarizing the above information it can be concluded that tetrasphaera were consistently detected in a large abundance and presented a biochemistry of p removal fig 2 however as indicated by fernando et al 2019 the abundance of tetrasphaera alone cannot prove their importance in the ebpr process in other words the tetrasphaera presenting a p removal physiology in batch tests cannot refer to that p removal being able to function properly in full scale wwtps for instance accumulibacter has generally been regarded as the key paos in ebpr however their functions generally fail due to interference from other factors zheng et al 2014 most recently fernando et al 2019 showed that tetrasphaera contributed to a comparable or even higher p removal than accumulibacter 12 50 and 10 48 respectively in 8 danish wwtps although the contribution of tetrasphaera has not been verified universally or gloably this result really sheds light on improving the ebpr from microbiology additionally the versatile physiology and metabolism of tetrasphaera bring about a concern of how to maintain an appropriate operational condition for them silva et al 2012 ever presented a comprehensive analysis of ebpr performance in several pilot and full scale mbrs the highest p removal was unexpectedly achieved in the reactor where accumulibacter and tetrasphaera were present in low number obvisouly appropriate operational conditions can also ensure small amounts of paos exerting big contribution to p removal as discussed in section 3 and 4 the operational conditions sewage properties anaerobic uint and environmental conditions temperature could not only afftect the abundance of tetrasphaera but also determine their physiologies on work fermentation and p removal herbst et al 2019 the change of these conditions could probably alter the metabolic pathway of tetraspaera from significant p removal to weak performance marques et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 studied the p release of activated sludge 0 95 3 8 accumulibacter and 0 23 1 8 tetrasphaera from a tropic area with glucose an initial adaptation period was observed for glucose to stimulate p release and the authors assumed that the glucose was probably fermented by tetrasphaera and the fermentation products induced p release it implies that the tetrasphaera under this environment probably took more fermentation physiology to supply carbon source for accumulibacter and involve in the p removal indirectly although tetrasphaera did not release p as paos the role of them was obviously favorable here comes anther question that whether it is proper to evaluate the contribution or importance of tetrasphaera based on p removal i e direct involvement in ebpr anyway although the contribution of tetrasphaera to p removal has been verified to be comparable to accumulibacter fernando et al 2019 further research is highly recommended to figure out how to keep tetrasphaera proceeding p removal physiology stably and what other factors e g nitrate to the accumulibacter in anaerobic condition could interfere this physiology 5 conclusions over the years the cumulative knowledge of tetrasphaera has significantly advanced the study on ebpr the comparative capacity of p removal as accumulibacter has been verified and presents advantages on utilizing large organics compounds meanwhile there are still gaps in our knowledge to be filled by future studies based on the existing literature and review based analysis some highlights can be concluded and some suggestions for further work can also be proposed 5 1 highlights for tetrasphaera in ebpr tetrasphaera consist of at least four identified species t jenkinsii t australiensis t japonica and t elongata as well as other uncultured species which is probably the basis leading to versatile physiologies reported tetrasphaera were reported consistently in a large abundance and can metabolize on and or ferment glucose and various amino acids for p removal and there is a synergy between tetrasphaera and accumulibacter to promote the p removal tetrasphaera have the capability to achieve a comparable or even higher p removal contribution compared with accumulibacter disputes exist on whether tetrasphaera have the ability to synthesize glycogen as storage products and further research is required on this topic operational and environmental conditions could affect the abundance of tetrasphaera and alter the metabolic pathway of them thus an appropriate condition promoting the p removal physiology of tetrasphaera should be figured out 5 2 suggestions for future work advancement in molecular techniques significantly benefits studies on microbial population currently fish and 16s rna amplicon analysis are the two most popular tools to achieve this purpose however the results have been known to present discrepancies between these two microbial analytical methods recently raman fish was applied to study tetrasphaera and is recommended to attest mutually to make a comparison and reliable results the detailed metabolic pathways of tetrasphaera in various environments are yet to be exclusively revealed and explained tetrasphaera can alternate their metabolic pathways to supply energy for growth and maintenance questions still remain to be answered about what factor induces their metabolism to alternate and how different metabolism pairs in anaerobic and aerobic phases can achieve p removal further study of the metabolic response will provide strategies to regulate them how can tetrasphaera survive and contribute to p removal in full scale wwtps to answer this question a suggestion for future research is the kinetic study of tetrasphaera particularly under mixed cultures so far few researchers have studied the dynamic kinetics of tetrasphaera and their competitive ability to others despite their abundance and physiology the kinetics of tetrasphaera determines their ability and contribution to p removal calculation of energy balance is a good way to test to what extent one microorganism relies on one biochemical process for growth and maintenance thus future work should evaluate the p removal potential of tetrasphaera by considering the energy supplied from organics substrates of course an accurate calculation of energy balance must be based on a clear metabolic pathway thus this part of the work can be cross evaluated with metabolic studies different species of tetrasphaera own a specific metabolic preference which may contribute to contradictory results and difficulty in interpretation thus future work on metabolism or kinetics should be accompanied by an analysis of the microbial population declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the study was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51878022 and also by the special fund from beijing advanced innovation center for future urban design 2019 
18451,the processes of enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr have been widely applied in wastewater treatment plants wwtps however meeting the increasingly stringent effluent discharge standards requires a more stable ebpr performance under the circumstances the identification of genus tetrasphaera as potential phosphate accumulating organisms paos has aroused much research interests on them in practice a large biovolume of genus tetrasphaera has been reliably observed in a number up to 80 of wwtps around the world tetrasphaera show a phenotype of aerobic polyphosphate poly p accumulation at the condition of assimilating glucose and or amino acids anaerobically in advance moreover tetrasphaera also present versatile physiologies of which some show no net orthophosphate removal while there are certainly some contradictory results and gaps in our knowledge concerning tetrasphaera this review summarizes the discovery abundance in wwtps functions on ebpr and biochemistry of the genus tetrasphaera in the existing literature it is expected to present the state of art progress about the genus tetrasphaera and to guide future r d work graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos tetrasphaera spp ca accumulibacter amino acids glucose poly β hydroxyalkanoate pha oxidation reduction potential orp 1 introduction high levels of nitrogen n and phosphorus p in surface water can cause eutrophication of which p is particularly a primary cause thus removal of p from wastewater is a key goal of biological nutrient removal bnr and is usually achieved by enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in wastewater treatment plants wwtps compared with the traditional chemical p removal methods ebpr is sustainable and cost effective and also offers an opportunity for p recovery at the start of the process hao and van loosdrecht 2003 associated with microbiology ebpr accomplishes bio p removal by cycling phosphate accumulating organisms paos capable of luxury p uptake between carbon feasting anaerobic and carbon famine aerobic anoxic conditions van loosdrecht et al 1997 after almost 30 years debate ca accumulibacter hereafter referred to as accumulibacter have been generally assumed to be the main functional paos in ebpr seviour and mcilroy 2008 moreover the mathematic models describing the bio p removal processes includingasm2 2d tudp b d and uctpho were all established with the physiology of accumulibacter varga et al 2018 so far these grey and or white box models fit well with full scale ebpr particularly tudp by fully considering the metabolisms of paos and are universally applied to learn design and optimize the bio p processes gernaey et al 2004 however fluctuations in full scale ebpr performance are observed even under seemingly favorable conditions zheng et al 2014 among others shortage of volatile fatty acids vfas and disturbances e g nitrate and or microorganisms were always the major causes oehmen et al 2007 zheng et al 2014 thus improving the stability and reliability of ebpr has been becoming a key objective for ebpr especially at a microbiological level coats et al 2017 a study by kong et al 2005 demonstrated that genus tetrasphaera hereafter referred to as tetrasphaera have the ability of aerobic p uptake following assimilating amino acids anaerobically furthermore this group of bacteria has been consistently detected in large abundance of biomass up to 35 at even higher levels than accumulibacter stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 since then on a series of studies further verified the identity of tetrasphaera as putative paos kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 2011 compared with accumulibacter tetrasphaera are better able to take up complex organics molecules such as amino acids and or glucose despite having no stored pha kristiansen et al 2013 moreover under anaerobic conditions some tetrasphaera are able to excrete vfas via fermentation herbst et al 2019 nguyen et al 2015 which can provide extra carbon sources for ebpr with the adoption of raman spectroscopy technology for in situ intracellular compound quantification fernando et al 2019 found that tetrasphaera could do a comparative or even higher p removal contribution in several full scale wwtps in denmark than accumulibacter this study also endorsed a revision of the established classical paos model based on accumulibacter however there are still some knowledge gaps and or disputes on the physiology metabolic pathway and intracellular compounds of tetrasphaera rubio rincón et al 2019 this review is an attempt to summarize the recent research advances and disputes of tetrasphaera to present a panaromatic overview the review fisrt focuses on sorting out the state of art progress about tetrasphaera by going through the history of studies on them chronologically then the review is to identify key environmental conditions probably associated with tetrasphaera in actual ebpr systems furthermore valuable highlights for future r d work are addressed 2 identification and abundance of tetrasphaera as paos 2 1 research timeline on tetrasphaera regarding the microbiological aspect of ebpr a number of review papers are available summarizing the progress and giving a holistic overview blackall et al 2002 gebremariam et al 2011 oehmen et al 2007 seviour et al 2003 however little review information about tetrasphaera has been presented yet in the course of identifying the microorganisms responsible for p removal in ebpr fig 1 tetrasphaera are one of the most recently confirmed putative paos indeed wagner et al 1994 quantified the acinetobacter population in a full scale wwtp and observed an unexpectedly large abundance 36 of phylum actinobacteria targeted by probe hgc in the system which now has been proved to be covered by tet mix probes designed for tetrasphaera nguyen et al 2011 however this report did not lead to more research on this group of bacteria in ebpr probably because at that period fig 1 the attention of the studies focused on verifying the actual role of accumulibacter as paos bond et al 1995 about 6 years later several isolated paos belonging to phylum actinobacteria were consecusively obtained and defined as tetrasphaera hanada et al 2002 maszenan et al 2000 then kong et al 2005 reported a high abudance of tetraspahera in a full scale wwtp in denmark after the definition of genus tetraspahera and initiated the systematic studies on the abundance physiology and metaobic pathway of them then some sporadic but important studies from japan and australia also reported the high abundance of tetrasphaera in several full scale wwtps beer et al 2006 wong et al 2005 even after these discovery however there was not too many studies focusing on tetrasphaera until 2011 nguyen et al 2011 and hereafter the focus on tetraspahera shifted from the paos identity and microbial abundance to their physiology from then on a multitude of studies tried to explore the carbon sources that tetrasphaera can utilize the intracellular compounds that tetrasphaera can store the metabolic pathways of tetraspahera to exert p release uptake as well as the exact contribution to p removal of tetrasphaera kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 particularly the adoption of genome analysis fish and raman microspectroscopy really advanced our knowledge on tetrasphaera although the studies on tetrasphaera is ongoing a summarization of available information so far can give us a rough picture on tetrasphaera which was also a spur for the current review 2 2 identification and importance of tetrasphaera as putative paos at the first definitation of tetrasphaera hanada et al 2002 maszenan et al 2000 they were cultured statically in prepared medium the experimental results just testified their p accumulating ability and at that moment few studies tried to verify their identidy as paos and the conformity to the classical p removal model then lee et al 2003 ever observed a relatively high correlation between the amount of actinobacteria tetrasphaera related bacteria based on the cumulative information and the p content of biomass the fish mar results in that study also supported the assumption that other paos actinobacteria as well as other betaprotebacteria besides the rhodocyclus related bacteria still most likely exist thus studies were steered toward the verification of pao identity of actinobacteria and to what contribution they could do in ebpr it was kong et al 2005 who firstly and comprehensively verified the p release uptake dynamics of tetrasphaera from a full scale wwtp with fish mar technology the targeted tetrasphaera showed a general feature of p uptake in an aerobic environment but only if they had taken up specific carbon organics oleic acid from wastewater in the previous anaerobic environment for the first time tetrasphaera have been proved in significant amounts and exhibiting paos behavior in full scale wwtps thereafter studies mainly explored the metabolisms besides abundance of tetrasphaera with various organics being their carbon sources although lots of effort had been done with enriched culture genomic analysis and energy balance the experimental results were far from concluding the importance of tetrasphaera in full scale ebpr i e the exact contribution of tetrasphaera to p removal compared with accumulibacter high abundance of tetrasphaera consistently observed in full scale wwtps and lack of in situ verification of the p removal contribution of tetrasphaera could not convince their importance until recently fernando et al 2019 deployed raman spectroscopy to quantify the poly p content of accumulibacter and tetrasphaera in various stages of full scale wwtps the results showed that tetrasphaera contributed a comparable level to p removal higher than accumulibacter although this study was conducted in several wwtps in denmark and biovolum instead of cell number were used for the calculation it really reflected that tetrasphaera could be important to ebpr at least under some favorable conditions based on the research progress so far the information about tetrasphaera are summazired in table 1 see the detailed discussion in section 3 hitherto six species were identified in tetrasphaera all of which were confirmed to be putative paos according to their p uptake property including t australiensis and t japonica maszenan et al 2000 t elongata hanada et al 2002 t jenkinsii t vanveenii and t veronensis mckenzie et al 2006 as summarized in table 1 three separate clades were defined to clearly represent the structure and compositions of tetrasphaera nguyen et al 2011 varieties exist in abundance growth rate morphology and carbon source preferecne among all clades or species kristiansen et al 2013 mckenzie et al 2006 according to kong et al 2005 the cocci in clusters of tetrads and the short rods were much more abundant than the filamentous morphotypes in a full scale wwtp as stated t elongata in clade 1 was the most abundant isolate in full scale wwtps in denmark kristiansen et al 2013 t elongata grew faster compared with others and as a result this isolate was always cultured and studied in pure culture as a representative of tetrasphaera kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 it is worth noting that the preferred carbon sources of each isolate to achieve p release uptake varied a lot and the results are not consistent for example nguyen et al 2015 one study found that some isolates tet3 19 defined populations could take up glucose and glutamic acid under anaerobic condition but were not able to take up p in addition t japonica and some filamentous tetrasphaera could synthesize pha like accumulibacter obviously each isolate of tetrasphaera presented some distinct features and consequently made the interpretation of experimental results more difficult 2 3 abundance of tetrasphaera in full scale wwtps in the past decade substantial efforts have been made to quantify tetrasphaera for justifying their importance in full scale ebpr beer et al 2006 lanham et al 2013 qiu et al 2019 here a summary of the abundance of tetrasphaera reported ever was presented in table 2 although various molecular techniques and or probes were applied in experiments in comparison with the abundance of accumulibacter the biomass quantification results certainly demonstrated that the presence of tetrasphaera should not be overlooked in ebpr from the studies listed in table 2 the abundances of tetrasphaera were detected in a wide range from 1 to 30 5 of the total bacteria even more convincingly a survey across 12 countries from 5 continents showed a high average abundance of tetrasphaera nielsen et al 2019 however the oligonucleotide probes designed and applied for detecting tetrasphaera in the literature were not consistent and the coverage varied considerably for example some detection applied hgc69a for a broad coverage of phylum actinobacteria while some studies used tetmix for the identification of genus tetrasphaera in one study wong et al 2005 the designed actino 1011 probe claimed to target t japonica while in another study this probe was designed for t elongata beer et al 2006 nguyen et al 2011 proposed that probe tet1 266 for clade i tet2 892 and tet2 174 for clade ii and tet3 654 for clade iii are recommended to apply in order to identify the most important tetrasphaera related paos 3 physiology of tetrasphaera 3 1 methodology for physiological and metabolic studies for the microbial physiological study reliable and valid methods or tools to quantify the relevant compounds including extracellular and intracellular products are the key stepping stones by adopting these methods the dynamics and flow of the targeted compounds could be traced and analyzed such as the poly p glycogen and pha in the exploration of tetrasphaera physiology particularly under practical condition with mixed microbial culture a pure culture is of vital importance in studying the biochemical properties of microorganisms as the substrates consumption and storage final products can be directly linked to the specific microorganisms for the isolations of tetrasphaera spp it was difficult to enrich some isolates to a certain amount due to their low growth rate kristiansen et al 2013 moreover a physiological study under practical condition with real wastewater is also necessary especially given that the tetrasphaera have three diverse clades with versatile metabolisms stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the results from a enriched culture with synthetic wastewater are hard to extrapolate into full scale cases as such several technologies have been commonly applied to trace and quantify the storage products poly p glycogen and pha by distinguishing tetrasphaera from accumulibacter including fish mar microautoradiography fish dapi 4 6 diamino 2 phenylindole staining and fish raman technologies fernando et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 however the staining methods can only be interpreted as qualitative information or as relative quantitative estimates moreover the dapi rna complex is known to interfere with poly p fluorometric quantification as highlighted by fernando et al 2019 in addition the conventional glycogen quanfication at a glucose equivalent after acid hydrolysis of cells has long been applied and also received concerns regarding the accuracy and interference from similar sugars then fernando et al 2019 adopted raman microspectroscopy method to quantitatively determine the level and dynamics of intracellular poly p and other storage products in a mixed microbial culture jointly with the help of fish targeting specific bacteria cell this metod allows us to distinguish the poly p or glycogen content in accumulibacter and tetrasphaera respectively and seems a reliable method for future studies however more confirmation may be needed to evaluate any interference to the results for instance from other molecular compounds kumamoto et al 2018 additionally in a measurement targets are hard to detect due to signals from massively existing molecules konorov et al 2011 3 2 key findings about the physiology of tetrasphaera although it has been proved that tetrasphaera have a comparable capability of p removal with accumulibacter in full scale wwtps fernando et al 2019 there is still lack of clear physiology or metabolic model describing their p removal process indeed lots of effort have been done following the definitation of tetrasphaera regarding their favorable carbon sources possible storage products and the conformity to classical ebpr metabolic model the results reported so far have reached some consensuses i tetrasphaera present aeobic p uptake under the premise of organics storage in the prior anaerobic environment ii tetrasphaera have the ability to conduct fermentation botero et al 2018 and iii pha was not detected with the tetrasphaera taking significant p removal under anaerobic aerobic cycle point i showed a similarity in fulfilling p removal with accumulibacter while point ii and point iii were always denoted two distinct differences distinguishing these two group bacteria 3 2 1 fermentation capability of tetrasphaera the fermentation capability of tetrasphaera has been clearly verified by kong et al 2008 and the batch tests with glucose in the anaerobic condition showed that tetrasphaera were mainly responsible for the glucose fermentation not only in ebpr plants but also in n removal wwtps then the fermentation of glucose amino acids and other large molecular carbon were further reported and confirmed by a series of studies kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2011 although the interaction or link between the fermentation ability of tetrasphaera and their p removal is still not clear fermentation provides tetrasphaera with an energy acquisition pathway it would be a supplement or alternative energy supply for maintenance and growth of tetrasphaera to poly p hydrolysis also vice versa and probably the poly p degradation would be frustrated and ceased thereby losing the p removal physiology marques et al 2017 ever reported that in a tetrashpaera enriched culture glucose glutamate asparate and glycine as the sole carbon source did not lead to p release anaerobically but p uptake by calculating the energy balance energy generated from fermentation of these carbon sources could account for about 90 of the energetic demands for p uptake glycogen production and anaerobic maintenance as such the energy from the hydrolysis of poly p was not necessary in addition another study rubio rincón et al 2019 to verify the suitability of lactate as carbon source for ebpr may also support the above assumption in that study changing the carbon souce from a mixed carbon source acetate propionate and lactate to sole lactate led to decrease of accumulibacter population and increase of tetrasphaera the p removal performance of the system also disappeared the authors suggested that the main carbon source stored did not require additional atp from the hydrolysis of poly p and this failure of ebpr was likely to be the metabolic diversion to fermentation it is worth noting that the fermentation capability of tetrasphaera was not always a nuisance and on the one hand allows them to survive under such a dynamic environment in activated sludge systems on the other hand the fermentation capability of tetrasphaera could also do favor to the stability of ebpr for some sewage e g municipal sewage with high percentage of industrial sewage with small quantity of vfas and large proportion of large molecular carbon organics tetrasphaera could contribute to the p removal not only directly but also via their fermentation ability to supply vfas to accumulibacter marques et al 2017 this is the basis for the recently proposed two phosphate accumulating organisms model botero et al 2018 dunlap et al 2016 which needs more studies and verification in addition the negative results of the above two studies were probably associated with the carbon sources used or biased by the experimental methods thus the link between fermentation physiology of tetrasphaera and p removal deserves more exploration 3 2 2 can glucose be the carbon source of tetrasphaera since the first dynamic incubation study under anaerobic aerobic cycle from lee et al 2003 a multitude of studies tried to clarify what kind of carbon sources tetrasphaera could take up for p release and what the storage products were for subsequent aerobic p uptake in terms of the carbon sources carbonhydrates vfas and amino acids representing the most common categories have been tested including acetate glucose glutamate glycine and lactate herein some disputes and inconsistent results always existed on the ability of tetrasphaera to take up these carbon organics for p removal particularly on glucose which was regarded as another distinct feature distinguishing tetrasphaera from accumulibacter kong et al 2005 ever evalutated various organics as carbon sources of tetrasphaera to promote the aerobic p uptake in dynamic feast and famine cycles the organics included formic acid propionate butyric acid pyruvate lactate ethanol glucose oleic acid aspartic acid glutamic acid leucine glycine thymidine and mixed amino acids however fish mar results showed that none of them could be taken up by the tetrasphaera targeted by actino 221 and actino 658 probes except casamino acid and acetate in another study marques et al 2017 glucose aspartate glutamate and glycine were explored with an enriched tetrasphaera culture the results from fish mar showed that tetrasphaera presented p uptake anaerobically with each of these four carbon solely it seemed that glucose cannot support the p removal physiology of tetrasphaera on the contrary kong et al 2005 and nguyen et al 2011 demonstrated that tetrasphaera were able to consume glucose anaerobically to promote p uptake aerobically following a similar experimental prototype with fish mar it is worth noting that all these studies were conducted in a mixed microbial culture and fish mar helped to locate tetrasphaera in addition the incubation period of mar is a critical factor to allow sufficient cellular incorporation of the radioisotope thus the inconsistency regarding the glucose utilization for p removal was probably attributed to the bias from mixed culture and tools used and it is difficult to confirm which results are correct then a genome analysis from kristiansen et al 2013 showed that tetrasphaera have the genes coding the enzymes for glucose assimilation most importanatly an experiment conducted in a pure culture of t elongata explicitly showed a typical pao phenotype with glucose as carbon source as t elgontata represents the most abundant clade in full scale plants in denmark kristiansen et al 2013 thus glucose can support the p removal physiology of tetrasphaera the reason why glucose led to anaerobic p uptake in previous study marques et al 2017 was probably that the tetrasphaera in the enriched culture did not exert p release uptake physiology at all in the enrichement stage calculation based on pha might overestimate the contribution of tetrasphaera as fish staining was not applied directely to confirm that the poly p pool of tetrasphaera was low and resulted in a p uptake anaerobically in the batch test to store energy to response the carbon shift to glucose amino acid as carbon source in culture stage this also reflects that the physiology of p removal on glucose was affected by environmental condition 3 2 3 is glycogen the storage products of tetrasphaera as summarized in table 1 and above statement despite that t japonica and some filamentous tetrasphaera can store pha it is generally accepted that tetrasphaera cannot synthesize and store pha anaerobically to fuel the p uptake aerobically thus it is a high research interest to find out what storage productes will take the role of pha in tetrasphaera for p removal herein glycogen was always regarded as one important energy storage compound in tetrasphaera so were succinate pyruvate and amino acids kristiansen et al 2013 contrary to the anaerobic glycogen consumption in classical paos metabolic model the glycogen replenishment of tetrasphaera occurred in anaerobic condition and then was consumed for p uptake aerobically kristiansen et al 2013 reported that all the genes encoding for enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis were present in tetrasphaera in addition an increase of intracellular glycogen content in the pure t elongata under anaerobic condition was also observed with glucose as carbon source moreover glycogen production in the anaerobic phase was also observed in another study with glucose glutamate and aspartate as carbon source respectively marques et al 2017 glycogen seemed to be an key storage polymer for tetrasphaera to achieve p removal however fernando et al 2019 reported a totally contrary result that no glycogen was detected in pure t elongata or tetrasphaera in activated sludge with glucose as carbon source by raman microspectroscopy the authors assumed that the previous glycogen detection could be wrong due to the in vitro glycogen quantification method used commonly by the contrast raman technology can do the quantification in situ and more accurately in addition this inconsistency was also explained by the versatile metabolic pathways of tetrasphaera and glycogen synthesis in that study was probably not necessary by tracing back to kong et al 2005 inhibiting the glycogen hydrolysis by inhibitor did not suppress the uptake of oleic acid and casamino acids by actinobacteria and the glycogen was not necessary for the energy supply herein the explanation of versatile metabolism seems more justified than attributing to the bias from quantification method raman microspectroscopy has been used to quantify the glycogen in human embryonic stem cells with advantages of time saving konorov et al 2011 while some drawbacks are stated in section 3 1 in addition the conventional glyconge quantification method has long been applied in experiments and the accuracy has been approved lanham et al 2012 worthnoting is that the validation of the raman method on glycogen quantification was via comparision to the conventional method konorov et al 2011 thus it is highly possible that no detection of glycogen demonstrated that glycogen is not always the intracellular storage products and identification of other products needs further studies overall the physiological characteristics of tetrasphaera from the above information are summarized in table 3 in comparison with accumulibacter kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 it is clear now that the tetrasphaera have a highly versatile preference in substrates assimilation and energy provision and compared with accumulibacter have many alternative options to survive in a dynamic environment nielsen et al 2019 all these features make the experimental results inconsistent sometimes and more difficult to interpretate 3 2 4 can tetrasphaera achieve denitrification there is something of a paucity of research addressing the capacity of tetrasphaera to achieve denitrifying ebpr in a dynamic environment but findings on the reduction of no3 n to no2 n by tetrasphaera have been reported marques et al 2018 studied the denitrification capacity of tetrasphaera in a mixed culture 60 of tetrasphaera the results show that tetrasphaera has the capability of denitrification but the specific p uptake rate in anoxic condition was insignificant compared with accumulibacter 0 09 mmol p g vss h compared with 0 58 for accumulibacter 3 2 5 metabolic model proposed for tetrasphaera according to the experimental results several metabolic models regarding the p removal of tetrasphaera have been configured kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 as these models were proposed based on various carbon sources and microbial cultures mixed or pure culture the mass flow varied a lot regarding the storage compounds and flow direction as discussed in section 3 2 3 kristiansen et al 2013 proposed a model describing the metabolism of t elongata as a representative in ebpr with glucose as the substrate in the experiment under anaerobic conditions tetrasphaera take up glucose using poly p as an energy source and glucose can be stored as glycogen in subsequent aerobic conditions the stored glycogen can be used for growth and for replenishing supplies of poly p in the model proposed by nguyen et al 2015 with glycine as carbon source no glycogen but intracellular glycine was accumulated under anaerobic conditions as well as small amounts of glutamine serine and alanine these intracellular metabolites can then be used to power the p uptake aerobically moreover tetrasphaera share some key metabolic pathways with accumulibacter such as tca cycle and poly p degradation synthesis overall tetrasphaera are extremely versatile capable of surviving in highly dynamic environments and in a large abundance this is why there is still lack of a generic model the study on the metabolism of tetrasphaera is still in progress particularly on the storage products in anaerobic stage 4 factors probably influencing tetrasphaera in ebpr in mixed culture 4 1 influent compositions and temperature with the data from table 2 a statistical correlation analysis was then conducted between the abundance of tetrasphaera diameter of the bubbles and the temperature vertical axis industrial wastewater percentage horizontal axis as depicted in fig 2 the bubbles filled with diagonal were from the s2ebpr process which is believed to be advantageous for tetrasphaera proliferation onnis hayden et al 2018 and the remaining circles represents the data from conventional ebpr by excluding the s2ebpr data i e bubbles filled with diagonal as presented in fig 2 a large amount of bubbles were gathered between 10 and 20 c especially the bubbles with large diameter it implies that a temperate environment probably supported the proliferation of tetrasphaera on the other hand the bubbles representing the tetrasphaera abundance from australia and singapore was pinned on the top 20 30 c with a low abundance qualitatively at high temperaturestetrasphaera seemed to be outcompeted by other microorganisms qiu et al 2019 the low abundance of tetrasphaera in wwtps from spain also supported this assumption rey martínez et al 2019 in terms of correlation between tetrasphaera abundance and industrial wastewater percentage fig 2 also presents some significant feature most of the wwtps receiving more industrial wastewater had a high abundance of tetrasphaera while most of the wwtps mainly receiving domestic wastewater had a low tetrasphaera abundance more specifically the bubbles from the same study kong et al 2005 also presented a similar distribution black hollow bubbles mielczarek et al 2013 ever discussed the correlation between the microbial community e g abundance of tetrasphaera and wastewater characteristics process design and operation with the data of over 3 years from 28 danish wwtps the analysis showed that the abundance of tetrasphaera only presented weak correlations with the amount of industrial wastewater due to the spatial limitation the temperature was not considered in their analysis as such all these results qualitatively attested the correlation between tetrasphaera proliferation and the wastewater quality and temperature 4 2 anaerobic conditions as indicated in many publications barnard et al 2017 it appears that the most important parameter for optimal ebpr is to have a deep anaerobic zone a lower oxidation and reduction potential orp level for paos by doing so the anaerobic conditions give a competitive advantage for substrate uptake over other heterotrophic bacteria van loosdrecht et al 1997 thus the stored products power the p uptake aerobically however a concern arises is the biochemistry of p removal of tetrasphaera controlled or influenced by the anaerobic condition it is frustrating that previous studies on tetrasphaera rarely mentioned the exact orp value under the anaerobic condition however some information can also be qualitatively summarized from fig 2 on the left side area with no industrial wastewater flowing in the black bubbles filled with diagonals represent the wwtps with the side stream ebpr s2ebpr process which is believed to conceive a deep anaerobic zone barnard et al 2017 onnis hayden et al 2018 obviously the abundance of tetrasphaera with s2ebpr was higher than others in the same left area in addition barnard et al 2017 presumed that orp 200 mv favors the organisms such as tetrasphaera that can ferment higher carbon compound which was also stated by onnis hayden et al 2018 although many studies have already showed that tetrasphaera can ferment glucose and various amino acid aerobically herbst et al 2019 maszenan et al 2000 herbst et al 2019 verified that the poly p degradation and release from t elongata was enhanced under anaerobic conditions which is believed to be an extra energy supplement for t elongata it would appear that tetrasphaera also require anaerobic conditions to get competitive advantages particularly concentrated anaerobic conditions onnis hayden et al 2018 according to the metabolic models of tetrasphaera in section 3 2 tetrasphaera shows p uptake only when they have taken up organics matter and stored it intracellularly under prior anaerobic conditions kong et al 2005 kristiansen et al 2013 although there is still no consistency on what kinds of storage products are coupled with p uptake herbst et al 2019 the anaerobically stored products are necessary in another study from kong et al 2008 tetrasphaera were able to ferment glucose after 3 days in this condition which suggests that tetrasphaera can benefit from long term anaerobic conditions in order to utilize glucose for subsequent p uptake thus the impact of anaerobic conditions on tetrasphaera requires further study 4 3 the importance of tetrasphaera in ebpr by summarizing the above information it can be concluded that tetrasphaera were consistently detected in a large abundance and presented a biochemistry of p removal fig 2 however as indicated by fernando et al 2019 the abundance of tetrasphaera alone cannot prove their importance in the ebpr process in other words the tetrasphaera presenting a p removal physiology in batch tests cannot refer to that p removal being able to function properly in full scale wwtps for instance accumulibacter has generally been regarded as the key paos in ebpr however their functions generally fail due to interference from other factors zheng et al 2014 most recently fernando et al 2019 showed that tetrasphaera contributed to a comparable or even higher p removal than accumulibacter 12 50 and 10 48 respectively in 8 danish wwtps although the contribution of tetrasphaera has not been verified universally or gloably this result really sheds light on improving the ebpr from microbiology additionally the versatile physiology and metabolism of tetrasphaera bring about a concern of how to maintain an appropriate operational condition for them silva et al 2012 ever presented a comprehensive analysis of ebpr performance in several pilot and full scale mbrs the highest p removal was unexpectedly achieved in the reactor where accumulibacter and tetrasphaera were present in low number obvisouly appropriate operational conditions can also ensure small amounts of paos exerting big contribution to p removal as discussed in section 3 and 4 the operational conditions sewage properties anaerobic uint and environmental conditions temperature could not only afftect the abundance of tetrasphaera but also determine their physiologies on work fermentation and p removal herbst et al 2019 the change of these conditions could probably alter the metabolic pathway of tetraspaera from significant p removal to weak performance marques et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 studied the p release of activated sludge 0 95 3 8 accumulibacter and 0 23 1 8 tetrasphaera from a tropic area with glucose an initial adaptation period was observed for glucose to stimulate p release and the authors assumed that the glucose was probably fermented by tetrasphaera and the fermentation products induced p release it implies that the tetrasphaera under this environment probably took more fermentation physiology to supply carbon source for accumulibacter and involve in the p removal indirectly although tetrasphaera did not release p as paos the role of them was obviously favorable here comes anther question that whether it is proper to evaluate the contribution or importance of tetrasphaera based on p removal i e direct involvement in ebpr anyway although the contribution of tetrasphaera to p removal has been verified to be comparable to accumulibacter fernando et al 2019 further research is highly recommended to figure out how to keep tetrasphaera proceeding p removal physiology stably and what other factors e g nitrate to the accumulibacter in anaerobic condition could interfere this physiology 5 conclusions over the years the cumulative knowledge of tetrasphaera has significantly advanced the study on ebpr the comparative capacity of p removal as accumulibacter has been verified and presents advantages on utilizing large organics compounds meanwhile there are still gaps in our knowledge to be filled by future studies based on the existing literature and review based analysis some highlights can be concluded and some suggestions for further work can also be proposed 5 1 highlights for tetrasphaera in ebpr tetrasphaera consist of at least four identified species t jenkinsii t australiensis t japonica and t elongata as well as other uncultured species which is probably the basis leading to versatile physiologies reported tetrasphaera were reported consistently in a large abundance and can metabolize on and or ferment glucose and various amino acids for p removal and there is a synergy between tetrasphaera and accumulibacter to promote the p removal tetrasphaera have the capability to achieve a comparable or even higher p removal contribution compared with accumulibacter disputes exist on whether tetrasphaera have the ability to synthesize glycogen as storage products and further research is required on this topic operational and environmental conditions could affect the abundance of tetrasphaera and alter the metabolic pathway of them thus an appropriate condition promoting the p removal physiology of tetrasphaera should be figured out 5 2 suggestions for future work advancement in molecular techniques significantly benefits studies on microbial population currently fish and 16s rna amplicon analysis are the two most popular tools to achieve this purpose however the results have been known to present discrepancies between these two microbial analytical methods recently raman fish was applied to study tetrasphaera and is recommended to attest mutually to make a comparison and reliable results the detailed metabolic pathways of tetrasphaera in various environments are yet to be exclusively revealed and explained tetrasphaera can alternate their metabolic pathways to supply energy for growth and maintenance questions still remain to be answered about what factor induces their metabolism to alternate and how different metabolism pairs in anaerobic and aerobic phases can achieve p removal further study of the metabolic response will provide strategies to regulate them how can tetrasphaera survive and contribute to p removal in full scale wwtps to answer this question a suggestion for future research is the kinetic study of tetrasphaera particularly under mixed cultures so far few researchers have studied the dynamic kinetics of tetrasphaera and their competitive ability to others despite their abundance and physiology the kinetics of tetrasphaera determines their ability and contribution to p removal calculation of energy balance is a good way to test to what extent one microorganism relies on one biochemical process for growth and maintenance thus future work should evaluate the p removal potential of tetrasphaera by considering the energy supplied from organics substrates of course an accurate calculation of energy balance must be based on a clear metabolic pathway thus this part of the work can be cross evaluated with metabolic studies different species of tetrasphaera own a specific metabolic preference which may contribute to contradictory results and difficulty in interpretation thus future work on metabolism or kinetics should be accompanied by an analysis of the microbial population declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18452,it is important to model flux variation during the membrane filtration process particularly in the early stage of filtration where severe fouling causes rapid flux decay in a short period of time the objective of this study was to develop a combined fouling mathematical model based on energy head loss principle for prediction of flux variation in the membrane filtration the complete cake model was employed in the model in order to describe the loss of membrane available area due to pore clogging while the classical cake model was used for cake filtration a new dimensionless parameter namely the filter number fn was proposed in this study to account for the unmeasurable properties of the membrane in the model the application of the proposed model was tested and compared with the existing models using experimental data for the filtration of wastewater sludge microalgae suspension and sodium alginate solution with different membranes and pressures the results showed that the flux calculated values of the new model had good agreements with the experimental data under different conditions according to statistical analyses the model improved the representing accuracy of flux variation in the early stage of filtration in addition the model provides better performance and efficiency in comparison to the existing models for high flux operations which is more conventionally

variety of fields including wastewater treatment and microalgae harvesting due to its easy operation environmental friendliness and low energy consumption mo et al 2015 however membrane pore blockage and formation of filter cake on the membrane surface could cause serious membrane fouling which results in a rapid reduction of water flux in early stage of filtration reduces membrane service life and increases the operation cost meng et al 2017 despite the relative simplicity of the membrane filtration technology it is difficult but greatly important to correctly model flux variation during the filtration process under different conditions of the sludge membrane and applied pressure since darcy s filtration law 1856 a number of theoretical and empirical models have been developed to describe the permeate flux decline and fouling characterization by considering the effects of pore plugging and or the kinetics of cake formation olivier and vaxelaire 2007 ruth 1935 initially proposed the cake filtration model for an incompressible sludge by applying an average specific resistance α to the permeate flow as being contributed by the filter cake formed on the membrane surface during filtration later a great majority of researches have been conducted to improve and extend the model in order to be applicable in the case of compressible sludge shirato et al 1969 schippers and verdouw 1980 bassirou et al 2019 by analyzing different physical mechanisms for the foulants deposition inside and or top of the membrane pore hermans and bredee 1936 and later gonsalves 1950 developed the classical blocking law which has shown that all the filtration equations can be derived from a second order non linear differential equation by adjusting two empirical constants thus far blocking model has been widely adopted as a powerful tool for simulating fouling behavior and modeling filtration flux during both constant pressure operation and constant flow operation grase 1956 hermia 1982 hwang et al 2007 tien et al 2014 iritani et al 2016 the blocking filtration laws describe four different mechanisms of the fouling process standard blocking intermediate blocking complete blocking and cake formation bowen et al 1995 some researchers attempted to model flux variation based on an individual fouling mechanism hlavacek and bouchet 1993 zhang et al 2018 however the results of the different studies indicated that the fouling mechanism during the filtration process may not follow any of the individual classical models and likely the different fouling mechanisms might occur simultaneously or sequentially liu et al 2008 yao et al 2017 in this case models that combine two or more classical blocking mechanisms have been shown to be useful methods to improve the representing accuracy of flux variation goldrick et al 2017 ho and zydney 2000 for the first time developed a combined fouling model which describes flux decline initially through pore blocking and subsequently by cake formation over the blocked membrane although the model showed good agreement with the membrane flux data during the filtration of bovine serum albumin bsa internal fouling was neglected in this model duclos orsello et al 2006 developed the model to describe flux decline during filtration accounting for both external and internal fouling from another perspective iratani et al 2005 proposed a combined filtration model in which cake formation and pore blocking occurred simultaneously the model assumed that some membrane pores remain open intermediate blocking even at the late pseudo steady stage of filtration a novel method which combines darcy s law and traditional blocking models was developed by bolton et al 2006 they proposed five new fouling models based on the combined effects of the different individual fouling mechanism among them the cake complete model provided the best fit with the experimental data recently hou et al 2017 considered a steady membrane frontal area k in the cake complete model to improve the predictive accuracy of the model a limitation of these combine models is that the pressure drop across the filter cake and clogged membrane are treated as a similar mechanism according to the resistances in series model based on darcy s law 1 δ p μ r m r c j where δ p is the pressure drop across the cake and membrane pa μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s j is the permeate flux ms 1 and r m and r c are the membrane and cake resistances m 1 respectively this model is based on two main assumptions which may be invalid under certain circumstances 1 the permeate flux j is considered as constant throughout the filter cake and the filter membrane several studies showed that the assumption involving the constancy of flux may be strikingly in error where the cross sectional area of the filter cake and clogged membrane cannot be similar and might dramatically change during filtration tiller and cooper 1960 vorobiev 2006 2 it is postulated that the relationship between flow rate through membrane pores and pressure drop is linear this assumption has also shown some errors particularly for the modeling of the initial flux decline at a high flux operation when scaling up to full scale manufacturing xu et al 2017 thurmer et al 2012 wang et al 2006 in this case the linear relationship between the flow rate through porous medium and pressure drop may turn into non linearity firdaous et al 1997 ergun 1952 as these assumptions are far from true especially in the early stage of filtration which has been reported as a significant portion of total permeate flux approximately 30 50 yao et al 2018 it is necessary to develop a new combined model to appropriately describe the process of cake and membrane resistances and model the constitutive relationship between them during the filtration process in this study a novel membrane filtration mathematical model was developed to describe flux decline during both the initial and pseudo steady stage of membrane filtration to account for the membrane resistance into the model a new dimensionless parameter termed the filter number fn was introduced the proposed model was compared with experimental data obtained during dead end filtration tests of three different types of feed at different pressures wastewater sludge and microalgae suspension were filtered through polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 0 1 μm and mixed celluloseester mce 0 3 μm microfiltration membranes respectively moreover the applicability of the model to the ultramembrane filtration data of commercial sodium alginate sa from the work of sioutopoulos and karabelas 2016 was also tested the model was compared with the existing models and was validated using experimental data by the sum of squared deviation ssd mean relative deviation mrd and regression coefficient r 2 2 model development the proposed model in this study was developed based on the conservation of energy head principle for flowing fluids through the filter cake and membrane pores fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of energy head losses due to cake formation and membrane blocking during the membrane filtration process in the development of filtration models usually it is assumed that all the particles are rejected by the membrane it is also postulated that dynamic head kinetic energy and hydraulic head potential energy reduce to negligible values in comparison with high applied pressure head ruth 1935 according to the conservation of energy principle the total pressure head drop is equal to total head losses 2 p ρ g δ h c a k e δ h m e m b r a n e where p is the applied pressure pa ρ is the density of the fluid at all points in the fluid kg m 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity ms 2 and δ h c a k e and δ h m e m b r a n e are the total energy head losses due to the filter cake and clogged membrane m respectively 2 1 energy head loss due to filter cake resistance by the assumption of full foulant rejection by the membrane all particles accumulate on the membrane surface and form a filter cake as the water flows frictionally through the filter cake the pressure head drops until it reaches the value of δ h m e m b r a n e at the interface of the cake and supporting medium fig 1 darcy s law is commonly used to calculate this head loss associated with frictional effects as a function of flow rate and cake resistance as sioutopoulos and karabelas 2016 3 δ h c a k e μ ρ g r c j the cake resistance to flow is increased with time by the growth of the filter cake during the filtration process goldrick et al 2017 to account for the variation of cake resistance as a function of time during the filtration period the classical cake filtration model was used in the proposed model as developed in bolton s model bolton et al 2006 4 r c t r 0 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 0 5 where r 0 is the initial cake resistance m 1 k c is the cake filtration constant in the blocking model sm 2 and j 0 is the initial flux value sm 1 the pressure head loss due to cake resistance can be obtained by inserting eq 4 into eq 3 5 δ h c a k e μ r 0 ρ g 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 0 5 j 2 2 energy head loss due to filter membrane resistance the energy head loss due to membrane resistance occurs when the streamlines are directed away from the axial direction of flow and contracted to pass through the open area of the membrane pores fig 1 hager 2010 in this case the speed of the flux passing through the porous medium increases rapidly and the flow regime turns from darcy s flow to an inertial flow regime experimental studies for conduit contractions gardel 1962 and filtration test with pure water at high fluxes xu et al 2017 thumer et al 2012 show that membrane head loss will vary as the square of fluid flux through open pores firdaous et al 1997 the most common equation used to determine this head loss is 6 δ h m e m b r a n e f j o p e n 2 2 g f q a o p e n 2 2 g f a m a o p e n 2 j 2 2 g where j o p e n is the fluid flux throughout the open area of the membrane f is the loss coefficient dimensionless q is the flow volume rate m3s 1 and a m and a o p e n are the membrane frontal area and the area of the membrane which remains uncovered at any given time during filtration m2 respectively to characterize the physicochemical properties of the membrane i e the aperture opening size aos material and the loss coefficient a new dimensionless factor has been defined in this study which is referred to as the filter number fn given by eq 7 7 f n t f a m a o p e n 2 for a pure water filtration test with a clean membrane the total pressure head drop is due to head loss associated with the membrane eq 2 δ h m e m b r a n e p ρ g filter number for a clean membrane can be calculated from eq 8 as the slope of the pressure head versus dynamic head curve 8 f n 0 f a m a 0 2 pressure head p ρg dynamic head j w 2 2 g where a o is the open area of clean membrane m2 and j w is the pure water flux ms 1 this number is a specific number for a clean membrane however during the filtration process with feed solutions the available membrane area appreciably declines as large particles partially intermediate blocking or completely complete blocking seal off pore entrances this can also occur due to pore constriction by small colloid matters that accumulate inside membranes on the pore wall standard blocking as schematically illustrated in fig 1 on the bases of the blocking law and fouling mechanisms bolton et al 2006 obtained eq 9 and eq 10 for the loss of available membrane area as a function of time in the complete model and in the intermediate model respectively kim et al 2013 9 a o p e n a 0 exp k b t 10 a o p e n a 0 1 k i j 0 t 1 where k b and k i are the complete blocking constant s 1 and the intermediate blocking constant m 1 respectively a similar equation for the loss of free membrane area as a function of time eq 9 was used by ho and zydney 2000 eq 9 and eq 10 can be obtained in terms of accumulated permeate volume v in the complete model according to eq 11 and in the intermediate model according to eq 12 11 a o p e n a 0 1 k b j 0 v 12 a o p e n a 0 exp k i v bolton et al 2006 used eq 11 in their cake complete model in order to obtain permeate volume as a function of time while iritani et al 2015 employed the intermediate blocking law eq 12 in which some membrane pores still remain open to describe the loss of available membrane as a function of volume however these equations for the loss of membrane area in terms of time eqs 9 and 10 or permeate volume eqs 11 and 12 may not be valid in the presence of the cake because these equations are derived by assuming that the membrane resistance and the cake resistance are constant independent of the permeate flux this assumption means that the flux decline during membane filtration is only due to the decay in membrane area and the effect of the resistances variation on the flux decline is not considered in order to consider the effects of resistances variation on the flux decay during membare filtration hou et al 2017 inserted the accumulated permeate volume from the cake complete model of bolton et al into eq 11 and obtained eq 13 for the loss of available membrane area as a function of time 13 a o p e n a 0 e x p k b k c j 0 2 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 1 2 1 the combined cake complete model is the most effective model in describing the fouling process for both membrane fouling and cake formation liu and kim 2008 goldrick et al 2017 bolton et al 2006 thus in the proposed model the modified cake complete model is used to obtain the fn as a function of time by inserting eq 13 and eq 8 into eq 7 14 f n t f n 0 e x p 2 k b k c j 0 2 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 1 2 1 eq 15 represents the energy head loss due to membrane resistance as a function of time permeate flux was obtained by combining eqs 6 7 and 14 15 δ h m e m b r a n e f n 0 e x p 2 k b k c j 0 2 1 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 1 2 j 2 2 g 2 3 flux modeling in order to model the flux variation during membrane filtration a new mathematical model was developed based on darcy regime through the filter cake and inertial regime through the porous membrane in the proposed model the dynamic approach of the fouling process was implemented by using the cake filtration model for representing the cake resistance variation and complete blocking model for describing the membrane resistance increasing due to the loss of available area eq 16 was obtained by combining eqs 2 5 and 15 16 f n 0 2 g e x p 2 k b k c j 0 2 1 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 1 2 j 2 μ r 0 ρ g 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 0 5 j p ρ g 0 a similar form of this quadratic equation was derived by forchheimer 1901 for the expression of the pressure dissipation due to the flow of the fluid through an isotropic medium firdaous et al 1997 he suggested the inclusion of an inertial term representing the dynamic energy of the fluid to the darcy s equation the law related to the loss of the pressure head of forchheimer is given by eq 17 17 p a j 2 b j where p is the pressure gradient i e for constant pressure operation in one dimension p p ρ g and a and b are constants to be determined from experiments ergun 1952 generalized the forchheimer equation for packed beds and obtained a and b values as a function of membrane porosity ergun 1952 solving quadratic eq 17 and the substitution of a and b from proposed model eq 16 allows to establish the relationship between the flux filtration time and the applied pressure eq 18 18 j g f n μ r c ρ g 2 2 f n ρ g 2 p 0 5 μ r c ρ f n where r c and f n represent the effect of cake resistance and membrane resistance respectively and can be obtained from eq 4 and eq 14 as a function of time in the case of the clean water test r c 0 0 the only resistance is due to the membrane resistance thus eq 18 will be equal to eq 8 which is valid for a pure water filtration by the assumption that membrane resistance is negligible f n 0 0 or in very low flux filtration j 2 0 the darcy regime will be the domain and eq 16 turns to the cake filtration model eq 19 in table 1 3 experimental 3 1 materials in order to evaluate the application of the new proposed model as well as the existing models in the literature table 1 three different types of feed suspensions were used wastewater sludge the activated sludge was collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant gwacheon wwtp south korea the sludge contained 4200 mgl 1 of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss the ph and zeta potential values of sludge suspension were measured to be 7 8 and 10 90 mv respectively in order to stabilize the sludge condition 100 mgl 1 of 0 035 w v sodium azide nan3 was added to the suspension then the solution was mixed at 1000 rpm with a stirrer for 15 min next the sample was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for a period of 24 h and then allowed to warm to room temperature before using to minimize sludge biological activity microalgae suspension the chlamydomonas sp microalgae suspension with 1 98 g dry weight l and 7 5 ph used in this work was described in the previous study of taghavijeloudar et al 2019 sodium alginate solution the sodium alginate filtration experimental data processed in this study were obtained from the work of sioutopoulos and karabelas 2016 the membranes used in this study were 0 1 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and 0 3 μm mixed celluloseester mce microfiltration with an effective filtration area of 0 0433 m 2 in order to reduce the hydrophobic effect of the membranes the clean membranes were pre wetted by placing them into distilled water for 12 h before each experiment 3 2 experimental setup and procedure a bench scale dead end setup cs20 201203538 with the schematic layout shown in fig 2 was used to perform microfiltration experiments under a constant pressure condition the working volume and area of the filtration cylinder were 20 l and 0 0706 m2 0 3 m diameter respectively a p425 hp375 t4i dual pressure portable air compressor was used to deliver an airflow of 0 18 0 20 cfm at a pressure of 100 1100 kpa to determine the filter number fn 0 and resistance of virgin membrane the pure water flux of the pre wetted membranes was measured at operating pressures of 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 kpa for both pvdf and mce membranes the pure water flux was calculated according to the time t for collecting 20 l pure water j w 0 283 t the microfiltration experiments with microalgae suspension and wastewater sludge were conducted at four different pressures of 200 and 300 kpa for microalgae and 400 and 500 kpa for wastewater in each filtration process 7 l of the suspension initial height of 0 1 m was passed through the filter placed at the bottom of the filtration chamber the variation of the suspension height h with time t was recorded through a plexiglass window which was improvised on the filtration chamber using a video camera connected to a personal computer the permeate flux j was calculated as 19 j a c a m δ h t 1000 where j is the permeate flux lm 2 h 1 δ h is the suspension height decrease during filtration m t is the duration time of the filtration for δh h a c and a m are the cylinder area 0 0706 m2 and the effective membrane area 0 0433 m2 respectively the filtration experiment lasted to achieve a nearly constant permeation flux the rejection of the feed components was then quantified as follows 20 r c f e e d c p e r m e a t e c f e e d 100 where r is the rejection rate c f e e d and c p e r m e a t e are the concentrations of the solute in the feed and permeate mgl 1 respectively in order to determine the final value of the membrane resistance f n f after each test the filter cake layer was wiped away carefully the membrane was backwashed and a filtration test with pure water and fouled membrane was performed all experiments were performed at room temperature 24 1 co and in duplicate 3 3 statistical analysis to analyze the accuracy of the new model in comparison with the conventional models the sum of squared deviation ssd the mean relative deviation mrd and standard deviation σ between the experimental data and the calculated values of the models were determined taghavi et al 2010 21 sse 1 n i n j exp i j cal i 2 22 mre 1 n i n j exp i j cal i j exp i 23 σ i n j exp i j cal i 2 n where n is the number of recorded data during an experiment and j cal i and j exp i are the calculated and experimental flux values at filtration time i respectively in addition graphs j cal i versus j exp i were plotted and r square values were obtained by excel 2016 to compare the performance of the new proposed and existing models 4 results and discussion 4 1 filtration experiments with pure water to achieve better understanding of the membrane resistance filtration tests with pure water were performed at different pressures in this study the variations of the pure water fluxes j w and dynamic head j w 2 2 g versus applied pressure were plotted in fig 3 a for pvdf and mce membranes the figure shows a linear increase in pure water fluxes at low pressures lower than 100 kpa however when the operating pressure is over a critical value the j w p relationship is no longer linear which suggests that the flow regime transferred from the darcy regime to the inertial flow regime where darcy s law is not valid any more as shown in fig 3a at a higher pressure the dynamic head is directly proportional to the applied pressure which suggests that the loss of linearity in the inertial flow regime can be corrected using the filter number fn from eq 7 instead of the membrane resistance r m from darcy law fig 3b shows the variation of clean membrane filter number fn 0 and membrane resistance r m as a function of applied pressure for pvdf and mce membranes at lower pressure the darcy flow regime the filter number fn 0 decreased with increasing applied pressure while the membrane resistance r m was slightly influenced by the pressure however at higher pressure in the inertial flow regime the filter number fn 0 was found to be independent of pressure while membrane resistance r m increased with increasing pressure some researchers have reported similar results for membrane resistance r m variation with pressure at lower fluxes huisman et al 1997 rezaei et al 2014 however they described the increase in resistance with increasing pressure to the compressibility of the membrane according to the results shown in fig 3 for pvdf 0 1 μm and mce 0 3 μm membranes it is noted that the filter number fn 0 and the membrane resistance r m decreased from 4 0 109 and 4 5 1011 m 1 to 9 5 108 and 2 2 1011 m 1 respectively with the increase of pore size consequently the pure water flux increased hydrodynamically as would be expected 4 2 filtration test with feed suspensions 4 2 1 permeate flux and cumulative volume variation with time fig 4 shows the variation of the permeate flux j and permeate cumulative volume v with time for wastewater sludge microalgae suspension and sodium alginate through the pvdf 0 1 μm the mce 0 3 μm and pan 20 kda at constant pressures of 500 and 400 kpa 300 and 200 kpa and 103 to 68 kpa respectively for all filtration tests the permeate flux alleviated rapidly at the beginning of filtration due to membrane pore blocking then followed by a gradual decline during pseudo steady stage as it can be seen from fig 4b the initial rate of flux decline was quite rapid for microalgae filtration in comparison to wastewater and sodium alginate filtration the permeate flux decreased 90 from its initial value of 1893 l m 2h 1 with in 60 s of microalgae filtration at 300 kpa compared to 70 and 20 decline of wastewater sludge and sodium alginate filtration at 500 and 103 kpa respectively this might be because of extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp in the primary secretion of the microalgae cells which forces the fouling to be worse in comparison to wastewater sludge as reported previously liao et al 2018 after the initial stage the flux decreased gradually toward a nearly constant value when the main fouling mechanism changes to the cake filtration model although the flux variation at long filtration times looks independent of time on the scale of fig 4 the permeate flux continues to decline indicating that while the membrane pore blocking reaches to a stable level the filter cake growths gradually on top of fouled membrane fig 5 shows feed components rejection during filtration of sodium alginate at 68 and 103 kpa microalgae at 200 and 300 kpa and wastewater sludge at 400 and 500 kpa it can be seen that the feed rejection decreases as applied pressure increases this can be due to the increase of the mass transfer driving force and consequently the transport of feed components through the membrane is facilitated as pressure increases the low rejection for microalgae 62 1 means that most of microalgae cells break during filtration resulting in smaller particles that can pass through the membrane and the formed cake 4 2 2 determination of filtration parameters the experimental initial flux values j 0 resulted in less than the pure water flux j w through a clean membrane due to initial particle adsorption before test runs it is reported that the initial adsorption can be 20 2000 of the clean membrane resistance depending on the membrane pore size ognier et al 2002 therefore even at time zero there is an initial cake resistance r 0 which can be calculated from eq 18 by having j j 0 and f n f n 0 after each test a final filter number f n f was obtained from the pure water test with the clogged filter other fitting parameters k b k i k s k c and k were determined by fitting methods minimizing the standard deviation σ and are shown in table 2 to identify the pore blocking mechanism which resulted in the loss of available membrane area a o p e n the filter number were calculated according to the blocking model as a function of time using eq 9 the intermediate model as a function of time using eq 10 and as a function of volume using eq 11 and the proposed model according to eq 13 for wastewater sludge fig 6 a during the early stage of the filtration the filter number increases sharply in time due to the quick pore blockage of the membrane then the filter cake forms and becomes denser which prevents the pore blocking from growing the filter number increases more slowly and the available membrane area will become constant at long filtration times fig 6a however the filter number values calculated from the classical equations eq 9 to eq 11 showed an exponential increasing in a short period of filtration time because the effect of cake resistance variation is not considered in these equations for instance the filter number values calculated from the exponential equation of standard blocking eq 11 showed much higher values 7 2 10 10 than the final filter number 2 10 10 even at the early stage of filtration 2 min therefore the proposed equation by hou et al 2017 based on the cake completed blocking model eq 13 might be more accurate for describing the filter number variation as a function of time the variation of cake resistance as a function of time was calculated from eq 4 for different feeds of wastewater sludge microalgae suspension and sodium alginate solution fig 6b similar to membrane resistance the filter cake resistance also dramatically increases at the early period of filtration and then increases slowly in the pseudo steady stage due to decreasing filtration flux the microalgae suspension exhibited higher cake resistance due to the fact that not only extracellular products eps smp of microalgae can cause significant fouling problem but also the algal cells with bigger size 10 μm may increase cake resistance the cake resistance data show that the applied pressure affects the fouling resistance as one would expected it suggests that increased applied pressure leads to increased initial permeate flux j 0 and cake resistance r c consequently 4 2 3 energy head loss behaviors during filtration in order to get new insights helpful to understand energy head losses during filtration process the contribution of head losses due to membrane resistance δ h m e m b a r n e and filter cake resistance δ h c a k e to total pressure head are plotted in fig 7 for the three different feed solutions the variation of δ h cake with time was calculated by using eq 5 and the δ h membarne was obtained by subtracting δ h cake form total pressure head p ρg contrary to what has been reported in the previous studies the difference between pure water flux through clean membrane j w and initial flux values j 0 indicated that the clean membrane resistance does not correspond to the total pressure head drop at the beginning of filtration however membrane resistance exhibited the highest contribution to the total pressure head drop at the initial stage of filtration and decreased toward a negligible portion compared to cake resistance as time elapsed fig 7a and b this might because the membrane resistance arising from particles arriving directly on the membrane pores is added to the cake resistance it should be emphasized that microalgae cell lysis releases a large amount of eps and smp which are preferentially adhered to membrane surface to accumulate an additional gel layer therefore the filter cake resistance corresponds to the major portion of pressure head drop as shown in fig 7b however the results of sodium alginate filtration test with ultrafiltration membrane pan depicted in fig 7c revealed that the resistance of ultrafiltration membrane had a domain influence on the pressure head drop even at the pseudo steady stage of filtration particularly at lower pressure of 68 kpa where the cake resistance is lower in addition variations of feed height h with time t during filtration process were plotted in fig 7 the maximum hydraulic head produced by the feed height 0 1 m is 100 times less than the minimum applied pressure head 10 5 m for sa therefore the assumption that hydrodynamic head is negligible is reasonable in the proposed model 4 3 verification of the proposed model 4 3 1 model performance in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model the variation of the permeate flux with time was analyzed for the three different feeds of wastewater sludge microalgae suspensions and sodium alginate solution at different pressures fig 8 shows the application of the proposed model individual fouling models i e models 1 to 4 in table 1 and combined models i e models of ho and zydney 2000 bolton et al 2006 and hou et al 2017 to model the permeation flux under different conditions the black circles represent experimental data while the solid thick curves are the proposed model calculations using eq 18 the colored solid curves are the calculateds from the combined and individual models it was observed that individual blocking models alone were not capable of describing the flux trend for the whole filtration process however these basic models showed different effectiveness in the modeling of the flux over various filtration stages and operating conditions in fact some general trends in their ability to fit the experimental data were observed the cake filtration model was able to reasonably describe flux variation in all cases however the results depicted in fig 8 demonstrated that the use of the proposed model as well as combined models obviously improved the cure fitting suggesting that complex combined fouling mechanisms might occur simultaneously during filtration instead of an individual fouling mechanism the calculations of the proposed model had excellent agreement with experimental data at different cases it is of significance to note that the calculations of the proposed model showed a greater performance in the modeling of the permeate flux decline in the initial period of filtration while the other classical models failed for all filtration models it is assumed that the flow of the fluid through porous medium follows darcy regime which might be the reason of the inappropriate trend in the modeling of the existing models in the initial stage 4 3 2 comparison of existing models and the proposed model table 3 reports the results of the statistical analysis for the proposed model and other existing models the outcomes of the mean relative deviation mrd analysis confirm that the best predictive accuracy occurred with the proposed model which had the lowest mrd with the filtration experiments data of wastewater sludge mrd 1 1 microalgae suspension mrd 1 8 and sodium alginate solutions mrd 1 6 in the light of the obtained results of the sum of squared deviation ssd analysis the comparative study of the new model with those of existing model demonstrated that the proposed model is more effective in the modeling of flux variation in the initial stage of filtration when the flux value is high and results in higher ssd value the flux values calculated from the proposed model and existing models j cal verses experimental values j exp were plotted in fig 9 moreover the r square r 2 values between the calculated values and experimental records were determined and summarized in table 3 these results also proved that the proposed model was capable to model the experimental data over the entire process of filtration for the different feed solutions at different pressures it can be seen that the model showed lower correction with the microalgae experimental data at the lower pressure of 200 kpa mrd 2 6 ssd 42 1 r 2 0 998 this might be due to the lower rejection of the microalgae feed components during the filtration fig 5 the best fit of the proposed model occurred with the wastewater experimental data at higher pressure of 500 kpa r 2 0 999 an increase in the pressure leads to higher initial flux due to high driving force in this case the flow regime through porous medium might turn from darcy regime to an inertial regime and since it is postulated in the proposed model that the permeate flux through porous medium follows an inertial regime it is not surprising that the proposed model produced the best fit to the wastewater experimental data with higher permeate flux 5 conclusion for high flux filtration it has been shown that the existing models have not been able to describe flux variation particularly at the early stage of filtration a new mathematical model of membrane filtration based on the approach of energy head loss has been developed and verified in the model it was assumed that the flow regime through the filter cake and membrane pores follows darcy regime and an inertial regime respectively the model accounts for the effect of fouling spatial variation by implementing the complete cake model for pore clogging and the cake filtration law for cake formation the new dimensionless filter number fn enabled the model to use the same two fitting parameters from classical single blocking laws the application of the proposed model was evaluated based on dead end filtration experiments with three different feeds of wastewater sludge microalgae suspension and sa solution under different conditions the following results were obtained results of the pure water filtration test with virgin pvdf and mce membranes demonstrated a non linear relationship between flux and pressure at higher fluxes indicating that a flow regime through membrane pores might not always follow darcy regime according to the results of the filter number fn calculation membrane resistance dramatically increased at the very beginning of the filtration and then increased slowly suggesting that the flux decline is a result of the increase in the membrane resistance due to the membrane pore clogging at the beginning complete blocking model then formation of a cake layer over the membrane surface slowed down pore blocking process thus cake resistance will later be the main resistance to the permeate flow cake model the proposed model calculations showed the best fit to the experimental data for all cases the existing combined models could not describe flux variation well where the flow regime does not follow darcy regime particularly in the early stage of filtration the individual blocking models were able to provide a good fit of the data in specific periods of the experiments where these models are the main fouling mechanisms but not over the entire course of the filtration the values of ssd and correlation coefficient data confirmed that the proposed model provides better performance in higher flux membranes in general the combined model developed in this study can also be utilized as relatively simple tools for flux modeling in both slow membrane and fast membrane filtration

18452,it is important to model flux variation during the membrane filtration process particularly in the early stage of filtration where severe fouling causes rapid flux decay in a short period of time the objective of this study was to develop a combined fouling mathematical model based on energy head loss principle for prediction of flux variation in the membrane filtration the complete cake model was employed in the model in order to describe the loss of membrane available area due to pore clogging while the classical cake model was used for cake filtration a new dimensionless parameter namely the filter number fn was proposed in this study to account for the unmeasurable properties of the membrane in the model the application of the proposed model was tested and compared with the existing models using experimental data for the filtration of wastewater sludge microalgae suspension and sodium alginate solution with different membranes and pressures the results showed that the flux calculated values of the new model had good agreements with the experimental data under different conditions according to statistical analyses the model improved the representing accuracy of flux variation in the early stage of filtration in addition the model provides better performance and efficiency in comparison to the existing models for high flux operations which is more conventionally applied in the industry and is expected to be more in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords modeling membrane filtration fouling wastewater microalgae nomenclature a c cylinder area m2 a m

variety of fields including wastewater treatment and microalgae harvesting due to its easy operation environmental friendliness and low energy consumption mo et al 2015 however membrane pore blockage and formation of filter cake on the membrane surface could cause serious membrane fouling which results in a rapid reduction of water flux in early stage of filtration reduces membrane service life and increases the operation cost meng et al 2017 despite the relative simplicity of the membrane filtration technology it is difficult but greatly important to correctly model flux variation during the filtration process under different conditions of the sludge membrane and applied pressure since darcy s filtration law 1856 a number of theoretical and empirical models have been developed to describe the permeate flux decline and fouling characterization by considering the effects of pore plugging and or the kinetics of cake formation olivier and vaxelaire 2007 ruth 1935 initially proposed the cake filtration model for an incompressible sludge by applying an average specific resistance α to the permeate flow as being contributed by the filter cake formed on the membrane surface during filtration later a great majority of researches have been conducted to improve and extend the model in order to be applicable in the case of compressible sludge shirato et al 1969 schippers and verdouw 1980 bassirou et al 2019 by analyzing different physical mechanisms for the foulants deposition inside and or top of the membrane pore hermans and bredee 1936 and later gonsalves 1950 developed the classical blocking law which has shown that all the filtration equations can be derived from a second order non linear differential equation by adjusting two empirical constants thus far blocking model has been widely adopted as a powerful tool for simulating fouling behavior and modeling filtration flux during both constant pressure operation and constant flow operation grase 1956 hermia 1982 hwang et al 2007 tien et al 2014 iritani et al 2016 the blocking filtration laws describe four different mechanisms of the fouling process standard blocking intermediate blocking complete blocking and cake formation bowen et al 1995 some researchers attempted to model flux variation based on an individual fouling mechanism hlavacek and bouchet 1993 zhang et al 2018 however the results of the different studies indicated that the fouling mechanism during the filtration process may not follow any of the individual classical models and likely the different fouling mechanisms might occur simultaneously or sequentially liu et al 2008 yao et al 2017 in this case models that combine two or more classical blocking mechanisms have been shown to be useful methods to improve the representing accuracy of flux variation goldrick et al 2017 ho and zydney 2000 for the first time developed a combined fouling model which describes flux decline initially through pore blocking and subsequently by cake formation over the blocked membrane although the model showed good agreement with the membrane flux data during the filtration of bovine serum albumin bsa internal fouling was neglected in this model duclos orsello et al 2006 developed the model to describe flux decline during filtration accounting for both external and internal fouling from another perspective iratani et al 2005 proposed a combined filtration model in which cake formation and pore blocking occurred simultaneously the model assumed that some membrane pores remain open intermediate blocking even at the late pseudo steady stage of filtration a novel method which combines darcy s law and traditional blocking models was developed by bolton et al 2006 they proposed five new fouling models based on the combined effects of the different individual fouling mechanism among them the cake complete model provided the best fit with the experimental data recently hou et al 2017 considered a steady membrane frontal area k in the cake complete model to improve the predictive accuracy of the model a limitation of these combine models is that the pressure drop across the filter cake and clogged membrane are treated as a similar mechanism according to the resistances in series model based on darcy s law 1 δ p μ r m r c j where δ p is the pressure drop across the cake and membrane pa μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s j is the permeate flux ms 1 and r m and r c are the membrane and cake resistances m 1 respectively this model is based on two main assumptions which may be invalid under certain circumstances 1 the permeate flux j is considered as constant throughout the filter cake and the filter membrane several studies showed that the assumption involving the constancy of flux may be strikingly in error where the cross sectional area of the filter cake and clogged membrane cannot be similar and might dramatically change during filtration tiller and cooper 1960 vorobiev 2006 2 it is postulated that the relationship between flow rate through membrane pores and pressure drop is linear this assumption has also shown some errors particularly for the modeling of the initial flux decline at a high flux operation when scaling up to full scale manufacturing xu et al 2017 thurmer et al 2012 wang et al 2006 in this case the linear relationship between the flow rate through porous medium and pressure drop may turn into non linearity firdaous et al 1997 ergun 1952 as these assumptions are far from true especially in the early stage of filtration which has been reported as a significant portion of total permeate flux approximately 30 50 yao et al 2018 it is necessary to develop a new combined model to appropriately describe the process of cake and membrane resistances and model the constitutive relationship between them during the filtration process in this study a novel membrane filtration mathematical model was developed to describe flux decline during both the initial and pseudo steady stage of membrane filtration to account for the membrane resistance into the model a new dimensionless parameter termed the filter number fn was introduced the proposed model was compared with experimental data obtained during dead end filtration tests of three different types of feed at different pressures wastewater sludge and microalgae suspension were filtered through polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 0 1 μm and mixed celluloseester mce 0 3 μm microfiltration membranes respectively moreover the applicability of the model to the ultramembrane filtration data of commercial sodium alginate sa from the work of sioutopoulos and karabelas 2016 was also tested the model was compared with the existing models and was validated using experimental data by the sum of squared deviation ssd mean relative deviation mrd and regression coefficient r 2 2 model development the proposed model in this study was developed based on the conservation of energy head principle for flowing fluids through the filter cake and membrane pores fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of energy head losses due to cake formation and membrane blocking during the membrane filtration process in the development of filtration models usually it is assumed that all the particles are rejected by the membrane it is also postulated that dynamic head kinetic energy and hydraulic head potential energy reduce to negligible values in comparison with high applied pressure head ruth 1935 according to the conservation of energy principle the total pressure head drop is equal to total head losses 2 p ρ g δ h c a k e δ h m e m b r a n e where p is the applied pressure pa ρ is the density of the fluid at all points in the fluid kg m 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity ms 2 and δ h c a k e and δ h m e m b r a n e are the total energy head losses due to the filter cake and clogged membrane m respectively 2 1 energy head loss due to filter cake resistance by the assumption of full foulant rejection by the membrane all particles accumulate on the membrane surface and form a filter cake as the water flows frictionally through the filter cake the pressure head drops until it reaches the value of δ h m e m b r a n e at the interface of the cake and supporting medium fig 1 darcy s law is commonly used to calculate this head loss associated with frictional effects as a function of flow rate and cake resistance as sioutopoulos and karabelas 2016 3 δ h c a k e μ ρ g r c j the cake resistance to flow is increased with time by the growth of the filter cake during the filtration process goldrick et al 2017 to account for the variation of cake resistance as a function of time during the filtration period the classical cake filtration model was used in the proposed model as developed in bolton s model bolton et al 2006 4 r c t r 0 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 0 5 where r 0 is the initial cake resistance m 1 k c is the cake filtration constant in the blocking model sm 2 and j 0 is the initial flux value sm 1 the pressure head loss due to cake resistance can be obtained by inserting eq 4 into eq 3 5 δ h c a k e μ r 0 ρ g 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 0 5 j 2 2 energy head loss due to filter membrane resistance the energy head loss due to membrane resistance occurs when the streamlines are directed away from the axial direction of flow and contracted to pass through the open area of the membrane pores fig 1 hager 2010 in this case the speed of the flux passing through the porous medium increases rapidly and the flow regime turns from darcy s flow to an inertial flow regime experimental studies for conduit contractions gardel 1962 and filtration test with pure water at high fluxes xu et al 2017 thumer et al 2012 show that membrane head loss will vary as the square of fluid flux through open pores firdaous et al 1997 the most common equation used to determine this head loss is 6 δ h m e m b r a n e f j o p e n 2 2 g f q a o p e n 2 2 g f a m a o p e n 2 j 2 2 g where j o p e n is the fluid flux throughout the open area of the membrane f is the loss coefficient dimensionless q is the flow volume rate m3s 1 and a m and a o p e n are the membrane frontal area and the area of the membrane which remains uncovered at any given time during filtration m2 respectively to characterize the physicochemical properties of the membrane i e the aperture opening size aos material and the loss coefficient a new dimensionless factor has been defined in this study which is referred to as the filter number fn given by eq 7 7 f n t f a m a o p e n 2 for a pure water filtration test with a clean membrane the total pressure head drop is due to head loss associated with the membrane eq 2 δ h m e m b r a n e p ρ g filter number for a clean membrane can be calculated from eq 8 as the slope of the pressure head versus dynamic head curve 8 f n 0 f a m a 0 2 pressure head p ρg dynamic head j w 2 2 g where a o is the open area of clean membrane m2 and j w is the pure water flux ms 1 this number is a specific number for a clean membrane however during the filtration process with feed solutions the available membrane area appreciably declines as large particles partially intermediate blocking or completely complete blocking seal off pore entrances this can also occur due to pore constriction by small colloid matters that accumulate inside membranes on the pore wall standard blocking as schematically illustrated in fig 1 on the bases of the blocking law and fouling mechanisms bolton et al 2006 obtained eq 9 and eq 10 for the loss of available membrane area as a function of time in the complete model and in the intermediate model respectively kim et al 2013 9 a o p e n a 0 exp k b t 10 a o p e n a 0 1 k i j 0 t 1 where k b and k i are the complete blocking constant s 1 and the intermediate blocking constant m 1 respectively a similar equation for the loss of free membrane area as a function of time eq 9 was used by ho and zydney 2000 eq 9 and eq 10 can be obtained in terms of accumulated permeate volume v in the complete model according to eq 11 and in the intermediate model according to eq 12 11 a o p e n a 0 1 k b j 0 v 12 a o p e n a 0 exp k i v bolton et al 2006 used eq 11 in their cake complete model in order to obtain permeate volume as a function of time while iritani et al 2015 employed the intermediate blocking law eq 12 in which some membrane pores still remain open to describe the loss of available membrane as a function of volume however these equations for the loss of membrane area in terms of time eqs 9 and 10 or permeate volume eqs 11 and 12 may not be valid in the presence of the cake because these equations are derived by assuming that the membrane resistance and the cake resistance are constant independent of the permeate flux this assumption means that the flux decline during membane filtration is only due to the decay in membrane area and the effect of the resistances variation on the flux decline is not considered in order to consider the effects of resistances variation on the flux decay during membare filtration hou et al 2017 inserted the accumulated permeate volume from the cake complete model of bolton et al into eq 11 and obtained eq 13 for the loss of available membrane area as a function of time 13 a o p e n a 0 e x p k b k c j 0 2 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 1 2 1 the combined cake complete model is the most effective model in describing the fouling process for both membrane fouling and cake formation liu and kim 2008 goldrick et al 2017 bolton et al 2006 thus in the proposed model the modified cake complete model is used to obtain the fn as a function of time by inserting eq 13 and eq 8 into eq 7 14 f n t f n 0 e x p 2 k b k c j 0 2 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 1 2 1 eq 15 represents the energy head loss due to membrane resistance as a function of time permeate flux was obtained by combining eqs 6 7 and 14 15 δ h m e m b r a n e f n 0 e x p 2 k b k c j 0 2 1 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 1 2 j 2 2 g 2 3 flux modeling in order to model the flux variation during membrane filtration a new mathematical model was developed based on darcy regime through the filter cake and inertial regime through the porous membrane in the proposed model the dynamic approach of the fouling process was implemented by using the cake filtration model for representing the cake resistance variation and complete blocking model for describing the membrane resistance increasing due to the loss of available area eq 16 was obtained by combining eqs 2 5 and 15 16 f n 0 2 g e x p 2 k b k c j 0 2 1 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 1 2 j 2 μ r 0 ρ g 1 2 k c j 0 2 t 0 5 j p ρ g 0 a similar form of this quadratic equation was derived by forchheimer 1901 for the expression of the pressure dissipation due to the flow of the fluid through an isotropic medium firdaous et al 1997 he suggested the inclusion of an inertial term representing the dynamic energy of the fluid to the darcy s equation the law related to the loss of the pressure head of forchheimer is given by eq 17 17 p a j 2 b j where p is the pressure gradient i e for constant pressure operation in one dimension p p ρ g and a and b are constants to be determined from experiments ergun 1952 generalized the forchheimer equation for packed beds and obtained a and b values as a function of membrane porosity ergun 1952 solving quadratic eq 17 and the substitution of a and b from proposed model eq 16 allows to establish the relationship between the flux filtration time and the applied pressure eq 18 18 j g f n μ r c ρ g 2 2 f n ρ g 2 p 0 5 μ r c ρ f n where r c and f n represent the effect of cake resistance and membrane resistance respectively and can be obtained from eq 4 and eq 14 as a function of time in the case of the clean water test r c 0 0 the only resistance is due to the membrane resistance thus eq 18 will be equal to eq 8 which is valid for a pure water filtration by the assumption that membrane resistance is negligible f n 0 0 or in very low flux filtration j 2 0 the darcy regime will be the domain and eq 16 turns to the cake filtration model eq 19 in table 1 3 experimental 3 1 materials in order to evaluate the application of the new proposed model as well as the existing models in the literature table 1 three different types of feed suspensions were used wastewater sludge the activated sludge was collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant gwacheon wwtp south korea the sludge contained 4200 mgl 1 of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss the ph and zeta potential values of sludge suspension were measured to be 7 8 and 10 90 mv respectively in order to stabilize the sludge condition 100 mgl 1 of 0 035 w v sodium azide nan3 was added to the suspension then the solution was mixed at 1000 rpm with a stirrer for 15 min next the sample was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for a period of 24 h and then allowed to warm to room temperature before using to minimize sludge biological activity microalgae suspension the chlamydomonas sp microalgae suspension with 1 98 g dry weight l and 7 5 ph used in this work was described in the previous study of taghavijeloudar et al 2019 sodium alginate solution the sodium alginate filtration experimental data processed in this study were obtained from the work of sioutopoulos and karabelas 2016 the membranes used in this study were 0 1 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and 0 3 μm mixed celluloseester mce microfiltration with an effective filtration area of 0 0433 m 2 in order to reduce the hydrophobic effect of the membranes the clean membranes were pre wetted by placing them into distilled water for 12 h before each experiment 3 2 experimental setup and procedure a bench scale dead end setup cs20 201203538 with the schematic layout shown in fig 2 was used to perform microfiltration experiments under a constant pressure condition the working volume and area of the filtration cylinder were 20 l and 0 0706 m2 0 3 m diameter respectively a p425 hp375 t4i dual pressure portable air compressor was used to deliver an airflow of 0 18 0 20 cfm at a pressure of 100 1100 kpa to determine the filter number fn 0 and resistance of virgin membrane the pure water flux of the pre wetted membranes was measured at operating pressures of 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 kpa for both pvdf and mce membranes the pure water flux was calculated according to the time t for collecting 20 l pure water j w 0 283 t the microfiltration experiments with microalgae suspension and wastewater sludge were conducted at four different pressures of 200 and 300 kpa for microalgae and 400 and 500 kpa for wastewater in each filtration process 7 l of the suspension initial height of 0 1 m was passed through the filter placed at the bottom of the filtration chamber the variation of the suspension height h with time t was recorded through a plexiglass window which was improvised on the filtration chamber using a video camera connected to a personal computer the permeate flux j was calculated as 19 j a c a m δ h t 1000 where j is the permeate flux lm 2 h 1 δ h is the suspension height decrease during filtration m t is the duration time of the filtration for δh h a c and a m are the cylinder area 0 0706 m2 and the effective membrane area 0 0433 m2 respectively the filtration experiment lasted to achieve a nearly constant permeation flux the rejection of the feed components was then quantified as follows 20 r c f e e d c p e r m e a t e c f e e d 100 where r is the rejection rate c f e e d and c p e r m e a t e are the concentrations of the solute in the feed and permeate mgl 1 respectively in order to determine the final value of the membrane resistance f n f after each test the filter cake layer was wiped away carefully the membrane was backwashed and a filtration test with pure water and fouled membrane was performed all experiments were performed at room temperature 24 1 co and in duplicate 3 3 statistical analysis to analyze the accuracy of the new model in comparison with the conventional models the sum of squared deviation ssd the mean relative deviation mrd and standard deviation σ between the experimental data and the calculated values of the models were determined taghavi et al 2010 21 sse 1 n i n j exp i j cal i 2 22 mre 1 n i n j exp i j cal i j exp i 23 σ i n j exp i j cal i 2 n where n is the number of recorded data during an experiment and j cal i and j exp i are the calculated and experimental flux values at filtration time i respectively in addition graphs j cal i versus j exp i were plotted and r square values were obtained by excel 2016 to compare the performance of the new proposed and existing models 4 results and discussion 4 1 filtration experiments with pure water to achieve better understanding of the membrane resistance filtration tests with pure water were performed at different pressures in this study the variations of the pure water fluxes j w and dynamic head j w 2 2 g versus applied pressure were plotted in fig 3 a for pvdf and mce membranes the figure shows a linear increase in pure water fluxes at low pressures lower than 100 kpa however when the operating pressure is over a critical value the j w p relationship is no longer linear which suggests that the flow regime transferred from the darcy regime to the inertial flow regime where darcy s law is not valid any more as shown in fig 3a at a higher pressure the dynamic head is directly proportional to the applied pressure which suggests that the loss of linearity in the inertial flow regime can be corrected using the filter number fn from eq 7 instead of the membrane resistance r m from darcy law fig 3b shows the variation of clean membrane filter number fn 0 and membrane resistance r m as a function of applied pressure for pvdf and mce membranes at lower pressure the darcy flow regime the filter number fn 0 decreased with increasing applied pressure while the membrane resistance r m was slightly influenced by the pressure however at higher pressure in the inertial flow regime the filter number fn 0 was found to be independent of pressure while membrane resistance r m increased with increasing pressure some researchers have reported similar results for membrane resistance r m variation with pressure at lower fluxes huisman et al 1997 rezaei et al 2014 however they described the increase in resistance with increasing pressure to the compressibility of the membrane according to the results shown in fig 3 for pvdf 0 1 μm and mce 0 3 μm membranes it is noted that the filter number fn 0 and the membrane resistance r m decreased from 4 0 109 and 4 5 1011 m 1 to 9 5 108 and 2 2 1011 m 1 respectively with the increase of pore size consequently the pure water flux increased hydrodynamically as would be expected 4 2 filtration test with feed suspensions 4 2 1 permeate flux and cumulative volume variation with time fig 4 shows the variation of the permeate flux j and permeate cumulative volume v with time for wastewater sludge microalgae suspension and sodium alginate through the pvdf 0 1 μm the mce 0 3 μm and pan 20 kda at constant pressures of 500 and 400 kpa 300 and 200 kpa and 103 to 68 kpa respectively for all filtration tests the permeate flux alleviated rapidly at the beginning of filtration due to membrane pore blocking then followed by a gradual decline during pseudo steady stage as it can be seen from fig 4b the initial rate of flux decline was quite rapid for microalgae filtration in comparison to wastewater and sodium alginate filtration the permeate flux decreased 90 from its initial value of 1893 l m 2h 1 with in 60 s of microalgae filtration at 300 kpa compared to 70 and 20 decline of wastewater sludge and sodium alginate filtration at 500 and 103 kpa respectively this might be because of extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp in the primary secretion of the microalgae cells which forces the fouling to be worse in comparison to wastewater sludge as reported previously liao et al 2018 after the initial stage the flux decreased gradually toward a nearly constant value when the main fouling mechanism changes to the cake filtration model although the flux variation at long filtration times looks independent of time on the scale of fig 4 the permeate flux continues to decline indicating that while the membrane pore blocking reaches to a stable level the filter cake growths gradually on top of fouled membrane fig 5 shows feed components rejection during filtration of sodium alginate at 68 and 103 kpa microalgae at 200 and 300 kpa and wastewater sludge at 400 and 500 kpa it can be seen that the feed rejection decreases as applied pressure increases this can be due to the increase of the mass transfer driving force and consequently the transport of feed components through the membrane is facilitated as pressure increases the low rejection for microalgae 62 1 means that most of microalgae cells break during filtration resulting in smaller particles that can pass through the membrane and the formed cake 4 2 2 determination of filtration parameters the experimental initial flux values j 0 resulted in less than the pure water flux j w through a clean membrane due to initial particle adsorption before test runs it is reported that the initial adsorption can be 20 2000 of the clean membrane resistance depending on the membrane pore size ognier et al 2002 therefore even at time zero there is an initial cake resistance r 0 which can be calculated from eq 18 by having j j 0 and f n f n 0 after each test a final filter number f n f was obtained from the pure water test with the clogged filter other fitting parameters k b k i k s k c and k were determined by fitting methods minimizing the standard deviation σ and are shown in table 2 to identify the pore blocking mechanism which resulted in the loss of available membrane area a o p e n the filter number were calculated according to the blocking model as a function of time using eq 9 the intermediate model as a function of time using eq 10 and as a function of volume using eq 11 and the proposed model according to eq 13 for wastewater sludge fig 6 a during the early stage of the filtration the filter number increases sharply in time due to the quick pore blockage of the membrane then the filter cake forms and becomes denser which prevents the pore blocking from growing the filter number increases more slowly and the available membrane area will become constant at long filtration times fig 6a however the filter number values calculated from the classical equations eq 9 to eq 11 showed an exponential increasing in a short period of filtration time because the effect of cake resistance variation is not considered in these equations for instance the filter number values calculated from the exponential equation of standard blocking eq 11 showed much higher values 7 2 10 10 than the final filter number 2 10 10 even at the early stage of filtration 2 min therefore the proposed equation by hou et al 2017 based on the cake completed blocking model eq 13 might be more accurate for describing the filter number variation as a function of time the variation of cake resistance as a function of time was calculated from eq 4 for different feeds of wastewater sludge microalgae suspension and sodium alginate solution fig 6b similar to membrane resistance the filter cake resistance also dramatically increases at the early period of filtration and then increases slowly in the pseudo steady stage due to decreasing filtration flux the microalgae suspension exhibited higher cake resistance due to the fact that not only extracellular products eps smp of microalgae can cause significant fouling problem but also the algal cells with bigger size 10 μm may increase cake resistance the cake resistance data show that the applied pressure affects the fouling resistance as one would expected it suggests that increased applied pressure leads to increased initial permeate flux j 0 and cake resistance r c consequently 4 2 3 energy head loss behaviors during filtration in order to get new insights helpful to understand energy head losses during filtration process the contribution of head losses due to membrane resistance δ h m e m b a r n e and filter cake resistance δ h c a k e to total pressure head are plotted in fig 7 for the three different feed solutions the variation of δ h cake with time was calculated by using eq 5 and the δ h membarne was obtained by subtracting δ h cake form total pressure head p ρg contrary to what has been reported in the previous studies the difference between pure water flux through clean membrane j w and initial flux values j 0 indicated that the clean membrane resistance does not correspond to the total pressure head drop at the beginning of filtration however membrane resistance exhibited the highest contribution to the total pressure head drop at the initial stage of filtration and decreased toward a negligible portion compared to cake resistance as time elapsed fig 7a and b this might because the membrane resistance arising from particles arriving directly on the membrane pores is added to the cake resistance it should be emphasized that microalgae cell lysis releases a large amount of eps and smp which are preferentially adhered to membrane surface to accumulate an additional gel layer therefore the filter cake resistance corresponds to the major portion of pressure head drop as shown in fig 7b however the results of sodium alginate filtration test with ultrafiltration membrane pan depicted in fig 7c revealed that the resistance of ultrafiltration membrane had a domain influence on the pressure head drop even at the pseudo steady stage of filtration particularly at lower pressure of 68 kpa where the cake resistance is lower in addition variations of feed height h with time t during filtration process were plotted in fig 7 the maximum hydraulic head produced by the feed height 0 1 m is 100 times less than the minimum applied pressure head 10 5 m for sa therefore the assumption that hydrodynamic head is negligible is reasonable in the proposed model 4 3 verification of the proposed model 4 3 1 model performance in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model the variation of the permeate flux with time was analyzed for the three different feeds of wastewater sludge microalgae suspensions and sodium alginate solution at different pressures fig 8 shows the application of the proposed model individual fouling models i e models 1 to 4 in table 1 and combined models i e models of ho and zydney 2000 bolton et al 2006 and hou et al 2017 to model the permeation flux under different conditions the black circles represent experimental data while the solid thick curves are the proposed model calculations using eq 18 the colored solid curves are the calculateds from the combined and individual models it was observed that individual blocking models alone were not capable of describing the flux trend for the whole filtration process however these basic models showed different effectiveness in the modeling of the flux over various filtration stages and operating conditions in fact some general trends in their ability to fit the experimental data were observed the cake filtration model was able to reasonably describe flux variation in all cases however the results depicted in fig 8 demonstrated that the use of the proposed model as well as combined models obviously improved the cure fitting suggesting that complex combined fouling mechanisms might occur simultaneously during filtration instead of an individual fouling mechanism the calculations of the proposed model had excellent agreement with experimental data at different cases it is of significance to note that the calculations of the proposed model showed a greater performance in the modeling of the permeate flux decline in the initial period of filtration while the other classical models failed for all filtration models it is assumed that the flow of the fluid through porous medium follows darcy regime which might be the reason of the inappropriate trend in the modeling of the existing models in the initial stage 4 3 2 comparison of existing models and the proposed model table 3 reports the results of the statistical analysis for the proposed model and other existing models the outcomes of the mean relative deviation mrd analysis confirm that the best predictive accuracy occurred with the proposed model which had the lowest mrd with the filtration experiments data of wastewater sludge mrd 1 1 microalgae suspension mrd 1 8 and sodium alginate solutions mrd 1 6 in the light of the obtained results of the sum of squared deviation ssd analysis the comparative study of the new model with those of existing model demonstrated that the proposed model is more effective in the modeling of flux variation in the initial stage of filtration when the flux value is high and results in higher ssd value the flux values calculated from the proposed model and existing models j cal verses experimental values j exp were plotted in fig 9 moreover the r square r 2 values between the calculated values and experimental records were determined and summarized in table 3 these results also proved that the proposed model was capable to model the experimental data over the entire process of filtration for the different feed solutions at different pressures it can be seen that the model showed lower correction with the microalgae experimental data at the lower pressure of 200 kpa mrd 2 6 ssd 42 1 r 2 0 998 this might be due to the lower rejection of the microalgae feed components during the filtration fig 5 the best fit of the proposed model occurred with the wastewater experimental data at higher pressure of 500 kpa r 2 0 999 an increase in the pressure leads to higher initial flux due to high driving force in this case the flow regime through porous medium might turn from darcy regime to an inertial regime and since it is postulated in the proposed model that the permeate flux through porous medium follows an inertial regime it is not surprising that the proposed model produced the best fit to the wastewater experimental data with higher permeate flux 5 conclusion for high flux filtration it has been shown that the existing models have not been able to describe flux variation particularly at the early stage of filtration a new mathematical model of membrane filtration based on the approach of energy head loss has been developed and verified in the model it was assumed that the flow regime through the filter cake and membrane pores follows darcy regime and an inertial regime respectively the model accounts for the effect of fouling spatial variation by implementing the complete cake model for pore clogging and the cake filtration law for cake formation the new dimensionless filter number fn enabled the model to use the same two fitting parameters from classical single blocking laws the application of the proposed model was evaluated based on dead end filtration experiments with three different feeds of wastewater sludge microalgae suspension and sa solution under different conditions the following results were obtained results of the pure water filtration test with virgin pvdf and mce membranes demonstrated a non linear relationship between flux and pressure at higher fluxes indicating that a flow regime through membrane pores might not always follow darcy regime according to the results of the filter number fn calculation membrane resistance dramatically increased at the very beginning of the filtration and then increased slowly suggesting that the flux decline is a result of the increase in the membrane resistance due to the membrane pore clogging at the beginning complete blocking model then formation of a cake layer over the membrane surface slowed down pore blocking process thus cake resistance will later be the main resistance to the permeate flow cake model the proposed model calculations showed the best fit to the experimental data for all cases the existing combined models could not describe flux variation well where the flow regime does not follow darcy regime particularly in the early stage of filtration the individual blocking models were able to provide a good fit of the data in specific periods of the experiments where these models are the main fouling mechanisms but not over the entire course of the filtration the values of ssd and correlation coefficient data confirmed that the proposed model provides better performance in higher flux membranes in general the combined model developed in this study can also be utilized as relatively simple tools for flux modeling in both slow membrane and fast membrane filtration

18453,stabilization of waste activated sludge was is an essential step for the disposal or reuse in this study was stabilization via electrochemical pretreatment ept at 0 15v was evaluated for simultaneous dewaterability enhancement pathogen removal and h2s mitigation the mechanism underlying ept was investigated and discussed based on the changes in the physicochemical e g particle size zeta potential hydrophobicity and extracellular polymeric substances and biological characteristics i e cell morphology and distribution and percentages of live dead cells of was with different ept voltages the results revealed that ept disintegrated was flocs and disrupted the cell walls leading to a reduction in particle size by up to 50 increased release of extracellular and intracellular substances by up to 4 times to facilitate was stabilization with ept at 15v the capillary suction time of was decreased by 42 and the concentrations of e coli and indicator pathogens salmonella spp and streptococcus faecalis fell by nearly 5 log10 reaching u s epa hygienization levels furthermore ept at 12v or higher suppressed the amounts of dissolved sulfide and h2s g produced from the was under anaerobic conditions by over 99 this study demonstrates the feasibility of ept for simultaneous was dewaterability enhancement pathogen inactivation and h2s mitigation providing a one step alternative for sludge stabilization graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge stabilization electrochemical pretreatment pathogen inactivation dewaterability enhancement sulfide removal 1 introduction the stabilization and treatment of waste activated sludge was in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps pose a challenge worldwide with a highly hydrated colloid structure water content of 95 99 zhen et al 2018 unstabilized was not only hosts harmful pathogens salmonella spp escherichia coli etc in concentrations of 5 7 log units above acceptable levels arthurson 2008 it also causes malodor by generating hydrogen sulfide h2s thereby posing a health risk e g diarrhoea and h2s poisoning to those in surrounding areas around 1 8 billion people worldwide especially those living in low and middle income countries are currently suffering from poor sanitation and absence of appropriate sludge treatment systems berendes et al 2017 around 25 50 of the operating costs of wwtps that employ the activated sludge method are spent on sludge treatment and disposal including stabilization for dewatering volume reduction inactivating pathogens and eliminating malodor arising from h2s campos et al 2009 typical technologies applied for was stabilization are 1 alkaline conditioning with lime 2 anaerobic digestion ad 3 aerobic digestion and 4 composting metcalf and eddy 2014 lime addition is effective in both pathogen reduction and malodor control but it increases the total amount of sludge by 20 30 samaras et al 2008 another concern is the large amounts of ammonia nh3 emission from lime conditioning sludge due to the rise of ph kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 liu et al 2012 in comparison ad is a popular process used for sludge stabilization with energy recovery in the form of methane while the value of methane based electricity and heat production is not well recognized as it hardly benefits the downstream processing kleerebezem et al 2015 in addition typically 500 4000 ppm gaseous phase only of h2s are produced in an anaerobic digester akgul et al 2017 han et al 2018 most of the produced h2s in an anaerobic system can be eliminated by the addition of chemicals such as k2feo4 50 mg g dried sludge he et al 2009 but the frequent transport handling and storage of chemicals come with occupational health and safety concerns pikaar et al 2015 lin et al 2017 various auxiliary means such as ozonation semblante et al 2017 gholikandi et al 2018 thermal treatment svensson et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and chemical addition e g ferrate calcium peroxide and free nitrous acid he et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 wei et al 2018 have been developed specifically for sludge dewaterability enhancement pathogen removal or h2s control but usually a combination of techniques is needed to solve all issues du et al 2016 a robust versatile approach capable of tackling all three challenges simultaneously would be more practical and maintenance friendly chen et al 2011 anjum et al 2016 electrochemical pretreatment ept has attracted increasing interest as an emerging technique for treating sludge thanks to its small footprint and minimal chemical addition yin et al 2018 olvera vargas et al 2019 silva et al 2019 moreover industrial shock loads or seawater infiltration intrusion can raise the was salt content and conductivity he et al 2017 which is in favor of an electrochemical process lin et al 1998 enhancement of sludge dewaterability with ept has been proven recently where a decrease in capillary suction time cst of more than 30 was achieved at 30 v yuan et al 2011 gharibi et al 2013 ept is also found to be effective in inactivating pathogens of was and ept at 18 v reduced the e coli concentration in was by 6 logs elektorowicz and oleszkiewicz 2012 yin et al 2018 destroying the hydrated colloidal structure of sludge flocs and disrupting the cell walls by producing ohmic heat and or oxidants such as chlorine are recognized as the main ways through which ept stabilizes sludge xiao et al 2018 yin et al 2018 we therefore hypothesized that sludge malodor i e arising from h2s can also be addressed by ept by means of the produced oxidants and or microbial inactivation scaglia et al 2011 chen et al 2011 he et al 2018 and that ept could very well be a three in one approach integrating dewaterability enhancement pathogen removal and h2s control simultaneously if the current is supplied intermittently the energy consumption can be noticeably reduced due to minimal use of electric field mollah et al 2001 akamatsu et al 2010 the purpose of this study is to investigate the comprehensive capabilities of ept and its potential for sludge stabilization i e was dewaterability pathogen inactivation and h2s control changes in the physicochemical e g electrical resistance and current particle size zeta potential and extracellular polymer substances and biological characteristics i e microbial cell morphology and percentage of viable cells of was caused by different voltages of ept were investigated thereafter the effects of ept on was dewaterability pathogen inactivation and h2s control were evaluated and the working mechanism is discussed our results are expected to provide guidance on the use of ept as a one step solution to all of the challenges associated with sludge stabilization and disposal 2 materials and

100 w v homogenized with a wrist action shaker at 900 oscillations min for 10 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 300 g for 3 min at 4 c martín díaz et al 2017 the supernatant was used to

deoxycholate agar merck germany and counted after incubation at 36 c for 24 h 2 6 biochemical sulfide potential a biochemical sulfide potential test was conducted in triplicate using 125 ml serum bottles to assess the odor potential of was as h2s has typically been used as a surrogate for odor emission the sulfidogenic process contributes to around 80 of total h2s emission in anaerobic conditions sun et al 2016 dalby et al 2018 sulfidogenic sludge was taken from a sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed reactor in the same wwtp 40 ml of treated was 0 15 v were mixed with an equal volume

variables as a statistical analysis tool it has been used extensively in environmental studies wilen et al 2003 wang et al 2017 in this study correlation analysis was performed and scatter matrixes were plotted for sludge physicochemical characteristics using the r program the correlations were considered statistically significant with a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 2 8 cost estimation to evaluate application potential of ept an economic analysis was conducted the energy consumption of ept was calculated based on eq 1 brillas et al 2009 1 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n k w h l t 0 n e c e l l i t 1000 v s where e cell is the applied voltage v i is the current a t is the time h and v s is the sample volume l the power price was 0 12 kwh in hong kong and the transport and disposal costs of was were estimated at 50 wet ton assuming that these residues are not considered hazardous biosolids wang et al 2013 the chemical cost for facilitating dewater process was around 1 m3 zhai et al 2012 and the average cost for sulfide removal was estimated at 5 2 kg s zhang et al 2008 the analysis was conducted at 95 confidence intervals 3 results 3 1 changes in the physical characteristics of was changes in the physical properties of treated was and variation of current were investigated to obtain a preliminary understanding of the impacts of ept on was fig 1 the transient current electrical resistance and anode potentials were recorded fig 1a and fig a2 with constant voltage input the current decreased over the course of ept at voltage range of 1 8 v while a continuous increase was recorded at higher voltages e g from 190 12 to 245 28 ma at 12 v and from 250 7 to 335 65 ma at 15 v the changes in electrical resistance were inversely correlative with current variation disintegration of flocs is reflected by the was particle size distribution as illustrated in fig 1b the peak volume percentage of particle size decreased and shrank with increased voltage the particle size of raw was ranged from 10 1 1 0 to 116 2 2 2 μm after ept at 15 v for instance the particle size dropped to a range of 8 8 1 2 44 9 1 8 μm and the mean size decreased by nearly a half from 54 2 2 0 to 27 1 1 0 μm in a sludge system the aggregation and dispersion of particles can be revealed by the zeta potential sludge particles were negatively charged with a zeta potential of 26 1 mv due to the presence of ionizable groups such as carboxylates and phosphates the zeta potential gradually increased to 18 2 7 2 and 2 1 mv after ept at 5 10 and 15 v respectively fig 1c in addition the hydrophobicity of was dropped remarkably with an increasing voltage from 81 2 initially to 62 4 10 v and 33 3 15 v fig 1d 3 2 effects of ept on the chemical characteristics of was the impacts of ept on the chemical characteristics of was were examined with a focus on organics and nutrient release fig 2 the mlvss decreased from 4230 60 mg l at 0 v to 3530 76 mg l at 10 v and further dropped to 3370 50 mg l at 15 v showing a maximum reduction of 20 reductions in solids tss and vss are highly desirable considering how costly it is to transport and dispose of sludge meanwhile solids reduction implies solubilization scod rose steadily from 0 017 0 010 to 0 22 0 018 mg cod mg vs with a rising voltage due to the release of was components during floc disintegration and the release of cellular components during cell lysis fig 2b proteins and polysaccharides were released increasingly when a high voltage was applied with a peak value of 0 120 0 007 mg mg vs at 15v soluble proteins which is about 10 times higher than the peak amount of soluble polysaccharides fig 2c nh4 n remained constant after an increase from 0 005 0 001 mg n mg vs 1 3 v to around 0 008 0 001 mg n mg vs 5 15v fig 2d implying that some proteins might decompose when the voltage exceeds 5 v soluble metal concentrations remained very low with ept at 1 3 v accumulation of three metals in soluble phase was detected with an increasing voltage fig 3 in descending order of concentration these metals were fe mn and ni fe might have originated from the iron coagulant and iron containing compounds of cells e g ferredoxins and cytochromes its soluble concentration increased considerably from 1 3 10 4 1 0 10 5 mg mg vs 0 v to 0 057 0 001 mg mg vs 15 v similarly the liberation of mn and ni was limited at voltages below 5 v and their concentrations later reached 0 021 0 002 mn and 0 007 0 001 ni mg mg vs at 15 v the ph variations of was with ept at different voltages were provided in fig a3 3 3 effects of ept on the biological characteristics of was the direct effect of ept on was was evaluated at the cellular level optical microscopy inspection of cells before and after ept fig 4 a shows the morphological change of cells in was ept resulted in an obvious disruption of the cell envelop structure compared with intact cells 0 v live and dead bacterial consortia further underpinned the cell lysis damage caused by ept bacteria with intact cell membranes fluoresce bright green whereas bacteria with damaged membranes exhibit red fluorescence red fluorescent propidium iodide can bind to soluble nucleic acids released from bacteria fig 4b with ept at higher voltages the red fluorescence in was gradually became stronger indicating that more intracellular substances i e nucleic acids were released live and dead microorganisms at each voltage gradient was further quantified by determining the relative abundance of green and red pixels and the percentage of live cells is shown in fig 4c the change in cell viability was insignificant with ept below 5 v while a reduction around 12 were achieved at 15 v 66 2 compared with the control 78 3 fig 4c 3 4 was stabilization by ept 3 4 1 was dewaterability dewatering is essential for was disposal and dewaterability enhancement is highly desired after sludge stabilization cst and viscosity were used to evaluate the dewaterability of was after ept fig 5 a smaller cst value indicates greater dewaterability vesilind 1988 cst of was dropped from 48 1 s initially to 38 1 s and 30 1 s when the voltage reached 5 and 10 v respectively and stayed at a 28 1 s when the voltage increased to 15 v correspondingly sludge dewaterability was enhanced by about 37 and 42 after ept at 10 and 15 v respectively for 1 h furthermore sludge dewaterability is closely related to the viscosity of sludge mixtures and the sludge with poor dewaterability appeared to be stickier with a higher viscosity li and yang 2007 the viscosity of was reduced from initial 2 93 0 05 mpa s to 2 02 0 12 mpa s at 5 v 1 80 0 09 mpa s at 10 v and 1 65 0 10 mpa s at 15 v the maximum reduction of 44 in was viscosity was achieved with ept at 15 v which could be due to the decrease in ts concentration and enhanced solubilization effect jin et al 2004 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 3 4 2 pathogens in was pathogen inactivation is one objective of sludge stabilization and is essential for sanitary landfills and the agricultural reuse of sludge daneshmand et al 2012 cui et al 2013 routine indicators e g e coli and total coliform and indicator pathogens e g salmonella are used to reflect the presence of pathogens since these microorganisms may cause gastroenteritis and typhoid fever in humans winfield and groisman 2003 species of the salmonella genus can survive the harsh conditions in the sludge environment and are believed to be responsible for 1 to 2 million cases of human disease annually in the u s arthurson 2008 the effect of ept at 0 5 10 and 15 v on pathogen reduction was evaluated as shown in fig 6 the number of all tested pathogens decreased with an increasing applied voltage the amounts of e coli removed were 0 42 0 16 1 45 0 15 and 3 12 0 2 log10 cfu g ts after ept at 5 10 and 15 v respectively thereby meeting the level of hygienization required by the u s epa 3 log10 cfu g ts ruiz hernando et al 2014 the inactivation of salmonella spp and streptococcus faecalis was limited with ept at 5 v while the concentrations of these pathogens decreased significantly by more than 4 log10 cfu g ts with ept at 15 v 3 4 3 biological sulfide production of was h2s is considered as the dominant contributor to odorous and toxic gas emissions during was transportation storage and disposal pikaar et al 2015 the biochemical sulfide potential bsp test was applied to assess the sulfide production of the treated was peu et al 2012 sun et al 2016 zan et al 2016 the transient variation in dissolved sulfide production is shown in fig 7 a without ept was produced sulfide at levels exceeding 110 mg s l via the sulfate reduction process fig a4 the produced sulfide was released in the form of gaseous h2s with a concentration of 3596 155 parts per million ppm in the control test fig 7b high level sulfide production i e 110 mg s was ascribed to the high sulfate concentration 300 mg s l in wastewater due to the seawater toilet flushing system in hong kong wu et al 2016 after ept dissolved sulfide production was greatly suppressed the concentration of dissolved sulfide reduced to 70 5 11 1 and 2 1 mg s l with ept at 5 10 and 15 v respectively a sharp decrease in h2s in gaseous phase was also observed with elevated voltages furthermore dissolved sulfide production was almost completely quenched for an entire month with ept at 12 and 15 v fig a5 which clearly satisfies our hypothesis that malodor and pathogen control and dewaterability enhancement can be realized in one go with ept 4 discussion 4 1 impact of ept on was to uncover the underlying working mechanisms of ept the characteristics of treated was were investigated and their interactions were analyzed higher electric field strength resulted in intensive disintegration effects and induced the release of intracellular and or extracellular compounds from was and salts from the cytoplasm which in turn contributed to changes in electrical current and resistance fig 1a neutral zeta potential after ept implies a decrease of the electrostatic repulsion thus causing a reduction in the repulsive forces of flocs and enhancing aggregation based on the model of the sludge floccule structure macro flocs 125 0 μm in was are formed through the aggregation of 13 5 μm micro flocs which originate from much smaller particles 2 5 μm jorand et al 1995 the micro floc aggregates consist of the microbial cells and their eps fang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 ept caused the fragmentation of sludge flocs and destruction of the microbial cells overall led to a decrease over the aggregation and thereby reduced particle size this phenomenon was also observed when was was treated by synergetic hydrodynamic cavitation and the fenton reaction cai et al 2018 as indicated by the scatter matrixes coupled with correlation analysis fig 8 particle size showed a strong linear correlation with zeta potential and soluble protein concentration with r values of 0 92 and 0 90 respectively zeta potential demonstrated a strong correlation with protein concentration r 0 94 and hydrophobicity r 0 89 significant correlations p 0 05 between the concentrations of soluble metals and other variables e g voltage zeta potential and hydrophobicity were also found was can be considered as hydrated floc aggregates consisting of microbial cells and their extracellular polymeric substances eps and the eps containing large amount of protein and polysaccharide is dominant in sludge and known as a sink for metals due to the disintegration of the flocs microcolonies as shown in fig 1 decrease in particle size was clearly correlated with the release of soluble proteins polysaccharides and metals released metallic ions and amino groups typically carry positive charges which can neutralize the zeta potential fig 1c cell lysis is another impact caused by ept on was a voltage of 20 v can cause pores to form in microbial cell membranes yuan et al 2011 hereby the cell membrane loses its intrinsic properties of electrical resistance and barrier function sheng et al 2011 in this work cell lysis was directly captured under an optical microscope when a voltage of 8 v was applied fig 4a ept may directly attack and disorganize sludge flocs and cause cytoplasmic dissolution by passing an electrical current 1200 ma through materials rahmani et al 2015 additionally production of oxidants such as hclo hclo clo3 and clo4 via electrochlorination reactions could also contribute to cell damage various chlorine products including chlorine chlorate and perchlorate were detected in this study fig a6 cell lysis could occur upon chlorine exposure at doses between 7 and 29 mg min l which fall in the range of typical water disinfection practices daly et al 2007 overall these combined direct and indirect effects caused by ept including electroporation and electrooxidation resulted in disintegration of sludge flocs and induced the release of extracellular and or intracellular compounds from was fig 9 4 2 was stabilization sludge dewaterability is typically dependent on the physicochemical properties of sludge flocs the decreases in particle size fig 1a surface charge fig 1b and hydrophobicity fig 1c give decreased viscosity and cst i e enhanced dewaterability bigger particles can easily block the filter medium during filtration resulting in a large resistance to the flow of water molecules and thus lowering the was dewaterability karr and keinath 1978 such effects were eliminated in the present work since the mean particle size of was was reduced considerably from 54 to 27 μm corresponding to a 50 size reduction after ept at 8 15 v fig 1b neutral zeta potential implies a destruction of the electrostatic repulsion thus causing a reduction in the repulsive forces of flocs and enhancing dewatering li et al 2016 sludge dewaterability was also enhanced with the decrease in hydrophobicity jin et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 likely because the abundant trapped water was released with the disintegration of sludge flocs and a larger amount of smaller sludge flocs with a higher hydrophilicity were formed fig a7 a decrease in the hydrophobicity of the treated was could also result from the release of proteins to the bulk liquid with an increasing voltage ept soluble proteins reached 0 120 0 007 mg mg vs with ept at 15 v in this study however it has been widely reported that a high content of eps in sludge would jeopardize the sludge dewaterability liu and fang 2003 li and yang 2007 cao et al 2018 point out that a higher release of eps is associated with poorer sludge dewaterability if the sticky biopolymers proteins and humic substances cannot be converted into smaller molecules furthermore high voltages 30 v resulted in the additional disintegration of sludge flocs and excess release of eps 94 mg l which subsequently increased sludge viscosity and diminished the dewaterability gharibi et al 2013 in the current work was dewaterability was not jeopardized probably due to the intensive solubilization of eps components and the release of cell interstitial water during cell lysis fig 4 several mechanisms have been proposed for killing bacteria in sludge treated by electrochemical methods navab daneshmand et al 2012 suggested that ohmic heating was the primary cause of microbial inactivation and the ohmic heating temperature of 70 c was necessary for the inactivation of e coli yin et al 2018 however this explanation may not be supported by the present work as temperature fluctuations of only 1 2 c were observed due to the discrete operating mode and short operating duration 1 h huang et al 2016 reported that chlorine generated during electrochemical treatment was more effective in the disinfection of pathogens than direct chemical chlorination and free chlorine was always present during electrolysis even in the presence of free ammonia chlorine disinfectants produced in the system hclo and clo attack cell surface components such as the peptide bonds of protein side chains causing cell membrane damage or the malfunction of enzymatic transport systems pattison and davies 2001 in this study we observed an increase in free chlorine concentration to as high as 9 7 0 2 mg l as cl2 when the voltage increased to 15 v as the was sample used contained a high concentration of cl 4000 mg l due to the practice of seawater toilet flushing in hong kong in addition the titanium electrode used in this study can also facilitate chlorine production owing to its higher electrocatalytic activity on the surface jeong et al 2009 the contribution of electrochemically produced oxidants to sludge disinfection as well as aforementioned potential cell lysis cause in the ept system needs further investigation ept was also effective against h2s while the mechanism is unclear sulfate reduction process was not hindered in this study fig a4 based on the present results the dissolved sulfide might be precipitated by the released metals rather than oxidized by produced chlorine as it lasted less than 5 min after ept and the h2s was not produced at this stage precipitation with the released metal data not shown could be the major pathway for h2s elimination sludge is an abundant metals source babel and del mundo dacera 2006 and the fe source in was could be the fecl3 addition for flocculation and or sulfide mitigation ept destroyed sludge flocs enhancing liberation of metals tang et al 2018 nevertheless it cannot explain the long term one month sulfide suppression it is likely that ept caused the inactivation of specific microbes leading to the long term sulfide suppression further investigation is needed to confirm this speculation in this study the used was is saline due to the practice of seawater toilet flushing in hong kong as salt content is directly proportional to the system conductivity lin et al 1998 high conductivity renders a decrease in the resistance and the loss of energy to heat generation li et al 2002 as for the treatment of non saline sludge performance of ept is subject to the electrode materials conductivity reactor configuration and input voltage among these electrode material was identified as the key parameter based on our obtained results in addition efficient electrochemical sludge treatment can be achieved with other auxiliary means for instance addition of fenton reagent to the electrochemical system for sludge dewaterability enhancement masihi and gholikandi 2018 chen et al 2019 dosing oxidants such as h2o2 and naclo during electrochemical sludge pretreatment could lead to synergistic effects on cod solubilization thus improving sludge biodegradability feki et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 in this study no chemical was added to assist ept for achieving similar treatment efficiency with saline was used ept might be more compatible for saline streams 4 3 potential application of ept for was stabilization stabilization is an integral step during sludge handling for reducing pathogens eliminating malodor and improving dewaterability ad is currently the most popular sludge stabilization process regarding its energy recovery potential ept enhanced was solubilization scod increased by up to 12 9 times in this study showing its potential for improvement of ch4 production in ad an increase in biogas yield over 60 was recorded after ept at 20 v for 1 h yang et al 2014 nevertheless zhen et al 2014 presented that biogas production also can be inhibited by over 20 with ept 20 v 40 min and the reason is still unclear biogas production inhibition with ept on the other hand leaves us a window for accumulation of volatile fatty acids which could be in situ used as the carbon source in wwtps for nutrients removal in addition ept could be a complementary technique after anaerobic sludge digestion digestate contains high concentrations of fecal coliforms which even regrow to 5 7 log units after centrifuge dewatering higgins et al 2007 qi et al 2007 malodor generation is another concern for dewatered biosolids during its storage chen et al 2011 employment of ept after ad might be capable of tackling these problems in one go more investigations are deserved to support the expanding of application potential of ept on the other hand the possible adverse impact of ept cannot be neglected the released scod and stn from sludge in reject water will increase the loads of main stream in wwtps although the volume of the reject water is relatively small e g 0 5 of the influent in hong kong shatin lam et al 2016 it typically contributes to 10 30 nitrogen load to the wwtps van loosdrecht and salem 2006 in such case side stream processes e g sharon annamox and babe are suggested for nitrogen removal and or phosphorus recovery as fertilizer bozkurt et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2018 in general implementation of ept prior to ad or after ad depends on specific needs the cost of the overall ept implementation was estimated based on the method described in section 2 8 total treatment cost per cubic meter of sludge including ept energy consumption sludge dewatering sulfide control and sludge disposal was estimated to be 44 20 2 21 per m3 sludge with ept at 15 v table a2 compared with conventional treatment means cost of 8 10 0 41 per m3 sludge was saved table a2 nevertheless the cost saving depends on different sludge characteristics as well as the sludge treatment strategies used in the local wwtps in addition the cost saving is subject to the produced sulfide concentration the sulfide potential of saline sludge is typically higher than that of non saline sludge due to the presence of sulfate ion it should be aware of that this calculation is based on a lab scale study larger prototypes with long term operation are necessary for further economical evaluation 5 conclusions the findings of this study demonstrate that ept is an efficient approach for simultaneously enhancing sludge dewaterability inactivating pathogens and mitigating h2s was dewaterability was enhanced by around 40 with ept at 15 v the concentrations of e coli salmonella spp and streptococcus faecalis were significantly reduced to hygienization levels at a voltage of 15 v and the treated was is suitable for land application according to u s epa criteria dissolved sulfide was suppressed and h2s levels were greatly reduced after ept at 15 v and no sulfide regeneration was observed in was for at least one month future studies should try to confirm the mechanism of h2s suppression with ept and extend the application of ept nevertheless the findings of this study provide guidance on scaling up ept for treating was in an environmentally friendly manner declaration of

18453,stabilization of waste activated sludge was is an essential step for the disposal or reuse in this study was stabilization via electrochemical pretreatment ept at 0 15v was evaluated for simultaneous dewaterability enhancement pathogen removal and h2s mitigation the mechanism underlying ept was investigated and discussed based on the changes in the physicochemical e g particle size zeta potential hydrophobicity and extracellular polymeric substances and biological characteristics i e cell morphology and distribution and percentages of live dead cells of was with different ept voltages the results revealed that ept disintegrated was flocs and disrupted the cell walls leading to a reduction in particle size by up to 50 increased release of extracellular and intracellular substances by up to 4 times to facilitate was stabilization with ept at 15v the capillary suction time of was decreased by 42 and the concentrations of e coli and indicator pathogens salmonella spp and streptococcus faecalis fell by nearly 5 log10 reaching u s epa hygienization levels furthermore ept at 12v or higher suppressed the amounts of dissolved sulfide and h2s g produced from the was under anaerobic conditions by over 99 this study demonstrates the feasibility of ept for simultaneous was dewaterability enhancement pathogen inactivation and h2s mitigation providing a one step alternative for sludge stabilization graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge stabilization electrochemical pretreatment pathogen inactivation dewaterability enhancement sulfide removal 1 introduction the stabilization and treatment of waste activated sludge was in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps pose a challenge worldwide with a highly hydrated colloid structure water content of 95 99 zhen et al 2018 unstabilized was not only hosts harmful pathogens salmonella spp escherichia coli etc in concentrations of 5 7 log units above acceptable levels arthurson 2008 it also causes malodor by generating hydrogen sulfide h2s thereby posing a health risk e g diarrhoea and h2s poisoning to those in surrounding areas around 1 8 billion people worldwide especially those living in low and middle income countries are currently suffering from poor sanitation and absence of appropriate sludge treatment systems berendes et al 2017 around 25 50 of the operating costs of wwtps that employ the activated sludge method are spent on sludge treatment and disposal including stabilization for dewatering volume reduction inactivating pathogens and eliminating malodor arising from h2s campos et al 2009 typical technologies applied for was stabilization are 1 alkaline conditioning with lime 2 anaerobic digestion ad 3 aerobic digestion and 4 composting metcalf and eddy 2014 lime addition is effective in both pathogen reduction and malodor control but it increases the total amount of sludge by 20 30 samaras et al 2008 another concern is the large amounts of ammonia nh3 emission from lime conditioning sludge due to the rise of ph kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 liu et al 2012 in comparison ad is a popular process used for sludge stabilization with energy recovery in the form of methane while the value of methane based electricity and heat production is not well recognized as it hardly benefits the downstream processing kleerebezem et al 2015 in addition typically 500 4000 ppm gaseous phase only of h2s are produced in an anaerobic digester akgul et al 2017 han et al 2018 most of the produced h2s in an anaerobic system can be eliminated by the addition of chemicals such as k2feo4 50 mg g dried sludge he et al 2009 but the frequent transport handling and storage of chemicals come with occupational health and safety concerns pikaar et al 2015 lin et al 2017 various auxiliary means such as ozonation semblante et al 2017 gholikandi et al 2018 thermal treatment svensson et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and chemical addition e g ferrate calcium peroxide and free nitrous acid he et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 wei et al 2018 have been developed specifically for sludge dewaterability enhancement pathogen removal or h2s control but usually a combination of techniques is needed to solve all issues du et al 2016 a robust versatile approach capable of tackling all three challenges simultaneously would be more practical and maintenance friendly chen et al 2011 anjum et al 2016 electrochemical pretreatment ept has attracted increasing interest as an emerging technique for treating sludge thanks to its small footprint and minimal chemical addition yin et al 2018 olvera vargas et al 2019 silva et al 2019 moreover industrial shock loads or seawater infiltration intrusion can raise the was salt content and conductivity he et al 2017 which is in favor of an electrochemical process lin et al 1998 enhancement of sludge dewaterability with ept has been proven recently where a decrease in capillary suction time cst of more than 30 was achieved at 30 v yuan et al 2011 gharibi et al 2013 ept is also found to be effective in inactivating pathogens of was and ept at 18 v reduced the e coli concentration in was by 6 logs elektorowicz and oleszkiewicz 2012 yin et al 2018 destroying the hydrated colloidal structure of sludge flocs and disrupting the cell walls by producing ohmic heat and or oxidants such as chlorine are recognized as the main ways through which ept stabilizes sludge xiao et al 2018 yin et al 2018 we therefore hypothesized that sludge malodor i e arising from h2s can also be addressed by ept by means of the produced oxidants and or microbial inactivation scaglia et al 2011 chen et al 2011 he et al 2018 and that ept could very well be a three in one approach integrating dewaterability enhancement pathogen removal and h2s control simultaneously if the current is supplied intermittently the energy consumption can be noticeably reduced due to minimal use of electric field mollah et al 2001 akamatsu et al 2010 the purpose of this study is to investigate the comprehensive capabilities of ept and its potential for sludge stabilization i e was dewaterability pathogen inactivation and h2s control changes in the physicochemical e g electrical resistance and current particle size zeta potential and extracellular polymer substances and biological characteristics i e microbial cell morphology and percentage of viable cells of was caused by different voltages of ept were investigated thereafter the effects of ept on was dewaterability pathogen inactivation and h2s control were evaluated and the working mechanism is discussed our results are expected to provide guidance on the use of ept as a one step solution to all of the challenges associated with sludge stabilization and disposal 2 materials and

compartment plexiglass chamber inner diameter 4 0 cm length 8 0 cm phychemi hong kong a pair of graphite fiber brushes outer diameter 3 0 cm length 3 5 cm with titanium electrodes were installed in

100 w v homogenized with a wrist action shaker at 900 oscillations min for 10 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 300 g for 3 min at 4 c martín díaz et al 2017 the supernatant was used to analyze the populations of salmonella spp streptococcus faecalis and escherichia coli in the was for e coli samples were cultured on chromocult agar plates merck germany with e coli or coliform selective supplement merck germany plates were incubated at 44 c for 24 h and dark blue or purple colonies were counted as e coli the quantity of s faecalis was determined by sowing the sample and its

deoxycholate agar merck germany and counted after incubation at 36 c for 24 h 2 6 biochemical sulfide potential a biochemical sulfide potential test was conducted in triplicate using 125 ml serum bottles to assess the odor potential of was as h2s has typically been used as a surrogate for odor emission the sulfidogenic process contributes to around 80 of total h2s emission in anaerobic conditions sun et al 2016 dalby et al 2018 sulfidogenic sludge was taken from a sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed reactor in the same wwtp 40 ml of treated was 0 15 v were mixed with an equal volume

variables as a statistical analysis tool it has been used extensively in environmental studies wilen et al 2003 wang et al 2017 in this study correlation analysis was performed and scatter matrixes were plotted for sludge physicochemical characteristics using the r program the correlations were considered statistically significant with a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 2 8 cost estimation to evaluate application potential of ept an economic analysis was conducted the energy consumption of ept was calculated based on eq 1 brillas et al 2009 1 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n k w h l t 0 n e c e l l i t 1000 v s where e cell is the applied voltage v i is the current a t is the time h and v s is the sample volume l the power price was 0 12 kwh in hong kong and the transport and disposal costs of was were estimated at 50 wet ton assuming that these residues are not considered hazardous biosolids wang et al 2013 the chemical cost for facilitating dewater process was around 1 m3 zhai et al 2012 and the average cost for sulfide removal was estimated at 5 2 kg s zhang et al 2008 the analysis was conducted at 95 confidence intervals 3 results 3 1 changes in the physical characteristics of was changes in the physical properties of treated was and variation of current were investigated to obtain a preliminary understanding of the impacts of ept on was fig 1 the transient current electrical resistance and anode potentials were recorded fig 1a and fig a2 with constant voltage input the current decreased over the course of ept at voltage range of 1 8 v while a continuous increase was recorded at higher voltages e g from 190 12 to 245 28 ma at 12 v and from 250 7 to 335 65 ma at 15 v the changes in electrical resistance were inversely correlative with current variation disintegration of flocs is reflected by the was particle size distribution as illustrated in fig 1b the peak volume percentage of particle size decreased and shrank with increased voltage the particle size of raw was ranged from 10 1 1 0 to 116 2 2 2 μm after ept at 15 v for instance the particle size dropped to a range of 8 8 1 2 44 9 1 8 μm and the mean size decreased by nearly a half from 54 2 2 0 to 27 1 1 0 μm in a sludge system the aggregation and dispersion of particles can be revealed by the zeta potential sludge particles were negatively charged with a zeta potential of 26 1 mv due to the presence of ionizable groups such as carboxylates and phosphates the zeta potential gradually increased to 18 2 7 2 and 2 1 mv after ept at 5 10 and 15 v respectively fig 1c in addition the hydrophobicity of was dropped remarkably with an increasing voltage from 81 2 initially to 62 4 10 v and 33 3 15 v fig 1d 3 2 effects of ept on the chemical characteristics of was the impacts of ept on the chemical characteristics of was were examined with a focus on organics and nutrient release fig 2 the mlvss decreased from 4230 60 mg l at 0 v to 3530 76 mg l at 10 v and further dropped to 3370 50 mg l at 15 v showing a maximum reduction of 20 reductions in solids tss and vss are highly desirable considering how costly it is to transport and dispose of sludge meanwhile solids reduction implies solubilization scod rose steadily from 0 017 0 010 to 0 22 0 018 mg cod mg vs with a rising voltage due to the release of was components during floc disintegration and the release of cellular components during cell lysis fig 2b proteins and polysaccharides were released increasingly when a high voltage was applied with a peak value of 0 120 0 007 mg mg vs at 15v soluble proteins which is about 10 times higher than the peak amount of soluble polysaccharides fig 2c nh4 n remained constant after an increase from 0 005 0 001 mg n mg vs 1 3 v to around 0 008 0 001 mg n mg vs 5 15v fig 2d implying that some proteins might decompose when the voltage exceeds 5 v soluble metal concentrations remained very low with ept at 1 3 v accumulation of three metals in soluble phase was detected with an increasing voltage fig 3 in descending order of concentration these metals were fe mn and ni fe might have originated from the iron coagulant and iron containing compounds of cells e g ferredoxins and cytochromes its soluble concentration increased considerably from 1 3 10 4 1 0 10 5 mg mg vs 0 v to 0 057 0 001 mg mg vs 15 v similarly the liberation of mn and ni was limited at voltages below 5 v and their concentrations later reached 0 021 0 002 mn and 0 007 0 001 ni mg mg vs at 15 v the ph variations of was with ept at different voltages were provided in fig a3 3 3 effects of ept on the biological characteristics of was the direct effect of ept on was was evaluated at the cellular level optical microscopy inspection of cells before and after ept fig 4 a shows the morphological change of cells in was ept resulted in an obvious disruption of the cell envelop structure compared with intact cells 0 v live and dead bacterial consortia further underpinned the cell lysis damage caused by ept bacteria with intact cell membranes fluoresce bright green whereas bacteria with damaged membranes exhibit red fluorescence red fluorescent propidium iodide can bind to soluble nucleic acids released from bacteria fig 4b with ept at higher voltages the red fluorescence in was gradually became stronger indicating that more intracellular substances i e nucleic acids were released live and dead microorganisms at each voltage gradient was further quantified by determining the relative abundance of green and red pixels and the percentage of live cells is shown in fig 4c the change in cell viability was insignificant with ept below 5 v while a reduction around 12 were achieved at 15 v 66 2 compared with the control 78 3 fig 4c 3 4 was stabilization by ept 3 4 1 was dewaterability dewatering is essential for was disposal and dewaterability enhancement is highly desired after sludge stabilization cst and viscosity were used to evaluate the dewaterability of was after ept fig 5 a smaller cst value indicates greater dewaterability vesilind 1988 cst of was dropped from 48 1 s initially to 38 1 s and 30 1 s when the voltage reached 5 and 10 v respectively and stayed at a 28 1 s when the voltage increased to 15 v correspondingly sludge dewaterability was enhanced by about 37 and 42 after ept at 10 and 15 v respectively for 1 h furthermore sludge dewaterability is closely related to the viscosity of sludge mixtures and the sludge with poor dewaterability appeared to be stickier with a higher viscosity li and yang 2007 the viscosity of was reduced from initial 2 93 0 05 mpa s to 2 02 0 12 mpa s at 5 v 1 80 0 09 mpa s at 10 v and 1 65 0 10 mpa s at 15 v the maximum reduction of 44 in was viscosity was achieved with ept at 15 v which could be due to the decrease in ts concentration and enhanced solubilization effect jin et al 2004 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 3 4 2 pathogens in was pathogen inactivation is one objective of sludge stabilization and is essential for sanitary landfills and the agricultural reuse of sludge daneshmand et al 2012 cui et al 2013 routine indicators e g e coli and total coliform and indicator pathogens e g salmonella are used to reflect the presence of pathogens since these microorganisms may cause gastroenteritis and typhoid fever in humans winfield and groisman 2003 species of the salmonella genus can survive the harsh conditions in the sludge environment and are believed to be responsible for 1 to 2 million cases of human disease annually in the u s arthurson 2008 the effect of ept at 0 5 10 and 15 v on pathogen reduction was evaluated as shown in fig 6 the number of all tested pathogens decreased with an increasing applied voltage the amounts of e coli removed were 0 42 0 16 1 45 0 15 and 3 12 0 2 log10 cfu g ts after ept at 5 10 and 15 v respectively thereby meeting the level of hygienization required by the u s epa 3 log10 cfu g ts ruiz hernando et al 2014 the inactivation of salmonella spp and streptococcus faecalis was limited with ept at 5 v while the concentrations of these pathogens decreased significantly by more than 4 log10 cfu g ts with ept at 15 v 3 4 3 biological sulfide production of was h2s is considered as the dominant contributor to odorous and toxic gas emissions during was transportation storage and disposal pikaar et al 2015 the biochemical sulfide potential bsp test was applied to assess the sulfide production of the treated was peu et al 2012 sun et al 2016 zan et al 2016 the transient variation in dissolved sulfide production is shown in fig 7 a without ept was produced sulfide at levels exceeding 110 mg s l via the sulfate reduction process fig a4 the produced sulfide was released in the form of gaseous h2s with a concentration of 3596 155 parts per million ppm in the control test fig 7b high level sulfide production i e 110 mg s was ascribed to the high sulfate concentration 300 mg s l in wastewater due to the seawater toilet flushing system in hong kong wu et al 2016 after ept dissolved sulfide production was greatly suppressed the concentration of dissolved sulfide reduced to 70 5 11 1 and 2 1 mg s l with ept at 5 10 and 15 v respectively a sharp decrease in h2s in gaseous phase was also observed with elevated voltages furthermore dissolved sulfide production was almost completely quenched for an entire month with ept at 12 and 15 v fig a5 which clearly satisfies our hypothesis that malodor and pathogen control and dewaterability enhancement can be realized in one go with ept 4 discussion 4 1 impact of ept on was to uncover the underlying working mechanisms of ept the characteristics of treated was were investigated and their interactions were analyzed higher electric field strength resulted in intensive disintegration effects and induced the release of intracellular and or extracellular compounds from was and salts from the cytoplasm which in turn contributed to changes in electrical current and resistance fig 1a neutral zeta potential after ept implies a decrease of the electrostatic repulsion thus causing a reduction in the repulsive forces of flocs and enhancing aggregation based on the model of the sludge floccule structure macro flocs 125 0 μm in was are formed through the aggregation of 13 5 μm micro flocs which originate from much smaller particles 2 5 μm jorand et al 1995 the micro floc aggregates consist of the microbial cells and their eps fang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 ept caused the fragmentation of sludge flocs and destruction of the microbial cells overall led to a decrease over the aggregation and thereby reduced particle size this phenomenon was also observed when was was treated by synergetic hydrodynamic cavitation and the fenton reaction cai et al 2018 as indicated by the scatter matrixes coupled with correlation analysis fig 8 particle size showed a strong linear correlation with zeta potential and soluble protein concentration with r values of 0 92 and 0 90 respectively zeta potential demonstrated a strong correlation with protein concentration r 0 94 and hydrophobicity r 0 89 significant correlations p 0 05 between the concentrations of soluble metals and other variables e g voltage zeta potential and hydrophobicity were also found was can be considered as hydrated floc aggregates consisting of microbial cells and their extracellular polymeric substances eps and the eps containing large amount of protein and polysaccharide is dominant in sludge and known as a sink for metals due to the disintegration of the flocs microcolonies as shown in fig 1 decrease in particle size was clearly correlated with the release of soluble proteins polysaccharides and metals released metallic ions and amino groups typically carry positive charges which can neutralize the zeta potential fig 1c cell lysis is another impact caused by ept on was a voltage of 20 v can cause pores to form in microbial cell membranes yuan et al 2011 hereby the cell membrane loses its intrinsic properties of electrical resistance and barrier function sheng et al 2011 in this work cell lysis was directly captured under an optical microscope when a voltage of 8 v was applied fig 4a ept may directly attack and disorganize sludge flocs and cause cytoplasmic dissolution by passing an electrical current 1200 ma through materials rahmani et al 2015 additionally production of oxidants such as hclo hclo clo3 and clo4 via electrochlorination reactions could also contribute to cell damage various chlorine products including chlorine chlorate and perchlorate were detected in this study fig a6 cell lysis could occur upon chlorine exposure at doses between 7 and 29 mg min l which fall in the range of typical water disinfection practices daly et al 2007 overall these combined direct and indirect effects caused by ept including electroporation and electrooxidation resulted in disintegration of sludge flocs and induced the release of extracellular and or intracellular compounds from was fig 9 4 2 was stabilization sludge dewaterability is typically dependent on the physicochemical properties of sludge flocs the decreases in particle size fig 1a surface charge fig 1b and hydrophobicity fig 1c give decreased viscosity and cst i e enhanced dewaterability bigger particles can easily block the filter medium during filtration resulting in a large resistance to the flow of water molecules and thus lowering the was dewaterability karr and keinath 1978 such effects were eliminated in the present work since the mean particle size of was was reduced considerably from 54 to 27 μm corresponding to a 50 size reduction after ept at 8 15 v fig 1b neutral zeta potential implies a destruction of the electrostatic repulsion thus causing a reduction in the repulsive forces of flocs and enhancing dewatering li et al 2016 sludge dewaterability was also enhanced with the decrease in hydrophobicity jin et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 likely because the abundant trapped water was released with the disintegration of sludge flocs and a larger amount of smaller sludge flocs with a higher hydrophilicity were formed fig a7 a decrease in the hydrophobicity of the treated was could also result from the release of proteins to the bulk liquid with an increasing voltage ept soluble proteins reached 0 120 0 007 mg mg vs with ept at 15 v in this study however it has been widely reported that a high content of eps in sludge would jeopardize the sludge dewaterability liu and fang 2003 li and yang 2007 cao et al 2018 point out that a higher release of eps is associated with poorer sludge dewaterability if the sticky biopolymers proteins and humic substances cannot be converted into smaller molecules furthermore high voltages 30 v resulted in the additional disintegration of sludge flocs and excess release of eps 94 mg l which subsequently increased sludge viscosity and diminished the dewaterability gharibi et al 2013 in the current work was dewaterability was not jeopardized probably due to the intensive solubilization of eps components and the release of cell interstitial water during cell lysis fig 4 several mechanisms have been proposed for killing bacteria in sludge treated by electrochemical methods navab daneshmand et al 2012 suggested that ohmic heating was the primary cause of microbial inactivation and the ohmic heating temperature of 70 c was necessary for the inactivation of e coli yin et al 2018 however this explanation may not be supported by the present work as temperature fluctuations of only 1 2 c were observed due to the discrete operating mode and short operating duration 1 h huang et al 2016 reported that chlorine generated during electrochemical treatment was more effective in the disinfection of pathogens than direct chemical chlorination and free chlorine was always present during electrolysis even in the presence of free ammonia chlorine disinfectants produced in the system hclo and clo attack cell surface components such as the peptide bonds of protein side chains causing cell membrane damage or the malfunction of enzymatic transport systems pattison and davies 2001 in this study we observed an increase in free chlorine concentration to as high as 9 7 0 2 mg l as cl2 when the voltage increased to 15 v as the was sample used contained a high concentration of cl 4000 mg l due to the practice of seawater toilet flushing in hong kong in addition the titanium electrode used in this study can also facilitate chlorine production owing to its higher electrocatalytic activity on the surface jeong et al 2009 the contribution of electrochemically produced oxidants to sludge disinfection as well as aforementioned potential cell lysis cause in the ept system needs further investigation ept was also effective against h2s while the mechanism is unclear sulfate reduction process was not hindered in this study fig a4 based on the present results the dissolved sulfide might be precipitated by the released metals rather than oxidized by produced chlorine as it lasted less than 5 min after ept and the h2s was not produced at this stage precipitation with the released metal data not shown could be the major pathway for h2s elimination sludge is an abundant metals source babel and del mundo dacera 2006 and the fe source in was could be the fecl3 addition for flocculation and or sulfide mitigation ept destroyed sludge flocs enhancing liberation of metals tang et al 2018 nevertheless it cannot explain the long term one month sulfide suppression it is likely that ept caused the inactivation of specific microbes leading to the long term sulfide suppression further investigation is needed to confirm this speculation in this study the used was is saline due to the practice of seawater toilet flushing in hong kong as salt content is directly proportional to the system conductivity lin et al 1998 high conductivity renders a decrease in the resistance and the loss of energy to heat generation li et al 2002 as for the treatment of non saline sludge performance of ept is subject to the electrode materials conductivity reactor configuration and input voltage among these electrode material was identified as the key parameter based on our obtained results in addition efficient electrochemical sludge treatment can be achieved with other auxiliary means for instance addition of fenton reagent to the electrochemical system for sludge dewaterability enhancement masihi and gholikandi 2018 chen et al 2019 dosing oxidants such as h2o2 and naclo during electrochemical sludge pretreatment could lead to synergistic effects on cod solubilization thus improving sludge biodegradability feki et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 in this study no chemical was added to assist ept for achieving similar treatment efficiency with saline was used ept might be more compatible for saline streams 4 3 potential application of ept for was stabilization stabilization is an integral step during sludge handling for reducing pathogens eliminating malodor and improving dewaterability ad is currently the most popular sludge stabilization process regarding its energy recovery potential ept enhanced was solubilization scod increased by up to 12 9 times in this study showing its potential for improvement of ch4 production in ad an increase in biogas yield over 60 was recorded after ept at 20 v for 1 h yang et al 2014 nevertheless zhen et al 2014 presented that biogas production also can be inhibited by over 20 with ept 20 v 40 min and the reason is still unclear biogas production inhibition with ept on the other hand leaves us a window for accumulation of volatile fatty acids which could be in situ used as the carbon source in wwtps for nutrients removal in addition ept could be a complementary technique after anaerobic sludge digestion digestate contains high concentrations of fecal coliforms which even regrow to 5 7 log units after centrifuge dewatering higgins et al 2007 qi et al 2007 malodor generation is another concern for dewatered biosolids during its storage chen et al 2011 employment of ept after ad might be capable of tackling these problems in one go more investigations are deserved to support the expanding of application potential of ept on the other hand the possible adverse impact of ept cannot be neglected the released scod and stn from sludge in reject water will increase the loads of main stream in wwtps although the volume of the reject water is relatively small e g 0 5 of the influent in hong kong shatin lam et al 2016 it typically contributes to 10 30 nitrogen load to the wwtps van loosdrecht and salem 2006 in such case side stream processes e g sharon annamox and babe are suggested for nitrogen removal and or phosphorus recovery as fertilizer bozkurt et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2018 in general implementation of ept prior to ad or after ad depends on specific needs the cost of the overall ept implementation was estimated based on the method described in section 2 8 total treatment cost per cubic meter of sludge including ept energy consumption sludge dewatering sulfide control and sludge disposal was estimated to be 44 20 2 21 per m3 sludge with ept at 15 v table a2 compared with conventional treatment means cost of 8 10 0 41 per m3 sludge was saved table a2 nevertheless the cost saving depends on different sludge characteristics as well as the sludge treatment strategies used in the local wwtps in addition the cost saving is subject to the produced sulfide concentration the sulfide potential of saline sludge is typically higher than that of non saline sludge due to the presence of sulfate ion it should be aware of that this calculation is based on a lab scale study larger prototypes with long term operation are necessary for further economical evaluation 5 conclusions the findings of this study demonstrate that ept is an efficient approach for simultaneously enhancing sludge dewaterability inactivating pathogens and mitigating h2s was dewaterability was enhanced by around 40 with ept at 15 v the concentrations of e coli salmonella spp and streptococcus faecalis were significantly reduced to hygienization levels at a voltage of 15 v and the treated was is suitable for land application according to u s epa criteria dissolved sulfide was suppressed and h2s levels were greatly reduced after ept at 15 v and no sulfide regeneration was observed in was for at least one month future studies should try to confirm the mechanism of h2s suppression with ept and extend the application of ept nevertheless the findings of this study provide guidance on scaling up ept for treating was in an environmentally friendly manner declaration of

18454,there is an increasing need for coastal and marine ecosystems conservation however information to guide management decisions for coastal and marine ecosystems is still lacking considering the

used as the basis for better policies making on coastal and marine conservation in particular this includes a classification of different ecosystems a system for ecosystem services es classification es formation mechanism as well as accounting techniques the es classification system includes direct indirect and existence services accounting techniques presented here can overcome common limitations in existing accounting methods 1 double counting 2 evaluation from the receiver perspective 3 the inappropriate use and replacement of unit emergy value uev the present method is applied to the evaluation of coastal and marine ecosystems in the pearl river delta prd china results show that 1 the total coastal esv decreased from 2000 to 2009 in the prd area among which water purification contributes most to the decrease followed by soil building climate regulation and microclimate regulation 2 the coastal ecosystems have the largest potential to regulate climate whether at micro or macro scale 3 the marine esv decreased with the ratio of 42 37 and biomass increase and carbon sequestration account for the decrease 4 intertidal marshes has the largest esv per unit area followed by mangrove coral reefs and rocky marine shores while the marine ecosystem has the smallest esv per unit area as proved by the case study this work can provide a basis for an accounting method for coastal and marine esv assessment which could serve to improve both the management decision making processes and policy indications through accurately valuing coastal and marine es leading to additional investment in conservation of these ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords coastal ecosystem marine ecosystem ecosystem services valuation emergy accounting method 1 introduction marine and coastal ecosystems are highly valuable due to their richness in productivity and diversity wilkinson 2008 finlayson et al 2018 the huge list of ecosystem services es provided includes habitats for flora and fauna floods and storms mitigation sediment retention erosion control and carbon storage brown et al 2006 barbier et al 2011 in parallel they have a beneficial impact on the people living in coastal areas and small islands which account for one third of the global human population barbier et al 2008 the overexploitation of these areas results in habitat destruction climate change pollution and invasive species growth mea 2005 barbier 2017 newton et al 2018 a further expansion of urbanization and economic development has significantly influenced coastal sustainability dobson et al 2006 halpern et al 2008 bateman et al 2011 murray et al 2014 yang et al 2018 as remarked by costanza et al 2014 and ellis et al 2015 it is unlikely that these pressures will decrease in the short future protection plans and actions are still lacking even if the public s perception of marine ecosystems conservation is improving due to difficulties and costs of working at sea marine ecosystems conservation exploitation and restoration are commonly undervalued in decision making camacho valdez et al 2014 vassallo et al 2018 consequently marine protection measures are less developed than terrestrial ones unep wcmc and iucn 2016 even if many nations such as china united stated canada and so on and international ngos that are cooperating to develop implemented policies in this field this is why many marine ecosystems are under pressure watson and hewson 2018 xia et al 2017 sun et al 2018b lirman et al 2019 it would be highly desirable to expand the protection of coastal and marine waters up to 10 by 2020 as fixed under the convention on biological diversity cbd coates 2016 roberts et al 2018 therefore it is critical to develop a clear and transparent process for es assessment however the uniqueness and complexity of coastal and marine ecosystems bring challenges to coastal and marine esv assessment in detail it is critical to evaluate marine and coastal es with adequate consideration of their uniqueness and features to provide conservation and management suggestions and to preserve the benefits that es give to humans sandhu et al 2018 three main methods were implemented to assess esv langan et al 2018 the first one is economic method twenty years ago costanza et al 1997 applied an economic method to assign a value to the world s es other researchers used this method to develop several applications and policies braat and groot 2012 costanza et al 2017 revisited this method concluding that its main advantage is that it is easier to understand values of ecosystem services when they are expressed in monetary units however other researchers criticized some weaknesses of this choice in fact using a monetary approach the quantification of es becomes rooted on individual well being assessment or perception costanza et al 2017 instead human wellbeing should be more than an aggregate of individuals welfare depending also on the welfare of each community or society costanza et al 2017 campbell 2018 moreover individuals might not adequately perceive all the things that contribute to their wellbeing fioramonti 2014 the second dilemma related to limited applications of this approach for example costanza et al 2017 recently proposed some mistaken identities concerning es and esv in fact economic value does not necessarily equate to the market value meaning that expressing values in monetary units does not equal to market or exchanging values conservation and natural resource management can be approached evaluating es with invest model ouyang et al 2016 for example coastal es their spatial patterns as well as their dynamics were assessed applying this approach tallis and polasky 2009 yang et al 2017 however it lacks unified metrics and simulation of the dynamic ecological processes tallis and polasky 2009 bhagabati et al 2014 langan et al 2018 this is why an alternative option based on a donor side approach was implemented to evaluate the ecosystem support provided to humans franzese et al 2017 this method is called emergy analysis method solar emergy is solar energy required directly and indirectly to make a service or product unit solar emjoules sej odum 1996 emergy is a donor type value which is determined by the production process and not by human s preferences or willingness to pay odum 1996 one significant concept of this method is unit emergy values uevs emergy intensities which is the amount of emergy required to produce a given amount of mass or energy of a product measured in units of sej g sej j and sej brown and ulgiati 2004 emergy accounting based on a donor side evaluation of biophysical stocks and flows to assess the environmental costs of any production quantifies the cumulative available energy expenditure in making and eventually operating any service or good odum 1996 emergy method rooted on thermodynamic principles can be used to detail the flows of resources both materials and energy within any system this method has been already applied in es assessment and to measure the technological transformation of natural resources campbell and brown 2012 campbell 2012 turcato et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the application of emergy method still lacks a framework in its application to coastal and marine esv in fact economic approaches are still prevailing li et al 2013 canu et al 2015 pendleton et al 2016 sun et al 2016 2018a this study aims to fill this research gap in particular this research aims at providing a supply side evaluation of coastal and marine esv capturing the dynamic ecological processes and applying a unified metrics to esv accounting the method is applied to a case study the region of pearl river delta china finally some policy recommendations for marine and coastal ecosystems conservation management and restoration are also suggested 2 methods 2 1 description of study area the pearl river delta prd hereafter china is located in the downstream alluvial plain of the pearl river in china covering an area of 3000 km2 its extension ranges from 21 30 n to 23 42 n and from 112 26 e to 114 24 e liu et al 2017 nine cities located in guangdong province belong to this area guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai foshan huizhou dongguan zhongshan jiangmen zhaoqing the data about prd region coastal ecosystems referred to years 2000 and 2009 are presented in table 1 administration 2015 han et al 2006 defined a coastal ecosystem as the area including coastal lowlands tidelands and shallow waters less than 6 m in depth during low tide that is usually submerged by an immobile or flowing water body under sea land alternation processes besides terrestrial areas coastal ecosystems include water bodies with depth lower 2 m corresponding to a distance from shore of 1 km also due to the unavailability of dem data on china s coastal areas the coastal areas that the distance from shore is fixed at 3 km this limit is selected as the coastal ecosystems in case study fig 1 chester and jickells 2012 defined a marine ecosystem as the area where waters have a depth higher than 6 m and having a high salt content i e with an average salinity of 35 parts per thousand of water territorial waters is an area of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles around 22 2 km from the baseline of a coastal state inland sea may be located between coastal ecosystems and territorial sea due to the unavailability of china territorial sea baseline the areas ranging from the exterior line of coastal ecosystems and extending to 12 nautical miles are selected as marine ecosystem for the case study the geographical distribution of coastal and marine ecosystems applied to this case study is shown in fig 1 mangrove ecosystem is selected to detail the specific calculation process in an accompanying methods article in the journal of methodsx and all the uevs used in this study also attached in the article for reference 2 2 coastal and marine esv accounting method the framework of coastal and marine esv accounting method fig 2 include ecosystem classification es classification es formation mechanism and esv accounting techniques which will be detailed as follows 2 2 1 coastal and marine ecosystems and their services classification investigated ecosystems include marine shallow waters c1 subtidal marine aquatic beds c2 coral reefs c3 rocky marine shores c4 intertidal sand shingle pebble beach c5 intertidal mud sand flats c6 intertidal marshes c7 mangroves c8 permanent estuarine waters c9 estuarine systems of deltas c10 coastal brackish saline lagoons c11 coastal freshwater lagoons c12 the characters of these coastal and marine ecosystems are shown by table 2 jiang et al 2015 es are categorized into three types direct indirect and existing services the first one quantifies the changes in flows and storages within the studied ecosystem it mainly includes biomass increase carbon sequestration soil building and sedimentation the second one accounts for co products and by products of the ecological processes in producing the direct services there water air and soil purification microclimate regulation and electricity generation are accounted the third quantify the local share of global es as well as ecosystem cultural and educational values climate regulation biodiversity conservation cultural and education values are accounted as main existing services these categories and components are assigned to the different ecosystem types according to the scheme reported in table 3 2 2 2 diagram representation of coastal and marine es coastal and marine es dynamics are represented using emergy systems diagrams by fig 3 and fig 4 these representations are developed according to the symbolic language used by the system ecologist h t odum and followers e g odum 1996 odum and odum 2000 brown 2004 fig 3 shows the energy system diagram of coastal ecosystem services from left to right renewable sources including sunlight rain and so on drive photosynthesis in this process carbon can either be returned to the atmosphere through respiration or stored within the biomass of plant such as mangroves or seagrass in intertidal zone after the death of plants carbon moves from aboveground to the soil as one source of soil organic matter similarly from left to right as well as from outside to inside due to river flux and tidal variations oxygen salinity and nutrient availability are constantly fluctuating resulting in mangrove soils found between terrestrial and marine environments formed and deposited by fine particles rich in nutrients organic matter yet wastewaters discharged into river and tide would cause pollution in coastal environments while coastal ecosystems have potential to remove water pollutants except for water purification capacity coastal ecosystems especially mangroves have the ability to purify air and soil pollutants meanwhile driven by wind and tidal energy electricity can be generated in coastal ecosystems however if without the protection of coastal plants coasts would be easily eroded on the right side of the emergy analysis diagram the uniqueness of coastal ecosystems location makes it significant habitats for species resulting in their high value in biodiversity in addition integrating with water bodies and vegetation coastal ecosystems contribute a lot to climate regulation at both micro and macro scales the higher hierarchy flows in coastal regions are the information carried which is educational and cultural value in the perspective of ecosystem service fig 4 shows that on the left of marine system diagram sunlight drives the photosynthesis during which carbon is sequestrated from air to deep ocean through biological process thus increasing marine biomass except for this biological carbon pump at the bottom of the diagram there are another two carbon pumps physical and solubility pump the former refers to vertical deep mixing occurs when warm ocean surface waters at low latitudes is transported to high latitudes and then cooled resulting in the water heavy enough to sink thompson et al 2017 solubility carbon pump is the process by which carbon is carried from air into ocean through gas transfer on the middle and right side of the diagram due to the large amount of water volume marine ecosystem has strong capacity of self purification climate regulation at local and global scales as well as an extensive phylogenetic biodiversity than terrestrial ecosystems jenkins and van houtan 2016 similar to coastal ecosystem marine region offers educational and cultural value as a form of information service on the right 2 2 3 coastal and marine esv accounting techniques the coastal and marine esv accounting techniques are detailed in the accompanying methods article in the journal of methodsx 3 results 3 1 coastal and marine esv in the study area according to the coastal and marine esv in the study area are evaluated here as shown in fig 5 and table 3 coastal ecosystems area decreased by 16 during 2000 2009 in particular coastal esv are 2 93e 21 sej year 2000 and 2 76e 21 sej year 2009 with a 6 year decrease rate with the exception of biomass increase and carbon sequestration 63 09 growth rate all the other ecosystem services decreased among them water purification contributes most to this trend 53 22 followed by soil building 45 27 climate regulation 16 37 and microclimate regulation 15 74 for marine ecosystem the total esv in study area decreased around 42 37 from 2000 to 2009 with the esv decreasing from 2 16e 21 sej to 1 76e 21 sej as shown by fig 5 biomass increase and carbon sequestration contributes all the decrease because the climate regulation service of marine keeps stable during 2000 2009 considering the components of es separately for coastal ecosystems indirect services account most for the total esv with the percentage of 72 13 year 2000 and 64 31 year 2009 respectively in 2000 the existing and direct services contribute 14 83 and 13 04 respectively to the total coastal esv while their proportion are 13 17 and 22 52 in 2009 indicating the increase in direct services to be more specific coastal ecosystems in the prd area have the largest potential of microclimate regulation with the ratio of 71 13 in 2000 and 63 67 in 2009 followed by climate regulation accounting for 14 83 in 2000 and 13 17 in 2009 and biomass increase and carbon sequestration 12 95 in 2000 and 22 44 in 2009 these indicate coastal ecosystems have strong microclimate and climate regulation services in local and regional scale for marine ecosystem climate regulation service contributes 56 11 and 68 92 to the total esv in 2000 and 2009 respectively indicating the large potential to regulate climate which is consistent with the coastal ecosystems in the prd region 3 2 coastal and marine esv per unit area coastal and marine esv per unit area during 2000 2009 are presented in fig 6 in particular intertidal marshes had the highest esv per square meter 1 44e 12 sej m2 in 2000 1 40e 12 sej m2 in 2009 followed by mangrove 1 27e 12 sej m2 and 1 18e 12 sej m2 in 2000 and 2009 respectively rocky marine shores 1 16e 12 sej m2 in 2000 and 6 08e 11 sej m2 in 2009 and coral reefs 1 01e 12 sej m2 in 2000 and 8 53e 11 sej m2 in 2009 the absence of estuarine systems for deltas in 2009 leads to year 2009 esv per unit area equal to zero the marine ecosystem has the smallest esv per unit area compared to coastal ecosystems 4 discussion 4 1 general discussion from the calculation results of case study both coastal and marine esv decreased from 2 93e 21 sej yr to 2 76e 21 sej yr and from 2 16e 21 sej yr to 1 76e 21 sej yr during study period in the case of coastal ecosystems water purification contributed most to the decrease followed by soil building according to the accounting techniques of water purification i e equation s9 and s10 m i j d a l y i p d f i are constant parameters and τ h is also the same in year 2000 and 2009 because it is replaced with the emergy per capital in guangdong province in 2012 lin et al 2018 based on accounting detail presented in the accompanying methods article in the journal of methodsx the changes in ecosystem areas triggered the changes in e m s p consequently it was the decrease in coastal areas that caused the degradation of coastal ecosystem services this is a result of the high exploitation of coastal regions by humans murray et al 2014 as a consequence it would be relevant to increase the protection of coastal area to preserve its es in particular planners should try to plan a wider conversion of these regions into protected natural reserves biomass increase accounts for the decrease in marine esv mainly caused by the decline in rainfall from 2000 to 2009 while the other services are stable during study period because of the scarcity of data on biodiversity i e species density uniqueness trophic levels and so on the related esv is presently underestimated therefore appropriate monitoring technologies should be applied to collect sufficient information for such a purpose after many years as already claimed by manley et al 2006 it would be still highly desirable to define a national framework for species inventory and monitoring the application of the method to estimate the educational and cultural values through emergy accounting as defined by abel 2010 2013 would be difficult in the case of esv since a framework is still missing for such a purpose 4 2 specific topics 4 2 1 water supply water desalination is important for several countries to address water shortages according to zheng et al 2014 china s total seawater desalination ability grew from 10 000 m3 d to roughly 660 000 m3 d from 2000 to 2011 however a higher target is set for 2020 reaching 2 5 3 million m3 d desalination needs both natural contributions such as seawater and artificial inputs such as fuels filter membrane chemicals and so on buenfil 2001 because esv assessment is based on emergy method in this study thus only seawater s contribution is needed to be included in the esv evaluation yet according to odum 1996 there is no specific emergy of seawater because it is saltwater and the chemical potential is zero therefore water supply service of coastal and marine ecosystems is excluded in this study while for freshwater ecosystems such as lake river ecosystem this service should be included 4 2 2 advantages and limitations of accounting on biodiversity conservation the approach shown in this study to assess the biodiversity level can avoid double counting however some limitations still exist for example more details could be included by calculating turnover time for specific species as well as the emergy referred to the support area of each specie with this respect however data inputs would be currently unavailable in the majority of cases the second challenge would be to apply the accounting process to each taxonomic or phylogenetic group according to campbell and tilley 2016 this would support the definition of species variability based on turnover times a third limitation is that it fails to reflect the uniqueness and importance of species such as endangered species finally biodiversity should be accounted across trophic levels applying the approach typical of system theory considering the existing food web interactions brown et al 2006 4 2 3 marine ecosystems water and air purification services this study tested the assumption in the case of marine ecosystems of large water purification capacity for the majority of existing pollutants the result indicates that in the prd area its value was 9 25e 27 sej in 2009 being around 7 orders of magnitude larger than the other marine esv this result proves that the hypothesis is reasonable however considering the evidence of several studies various terrestrial marine and air pollution sources undermine the ocean health abessa et al 2018 therefore it does not indicate that ocean ecosystem can be polluted without being worried with respect to air purification the effects of marine ecosystem are often ignored prof however ocean can remove haze being the final sedimentary area of nitrogen pentoxide formed during fossil fuels combustion process and producing photochemical smog mungall et al 2017 during nighttime the ocean s surface absorbs nitric oxide eliminating about 15 of the smog chemicals specific evaluation of haze purification is still unavailable however this knowledge could provide the basis for further researches in related fields 4 2 4 inclusion of damages and losses in accounting process ecosystem dis services are fairly new concepts without a consensus on their definition lyytimäki et al 2008 and swinton et al 2007 suggested that they can be treated as ecological functions interfered or harmed by human activities if dis services are measured they should be deducted from the total esv some ecological phenomena caused by human activities or natural disaster such as seawater intrusion typhoon tsunami and so on can harm ecosystems should we consider these phenomena as dis services which should be reduced from the total esv or just exclude them into services in such a case how could disservices be measured these questions which remain unaddressed in this research would require specific efforts a possible reasoning is developed using seawater intrusion as an exploratory example according to svensson and theander 2013 the most common causes for seawater intrusion are pumping and sea level rise resulting in the groundwater level of seawater higher than that of freshwater and leading to a final seawater intrusion this is a dis service in coastal ecosystems in turn seawater intrusion causes groundwater salinization this is another disservice considering that mixing of freshwater bodies with 1 of seawater 250 mg l chloride by volume makes it non potable gorchev and ozolins 1984 we suggest to evaluate seawater intrusion driven by the kinetic energy of water and the emergy required by this process as 1 e m s i 1 2 m s w v 2 u e v w where e m s i represents the emergy needed by seawater intrusion sej m s w means the mass of seawater in the process of seawater intrusion g v is the average water velocity m s u e v g e o w is assumed to be the transformity of water kinetic energy sej j however the lack of seawater intrusion data prevent from calculating this quantity except for marine ecosystems other ecosystems also generate dis services consuming resources and resulting in negative effects on other systems for example water consumption greenhouse gases emissions and underutilized fertilizer discharge in agricultural ecosystem have adverse influence on human beings ma et al 2015 4 2 5 advantages and limitations of the present work emergy based esv accounting method proposed in this study also have some advantages in communicating policy making relative to economic methods to be more specific approaches to policy start with systems overviews applying diagram including significant inputs components and relationships odum 1996 emergy diagram of ecosystem services re understand the generation and formation of es which is driven by the three renewable resources i e solar earth cycle and tidal energy brown and ulgiati 2016 it can also keep track of quantity and quality of materials flows in systems and the interactions among system components at diverse scales yu et al 2016 whereas many economic methods rate jobs as contribution according to the money spent only the feedback loop design is reinforcing see fig 7 odum 1996 that means the first merit of emergy based esv to communicating policy is that it can make the ecological and economic uses of ecosystem and maximize es contribution to public welfare the second advantage is that emergy evaluation of esv is much cheaper and quicker than economic evaluation of esv odum 1996 for example on an economic analysis of the alternatives for one coastal ecosystem restoration policy 1 million may be spent on questionnaires to identify human s preferences whereas a much more rigorous emdollar evaluation possibly could have been done for 10 000 note that emdollar is the proportion of gross economic product due to emergy flow some topics require to be addressed in the future this is true for calculating biodiversity as well as cultural and educational values further large scale data are necessary to improve the quality of coastal and marine esv however despite these limitations this study defines a coherent and systematic esv accounting method whose application can provide a solid starting pointing for the development of a decision support system for coastal and marine ecosystem conservation and management 5 conclusions the protection of coastal and marine ecosystem is urgent due to their serious threatened situation this paper mainly aims to establish coastal and marine esv accounting methods to provide the basis for coastal and marine ecosystems conservation and management a coastal and marine esv accounting method based on emergy analysis is proposed to overcome the limitations of existing measurements and fill the research gap on the lack of systematic marine esv evaluation methods this includes ecosystem classification system ecosystem services classification system esv formation mechanism and their accounting techniques the coastal and marine ecosystems at the prd area china are selected as a study area to test the accounting method the results indicate that the coastal and marine esv decreased from 2000 to 2009 to be more specific for coastal ecosystems except for biomass increase and carbon sequestration increased the rest ecosystem services value decreased from 2000 to 2009 among them water purification contributes most to the decrease followed by soil building and climate regulation for marine ecosystem biomass increase and carbon sequestration decreased while the climate regulation keep stable also coastal ecosystems have the largest potential to regulation climate whether at local or regional scale intertidal marshes have the largest esv per square meter followed by mangrove coral reefs and rocky marine shores while marine ecosystem owns the smallest esv per square meter these results also indicate the accounting methods on coastal and marine esv proposed in this study can capture the spatio temporal dynamics in evaluating es due to the uniqueness of marine ecosystem an unlimited water purification capacity for general water pollutants is assumed in this study and the accounting result also indicate this hypothesis is reasonable however the exception of oil spilling or leakage should be considered being the pollutants concentration far beyond the self purification ability of marine ecosystem meanwhile the dis services of coastal ecosystems i e seawater intrusion typhoon and tsunami would also require to be considered and deducted from the total esv if data is available declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

purification contributes most to the decrease followed by soil building climate regulation and microclimate regulation 2 the coastal ecosystems have the largest potential to regulate climate whether at micro or macro scale 3 the marine esv decreased with the ratio of 42 37 and biomass increase and carbon sequestration account for the decrease 4 intertidal marshes has the largest esv per unit area followed by mangrove coral reefs and rocky marine shores while the marine ecosystem has the smallest esv per unit area as proved by the case study this work can provide a basis for an accounting method for coastal and marine esv assessment which could serve to improve both the management decision making processes and policy indications through accurately valuing coastal and marine es leading to additional investment in conservation of these ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords coastal ecosystem marine ecosystem ecosystem services valuation emergy accounting method 1 introduction marine and coastal ecosystems are highly valuable due to their richness in productivity and diversity wilkinson 2008 finlayson et al 2018 the huge list of ecosystem services es provided includes habitats for flora and fauna floods and storms mitigation sediment retention erosion control and carbon storage brown et al 2006 barbier et al 2011 in parallel they have a beneficial impact on the people living in coastal areas and small islands which account for one third of the global human population barbier et al 2008 the overexploitation of these areas results in habitat destruction climate change pollution and invasive species growth mea 2005 barbier 2017 newton et al 2018 a further expansion of urbanization and economic development has significantly influenced coastal sustainability dobson et al 2006 halpern et al 2008 bateman et al 2011 murray et al 2014 yang et al 2018 as remarked by costanza et al 2014 and ellis et al 2015 it is unlikely that these pressures will decrease in the short future protection plans and actions are still lacking even if the public s perception of marine ecosystems conservation is improving due to difficulties and costs of working at sea marine ecosystems conservation exploitation and restoration are commonly undervalued in decision making camacho valdez et al 2014 vassallo et al 2018 consequently marine protection measures are less developed than terrestrial ones unep wcmc and iucn 2016 even if many nations such as china united stated canada and so on and international ngos that are cooperating to develop implemented policies in this field this is why many marine ecosystems are under pressure watson and hewson 2018 xia et al 2017 sun et al 2018b lirman et al 2019 it would be highly desirable to expand the protection of coastal and marine waters up to 10 by 2020 as fixed under the convention on biological diversity cbd coates 2016 roberts et al 2018 therefore it is critical to develop a clear and transparent process for es assessment however the uniqueness and complexity of coastal and marine ecosystems bring challenges to coastal and marine esv assessment in detail it is critical to evaluate marine and coastal es with adequate consideration of their uniqueness and features to provide conservation and management suggestions and to preserve the benefits that es give to humans sandhu et al 2018 three main methods were implemented to assess esv langan et al 2018 the first one is economic method twenty years ago costanza et al 1997 applied an economic method to assign a value to the world s es other researchers used this method to develop several applications and policies braat and groot 2012 costanza et al 2017 revisited this method concluding that its main advantage is that it is easier to understand values of ecosystem services when they are expressed in monetary units however other researchers criticized some weaknesses of this choice in fact using a monetary approach the quantification of es becomes rooted on individual well being assessment or perception costanza et al 2017 instead human wellbeing should be more than an aggregate of individuals welfare depending also on the welfare of each community or society costanza et al 2017 campbell 2018 moreover individuals might not adequately perceive all the things that contribute to their wellbeing fioramonti 2014 the second dilemma related to limited applications of this approach for example costanza et al 2017 recently proposed some mistaken identities concerning es and esv in fact economic value does not necessarily equate to the market value meaning that expressing values in monetary units does not equal to market or exchanging values conservation and natural resource management can be approached evaluating es with invest model ouyang et al 2016 for example coastal es their spatial patterns as well as their dynamics were assessed applying this approach tallis and polasky 2009 yang et al 2017 however it lacks unified metrics and simulation of the dynamic ecological processes tallis and polasky 2009 bhagabati et al 2014 langan et al 2018 this is why an alternative option based on a donor side approach was implemented to evaluate the ecosystem support provided to humans franzese et al 2017 this method is called emergy analysis method solar emergy is solar energy required directly and indirectly to make a service or product unit solar emjoules sej odum 1996 emergy is a donor type value which is determined by the production process and not by human s preferences or willingness to pay odum 1996 one significant concept of this method is unit emergy values uevs emergy intensities which is the amount of emergy required to produce a given amount of mass or energy of a product measured in units of sej g sej j and sej brown and ulgiati 2004 emergy accounting based on a donor side evaluation of biophysical stocks and flows to assess the environmental costs of any production quantifies the cumulative available energy expenditure in making and eventually operating any service or good odum 1996 emergy method rooted on thermodynamic principles can be used to detail the flows of resources both materials and energy within any system this method has been already applied in es assessment and to measure the technological transformation of natural resources campbell and brown 2012 campbell 2012 turcato et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the application of emergy method still lacks a framework in its application to coastal and marine esv in fact economic approaches are still prevailing li et al 2013 canu et al 2015 pendleton et al 2016 sun et al 2016 2018a this study aims to fill this research gap in particular this research aims at providing a supply side evaluation of coastal and marine esv capturing the dynamic ecological processes and applying a unified metrics to esv accounting the method is applied to a case study the region of pearl river delta china finally some policy recommendations for marine and coastal ecosystems conservation management and restoration are also suggested 2 methods 2 1 description of study area the pearl river delta prd hereafter china is located in the downstream alluvial plain of the pearl river in china covering an area of 3000 km2 its extension ranges from 21 30 n to 23 42 n and from 112 26 e to 114 24 e liu et al 2017 nine cities located in guangdong province belong to this area guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai foshan huizhou dongguan zhongshan jiangmen zhaoqing the data about prd region coastal ecosystems referred to years 2000 and 2009 are presented in table 1 administration 2015 han et al 2006 defined a coastal ecosystem as the area including coastal lowlands tidelands and shallow waters less than 6 m in depth during low tide that is usually submerged by an immobile or flowing water body under sea land alternation processes besides terrestrial areas coastal ecosystems include water bodies with depth lower 2 m corresponding to a distance from shore of 1 km also due to the unavailability of dem data on china s coastal areas the coastal areas that the distance from shore is fixed at 3 km this limit is selected as the coastal ecosystems in case study fig 1 chester and jickells 2012 defined a marine ecosystem as the area where waters have a depth higher than 6 m and having a high salt content i e with an average salinity of 35 parts per thousand of water territorial waters is an area of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles around 22 2 km from the baseline of a coastal state inland sea may be located between coastal ecosystems and territorial sea due to the unavailability of china territorial sea baseline the areas ranging from the exterior line of coastal ecosystems and extending to 12 nautical miles are selected as marine ecosystem for the case study the geographical distribution of coastal and marine ecosystems applied to this case study is shown in fig 1 mangrove ecosystem is selected to detail the specific calculation process in an accompanying methods article in the journal of methodsx and all the uevs used in this study also attached in the article for reference 2 2 coastal and marine esv accounting method the framework of coastal and marine esv accounting method fig 2 include ecosystem classification es classification es formation mechanism and esv accounting techniques which will be detailed as follows 2 2 1 coastal and marine ecosystems and their services classification investigated ecosystems include marine shallow waters c1 subtidal marine aquatic beds c2 coral reefs c3 rocky marine shores c4 intertidal sand shingle pebble beach c5 intertidal mud sand flats c6 intertidal marshes c7 mangroves c8 permanent estuarine waters c9 estuarine systems of deltas c10 coastal brackish saline lagoons c11 coastal freshwater lagoons c12 the characters of these coastal and marine ecosystems are shown by table 2 jiang et al 2015 es are categorized into three types direct indirect and existing services the first one quantifies the changes in flows and storages within the studied ecosystem it mainly includes biomass increase carbon sequestration soil building and sedimentation the second one accounts for co products and by products of the ecological processes in producing the direct services there water air and soil purification microclimate regulation and electricity generation are accounted the third quantify the local share of global es as well as ecosystem cultural and educational values climate regulation biodiversity conservation cultural and education values are accounted as main existing services these categories and components are assigned to the different ecosystem types according to the scheme reported in table 3 2 2 2 diagram representation of coastal and marine es coastal and marine es dynamics are represented using emergy systems diagrams by fig 3 and fig 4 these representations are developed according to the symbolic language used by the system ecologist h t odum and followers e g odum 1996 odum and odum 2000 brown 2004 fig 3 shows the energy system diagram of coastal ecosystem services from left to right renewable sources including sunlight rain and so on drive photosynthesis in this process carbon can either be returned to the atmosphere through respiration or stored within the biomass of plant such as mangroves or seagrass in intertidal zone after the death of plants carbon moves from aboveground to the soil as one source of soil organic matter similarly from left to right as well as from outside to inside due to river flux and tidal variations oxygen salinity and nutrient availability are constantly fluctuating resulting in mangrove soils found between terrestrial and marine environments formed and deposited by fine particles rich in nutrients organic matter yet wastewaters discharged into river and tide would cause pollution in coastal environments while coastal ecosystems have potential to remove water pollutants except for water purification capacity coastal ecosystems especially mangroves have the ability to purify air and soil pollutants meanwhile driven by wind and tidal energy electricity can be generated in coastal ecosystems however if without the protection of coastal plants coasts would be easily eroded on the right side of the emergy analysis diagram the uniqueness of coastal ecosystems location makes it significant habitats for species resulting in their high value in biodiversity in addition integrating with water bodies and vegetation coastal ecosystems contribute a lot to climate regulation at both micro and macro scales the higher hierarchy flows in coastal regions are the information carried which is educational and cultural value in the perspective of ecosystem service fig 4 shows that on the left of marine system diagram sunlight drives the photosynthesis during which carbon is sequestrated from air to deep ocean through biological process thus increasing marine biomass except for this biological carbon pump at the bottom of the diagram there are another two carbon pumps physical and solubility pump the former refers to vertical deep mixing occurs when warm ocean surface waters at low latitudes is transported to high latitudes and then cooled resulting in the water heavy enough to sink thompson et al 2017 solubility carbon pump is the process by which carbon is carried from air into ocean through gas transfer on the middle and right side of the diagram due to the large amount of water volume marine ecosystem has strong capacity of self purification climate regulation at local and global scales as well as an extensive phylogenetic biodiversity than terrestrial ecosystems jenkins and van houtan 2016 similar to coastal ecosystem marine region offers educational and cultural value as a form of information service on the right 2 2 3 coastal and marine esv accounting techniques the coastal and marine esv accounting techniques are detailed in the accompanying methods article in the journal of methodsx 3 results 3 1 coastal and marine esv in the study area according to the coastal and marine esv in the study area are evaluated here as shown in fig 5 and table 3 coastal ecosystems area decreased by 16 during 2000 2009 in particular coastal esv are 2 93e 21 sej year 2000 and 2 76e 21 sej year 2009 with a 6 year decrease rate with the exception of biomass increase and carbon sequestration 63 09 growth rate all the other ecosystem services decreased among them water purification contributes most to this trend 53 22 followed by soil building 45 27 climate regulation 16 37 and microclimate regulation 15 74 for marine ecosystem the total esv in study area decreased around 42 37 from 2000 to 2009 with the esv decreasing from 2 16e 21 sej to 1 76e 21 sej as shown by fig 5 biomass increase and carbon sequestration contributes all the decrease because the climate regulation service of marine keeps stable during 2000 2009 considering the components of es separately for coastal ecosystems indirect services account most for the total esv with the percentage of 72 13 year 2000 and 64 31 year 2009 respectively in 2000 the existing and direct services contribute 14 83 and 13 04 respectively to the total coastal esv while their proportion are 13 17 and 22 52 in 2009 indicating the increase in direct services to be more specific coastal ecosystems in the prd area have the largest potential of microclimate regulation with the ratio of 71 13 in 2000 and 63 67 in 2009 followed by climate regulation accounting for 14 83 in 2000 and 13 17 in 2009 and biomass increase and carbon sequestration 12 95 in 2000 and 22 44 in 2009 these indicate coastal ecosystems have strong microclimate and climate regulation services in local and regional scale for marine ecosystem climate regulation service contributes 56 11 and 68 92 to the total esv in 2000 and 2009 respectively indicating the large potential to regulate climate which is consistent with the coastal ecosystems in the prd region 3 2 coastal and marine esv per unit area coastal and marine esv per unit area during 2000 2009 are presented in fig 6 in particular intertidal marshes had the highest esv per square meter 1 44e 12 sej m2 in 2000 1 40e 12 sej m2 in 2009 followed by mangrove 1 27e 12 sej m2 and 1 18e 12 sej m2 in 2000 and 2009 respectively rocky marine shores 1 16e 12 sej m2 in 2000 and 6 08e 11 sej m2 in 2009 and coral reefs 1 01e 12 sej m2 in 2000 and 8 53e 11 sej m2 in 2009 the absence of estuarine systems for deltas in 2009 leads to year 2009 esv per unit area equal to zero the marine ecosystem has the smallest esv per unit area compared to coastal ecosystems 4 discussion 4 1 general discussion from the calculation results of case study both coastal and marine esv decreased from 2 93e 21 sej yr to 2 76e 21 sej yr and from 2 16e 21 sej yr to 1 76e 21 sej yr during study period in the case of coastal ecosystems water purification contributed most to the decrease followed by soil building according to the accounting techniques of water purification i e equation s9 and s10 m i j d a l y i p d f i are constant parameters and τ h is also the same in year 2000 and 2009 because it is replaced with the emergy per capital in guangdong province in 2012 lin et al 2018 based on accounting detail presented in the accompanying methods article in the journal of methodsx the changes in ecosystem areas triggered the changes in e m s p consequently it was the decrease in coastal areas that caused the degradation of coastal ecosystem services this is a result of the high exploitation of coastal regions by humans murray et al 2014 as a consequence it would be relevant to increase the protection of coastal area to preserve its es in particular planners should try to plan a wider conversion of these regions into protected natural reserves biomass increase accounts for the decrease in marine esv mainly caused by the decline in rainfall from 2000 to 2009 while the other services are stable during study period because of the scarcity of data on biodiversity i e species density uniqueness trophic levels and so on the related esv is presently underestimated therefore appropriate monitoring technologies should be applied to collect sufficient information for such a purpose after many years as already claimed by manley et al 2006 it would be still highly desirable to define a national framework for species inventory and monitoring the application of the method to estimate the educational and cultural values through emergy accounting as defined by abel 2010 2013 would be difficult in the case of esv since a framework is still missing for such a purpose 4 2 specific topics 4 2 1 water supply water desalination is important for several countries to address water shortages according to zheng et al 2014 china s total seawater desalination ability grew from 10 000 m3 d to roughly 660 000 m3 d from 2000 to 2011 however a higher target is set for 2020 reaching 2 5 3 million m3 d desalination needs both natural contributions such as seawater and artificial inputs such as fuels filter membrane chemicals and so on buenfil 2001 because esv assessment is based on emergy method in this study thus only seawater s contribution is needed to be included in the esv evaluation yet according to odum 1996 there is no specific emergy of seawater because it is saltwater and the chemical potential is zero therefore water supply service of coastal and marine ecosystems is excluded in this study while for freshwater ecosystems such as lake river ecosystem this service should be included 4 2 2 advantages and limitations of accounting on biodiversity conservation the approach shown in this study to assess the biodiversity level can avoid double counting however some limitations still exist for example more details could be included by calculating turnover time for specific species as well as the emergy referred to the support area of each specie with this respect however data inputs would be currently unavailable in the majority of cases the second challenge would be to apply the accounting process to each taxonomic or phylogenetic group according to campbell and tilley 2016 this would support the definition of species variability based on turnover times a third limitation is that it fails to reflect the uniqueness and importance of species such as endangered species finally biodiversity should be accounted across trophic levels applying the approach typical of system theory considering the existing food web interactions brown et al 2006 4 2 3 marine ecosystems water and air purification services this study tested the assumption in the case of marine ecosystems of large water purification capacity for the majority of existing pollutants the result indicates that in the prd area its value was 9 25e 27 sej in 2009 being around 7 orders of magnitude larger than the other marine esv this result proves that the hypothesis is reasonable however considering the evidence of several studies various terrestrial marine and air pollution sources undermine the ocean health abessa et al 2018 therefore it does not indicate that ocean ecosystem can be polluted without being worried with respect to air purification the effects of marine ecosystem are often ignored prof however ocean can remove haze being the final sedimentary area of nitrogen pentoxide formed during fossil fuels combustion process and producing photochemical smog mungall et al 2017 during nighttime the ocean s surface absorbs nitric oxide eliminating about 15 of the smog chemicals specific evaluation of haze purification is still unavailable however this knowledge could provide the basis for further researches in related fields 4 2 4 inclusion of damages and losses in accounting process ecosystem dis services are fairly new concepts without a consensus on their definition lyytimäki et al 2008 and swinton et al 2007 suggested that they can be treated as ecological functions interfered or harmed by human activities if dis services are measured they should be deducted from the total esv some ecological phenomena caused by human activities or natural disaster such as seawater intrusion typhoon tsunami and so on can harm ecosystems should we consider these phenomena as dis services which should be reduced from the total esv or just exclude them into services in such a case how could disservices be measured these questions which remain unaddressed in this research would require specific efforts a possible reasoning is developed using seawater intrusion as an exploratory example according to svensson and theander 2013 the most common causes for seawater intrusion are pumping and sea level rise resulting in the groundwater level of seawater higher than that of freshwater and leading to a final seawater intrusion this is a dis service in coastal ecosystems in turn seawater intrusion causes groundwater salinization this is another disservice considering that mixing of freshwater bodies with 1 of seawater 250 mg l chloride by volume makes it non potable gorchev and ozolins 1984 we suggest to evaluate seawater intrusion driven by the kinetic energy of water and the emergy required by this process as 1 e m s i 1 2 m s w v 2 u e v w where e m s i represents the emergy needed by seawater intrusion sej m s w means the mass of seawater in the process of seawater intrusion g v is the average water velocity m s u e v g e o w is assumed to be the transformity of water kinetic energy sej j however the lack of seawater intrusion data prevent from calculating this quantity except for marine ecosystems other ecosystems also generate dis services consuming resources and resulting in negative effects on other systems for example water consumption greenhouse gases emissions and underutilized fertilizer discharge in agricultural ecosystem have adverse influence on human beings ma et al 2015 4 2 5 advantages and limitations of the present work emergy based esv accounting method proposed in this study also have some advantages in communicating policy making relative to economic methods to be more specific approaches to policy start with systems overviews applying diagram including significant inputs components and relationships odum 1996 emergy diagram of ecosystem services re understand the generation and formation of es which is driven by the three renewable resources i e solar earth cycle and tidal energy brown and ulgiati 2016 it can also keep track of quantity and quality of materials flows in systems and the interactions among system components at diverse scales yu et al 2016 whereas many economic methods rate jobs as contribution according to the money spent only the feedback loop design is reinforcing see fig 7 odum 1996 that means the first merit of emergy based esv to communicating policy is that it can make the ecological and economic uses of ecosystem and maximize es contribution to public welfare the second advantage is that emergy evaluation of esv is much cheaper and quicker than economic evaluation of esv odum 1996 for example on an economic analysis of the alternatives for one coastal ecosystem restoration policy 1 million may be spent on questionnaires to identify human s preferences whereas a much more rigorous emdollar evaluation possibly could have been done for 10 000 note that emdollar is the proportion of gross economic product due to emergy flow some topics require to be addressed in the future this is true for calculating biodiversity as well as cultural and educational values further large scale data are necessary to improve the quality of coastal and marine esv however despite these limitations this study defines a coherent and systematic esv accounting method whose application can provide a solid starting pointing for the development of a decision support system for coastal and marine ecosystem conservation and management 5 conclusions the protection of coastal and marine ecosystem is urgent due to their serious threatened situation this paper mainly aims to establish coastal and marine esv accounting methods to provide the basis for coastal and marine ecosystems conservation and management a coastal and marine esv accounting method based on emergy analysis is proposed to overcome the limitations of existing measurements and fill the research gap on the lack of systematic marine esv evaluation methods this includes ecosystem classification system ecosystem services classification system esv formation mechanism and their accounting techniques the coastal and marine ecosystems at the prd area china are selected as a study area to test the accounting method the results indicate that the coastal and marine esv decreased from 2000 to 2009 to be more specific for coastal ecosystems except for biomass increase and carbon sequestration increased the rest ecosystem services value decreased from 2000 to 2009 among them water purification contributes most to the decrease followed by soil building and climate regulation for marine ecosystem biomass increase and carbon sequestration decreased while the climate regulation keep stable also coastal ecosystems have the largest potential to regulation climate whether at local or regional scale intertidal marshes have the largest esv per square meter followed by mangrove coral reefs and rocky marine shores while marine ecosystem owns the smallest esv per square meter these results also indicate the accounting methods on coastal and marine esv proposed in this study can capture the spatio temporal dynamics in evaluating es due to the uniqueness of marine ecosystem an unlimited water purification capacity for general water pollutants is assumed in this study and the accounting result also indicate this hypothesis is reasonable however the exception of oil spilling or leakage should be considered being the pollutants concentration far beyond the self purification ability of marine ecosystem meanwhile the dis services of coastal ecosystems i e seawater intrusion typhoon and tsunami would also require to be considered and deducted from the total esv if data is available declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this
