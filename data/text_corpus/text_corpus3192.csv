15960,tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep is of growing concern because of its ubiquitous occurrence potential toxicity and persistence in the environment in this study two efficient tcep degradation consortia at1 and at3 were developed and were able to completely hydrolyze tcep within 20 25 h rhizobiales was identified as the key degrader in both consortia because rhizobiales related phosphoesterase genes were enriched by one to two orders of magnitude when the carbon source was changed from acetate to tcep in addition the increase in rhizobiales abundance was related to the development of tcep degradation the isolation of xanthobacter strains confirmed the efficient tcep and bis 2 chloroethyl phosphate bcep degradation of rhizobiales the higher abundances of phosphoesterase genes affiliated with rhizobiales genera bradyrhizobium and ancylobacter cytophagales genus spirosoma sphingobacteriales genus pedobacter and burkholderia genus methylibium may be related to the faster tcep degradation in at3 while the higher abundance of rhizobiales genus hyphomicrobium related phosphodiesterase pde genes may contribute to the faster bcep degradation in at1 the stepwise hydrolysis of tcep was likely catalyzed by different bacterial guilds which was confirmed by the coculture of tcep and bcep degrading isolates and highlighted the importance of synergistic interactions during tcep degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep bacterial degradation rhizobiales xanthobacter synergistic

phosphatase alp takahashi et al 2017 which catalyzed the stepwise hydrolysis of tcep and generated 2 chloroethanol 2 ce as side product some isolates affiliated with ensifer pseudomonas rhodococcus

elevated activity of flavobacteria vila costa et al 2019 we previously observed the enrichment of rhizobiales and burkholderiales and their phosphatase genes in tcep amended sediment microcosms zhou et al 2020 to date research on tcep degradation has focused on isolates and the characterization of consortia has been limited to microbial community structure analysis there remains inadequate understanding about the diversity of bacterial tcep degraders and the ecological collaboration among the bacterial community during the degradation process the objective of this study was to investigate the bacterial tcep degradation in two tcep degrading consortia used to grow on acetate as the sole carbon source we characterized the degradation kinetics of tcep and its main transformation products bis 2 chloroethyl phosphate bcep and monochloroethyl phosphate mcep of the two consortia we also investigated the potential bacterial guilds participating in the complete tcep

multidimensional scaling nmds of otu profiles was performed with the vegan package dixon 2003 a pseudo zero order kinetic model was employed to assess tcep degradation results tcep degradation kinetics in the adaptation experiment tcep degradation was observed in all three bottles inoculated from a1 a1a c and in two bottles inoculated from a3 a3a and a3c while no tcep degradation was detected in bottles inoculated from a2 a2a c and a3b fig 1 figure s2 s5 the degradation patterns of a1 bottles were generally similar tcep degradation started on day 9 11 and the concentrations dropped to below the detection limit following pseudo zero order kinetics with reaction rates of 14 9 10 1 and 12 4 mg l d for a1a a1b and a1c respectively bcep accumulated to peak concentrations of 37 5 43 8 mg l on day 13 16 and decreased to below the detection limit on day 19 21 mcep appeared on day 11 13 reached peak concentrations on day 16 19 and decreased to below the detection limit on day 19 21 and 20 in a1a a1b and a1c respectively the tcep concentrations in a3a and a3c experienced an observed lag phase of 10 days and then decreased to below the detection limit following pseudo zero order kinetics with reaction rates of 10 5 and 10 9 mg l d bcep in a3a and a3c appeared on day 10 increased to 44 8 mg l and 45 1 mg l on day 19 respectively and remained stable for four days until day 23 when mcep was firstly detected mcep in a3a and a3b reached peak concentrations on day 30 and decreased to below the detection limit on day 33 a3b did not exhibit tcep degradation probably because that it did not contain enough tcep degrading strains bacterial community dynamics after tcep addition in the adaptation experiment we tracked the bacterial community change during tcep degradation by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the major orders were azospirillales 69 2 91 9 rhodocyclaceae 3 2 15 4 pseudomonadales 0 19 9 8 rhodobacterales 0 59 5 6 chitinophagales 1 0 5 4 and rhizobiales 0 33 2 9 figure s6 rhizobiales was noticeable because it increased during tcep degradation in all bottles from 0 43 to 2 15 in a1a c and from 0 34 to1 01 in a3a and a3c fig 1 figure s2 s4 within rhizobiales xanthobacter and hyphomicrobium increased in the a1 and a3 bottles which exhibited tcep degradation capability fig 1 figure s2 s4 xanthobacter increased from 0 018 to 0 40 in a1a c and from 0 0091 to 0 32 in a3a and a3c hyphomicrobium increased from 0 29 to 1 38 in a1a c and increased from 0 40 to 0 86 in a3a and a3c rhodobacerales also increased during tcep degradation in all bottles from 0 87 to 2 26 in a1a c and from 0 86 to 1 76 in a3a and a3c other bacterial guilds of increasing abundances included chitinophagales micrococcales and sbr1031 tcep degradation kinetics of at1 and at3 in the enrichment experiment tcep degradation started immediately in at1 and at3 and the concentration decreased to below the detection limit within 20 h and 10 h respectively fig 2 tcep degradation followed pseudo zero order kinetics with the reaction rates of 5 2 and 15 7 mg l h for at1 and at3 respectively in at1 bcep accumulated to 8 69 mg l at 5 h and then dropped to 0 49 mg l at 15 h at3 exhibited higher bcep accumulation and slower bcep degradation than at1 in at3 bcep peaked at 26 91 mg l at 3 h and then dropped to 0 44 mg l at 25 h mcep in both at1 and at3 reached the peak concentration at 5 h and the peak mcep concentration in at3 was 3 16 times higher than that in at1 mcep dropped to low level at 15 h in at1 and at 25 h in at3 no tcep degradation or bcep mcep detection was observed in the control groups with no culture addition bacterial community comparison in the enrichment experiment we compared the bacterial community structures before and after tcep enrichment after tcep enrichment the bacterial community changed with a drastic drop in bacterial diversity fig 3 a table s7 at the order level increases in the abundances of rhodocyclales from 12 8 in a1 to 49 5 in at1 from 17 4 in a3 to 26 3 in at3 flavobacteriales 2 9 in a3 to 28 9 in at3 rhodobacerales 1 3 in a1 to 16 4 in at1 6 0 in a3 to 14 6 in at3 and rhizobiales 2 3 in a1 to 7 9 in at1 and 2 7 in a3 to 4 3 in at3 were observed while decreases in the abundances of pseudomonadales 16 7 in a1 to 2 2 in at1 and 14 3 in a3 to 1 0 in at3 azospirillales 17 9 in a1 to 2 3 in at1 and 11 9 in a3 to 10 2 in at3 and burkholderiales 8 4 in a1 to 2 9 in at1 and 3 8 in a3 to 2 8 in at3 were noticed fig 3a within rhizobiales xanthobacter increased in both at1 from 0 54 in a1 to 4 8 in at1 and at3 from 0 43 in a3 to 2 2 in at3 fig 4 figure s10 ancylobacter and hyphomicrobium also increased after tcep enrichment rhodobacter which belongs to rhodobacerales increased from 1 2 in a1 to 16 4 in at1 and from 0 31 in a3 to 14 6 in at3 figure s8 changes in metabolic potential after tcep enrichment revealed by metagenomic sequencing nmds ordination suggested that the metabolic potential of a1 and a3 bacterial communities changed in the same direction after tcep addition fig 3b at1 and at3 were enriched in several pathways related to xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism including furfural degradation styrene degradation nitrotoluene degradation and xylene degradation fig 3d the metagenomic data were further analyzed with a focus on phosphoesterase related genes including genes associated with phosphoesterase pe metallophosphoesterase mpe phosphodiesterase pde alkaline phosphatase alp and acid phosphatase acp genes coding for phosphotriesterase pte were not included because they were of low abundances in all samples it is hypothesized that pe and mpe may participate in the hydrolysis of tcep bcep and mcep pde is expected to catalyze bcep hydrolysis alp and acp which are categorized as phosphomonoesterase are assumed to catalyze mcep hydrolysis differences were observed among phosphoesterase genes affiliated with different bacterial guilds figure s12 we hypothesized that phosphoesterase genes that meet the following criteria are important in tcep hydrolysis 1 with increasing abundance from a1 to at1 and or from a3 to at3 fold change higher than two 2 with higher abundance in a1 and a3 than those in a2 which failed to develop tcep hydrolysis capability pe genes affiliated with afipia ancylobacter shinella and xanthobacter from the order rhizobiales were much higher in both at1 and at3 than those in a1 and a3 while genes related to bradyrhizobium and mesorhizobium from the order rhizobiales and alicycliphilus and methylibium from the order burkholderiales increased only from a3 to at3 fig 4 pe genes related to the genera rhodobacter rubellimicrobium and methyloversatilis increased in at1 and or at3 but those genes were more abundant in a2 than those in a1 or a3 mpe genes affiliated with some rhizobiales genera including bradyrhizobiam starkeya and xanthobacter were much higher in both at1 and at3 than those in a1 and a3 fig 4 figure s9 for example the relative abundance of xanthobacter related mpe genes increased by 7 1 times to 1 1 10 4 after tcep enrichment in at1 and increased from non detected in a3 to 8 5 10 5 in at3 methylibium related mpe genes were much higher only in at3 than those in a3 mpe genes affiliated with myxococcales genera including anaeromyxobacter chondromyces cystobacter myxococcus and sorangium increased from a1 to at1 8 1 9 9 times higher in at1 than those in a1 but were still less abundant in at1 than those in at3 rhodobacter and methyloversatilis related mpe genes were of higher abundances in at1 and or at3 but were more abundant in a2 than those in a1 or a3 the abundances of pde genes related to afipia xanthobacter methylibium plesiocystis and sorangium increased in both at1 and at3 fig 4 figure s9 xanthobacter related pde genes increased by 6 6 times in at1 to 2 6 10 5 after tcep enrichment and increased from non detected to 2 2 10 5 in at3 which were 17 7 18 3 of the total pde gene abundances in at1 and at3 hyphomicrobium related pde genes only increased from a1 to at1 2 1 times increase while bradyrhizobium and sphingopyxis related pde genes increased only from a3 to at3 3 3 and 2 4 times increase respectively roseivivax related pde genes increased in both at1 and at3 but were more abundant in a2 than those in a3 alp genes affiliated with ancylobacter and bradyrhizobium from the order rhizobiales increased in both at1 and at3 fig 4 figure s9 sorangium related alp genes increased by 20 3 times in at1 while nonlabens related alp genes increased by 4 8 times in at3 alp genes related to rhodobacter and methyloversatilis were of higher abundances in at1 and or at3 than those in a1 and or a3 but were more abundant in a2 than those in a1 or a3 mesorhizobium and methylibium related acp genes increased in both at1 and at3 while anaeromyxobacter related acp genes increased only in at1 fig 4 figure s9 some phosphoesterase genes were of different abundances in at1 and at3 methyloversatilis related pe mpe and alp genes were higher in at1 than those in at3 while methylibium related pe mpe and acp genes were much higher in at3 fig 4 in particular methylibium related phosphoesterase genes were only enriched in at3 the abundances of ancylobacter related pe and alp genes bradyrhizobium related pe genes and anaeromyxobacter related acp genes were higher in at3 than those in at1 hyphomicrobium related pde genes gemmobacter related alp genes and mesorhizobium related acp genes were of higher abundances in at1 than those in at3 functional genes associated with 2 ce metabolism were enriched in at1 and at3 after tcep addition including genes coding for methanol dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase haloacetate dehalogenase and 2 haloacid dehalogenase figure s13 these genes were mainly attributed to ancylobacter bradyrhizobiam hyphomicrobium and xanthobacter within rhizobiales methyloversatilis within rhodocyclales and rhodobacter within rhodobacterales figure s13 we further explored the taxonomic and functional differences among a1 a2 and a3 which may lead to their differences in tcep degradation capability the bacterial community structure and metabolic potential of a2 were different from those of a1 and a3 according to nmds ordination based on 16s rrna gene sequencing data and metagenomic sequencing data fig 3a 3b notably rhizobiales related 16s rrna genes and phosphoesterase genes pe mpe pde alp and acp tended to be more abundant in a1 and a3 fig 5 the overall rhizobiales related phosphoesterase gene abundances in a1 and a3 were 3 9 11 1 times as high as those in a2 figure s11 in summary phosphoesterase genes associated with rhizobiales genera including afipia ancylobacter bradyrhizobium devosia hyphomicrobium mesorhizobium shinella starkeye and xanthobacter were enriched up to 102 times after tcep addition and were much higher in a1 and a3 than those in a2 rhodobacterales and rhodocyclales related phosphoesterase genes were more abundant in a2 than those in a1 or a3 but also increased after tcep addition isolation of tcep and bcep degrading bacteria in total 38 isolates were obtained three of which are able to degrade tcep but could not hydrolyze bcep at3 10 for example achieved 95 8 removal of 50 mg l tcep within 1 h with initial od600 of 0 049 fig 6 b resulting in 34 9 mg l bcep accumulation the three strains were unable to grow in msm with tcep as the sole carbon source 27 isolates could hydrolyze bcep but not tcep for instance at1 8b removed 93 3 of 10 mg l bcep within 1 h with initial od600 of 0 066 fig 6c the coculture of at3 10 and at1 8b were able to remove 96 6 of 50 mg l tcep within 1 h and achieve full tcep hydrolysis within 6 h fig 6d all tcep degrading and bcep degrading isolates were classified as xanthobacter according to the rdp classifier and shared 99 78 100 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with xanthobacter flavus strain nbrc 14759 fig 6a other isolates were unable to degrade tcep or bcep and were classified as ancylobacter nocardioides hydrogenophaga pseudomonas and rhodobacter table s9 discussion this is the first study that characterized the complete bacterial tcep hydrolysis and identified the bacterial guilds participating in the different steps of tcep degradation rhizobiales was the key bacterial guild contributing to the efficient tcep degradation in both consortia it was one of the only two bacterial guilds at the order level that consistently increased in consortia that developed tcep degradation capability in both adaptation experiment and enrichment experiment fig 1 fig 3c the co occurrence of the increasing abundance of rhizobiales and the development of tcep degradation ability hence indicated the importance of rhizobiales in tcep degradation furthermore the enrichment of phosphoesterase genes affiliated with rhizobiales genera indicated that those phosphoesterase genes possibly participated in the hydrolysis of tcep bcep and or mcep fig 4 figure s11 an increase in rhizobiales and the related phosphoesterase genes was observed after tcep amendment in our previous sediment microcosm study although in both cases rhizobiales was not the dominant member in the community 3 59 7 87 of total sequences zhou et al 2020 the lack of tcep degrading rhizobiales was probably the reason for consortium a2 s failure to degrade tcep fig 5b f among the rhizobiales genera xanthobacter was a critical member representing 35 6 78 1 of rhizobiales related phosphoesterase genes figure s11 the correlation between xanthobacter s abundance increase and the development of tcep degradation ability in both adaptation experiment and enrichment experiment and the enrichment of xanthobacter related phosphoesterase genes including pe mpe and pde genes proved its vital role in tcep hydrolysis the degradation test of isolates further demonstrated the high efficiency of tcep and bcep degradation by xanthobacter strains fig 6 the degradation capability is likely strain specific because tcep degrading and bcep degrading xanthobacter isolates shared 99 9 100 16s rrna gene sequence similarity it is noteworthy that tcep degraders do not necessarily contain the ability to degrade bcep and bcep degraders are not necessarily able to hydrolyze tcep which indicates the substrate specificity of functional bacteria the genus xanthobacter is widespread in the environment and known for its ability to degrade short chain alkenes via monooxygenation and haloalkane via hydrolytic dehalogenation broberg and clark 2010 munro et al 2016 xanthobacter autotrophicus strain gj10 was reported to degrade 2 ce a by product of tcep hydrolysis takahashi et al 2012 in this study xanthobacter also likely participated in 2 ce degradation since xanthobacter related dehydrogenase and dehalogenase genes involved in 2 ce degradation were enriched after tcep addition up to 103 fold increase figure s13 organophosphorous insecticides were reported to inhibit the growth and denitrification activity of xanthobacter autotrophicus sáez et al 2006 this is the first report that xanthobacter strains were able to hydrolyze op triester and diester bcep hydrolysis was reported as the bottleneck for complete mineralization of tcep abe et al 2017 the isolation of highly efficient bcep degrading xanthobacter strains provided an opportunity for the investigation of functional phosphodiesterases the stepwise hydrolysis of tcep to bcep mcep and phosphate in the consortia was likely catalyzed by different bacterial guilds as evidenced by both metagenomic results and coculture construction the cooperation of tcep and bcep degraders for the complete hydrolysis of tcep was exemplified by the coculture consisting of tcep degrading and bcep degrading xanthobacter isolates it is possible that different rhizobiales genera were responsible for a specific step of the hydrolysis of tcep bcep and mcep gemmobacter and nonlabens probably played a supporting role as mcep degraders because their alp genes were enriched but not pe mpe or pde genes some bacterial guilds in the tcep degrading consortia may not be directly involved in the phosphoester bond hydrolysis but act as 2 ce degraders including rhodobacter of the order rhodobacterales and methyloversatilis of the order rhodocyclales since their dehydrogenase and dehalogenase genes were enriched after tcep addition genera within rhodobacterales and rhodocyclales were not considered as key tcep hydrolyzing bacteria guilds although their phosphoesterase genes increased after tcep addition because that those phosphoesterase genes were of higher abundances in the consortium that failed to degrade tcep a2 than those in the consortia that developed tcep degradation capability a1 or a3 it is possible that genera within rhodobacterales and rhodocyclales used intermediate products from tcep hydrolysis for growth including 2 ce the partnership between tcep degrader and 2 ce degrader was observed between sphingobium sp strain tcm1 and xanthobacter autotrophicus strain gj10 takahashi et al 2012 in this study rhodobacterales was the other bacterial guild at the order level in addition to rhizobiales that increased after tcep addition in the consortia with tcep degradation capability in both adaptation experiment and enrichment experiment suggesting that 2 ce degraders also played a major role in the consortia on one hand they could alleviate the toxicity of 2 ce accumulation on the other hand they competed with tcep and bcep degraders for carbon and energy sources this synergistic interaction in the biodegradation of xenobiotics has been observed previously deng et al 2018 meyer cifuentes et al 2020 yu et al 2019 in a recent publication about anaerobic tcep degradation dehalococcoides transformed tcep to bcep and ethene via one electron transfer and c o bond cleavage but could not further dechlorinate bcep zhu et al 2022 collaboration among different bacterial guilds is critical for the comprehensive mineralization of the parent contaminant and the alleviation of product accumulation such as bcep in addition synergistic consortia may be more stable and resilient to environmental stress than isolates jeong and kim 2019 in this study the constructed coculture of xanthobacter isolates achieved more efficient overall tcep removal than the original consortia which implies its future application in bioremediation practice fig 6 future investigations are needed to explore the biodegradation at community level under both laboratory and field conditions the improved understanding of the stepwise degradation pathway and synergy within the bacterial community would help identify the key degradation step and key functional bacteria which would provide insights for bioremediation strategy development although both consortia at1 and at3 were able to fully hydrolyze tcep the two consortia had distinct degradation kinetics which could be attributed to their different bacterial community compositions and the different distributions of phosphoesterase genes the higher abundances of pe and mpe genes affiliated with spirosoma pedobacter methylibium bradyrhizobium and ancylobacter in at3 suggested that those genes may be more efficient in tcep hydrolysis on the other hand the abundance of hyphomicrobium related pde genes in at1 was 3 7 times as high as that in at3 which could be the reason for the faster bcep degradation in at1 hyphomicrobium related mpe and pe genes and devosia related pe genes were of higher abundances in at1 which may contribute to the higher bcep degradation as well the different contributions of different bacterial guilds during tcep degradation and the diversity and specificity of their phosphoesterase genes need further investigation in future research conclusions in summary rhizobiales was the key degrader in the two tcep degrading consortia although it only represented 4 35 7 87 of the total sequences the complete mineralization of tcep required cooperation among tcep degraders bcep degraders mcep degraders and 2 ce degraders this improved understanding of bacterial synergy during tcep degradation led to the construction of a coculture consisting of tcep degrading and bcep degrading xanthobacter isolates which demonstrated efficient overall tcep removal and implies future application in bioremediation different bacterial guilds likely had different substrate specificities and resulted in distinct degradation patterns of tcep and the transformation products indicating that research about the diversity of functional bacteria and related phosphoesterase genes is necessary overall our results enhanced the comprehensive understanding of the diversity and

15960,tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep is of growing concern because of its ubiquitous occurrence potential toxicity and persistence in the environment in this study two efficient tcep degradation consortia at1 and at3 were developed and were able to completely hydrolyze tcep within 20 25 h rhizobiales was identified as the key degrader in both consortia because rhizobiales related phosphoesterase genes were enriched by one to two orders of magnitude when the carbon source was changed from acetate to tcep in addition the increase in rhizobiales abundance was related to the development of tcep degradation the isolation of xanthobacter strains confirmed the efficient tcep and bis 2 chloroethyl phosphate bcep degradation of rhizobiales the higher abundances of phosphoesterase genes affiliated with rhizobiales genera bradyrhizobium and ancylobacter cytophagales genus spirosoma sphingobacteriales genus pedobacter and burkholderia genus methylibium may be related to the faster tcep degradation in at3 while the higher abundance of rhizobiales genus hyphomicrobium related phosphodiesterase pde genes may contribute to the faster bcep degradation in at1 the stepwise hydrolysis of tcep was likely catalyzed by different bacterial guilds which was confirmed by the coculture of tcep and bcep degrading isolates and highlighted the importance of synergistic interactions during tcep degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep bacterial degradation rhizobiales xanthobacter synergistic

elevated activity of flavobacteria vila costa et al 2019 we previously observed the enrichment of rhizobiales and burkholderiales and their phosphatase genes in tcep amended sediment microcosms zhou et al 2020 to date research on tcep degradation has focused on isolates and the characterization of consortia has been limited to microbial community structure analysis there remains inadequate understanding about the diversity of bacterial tcep degraders and the ecological collaboration among the bacterial community during the degradation process the objective of this study was to

multidimensional scaling nmds of otu profiles was performed with the vegan package dixon 2003 a pseudo zero order kinetic model was employed to assess tcep degradation results tcep degradation kinetics in the adaptation experiment tcep degradation was observed in all three bottles inoculated from a1 a1a c and in two bottles inoculated from a3 a3a and a3c while no tcep degradation was detected in bottles inoculated from a2 a2a c and a3b fig 1 figure s2 s5 the degradation patterns of a1 bottles were generally similar tcep degradation started on day 9 11 and the concentrations dropped to below the detection limit following pseudo zero order kinetics with reaction rates of 14 9 10 1 and 12 4 mg l d for a1a a1b and a1c respectively bcep accumulated to peak concentrations of 37 5 43 8 mg l on day 13 16 and decreased to below the detection limit on day 19 21 mcep appeared on day 11 13 reached peak concentrations on day 16 19 and decreased to below the detection limit on day 19 21 and 20 in a1a a1b and a1c respectively the tcep concentrations in a3a and a3c experienced an observed lag phase of 10 days and then decreased to below the detection limit following pseudo zero order kinetics with reaction rates of 10 5 and 10 9 mg l d bcep in a3a and a3c appeared on day 10 increased to 44 8 mg l and 45 1 mg l on day 19 respectively and remained stable for four days until day 23 when mcep was firstly detected mcep in a3a and a3b reached peak concentrations on day 30 and decreased to below the detection limit on day 33 a3b did not exhibit tcep degradation probably because that it did not contain enough tcep degrading strains bacterial community dynamics after tcep addition in the adaptation experiment we tracked the bacterial community change during tcep degradation by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the major orders were azospirillales 69 2 91 9 rhodocyclaceae 3 2 15 4 pseudomonadales 0 19 9 8 rhodobacterales 0 59 5 6 chitinophagales 1 0 5 4 and rhizobiales 0 33 2 9 figure s6 rhizobiales was noticeable because it increased during tcep degradation in all bottles from 0 43 to 2 15 in a1a c and from 0 34 to1 01 in a3a and a3c fig 1 figure s2 s4 within rhizobiales xanthobacter and hyphomicrobium increased in the a1 and a3 bottles which exhibited tcep degradation capability fig 1 figure s2 s4 xanthobacter increased from 0 018 to 0 40 in a1a c and from 0 0091 to 0 32 in a3a and a3c hyphomicrobium increased from 0 29 to 1 38 in a1a c and increased from 0 40 to 0 86 in a3a and a3c rhodobacerales also increased during tcep degradation in all bottles from 0 87 to 2 26 in a1a c and from 0 86 to 1 76 in a3a and a3c other bacterial guilds of increasing abundances included chitinophagales micrococcales and sbr1031 tcep degradation kinetics of at1 and at3 in the enrichment experiment tcep degradation started immediately in at1 and at3 and the concentration decreased to below the detection limit within 20 h and 10 h respectively fig 2 tcep degradation followed pseudo zero order kinetics with the reaction rates of 5 2 and 15 7 mg l h for at1 and at3 respectively in at1 bcep accumulated to 8 69 mg l at 5 h and then dropped to 0 49 mg l at 15 h at3 exhibited higher bcep accumulation and slower bcep degradation than at1 in at3 bcep peaked at 26 91 mg l at 3 h and then dropped to 0 44 mg l at 25 h mcep in both at1 and at3 reached the peak concentration at 5 h and the peak mcep concentration in at3 was 3 16 times higher than that in at1 mcep dropped to low level at 15 h in at1 and at 25 h in at3 no tcep degradation or bcep mcep detection was observed in the control groups with no culture addition bacterial community comparison in the enrichment experiment we compared the bacterial community structures before and after tcep enrichment after tcep enrichment the bacterial community changed with a drastic drop in bacterial diversity fig 3 a table s7 at the order level increases in the abundances of rhodocyclales from 12 8 in a1 to 49 5 in at1 from 17 4 in a3 to 26 3 in at3 flavobacteriales 2 9 in a3 to 28 9 in at3 rhodobacerales 1 3 in a1 to 16 4 in at1 6 0 in a3 to 14 6 in at3 and rhizobiales 2 3 in a1 to 7 9 in at1 and 2 7 in a3 to 4 3 in at3 were observed while decreases in the abundances of pseudomonadales 16 7 in a1 to 2 2 in at1 and 14 3 in a3 to 1 0 in at3 azospirillales 17 9 in a1 to 2 3 in at1 and 11 9 in a3 to 10 2 in at3 and burkholderiales 8 4 in a1 to 2 9 in at1 and 3 8 in a3 to 2 8 in at3 were noticed fig 3a within rhizobiales xanthobacter increased in both at1 from 0 54 in a1 to 4 8 in at1 and at3 from 0 43 in a3 to 2 2 in at3 fig 4 figure s10 ancylobacter and hyphomicrobium also increased after tcep enrichment rhodobacter which belongs to rhodobacerales increased from 1 2 in a1 to 16 4 in at1 and from 0 31 in a3 to 14 6 in at3 figure s8 changes in metabolic potential after tcep enrichment revealed by metagenomic sequencing nmds ordination suggested that the metabolic potential of a1 and a3 bacterial communities changed in the same direction after tcep addition fig 3b at1 and at3 were enriched in several pathways related to xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism including furfural degradation styrene degradation nitrotoluene degradation and xylene degradation fig 3d the metagenomic data were further analyzed with a focus on phosphoesterase related genes including genes associated with phosphoesterase pe metallophosphoesterase mpe phosphodiesterase pde alkaline phosphatase alp and acid phosphatase acp genes coding for phosphotriesterase pte were not included because they were of low abundances in all samples it is hypothesized that pe and mpe may participate in the hydrolysis of tcep bcep and mcep pde is expected to catalyze bcep hydrolysis alp and acp which are categorized as phosphomonoesterase are assumed to catalyze mcep hydrolysis differences were observed among phosphoesterase genes affiliated with different bacterial guilds figure s12 we hypothesized that phosphoesterase genes that meet the following criteria are important in tcep hydrolysis 1 with increasing abundance from a1 to at1 and or from a3 to at3 fold change higher than two 2 with higher abundance in a1 and a3 than those in a2 which failed to develop tcep hydrolysis capability pe genes affiliated with afipia ancylobacter shinella and xanthobacter from the order rhizobiales were much higher in both at1 and at3 than those in a1 and a3 while genes related to bradyrhizobium and mesorhizobium from the order rhizobiales and alicycliphilus and methylibium from the order burkholderiales increased only from a3 to at3 fig 4 pe genes related to the genera rhodobacter rubellimicrobium and methyloversatilis increased in at1 and or at3 but those genes were more abundant in a2 than those in a1 or a3 mpe genes affiliated with some rhizobiales genera including bradyrhizobiam starkeya and xanthobacter were much higher in both at1 and at3 than those in a1 and a3 fig 4 figure s9 for example the relative abundance of xanthobacter related mpe genes increased by 7 1 times to 1 1 10 4 after tcep enrichment in at1 and increased from non detected in a3 to 8 5 10 5 in at3 methylibium related mpe genes were much higher only in at3 than those in a3 mpe genes affiliated with myxococcales genera including anaeromyxobacter chondromyces cystobacter myxococcus and sorangium increased from a1 to at1 8 1 9 9 times higher in at1 than those in a1 but were still less abundant in at1 than those in at3 rhodobacter and methyloversatilis related mpe genes were of higher abundances in at1 and or at3 but were more abundant in a2 than those in a1 or a3 the abundances of pde genes related to afipia xanthobacter methylibium plesiocystis and sorangium increased in both at1 and at3 fig 4 figure s9 xanthobacter related pde genes increased by 6 6 times in at1 to 2 6 10 5 after tcep enrichment and increased from non detected to 2 2 10 5 in at3 which were 17 7 18 3 of the total pde gene abundances in at1 and at3 hyphomicrobium related pde genes only increased from a1 to at1 2 1 times increase while bradyrhizobium and sphingopyxis related pde genes increased only from a3 to at3 3 3 and 2 4 times increase respectively roseivivax related pde genes increased in both at1 and at3 but were more abundant in a2 than those in a3 alp genes affiliated with ancylobacter and bradyrhizobium from the order rhizobiales increased in both at1 and at3 fig 4 figure s9 sorangium related alp genes increased by 20 3 times in at1 while nonlabens related alp genes increased by 4 8 times in at3 alp genes related to rhodobacter and methyloversatilis were of higher abundances in at1 and or at3 than those in a1 and or a3 but were more abundant in a2 than those in a1 or a3 mesorhizobium and methylibium related acp genes increased in both at1 and at3 while anaeromyxobacter related acp genes increased only in at1 fig 4 figure s9 some phosphoesterase genes were of different abundances in at1 and at3 methyloversatilis related pe mpe and alp genes were higher in at1 than those in at3 while methylibium related pe mpe and acp genes were much higher in at3 fig 4 in particular methylibium related phosphoesterase genes were only enriched in at3 the abundances of ancylobacter related pe and alp genes bradyrhizobium related pe genes and anaeromyxobacter related acp genes were higher in at3 than those in at1 hyphomicrobium related pde genes gemmobacter related alp genes and mesorhizobium related acp genes were of higher abundances in at1 than those in at3 functional genes associated with 2 ce metabolism were enriched in at1 and at3 after tcep addition including genes coding for methanol dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase haloacetate dehalogenase and 2 haloacid dehalogenase figure s13 these genes were mainly attributed to ancylobacter bradyrhizobiam hyphomicrobium and xanthobacter within rhizobiales methyloversatilis within rhodocyclales and rhodobacter within rhodobacterales figure s13 we further explored the taxonomic and functional differences among a1 a2 and a3 which may lead to their differences in tcep degradation capability the bacterial community structure and metabolic potential of a2 were different from those of a1 and a3 according to nmds ordination based on 16s rrna gene sequencing data and metagenomic sequencing data fig 3a 3b notably rhizobiales related 16s rrna genes and phosphoesterase genes pe mpe pde alp and acp tended to be more abundant in a1 and a3 fig 5 the overall rhizobiales related phosphoesterase gene abundances in a1 and a3 were 3 9 11 1 times as high as those in a2 figure s11 in summary phosphoesterase genes associated with rhizobiales genera including afipia ancylobacter bradyrhizobium devosia hyphomicrobium mesorhizobium shinella starkeye and xanthobacter were enriched up to 102 times after tcep addition and were much higher in a1 and a3 than those in a2 rhodobacterales and rhodocyclales related phosphoesterase genes were more abundant in a2 than those in a1 or a3 but also increased after tcep addition isolation of tcep and bcep degrading bacteria in total 38 isolates were obtained three of which are able to degrade tcep but could not hydrolyze bcep at3 10 for example achieved 95 8 removal of 50 mg l tcep within 1 h with initial od600 of 0 049 fig 6 b resulting in 34 9 mg l bcep accumulation the three strains were unable to grow in msm with tcep as the sole carbon source 27 isolates could hydrolyze bcep but not tcep for instance at1 8b removed 93 3 of 10 mg l bcep within 1 h with initial od600 of 0 066 fig 6c the coculture of at3 10 and at1 8b were able to remove 96 6 of 50 mg l tcep within 1 h and achieve full tcep hydrolysis within 6 h fig 6d all tcep degrading and bcep degrading isolates were classified as xanthobacter according to the rdp classifier and shared 99 78 100 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with xanthobacter flavus strain nbrc 14759 fig 6a other isolates were unable to degrade tcep or bcep and were classified as ancylobacter nocardioides hydrogenophaga pseudomonas and rhodobacter table s9 discussion this is the first study that characterized the complete bacterial tcep hydrolysis and identified the bacterial guilds participating in the different steps of tcep degradation rhizobiales was the key bacterial guild contributing to the efficient tcep degradation in both consortia it was one of the only two bacterial guilds at the order level that consistently increased in consortia that developed tcep degradation capability in both adaptation experiment and enrichment experiment fig 1 fig 3c the co occurrence of the increasing abundance of rhizobiales and the development of tcep degradation ability hence indicated the importance of rhizobiales in tcep degradation furthermore the enrichment of phosphoesterase genes affiliated with rhizobiales genera indicated that those phosphoesterase genes possibly participated in the hydrolysis of tcep bcep and or mcep fig 4 figure s11 an increase in rhizobiales and the related phosphoesterase genes was observed after tcep amendment in our previous sediment microcosm study although in both cases rhizobiales was not the dominant member in the community 3 59 7 87 of total sequences zhou et al 2020 the lack of tcep degrading rhizobiales was probably the reason for consortium a2 s failure to degrade tcep fig 5b f among the rhizobiales genera xanthobacter was a critical member representing 35 6 78 1 of rhizobiales related phosphoesterase genes figure s11 the correlation between xanthobacter s abundance increase and the development of tcep degradation ability in both adaptation experiment and enrichment experiment and the enrichment of xanthobacter related phosphoesterase genes including pe mpe and pde genes proved its vital role in tcep hydrolysis the degradation test of isolates further demonstrated the high efficiency of tcep and bcep degradation by xanthobacter strains fig 6 the degradation capability is likely strain specific because tcep degrading and bcep degrading xanthobacter isolates shared 99 9 100 16s rrna gene sequence similarity it is noteworthy that tcep degraders do not necessarily contain the ability to degrade bcep and bcep degraders are not necessarily able to hydrolyze tcep which indicates the substrate specificity of functional bacteria the genus xanthobacter is widespread in the environment and known for its ability to degrade short chain alkenes via monooxygenation and haloalkane via hydrolytic dehalogenation broberg and clark 2010 munro et al 2016 xanthobacter autotrophicus strain gj10 was reported to degrade 2 ce a by product of tcep hydrolysis takahashi et al 2012 in this study xanthobacter also likely participated in 2 ce degradation since xanthobacter related dehydrogenase and dehalogenase genes involved in 2 ce degradation were enriched after tcep addition up to 103 fold increase figure s13 organophosphorous insecticides were reported to inhibit the growth and denitrification activity of xanthobacter autotrophicus sáez et al 2006 this is the first report that xanthobacter strains were able to hydrolyze op triester and diester bcep hydrolysis was reported as the bottleneck for complete mineralization of tcep abe et al 2017 the isolation of highly efficient bcep degrading xanthobacter strains provided an opportunity for the investigation of functional phosphodiesterases the stepwise hydrolysis of tcep to bcep mcep and phosphate in the consortia was likely catalyzed by different bacterial guilds as evidenced by both metagenomic results and coculture construction the cooperation of tcep and bcep degraders for the complete hydrolysis of tcep was exemplified by the coculture consisting of tcep degrading and bcep degrading xanthobacter isolates it is possible that different rhizobiales genera were responsible for a specific step of the hydrolysis of tcep bcep and mcep gemmobacter and nonlabens probably played a supporting role as mcep degraders because their alp genes were enriched but not pe mpe or pde genes some bacterial guilds in the tcep degrading consortia may not be directly involved in the phosphoester bond hydrolysis but act as 2 ce degraders including rhodobacter of the order rhodobacterales and methyloversatilis of the order rhodocyclales since their dehydrogenase and dehalogenase genes were enriched after tcep addition genera within rhodobacterales and rhodocyclales were not considered as key tcep hydrolyzing bacteria guilds although their phosphoesterase genes increased after tcep addition because that those phosphoesterase genes were of higher abundances in the consortium that failed to degrade tcep a2 than those in the consortia that developed tcep degradation capability a1 or a3 it is possible that genera within rhodobacterales and rhodocyclales used intermediate products from tcep hydrolysis for growth including 2 ce the partnership between tcep degrader and 2 ce degrader was observed between sphingobium sp strain tcm1 and xanthobacter autotrophicus strain gj10 takahashi et al 2012 in this study rhodobacterales was the other bacterial guild at the order level in addition to rhizobiales that increased after tcep addition in the consortia with tcep degradation capability in both adaptation experiment and enrichment experiment suggesting that 2 ce degraders also played a major role in the consortia on one hand they could alleviate the toxicity of 2 ce accumulation on the other hand they competed with tcep and bcep degraders for carbon and energy sources this synergistic interaction in the biodegradation of xenobiotics has been observed previously deng et al 2018 meyer cifuentes et al 2020 yu et al 2019 in a recent publication about anaerobic tcep degradation dehalococcoides transformed tcep to bcep and ethene via one electron transfer and c o bond cleavage but could not further dechlorinate bcep zhu et al 2022 collaboration among different bacterial guilds is critical for the comprehensive mineralization of the parent contaminant and the alleviation of product accumulation such as bcep in addition synergistic consortia may be more stable and resilient to environmental stress than isolates jeong and kim 2019 in this study the constructed coculture of xanthobacter isolates achieved more efficient overall tcep removal than the original consortia which implies its future application in bioremediation practice fig 6 future investigations are needed to explore the biodegradation at community level under both laboratory and field conditions the improved understanding of the stepwise degradation pathway and synergy within the bacterial community would help identify the key degradation step and key functional bacteria which would provide insights for bioremediation strategy development although both consortia at1 and at3 were able to fully hydrolyze tcep the two consortia had distinct degradation kinetics which could be attributed to their different bacterial community compositions and the different distributions of phosphoesterase genes the higher abundances of pe and mpe genes affiliated with spirosoma pedobacter methylibium bradyrhizobium and ancylobacter in at3 suggested that those genes may be more efficient in tcep hydrolysis on the other hand the abundance of hyphomicrobium related pde genes in at1 was 3 7 times as high as that in at3 which could be the reason for the faster bcep degradation in at1 hyphomicrobium related mpe and pe genes and devosia related pe genes were of higher abundances in at1 which may contribute to the higher bcep degradation as well the different contributions of different bacterial guilds during tcep degradation and the diversity and specificity of their phosphoesterase genes need further investigation in future research conclusions in summary rhizobiales was the key degrader in the two tcep degrading consortia although it only represented 4 35 7 87 of the total sequences the complete mineralization of tcep required cooperation among tcep degraders bcep degraders mcep degraders and 2 ce degraders this improved understanding of bacterial synergy during tcep degradation led to the construction of a coculture consisting of tcep degrading and bcep degrading xanthobacter isolates which demonstrated efficient overall tcep removal and implies future application in bioremediation different bacterial guilds likely had different substrate specificities and resulted in distinct degradation patterns of tcep and the transformation products indicating that research about the diversity of functional bacteria and related phosphoesterase genes is necessary overall our results enhanced the comprehensive understanding of the diversity and synergistic interactions of bacterial guilds participating in tcep degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15961,bio denitrification plays a crucial role in the purification of nitrogen contaminated water yet the low efficiency of the pure biological system often leads to the accumulation of harmful intermediates semi biological catalysis provides an effective approach to improving the reaction efficiency through hybridizing artificial nanomaterials with natural organisms yet the application of this strategy in bio denitrification is limited in this study the effect of surface engineered carbon nitride on the denitrification capability of denitrifying bacteria was investigated we found that cyano groups availed the biotic abiotic interactions while immobilized cobalt single atoms attenuated the local electrostatic repulsion this synergistic effect endowed carbon nitride modified with cobalt atoms and cyano groups co c3n4 c with the unexpected acceleration of bio denitrification reaction without the accumulation of harmful intermediates according to the metabolomics analysis this improvement was attributed to the moderate metabolic adaptation caused by nanoelicitor which induced dramatically boosted electron transfer and energy supply for extracellular polymeric substance eps secretion the elevation of intracellular iron level increased the activities of denitrification reductase which was evidenced by metatranscriptomic analysis our results not only demonstrate the great potential of carbon nitride as an artificial elicitor for biological regulation but also shed light on comprehending the complicated biotic abiotic interactions for versatile application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords semi biological system bio denitrification carbon nitride nitrate metabolism 1 introduction with the rapid growth of industrial activities and human population the excessive consumption of fertilizers and other nitrogen compounds causes serious environmental problems of nitrogen pollution such as eutrophication and climate change chen et al 2018 davidson 2009 bio denitrification is the primary pathway by which nitrate no3 n is reduced to the n2 under the catalysis of multiple denitrifying enzymes in microbes chen and strous 2013 thus it has been extensively applied in the removal of no3 n and ammonium nh4 n in wastewater treatment plants wwpts however the low denitrification efficiency usually causes no3 n residue in effluent and incomplete denitrification gao et al 2020 leading to nitrite nitrogen no2 n accumulation and nitrous oxide n2o emission zheng et al 2014 in the practical applications supplement of external carbon sources was conducted to improve the denitrification efficiency but brings about the risk of secondary pollution and significant increase of treatment cost ballantine et al 2014 an enhanced biological strategy with high economic benefit and excellent denitrification effect is urgently required to remove nitrate artificial nanomaterials with variable components have distinct advantages for physicochemical applications it has been proved that the efficiency of biotic or abiotic reactions could be improved by integrating synthetic nanomaterials with natural microorganisms arousing the research interest in semi biological systems nel et al 2009 in recent years several types of nanoarchitectures have been explored to enhance carbon or nitrogen metabolism in microbes for example molybdenum disulfide mos2 as catalytic active sites could dramatically reprogram the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of cyanobacteria via boosting the calvin cycles yan et al 2021 conductive multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and iron based materials have also been integrated with microorganisms to mediate the electron transfer in biotic abiotic hybrids for bio denitrification chen et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 until now the successes of strengthened bio denitrification by synthetic nanomaterials are still limited and the underlying biotic abiotic synergistic mechanism is poorly understood what is more besides the electron dependent respiration processes a new approach that could directly improve the physiological functions of denitrification bacteria is urgently required exogenous stimulus has proved to be an effective way to alter the physiological behavior of natural microorganisms sawicki et al 2015 biology studies have shown that engineered nanomaterials tend to induce metabolic adaption which could up or down regulate the physiological functions of microbes to realize the artificial strengthening of bio denitrification a material with tailorable structures is essential for the regulation of biotic abiotic interactions carbon nitride c3n4 is a potential elicitor to enhance bio denitrification due to the metal free components which ensure good biocompatibility compared to mos2 in addition the facile synthesis of c3n4 enables the low cost for large scale applications and the layered structure of c3n4 can provide more opportunities for the immobilization of biomaterials although there have been some successes c3n4 is normally employed as photocatalytic material to enhance the decontamination capability of microbes li et al 2022 by far the application of c3n4 as an artificial elicitor to strengthen the biological function for denitrification has never been attempted yet in the present study we report the fabrication of c3n4 nanosheets surface modified by cyano groups and cobalt single atoms as a synthetic component in semi biological systems we found cyano groups on co c3n4 c were prone to combining with p denitrificans while proximal cobalt single atoms facilitated this interaction caused by attenuated electrostatic repulsion this synergistic effect contributed to a moderate abiotic biotic interaction for metabolic adaption the fundamental role of carbon nitride as an artificial elicitor induced a significantly enhanced capability of semi biological system for denitrification reactions further investigations in terms of microbes growth intracellular physiology variations revealed that extracellular stress in response to nanostructured c3n4 changed the biological metabolism of denitrifying bacteria secreted more eps that in favor of iron uptake the improved electron and energy supply together with the boosted activity of denitrifying enzymes induced a significant improvement in denitrification performance thus this work opens an avenue to the regulation design of biotic abiotic nanoarchitectures with strengthened environmental functionalities by surface engineering of polymeric c3n4 2 material and method 2 1 microbe and cultivation paracoccus denitrificans atcc 19 367 is a widely used model denitrifying microbe in some previous studies in this work the passage strain gdmcc 1 335 of

concentration of 200 mg l 1 and ch3coona concentration of 1200 mg l 1 all the above medium and stock solutions were previously autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min to prevent precipitate formation mgso4 7h2o was added into the basic medium through sterilized filter after dissolved in water 2 2 synthesis of different types of c3n4 bulk c3n4 was obtained via thermal condensing of dicyandiamide in static air in muffle furnace at 550 c for 4 h c3n4 hn is an ultrathin nanosheet without modification of cyano groups it was synthesized according to our previous work bian et al 2021 typically melamine was calcinated under mixed h2 n2 gas 1 1 in a tube furnace with a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 co c3n4 c was synthesized using the crystal assisted confinement pyrolysis method liu et al 2020 4 g dicyandiamide was added into 100 ml ultrapure water followed by sonication and stirring for 10 min respectively after that 10 g nacl and 0 1 mmol co oac 2 were dissolved into the above solution to obtain a homogeneous transparent liquid the liquid was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen then dried in freeze dryer for 48 h to get precursor powder the ground powder was pyrolyzed to 550 c at a heating rate of 2 2 c min 1 and annealed for 4 h in tube furnace under the atmosphere of n2 with a flow of 50 ml min 1 finally the as prepared co c3n4 c was obtained after washed with ultrapure water and dried 2 3 characterization of co c3n4 c to confirm the crystal structure of co c3n4 c powder x ray diffraction xrd measurement was carried out using an advanced x ray powder diffractometer bruker d8 with cu kα radiation scanning electron microscopy sem was acquired on hitachi su 8020 with samples sprayed with gold for 50 s in advance transmission electron microscopy tem was used to characterize the morphologies of samples using a jem 2100f transmission electron microscope the morphology of denitrifican cells was also observed by sem and tem and the specific methods of preparing microbial samples are described in supporting information the x ray absorption spectra xas of the samples at co k edge were collected at beijing synchrotron radiation facility bsrf x ray absorption near edge structure xanes and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs were collected at room temperature with energy calibrated using co foil the spectra were collected at fluorescence mode using double si 111 crystal monochromator for energy selection high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy haadf stem images of the single atoms were taken using jeol arm 300 with an accelerating voltage of 300 kv the metal loading of the sample was determined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms on agilent 7800 fourier transform infrared spectra ftir were acquired to investigate the variation of organic functional group on thermo fisher scientific nicolet in10mx spectrometer from 4000 cm 1 to 600 cm 1 with the resolution of 1 cm 1 2 4 co c3n4 c enhanced biological denitrification denitrification experiments were performed in sealed 40 ml glass serum bottles after the addition of basic medium and stock solutions p denitrificans was inoculated into the bottles with an od600 0 05 then a certain amount of co c3n4 c suspension was injected to achieve a final concentration of 20 mg l to achieve anaerobic condition the sealed glass bottles were vacuumed and then purged with pure ar at least three times for 20 min on a custom built anaerobic operating platform in the end all bottles were placed in an air bath shaker with 170 rpm at 30 c after initiating the reaction the samples were withdrawn periodically and the bacteria and co c3n4 c nanosheet were removed with 0 45 μm millipore filter for control experiments sterilized water was injected instead of co c3n4 c suspension in the practical application experiment denitrifying bacteria were replaced with activated sludge 1 g l which collected from the anoxic pool in a wastewater treatment plant the concentration of no3 n no2 n and ch3coona was determined using the chromatography of ions ics 2000 dionex usa 2 5 evaluation of electron and energy generation processes the intracellular nad nadh and atp levels were detected to evaluate the electron and energy generation the concentration of atp was measured by an atp assay kit beyotime china according to the instruction biomolecule cells were firstly cracked with lysis buffer then supernatant was obtained by centrifugation 5000 rpm for 5 min 4 c for following determination since atp in the extract could provide energy for firefly luciferase to catalyze the generation of luminescence the atp content in p denitrificans could be determined by luminescence intensity similarly nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh was extracted after cell disruption and centrifugation the extract was treated at 60 c for 30 min to decompose nad in order to calculate the ratio of nad nadh nad was firstly reduced to nadh as electron donor using alcohol dehydrogenase then nadh provided electrons for the reduction of wst 8 to yellow formazan which has absorbance peak at 450 nm nadh concentration was determined via calculating the formation of yellow formazan herein the concentration of nad nadh and atp were normalized and expressed as μmol mg protein 2 6 metabolomics analysis microbial samples from the mono bacteria and the coupled groups were collected and pretreated by washing and freeze drying each group was set up six repetitions quality control sample qc was also set by mixing equal volumes of all samples in order to confirm the stability of the analysis the metabolites were extracted from 100 mg of solid sample using 800 µl of methanol water solution 4 1 v v the above mixtures were crushed ultrasonicated and centrifuged and the supernatant was transferred to sample vials for lc ms ms analysis chromatographic separation of the metabolites was performed on a thermo uhplc system equipped with an acquity beh c18 column waters milford usa thermo uhplc q exactive mass spectrometer was conducted to determine the metabolites over a mass range of 70 1050 m z with an electrospray ionization esi source operating in either positive or negative ion mode all the analyses of metabolomics data were performed on majorbio cloud platform https cloud majorbio com which include partial least square discriminant analysis pls da variable importance in projection vip analysis t test analysis and kegg enrichment 2 7 other analytical methods other analyses such as sem and tem analysis ros level cell counting and live dead assay analysis of eps denitrifying reductase activities etc were listed in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of co c3n4 c the morphology and structure of carbon nitride elicitors were firstly investigated tem image in fig 1 a shows that as prepared co c3n4 c are ultrathin nanosheets which are remarkably different from pristine bulk c3n4 figure s1 combined with the dynamic light scattering dls analysis the average size of co c3n4 c nanosheets is 836 nm which is comparable to bacteria figure s2 the characteristic peaks at 13 5 and 27 2 in the xrd patterns are identified as 100 and 002 planes of graphitic carbon nitride compared to c3n4 the weakened 002 peak and disappeared 100 peak in co c3n4 c evidenced the exfoliation of bulk polymers into ultrathin structures fig 1b wang et al 2019 the thickness of nanosheets was determined to be 3 5 nm fig 1c which is equivalent to 11 layers of carbon nitride monolayers wang et al 2017 the formation of co single atoms was confirmed by atomic resolution high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy haadf stem in fig 1d the appearance of isolated bright dots circled in yellow proves the distribution of atomically dispersed metals on the surface of carbon nitride nanosheets the single atom structure of co was further investigated by exafs spectroscopy the absence of co co coordination in k edge spectrum from fourier transformed results fig 1e further confirms the atomic dispersion of cobalt atoms chu et al 2020 best fit parameters extracted from the ft exafs spectra indicate cobalt atoms were four coordinated on nitrogen atoms with co n bond length of 1 99 å figure s3 according to inductively coupled plasma icp ms results the loading amount of co single atoms on co c3n4 c was 0 25 wt ftir spectra were collected to reveal the chemical functional groups of prepared materials fig 1f both samples possess similar peaks at the region of 800 and 1200 1700 cm 1 owing to the vibration of tri s triazine ring and aromatic c3n4 heterocycles wang et al 2019 respectively those characteristic peaks indicate that the dominant structure of carbon nitride was well preserved during the pyrolysis in the presence of co and alkali metals wang et al 2017 distinctly co c3n4 c exhibits a new peak at 2150 cm 1 which could be ascribed to cyano groups in a conjugated system cn wang et al 2019 as reported cn is prone to interact with biomolecules because of the formation of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions wang et al 2018 thus we have successfully synthesized ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets surface modified by cyano groups and co single atoms for the construction of nano bio conjugations 3 2 strengthen bio denitrification by co c3n4 c to reveal the effect of carbon nitride polymers on the denitrification performance of biological microorganisms diverse carbon nitride architectures were employed as artificial elicitor to couple with denitrifying bacteria for no3 n removal to clarify the synergistic effect of cn and co atoms c3n4 with cn c3n4 c and co atoms co c3n4 were separately synthesized it was observed that pristine bulk c3n4 exhibited ignorable influence on the denitrification capability of p denitrificans while the presence of co single atoms in co c3n4 deteriorated the biological activity fig 2 a the integration of p denitrificans with c3n4 c could effectively accelerate the removal rate of no3 n suggesting the critical role of cyano groups for biological regulation interestingly this enhancement was more significant when co c3n4 c was used as elicitor demonstrating the synergistic effect between cyano groups and co single atoms for strengthened denitrification on utilization of engineered carbon nitride with an initial no3 n concentration of 200 mg l the no3 n removal efficiency of p denitrificans was improved from 41 8 to 96 8 within 15 h figure s4 our synergistic system could effectively denitrify no3 n into n2 since no obvious accumulation of no2 n and n2o n intermediates were observed over the whole reaction duration fig 2b and figure s5 it is worth noting that during the reaction co concentration was less than 1 μg l in the effluent water according to icp ms results suggesting the stability of co c3n4 c to demonstrate the superiority of co c3n4 c p denitrificans hybrids various nanomaterials were explored as artificial elicitors for biohybridization when c3n4 hn nanosheets without cyano groups were used no obvious improvement in denitrification efficiency was achieved furthermore the performance of co c3n4 c p denitrificans was further compared with powder activated carbon pac a typical porous material with high specific surface area for biohybridization as shown in figure s6 the promotion effect of co c3n4 c was much better than other attempted nanomaterials demonstrating the synergistic contribution of cyano groups and co single atoms for denitrification strengthen it should be pointed out that although c3n4 hn and pac possessed moderate promotion effects due to the high specific surface area figure s7 much higher concentration of undesirable no2 n intermediate was detected fig 2c furthermore to explore the potential of carbon nitride materials for practical applications bio denitrification experiments using activated sludge was conducted fig 2d during the denitrification reactions with gradually increased no3 n concentration in influent the coupled group demonstrated significant improvement in no3 n removal thus our engineered carbon nitride possessed unpredicted capability for artificially regulate the biological functionality of denitrifying bacteria we thereafter investigated the nano bio interactions to comprehend the enhancement mechanism the contribution of adsorption to denitrification could be ignored since negligible change of no3 n concentration was observed in fig 2a additionally the adverse impact of light irradiation on denitrification performance excluded the contribution from catalytic effect of carbon nitride figure s8 what is more co c3n4 c with smaller size could not permeate into bacteria cells and exhibited negligible influence on the efficiency of bio denitrification figure s9 10 suggesting that the small size effect was not the dominant reason for the enhancement in bio denitrification note that the promotion effect was not obvious at the first several hours thus the interactions between co c3n4 c and p denitrificans is essential for the strengthened denitrification the nano bio interactions were thus investigated by ftir measurements in the spectrum of nano bio hybrid the peak of n h stretching vibration at 3290 cm 1 of p denitrificans and the peak of cn stretching vibration at 2150 cm 1 of co c3n4 c were decreased fig 3 a implying the formation of hydrogen bonds cn h n wang et al 2018 accordingly the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between amino groups in co c3n4 c were weakened since the peak of tri s triazine ring bending vibration at 795 7 cm 1 shifted to higher wavenumber after being coupled with denitrifying bacteria fig 3b rumyantsev et al 2016 due to the switch of conjugated group from double bond to alkyl groups a bathochromic shift from 2150 to 2180 cm 1 was observed for the cn stretching vibration besides the signal intensity of c h bond vibration of cellular membrane in the region of 1380 1450 cm 1 and 2870 2960 cm 1 decreased further confirmed the conjugation between cn and alkyl groups thus cn could act as bridge links the nanomaterials with microbes via hydrogen bonds which was consistent with previous reports sigala et al 2009 webb and boxer 2008 however cn groups could endow negative charges to carbon nitride electrostatic repulsion between bacteria and electron rich materials inevitably weakened their interactions fig 3c this detrimental effect could be well relieved by immobilizing co single atoms onto carbon nitride due to the decreased electronegativity synergy of cyano groups and co single atoms in co c3n4 c induced moderate interactions with p denitrificans thus effectively elicited microbes for denitrification conversely isolated cyano groups on c3n4 c could be easily divorced from material surface figure s11 contributing less to the strengthening effect the impact of carbon nitride elicitors on the growth of p denitrificans was considered confocal laser scanning microscope clsm analysis showed that co c3n4 c exhibited ignorable influence on the viability of microbes suggesting the good biocompatibility of co c3n4 c figure s12 additionally with addition of co c3n4 c biomass was increased by 14 8 figure s13 whereas the denitrification efficiency was increased 131 5 implying the increasement of biomass was not the main reason for enhanced denitrification sem and tem was employed to observe the morphology of biotic abiotic assemblies fig 3d g after elicitation spherical organisms with intact intracellular membrane and cytoskeleton microfilaments were tightly wrapped by thin nanosheets well evidenced the facilitated interfacial interactions by surface engineering of co c3n4 c 3 3 evaluation of material induced metabolic adaption the response of p denitrificans to oxidative stress caused by surface engineered c3n4 was thereafter investigated due to the strong biotic abiotic interactions co c3n4 c induced higher ros level of p denitrificans when exposed to external stimulation figure s14 since microbes are prone to secrete eps for resisting oxidative stress xiao and zheng 2016 fluorescence staining method was used to investigate the variation of eps secreted by p denitrificans after elicitation after the integration of p denitrificans with co c3n4 c the thickness of eps increased from 106 nm to 241 nm fig 4 a and 4b indicating the enhanced secretion of eps by artificial stimulation however this phenomenon was not observed for pristine c3n4 fig 4c the facilitated formation of eps promoted iron uptake of p denitrificans zhang et al 2018 which was an essential component element for denitrifying enzymes and electron transport proteins therefore the response of p denitrificans to oxidative stress elevated intracellular iron level figure s15 would contribute to the improved bio denitrification 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem was employed to determine the components of eps to explore the physiological changes in response to co c3n4 c stimulation as revealed in fig 4e peaks distribute at region ⅱ ex em of 220 242 340 350 nm region ⅲ ex em of 240 385 390 nm and region ⅳ ex em of 275 280 350 360 nm were assigned to aromatic like substance fulvic acid fa like substance and tryptophan protein respectively you et al 2021 compared to the pure bacteria fig 4d fluorescence intensity was increased and expanded with the addition of co c3n4 c suggesting enhanced intracellular metabolism of denitrifying bacteria in adaption to the stimulation given the fact that carbon source could accelerate eps secretion you et al 2021 the enzymatic and energetic behaviors involved in carbon metabolism was studied as displayed in fig 5 a the consumption of carbon source was significantly accelerated by co c3n4 c as evidenced by the negligible acetate residue in the coupled group this result implied that being elicited by co c3n4 c denitrifying bacteria exhibited higher utilization efficiency for carbon source no extra carbon source was needed the efficient utilization of carbon resource would generate more electrons which were transferred via nadh dehydrogenase quinone pool bc1 complex and cytochrome for the consecutive reduction of no3 n chen and strous 2013 thus nadh nad cofactor for electron transfer was used to evaluate the electron transport process as illustrated in fig 5b abiotic stimulation caused by co c3n4 c significantly increased the content of total nadh nad suggesting that more reducing equivalents were supplied to the respiratory chain to maintain a state of redox homeostasis chen et al 2020 the activities of various denitrification reductase such as nar nir nor and n2or were evaluated to assay the consumption of electrons as shown in fig 5c compared to single bacteria system the activities of denitrification reductase in the synergistic system were increased by 65 5 nar 30 28 nir 48 25 nor and 32 6 n2or respectively agree with the results in fig 2 thus co c3n4 c enhanced the denitrification efficiency via facilitating the electron transfer chains with respect to a denitrification organism electron supply is closely related with biological metabolism for the regulation of physiological functions atp is an essential direct energy substance for cell based biosynthesis and substrate transport thus higher atp level usually refers to a greater physiological activity of denitrifying bacteria simon and klotz 2013 in the present study co c3n4 c could remarkably increase the atp level of microbial system by about 4 times fig 5d which would provide more energy for bio denitrification 3 4 mechanism for artificial strengthen of denitrification to give deeper understand on how co c3n4 c facilitated electron transfer energy generation and enhanced denitrifying enzymes activities multi omics approaches including transcriptomics and metabolic analysis were performed firstly transcriptions differential analysis was carried out and there were in total 1162 differentially expressed genes absolute fold change 2 and p 0 05 figure s16 the different values of pearson correlation coefficients between samples indicated that the presence of co c3n4 c brought about significant influences on p denitrificans the transcriptomics results were mapped to gene ontology go database figure s17 and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg figure s18 for ontology and pathway annotations go annotations showed genes were different in transmembrane transporter activity atpase activity atp binding cassette abc transporter complex and catalytic activity which suggested highly active transmembrane process and energy metabolism in response to co c3n4 c stimulations similar results were obtained in kegg annotations as for the metabolism class most up regulated genes were affiliated with carbohydrate energy and amino acid metabolism implying the active membrane transport might arouse for these metabolic activities these results could well support the enhanced atp level and carbon metabolism in fig 5 considering the importance of iron element in the denitrifying enzymes and electron transport chains we analyzed the transcription of relevant key genes fig 6 two groups were successfully clustered indicating the variance in iron related gene expression pattern five up regulated iron abc transporters could well explain the elevated iron uptake of p denitrificans and up regulated activities of denitrifying enzymes figure s15 and fig 5c protocatechuate 3 4 dioxygenase is an important enzyme in the correlation of aromatic and hydroaromatic compounds arvay et al 2021 barbe et al 2004 it needs to bind with fe3 for function the distinguished high expression level of its two subunits corresponded with the signal of aromatic like substances in 3d eem fig 4 other genes presented in fig 6 possess iron sulfur clusters important components of protein for electron transfer bandyopadhyay et al 2008 in various activities such as denitrification bertero et al 2003 photosynthesis kang et al 2021 and sulfatase post transcriptional modification benjdia et al 2008 according to the other expression patterns the increased iron uptake stimulated by co c3n4 c might account for promoting denitrification eo213 rs25820 heme biosynthesis eo213 rs02830 and energy conversion eo213 rs15240 having revealed the changes of metatranscriptomics we investigated the material involved metabolism in denitrifying bacteria via untargeted metabolomic techniques a total of 529 metabolites in p denitrificans were identified using lc ms multivariate sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da shows mono bacteria group was well separated from the coupled group figure s19 indicating co c3n4 c altered the metabolism processes of denitrifying bacteria among these metabolites 322 remarkably distinguishing p 0 05 compounds between two groups with pls da score 0 1 were selected as a metabolic set in the following studies and they can be classified into seven categories figure s20 microbes are instinctively to regulate metabolic pathways in face of environmental stress han et al 2021 the metabolic pathways and biological effects of above selected metabolites were determined by kegg pathway enrichment analysis as shown in fig 7 pathways with lower p value and higher enrichment ratio are identified as essential metabolic pathways the most significant metabolic pathway was arginine biosynthesis in which four metabolites including l glutamate n acetyl l glutamic acid n acetyl l glutamate 5 semialdehyde and l glutamic acid were significantly increased in the presence of co c3n4 c fig 8 a indicating the high activity of this metabolism process arginine an antioxidant was synthesized along with urea cycle fig 8c could scavenge free radicals to relieve oxidative stress fang et al 2002 implying the alteration of p denitrificans in response to abiotic materials therefore p denitrificans were undamaged with integrated membrane structure in fig 3g besides pantothenate and coenzyme a coa biosynthesis is another distinguish pathway enriched in the metabolic set fig 7 coa is a precursor for the synthesis of acetyl coa which played major role in initiating tca cycle chen et al 2020 acetyl coa can be synthesized from fatty acid oxidation or the oxidation of amino acids tryptophan martínez reyes and chandel 2020 agreed with the fluctuant compounds in amino acids metabolism figure s21 and increased fluorescence intensity of eps in region ⅳ fig 5e apart from promoter several key intermediates in the tca cycle were obviously increased on exposure of co c3n4 c including pyruvate acely coa citric acid and glutamic acid chen et al 2020 fig 8b indicating that tca cycle was enhanced the byproduct of arginine synthesis fumarate also accelerated this cycle reaction theoretically 3 nadh and 1 fadh2 equivalent to 10 atp are generated in one biochemical cycle process xie and wang 1996 thus the enhanced tca cycle would supply more electrons and energy for biological denitrification especially from no2 n to n2 confirming the elevated levels of nadh and atp were original from more activated tca cycle pathway furthermore tca cycle intermediates which are important for biosynthesis can also act as signaling molecules to control cell fate and function for example post translational modifications martínez reyes and chandel 2020 glutamic acid is converted into α ketoglutarate fig 8c a metabolite which was correlated with the emergence and abundance of denitrifying genes including napa narg nosz and norb emmanuel et al 2019 all the above results demonstrated that co c3n4 c likely boosted denitrification processes via regulating the expression of related enzymes and the adaption of related metabolic pathways 4 conclusions in summary co c3n4 c was introduced to construct a semi biological system for efficient denitrification the no3 n was almost removed at

15961,bio denitrification plays a crucial role in the purification of nitrogen contaminated water yet the low efficiency of the pure biological system often leads to the accumulation of harmful intermediates semi biological catalysis provides an effective approach to improving the reaction efficiency through hybridizing artificial nanomaterials with natural organisms yet the application of this strategy in bio denitrification is limited in this study the effect of surface engineered carbon nitride on the denitrification capability of denitrifying bacteria was investigated we found that cyano groups availed the biotic abiotic interactions while immobilized cobalt single atoms attenuated the local electrostatic repulsion this synergistic effect endowed carbon nitride modified with cobalt atoms and cyano groups co c3n4 c with the unexpected acceleration of bio denitrification reaction without the accumulation of harmful intermediates according to the metabolomics analysis this improvement was attributed to the moderate metabolic adaptation caused by nanoelicitor which induced dramatically boosted electron transfer and energy supply for extracellular polymeric substance eps secretion the elevation of intracellular iron level increased the activities of denitrification reductase which was evidenced by metatranscriptomic analysis our results not only demonstrate the great potential of carbon nitride as an artificial elicitor for biological regulation but also shed light on comprehending the complicated biotic abiotic interactions for versatile application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords semi biological system bio denitrification carbon nitride nitrate metabolism 1 introduction with the rapid growth of industrial activities and human population the excessive consumption of fertilizers and other nitrogen compounds causes serious environmental problems of nitrogen pollution such as eutrophication and climate change chen et al 2018 davidson 2009 bio denitrification is the primary pathway by which nitrate no3 n is reduced to the n2 under the catalysis of multiple denitrifying enzymes in microbes chen and strous 2013 thus it has been extensively applied in the removal of no3 n and ammonium nh4 n in wastewater treatment plants wwpts however the low denitrification efficiency usually causes no3 n residue in effluent and incomplete denitrification gao et al 2020 leading to nitrite nitrogen no2 n accumulation and nitrous oxide n2o emission zheng et al 2014 in the practical applications supplement of external carbon sources was conducted to improve the denitrification efficiency but brings about the risk of secondary pollution and significant increase of treatment cost ballantine et al 2014 an enhanced biological strategy with high economic benefit and excellent denitrification effect is urgently required to remove nitrate artificial nanomaterials with variable components have distinct advantages for physicochemical applications it has been proved that the efficiency of biotic or abiotic reactions could be improved by integrating synthetic nanomaterials with natural microorganisms arousing the research interest in semi biological systems nel et al 2009 in recent years several types of nanoarchitectures have been explored to enhance carbon or nitrogen metabolism in microbes for example molybdenum disulfide mos2 as catalytic active sites could dramatically reprogram the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of cyanobacteria via boosting the calvin cycles yan et al 2021 conductive multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and iron based materials have also been integrated with microorganisms to mediate the electron transfer in biotic abiotic hybrids for bio denitrification chen et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 until now the successes of strengthened bio denitrification by synthetic nanomaterials are still limited and the underlying biotic abiotic synergistic mechanism is poorly understood what is more besides the electron dependent respiration processes a new approach that could directly improve the physiological functions of denitrification bacteria is urgently required exogenous stimulus has proved to be an effective way to alter the physiological behavior of natural microorganisms sawicki et al 2015 biology studies have shown that engineered nanomaterials tend to induce metabolic adaption which could up or down regulate the physiological functions of microbes to realize the artificial strengthening of bio denitrification a material with tailorable structures is essential for the regulation of biotic abiotic interactions carbon nitride c3n4 is a potential elicitor to enhance bio denitrification due to the metal free components which ensure good biocompatibility compared to mos2 in addition the facile synthesis of c3n4 enables the low cost for large scale applications and the layered structure of c3n4 can provide more opportunities for the immobilization of biomaterials although there have been some successes c3n4 is normally employed as photocatalytic material to enhance the decontamination capability of microbes li et al 2022 by far the application of c3n4 as an artificial elicitor to strengthen the biological function for denitrification has never been attempted yet in the present study we report the fabrication of c3n4 nanosheets surface modified by cyano groups and cobalt single atoms as a synthetic component in semi biological systems we found cyano groups on co c3n4 c were prone to combining with p denitrificans while proximal cobalt single atoms facilitated this interaction caused by attenuated electrostatic repulsion this synergistic effect contributed to a moderate abiotic biotic interaction for metabolic adaption the fundamental role of carbon nitride as an artificial elicitor induced a significantly enhanced capability of semi biological system for denitrification reactions further investigations in terms of microbes growth intracellular physiology variations revealed that extracellular stress in response to nanostructured c3n4 changed the biological metabolism of denitrifying bacteria secreted more eps that in favor of iron uptake the improved electron and energy supply together with the boosted activity of denitrifying enzymes induced a significant improvement in denitrification performance thus this work opens an avenue to the regulation design of biotic abiotic nanoarchitectures with strengthened environmental functionalities by surface engineering of polymeric c3n4 2 material and method 2 1 microbe and cultivation paracoccus denitrificans atcc 19 367 is a widely used model denitrifying microbe in some previous studies in this work the passage strain gdmcc 1 335 of

concentration of 200 mg l 1 and ch3coona concentration of 1200 mg l 1 all the above medium and stock solutions were previously autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min to prevent precipitate formation mgso4 7h2o was added into the basic medium through sterilized filter after dissolved in water 2 2 synthesis of different types of c3n4 bulk c3n4 was obtained via thermal condensing of dicyandiamide in static air in muffle furnace at 550 c for 4 h c3n4 hn is an ultrathin nanosheet without modification of cyano groups it was synthesized according to our previous work bian et al 2021 typically melamine was calcinated under mixed h2 n2 gas 1 1 in a tube furnace with a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 co c3n4 c was synthesized using the crystal assisted confinement pyrolysis method liu et al 2020 4 g dicyandiamide was added into 100 ml ultrapure water followed by sonication and stirring for 10 min respectively after that 10 g nacl and 0 1 mmol co oac 2 were dissolved into the above solution to obtain a homogeneous transparent liquid the liquid was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen then dried in freeze dryer for 48 h to get precursor powder the ground powder was pyrolyzed to 550 c at a heating rate of 2 2 c min 1 and annealed for 4 h in tube furnace under the atmosphere of n2 with a flow of 50 ml min 1 finally the as prepared co c3n4 c was obtained after washed with ultrapure water and dried 2 3 characterization of co c3n4 c to confirm the crystal structure of co c3n4 c powder x ray diffraction xrd measurement was carried out using an advanced x ray powder diffractometer bruker d8 with cu kα radiation scanning electron microscopy sem was acquired on hitachi su 8020 with samples sprayed with gold for 50 s in advance transmission electron microscopy tem was used to characterize the morphologies of samples using a jem 2100f transmission electron microscope the morphology of denitrifican cells was also observed by sem and tem and the specific methods of preparing microbial samples are described in supporting information the x ray absorption spectra xas of the samples at co k edge were collected at beijing synchrotron radiation facility bsrf x ray absorption near edge structure xanes and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs were collected at room temperature with energy calibrated using co foil the spectra were collected at fluorescence mode using double si 111 crystal monochromator for energy selection high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy haadf stem images of the single atoms were taken using jeol arm 300 with an accelerating voltage of 300 kv the metal loading of the sample was determined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms on agilent 7800 fourier transform infrared spectra ftir were acquired to investigate the variation of organic functional group on thermo fisher scientific nicolet in10mx spectrometer from 4000 cm 1 to 600 cm 1 with the resolution of 1 cm 1 2 4 co c3n4 c enhanced biological denitrification denitrification experiments were performed in sealed 40 ml glass serum bottles after the addition of basic medium and stock solutions p denitrificans was inoculated into the bottles with an od600 0 05 then a certain amount of co c3n4 c suspension was injected to achieve a final concentration of 20 mg l to achieve anaerobic condition the sealed glass bottles were vacuumed and then purged with pure ar at least three times for 20 min on a custom built anaerobic operating platform in the end all bottles were placed in an air bath shaker with 170 rpm at 30 c after initiating the reaction the samples were withdrawn periodically and the bacteria and co c3n4 c nanosheet were removed with 0 45 μm millipore filter for control experiments sterilized water was injected instead of co c3n4 c suspension in the practical application experiment denitrifying bacteria were replaced with activated sludge 1 g l which collected from the anoxic pool in a wastewater treatment plant the concentration of no3 n no2 n and ch3coona was determined using the chromatography of ions ics 2000 dionex usa 2 5 evaluation of electron and energy generation processes the intracellular nad nadh and atp levels were detected to evaluate the electron and energy generation the concentration of atp was measured by an atp assay kit beyotime china according to the instruction biomolecule cells were firstly cracked with lysis buffer then supernatant was obtained by centrifugation 5000 rpm for 5 min 4 c for following determination since atp in the extract could provide energy for firefly luciferase to catalyze the generation of luminescence the atp content in p denitrificans could be determined by luminescence intensity similarly nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh was extracted after cell disruption and centrifugation the extract was treated at 60 c for 30 min to decompose nad in order to calculate the ratio of nad nadh nad was firstly reduced to nadh as electron donor using alcohol dehydrogenase then nadh provided electrons for the reduction of wst 8 to yellow formazan which has absorbance peak at 450 nm nadh concentration was determined via calculating the formation of yellow formazan herein the concentration of nad nadh and atp were normalized and expressed as μmol mg protein 2 6 metabolomics analysis microbial samples from the mono bacteria and the coupled groups were collected and pretreated by washing and freeze drying each group was set up six repetitions quality control sample qc was also set by mixing equal volumes of all samples in order to confirm the stability of the analysis the metabolites were extracted from 100 mg of solid sample using 800 µl of methanol water solution 4 1 v v the above mixtures were crushed ultrasonicated and centrifuged and the supernatant was transferred to sample vials for lc ms ms analysis chromatographic separation of the metabolites was performed on a thermo uhplc system equipped with an acquity beh c18 column waters milford usa thermo uhplc q exactive mass spectrometer was conducted to determine the metabolites over a mass range of 70 1050 m z with an electrospray ionization esi source operating in either positive or negative ion mode all the analyses of metabolomics data were performed on majorbio cloud platform https cloud majorbio com which include partial least square discriminant analysis pls da variable importance in projection vip analysis t test analysis and kegg enrichment 2 7 other analytical methods other analyses such as sem and tem analysis ros level cell counting and live dead assay analysis of eps denitrifying reductase activities etc were listed in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of co c3n4 c the morphology and structure of carbon nitride elicitors were firstly investigated tem image in fig 1 a shows that as prepared co c3n4 c are ultrathin nanosheets which are remarkably different from pristine bulk c3n4 figure s1 combined with the dynamic light scattering dls analysis the average size of co c3n4 c nanosheets is 836 nm which is comparable to bacteria figure s2 the characteristic peaks at 13 5 and 27 2 in the xrd patterns are identified as 100 and 002 planes of graphitic carbon nitride compared to c3n4 the weakened 002 peak and disappeared 100 peak in co c3n4 c evidenced the exfoliation of bulk polymers into ultrathin structures fig 1b wang et al 2019 the thickness of nanosheets was determined to be 3 5 nm fig 1c which is equivalent to 11 layers of carbon nitride monolayers wang et al 2017 the formation of co single atoms was confirmed by atomic resolution high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy haadf stem in fig 1d the appearance of isolated bright dots circled in yellow proves the distribution of atomically dispersed metals on the surface of carbon nitride nanosheets the single atom structure of co was further investigated by exafs spectroscopy the absence of co co coordination in k edge spectrum from fourier transformed results fig 1e further confirms the atomic dispersion of cobalt atoms chu et al 2020 best fit parameters extracted from the ft exafs spectra indicate cobalt atoms were four coordinated on nitrogen atoms with co n bond length of 1 99 å figure s3 according to inductively coupled plasma icp ms results the loading amount of co single atoms on co c3n4 c was 0 25 wt ftir spectra were collected to reveal the chemical functional groups of prepared materials fig 1f both samples possess similar peaks at the region of 800 and 1200 1700 cm 1 owing to the vibration of tri s triazine ring and aromatic c3n4 heterocycles wang et al 2019 respectively those characteristic peaks indicate that the dominant structure of carbon nitride was well preserved during the pyrolysis in the presence of co and alkali metals wang et al 2017 distinctly co c3n4 c exhibits a new peak at 2150 cm 1 which could be ascribed to cyano groups in a conjugated system cn wang et al 2019 as reported cn is prone to interact with biomolecules because of the formation of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions wang et al 2018 thus we have successfully synthesized ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets surface modified by cyano groups and co single atoms for the construction of nano bio conjugations 3 2 strengthen bio denitrification by co c3n4 c to reveal the effect of carbon nitride polymers on the denitrification performance of biological microorganisms diverse carbon nitride architectures were employed as artificial elicitor to couple with denitrifying bacteria for no3 n removal to clarify the synergistic effect of cn and co atoms c3n4 with cn c3n4 c and co atoms co c3n4 were separately synthesized it was observed that pristine bulk c3n4 exhibited ignorable influence on the denitrification capability of p denitrificans while the presence of co single atoms in co c3n4 deteriorated the biological activity fig 2 a the integration of p denitrificans with c3n4 c could effectively accelerate the removal rate of no3 n suggesting the critical role of cyano groups for biological regulation interestingly this enhancement was more significant when co c3n4 c was used as elicitor demonstrating the synergistic effect between cyano groups and co single atoms for strengthened denitrification on utilization of engineered carbon nitride with an initial no3 n concentration of 200 mg l the no3 n removal efficiency of p denitrificans was improved from 41 8 to 96 8 within 15 h figure s4 our synergistic system could effectively denitrify no3 n into n2 since no obvious accumulation of no2 n and n2o n intermediates were observed over the whole reaction duration fig 2b and figure s5 it is worth noting that during the reaction co concentration was less than 1 μg l in the effluent water according to icp ms results suggesting the stability of co c3n4 c to demonstrate the superiority of co c3n4 c p denitrificans hybrids various nanomaterials were explored as artificial elicitors for biohybridization when c3n4 hn nanosheets without cyano groups were used no obvious improvement in denitrification efficiency was achieved furthermore the performance of co c3n4 c p denitrificans was further compared with powder activated carbon pac a typical porous material with high specific surface area for biohybridization as shown in figure s6 the promotion effect of co c3n4 c was much better than other attempted nanomaterials demonstrating the synergistic contribution of cyano groups and co single atoms for denitrification strengthen it should be pointed out that although c3n4 hn and pac possessed moderate promotion effects due to the high specific surface area figure s7 much higher concentration of undesirable no2 n intermediate was detected fig 2c furthermore to explore the potential of carbon nitride materials for practical applications bio denitrification experiments using activated sludge was conducted fig 2d during the denitrification reactions with gradually increased no3 n concentration in influent the coupled group demonstrated significant improvement in no3 n removal thus our engineered carbon nitride possessed unpredicted capability for artificially regulate the biological functionality of denitrifying bacteria we thereafter investigated the nano bio interactions to comprehend the enhancement mechanism the contribution of adsorption to denitrification could be ignored since negligible change of no3 n concentration was observed in fig 2a additionally the adverse impact of light irradiation on denitrification performance excluded the contribution from catalytic effect of carbon nitride figure s8 what is more co c3n4 c with smaller size could not permeate into bacteria cells and exhibited negligible influence on the efficiency of bio denitrification figure s9 10 suggesting that the small size effect was not the dominant reason for the enhancement in bio denitrification note that the promotion effect was not obvious at the first several hours thus the interactions between co c3n4 c and p denitrificans is essential for the strengthened denitrification the nano bio interactions were thus investigated by ftir measurements in the spectrum of nano bio hybrid the peak of n h stretching vibration at 3290 cm 1 of p denitrificans and the peak of cn stretching vibration at 2150 cm 1 of co c3n4 c were decreased fig 3 a implying the formation of hydrogen bonds cn h n wang et al 2018 accordingly the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between amino groups in co c3n4 c were weakened since the peak of tri s triazine ring bending vibration at 795 7 cm 1 shifted to higher wavenumber after being coupled with denitrifying bacteria fig 3b rumyantsev et al 2016 due to the switch of conjugated group from double bond to alkyl groups a bathochromic shift from 2150 to 2180 cm 1 was observed for the cn stretching vibration besides the signal intensity of c h bond vibration of cellular membrane in the region of 1380 1450 cm 1 and 2870 2960 cm 1 decreased further confirmed the conjugation between cn and alkyl groups thus cn could act as bridge links the nanomaterials with microbes via hydrogen bonds which was consistent with previous reports sigala et al 2009 webb and boxer 2008 however cn groups could endow negative charges to carbon nitride electrostatic repulsion between bacteria and electron rich materials inevitably weakened their interactions fig 3c this detrimental effect could be well relieved by immobilizing co single atoms onto carbon nitride due to the decreased electronegativity synergy of cyano groups and co single atoms in co c3n4 c induced moderate interactions with p denitrificans thus effectively elicited microbes for denitrification conversely isolated cyano groups on c3n4 c could be easily divorced from material surface figure s11 contributing less to the strengthening effect the impact of carbon nitride elicitors on the growth of p denitrificans was considered confocal laser scanning microscope clsm analysis showed that co c3n4 c exhibited ignorable influence on the viability of microbes suggesting the good biocompatibility of co c3n4 c figure s12 additionally with addition of co c3n4 c biomass was increased by 14 8 figure s13 whereas the denitrification efficiency was increased 131 5 implying the increasement of biomass was not the main reason for enhanced denitrification sem and tem was employed to observe the morphology of biotic abiotic assemblies fig 3d g after elicitation spherical organisms with intact intracellular membrane and cytoskeleton microfilaments were tightly wrapped by thin nanosheets well evidenced the facilitated interfacial interactions by surface engineering of co c3n4 c 3 3 evaluation of material induced metabolic adaption the response of p denitrificans to oxidative stress caused by surface engineered c3n4 was thereafter investigated due to the strong biotic abiotic interactions co c3n4 c induced higher ros level of p denitrificans when exposed to external stimulation figure s14 since microbes are prone to secrete eps for resisting oxidative stress xiao and zheng 2016 fluorescence staining method was used to investigate the variation of eps secreted by p denitrificans after elicitation after the integration of p denitrificans with co c3n4 c the thickness of eps increased from 106 nm to 241 nm fig 4 a and 4b indicating the enhanced secretion of eps by artificial stimulation however this phenomenon was not observed for pristine c3n4 fig 4c the facilitated formation of eps promoted iron uptake of p denitrificans zhang et al 2018 which was an essential component element for denitrifying enzymes and electron transport proteins therefore the response of p denitrificans to oxidative stress elevated intracellular iron level figure s15 would contribute to the improved bio denitrification 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem was employed to determine the components of eps to explore the physiological changes in response to co c3n4 c stimulation as revealed in fig 4e peaks distribute at region ⅱ ex em of 220 242 340 350 nm region ⅲ ex em of 240 385 390 nm and region ⅳ ex em of 275 280 350 360 nm were assigned to aromatic like substance fulvic acid fa like substance and tryptophan protein respectively you et al 2021 compared to the pure bacteria fig 4d fluorescence intensity was increased and expanded with the addition of co c3n4 c suggesting enhanced intracellular metabolism of denitrifying bacteria in adaption to the stimulation given the fact that carbon source could accelerate eps secretion you et al 2021 the enzymatic and energetic behaviors involved in carbon metabolism was studied as displayed in fig 5 a the consumption of carbon source was significantly accelerated by co c3n4 c as evidenced by the negligible acetate residue in the coupled group this result implied that being elicited by co c3n4 c denitrifying bacteria exhibited higher utilization efficiency for carbon source no extra carbon source was needed the efficient utilization of carbon resource would generate more electrons which were transferred via nadh dehydrogenase quinone pool bc1 complex and cytochrome for the consecutive reduction of no3 n chen and strous 2013 thus nadh nad cofactor for electron transfer was used to evaluate the electron transport process as illustrated in fig 5b abiotic stimulation caused by co c3n4 c significantly increased the content of total nadh nad suggesting that more reducing equivalents were supplied to the respiratory chain to maintain a state of redox homeostasis chen et al 2020 the activities of various denitrification reductase such as nar nir nor and n2or were evaluated to assay the consumption of electrons as shown in fig 5c compared to single bacteria system the activities of denitrification reductase in the synergistic system were increased by 65 5 nar 30 28 nir 48 25 nor and 32 6 n2or respectively agree with the results in fig 2 thus co c3n4 c enhanced the denitrification efficiency via facilitating the electron transfer chains with respect to a denitrification organism electron supply is closely related with biological metabolism for the regulation of physiological functions atp is an essential direct energy substance for cell based biosynthesis and substrate transport thus higher atp level usually refers to a greater physiological activity of denitrifying bacteria simon and klotz 2013 in the present study co c3n4 c could remarkably increase the atp level of microbial system by about 4 times fig 5d which would provide more energy for bio denitrification 3 4 mechanism for artificial strengthen of denitrification to give deeper understand on how co c3n4 c facilitated electron transfer energy generation and enhanced denitrifying enzymes activities multi omics approaches including transcriptomics and metabolic analysis were performed firstly transcriptions differential analysis was carried out and there were in total 1162 differentially expressed genes absolute fold change 2 and p 0 05 figure s16 the different values of pearson correlation coefficients between samples indicated that the presence of co c3n4 c brought about significant influences on p denitrificans the transcriptomics results were mapped to gene ontology go database figure s17 and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg figure s18 for ontology and pathway annotations go annotations showed genes were different in transmembrane transporter activity atpase activity atp binding cassette abc transporter complex and catalytic activity which suggested highly active transmembrane process and energy metabolism in response to co c3n4 c stimulations similar results were obtained in kegg annotations as for the metabolism class most up regulated genes were affiliated with carbohydrate energy and amino acid metabolism implying the active membrane transport might arouse for these metabolic activities these results could well support the enhanced atp level and carbon metabolism in fig 5 considering the importance of iron element in the denitrifying enzymes and electron transport chains we analyzed the transcription of relevant key genes fig 6 two groups were successfully clustered indicating the variance in iron related gene expression pattern five up regulated iron abc transporters could well explain the elevated iron uptake of p denitrificans and up regulated activities of denitrifying enzymes figure s15 and fig 5c protocatechuate 3 4 dioxygenase is an important enzyme in the correlation of aromatic and hydroaromatic compounds arvay et al 2021 barbe et al 2004 it needs to bind with fe3 for function the distinguished high expression level of its two subunits corresponded with the signal of aromatic like substances in 3d eem fig 4 other genes presented in fig 6 possess iron sulfur clusters important components of protein for electron transfer bandyopadhyay et al 2008 in various activities such as denitrification bertero et al 2003 photosynthesis kang et al 2021 and sulfatase post transcriptional modification benjdia et al 2008 according to the other expression patterns the increased iron uptake stimulated by co c3n4 c might account for promoting denitrification eo213 rs25820 heme biosynthesis eo213 rs02830 and energy conversion eo213 rs15240 having revealed the changes of metatranscriptomics we investigated the material involved metabolism in denitrifying bacteria via untargeted metabolomic techniques a total of 529 metabolites in p denitrificans were identified using lc ms multivariate sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da shows mono bacteria group was well separated from the coupled group figure s19 indicating co c3n4 c altered the metabolism processes of denitrifying bacteria among these metabolites 322 remarkably distinguishing p 0 05 compounds between two groups with pls da score 0 1 were selected as a metabolic set in the following studies and they can be classified into seven categories figure s20 microbes are instinctively to regulate metabolic pathways in face of environmental stress han et al 2021 the metabolic pathways and biological effects of above selected metabolites were determined by kegg pathway enrichment analysis as shown in fig 7 pathways with lower p value and higher enrichment ratio are identified as essential metabolic pathways the most significant metabolic pathway was arginine biosynthesis in which four metabolites including l glutamate n acetyl l glutamic acid n acetyl l glutamate 5 semialdehyde and l glutamic acid were significantly increased in the presence of co c3n4 c fig 8 a indicating the high activity of this metabolism process arginine an antioxidant was synthesized along with urea cycle fig 8c could scavenge free radicals to relieve oxidative stress fang et al 2002 implying the alteration of p denitrificans in response to abiotic materials therefore p denitrificans were undamaged with integrated membrane structure in fig 3g besides pantothenate and coenzyme a coa biosynthesis is another distinguish pathway enriched in the metabolic set fig 7 coa is a precursor for the synthesis of acetyl coa which played major role in initiating tca cycle chen et al 2020 acetyl coa can be synthesized from fatty acid oxidation or the oxidation of amino acids tryptophan martínez reyes and chandel 2020 agreed with the fluctuant compounds in amino acids metabolism figure s21 and increased fluorescence intensity of eps in region ⅳ fig 5e apart from promoter several key intermediates in the tca cycle were obviously increased on exposure of co c3n4 c including pyruvate acely coa citric acid and glutamic acid chen et al 2020 fig 8b indicating that tca cycle was enhanced the byproduct of arginine synthesis fumarate also accelerated this cycle reaction theoretically 3 nadh and 1 fadh2 equivalent to 10 atp are generated in one biochemical cycle process xie and wang 1996 thus the enhanced tca cycle would supply more electrons and energy for biological denitrification especially from no2 n to n2 confirming the elevated levels of nadh and atp were original from more activated tca cycle pathway furthermore tca cycle intermediates which are important for biosynthesis can also act as signaling molecules to control cell fate and function for example post translational modifications martínez reyes and chandel 2020 glutamic acid is converted into α ketoglutarate fig 8c a metabolite which was correlated with the emergence and abundance of denitrifying genes including napa narg nosz and norb emmanuel et al 2019 all the above results demonstrated that co c3n4 c likely boosted denitrification processes via regulating the expression of related enzymes and the adaption of related metabolic pathways 4 conclusions in summary co c3n4 c was introduced to construct a semi biological system for efficient denitrification the no3 n was almost removed at given time with little harmful intermediates no2 n and n2o n accumulation and emission the underlying mechanism of co c3n4 c assisted enhancement of bio denitrification was fully explored on exposure to co c3n4 c denitrifying bacteria suffered from slight oxidative stress without damage to morphology and viability whereas the intracellular metabolism was dramatically boosted facilitating electron transfer energy supply and eps secretion the intracellular iron level was elevated with more eps was secreted which increased denitrification reductase activities these results provide a novel application of carbon nitride for environmental remediation in the absence of light irradiation and give a deep understand of biophysicochemical interactions at the nano bio interface declaration of

15962,it is generally believed that the ability of nanoplastics nps to mobilize other contaminants is due to direct adsorption however this intuitive belief is questioned in this study when it comes to a historically contaminated soil where mining activities since 1958 have resulted in arsenic as and cadmium cd enrichment negatively charged polystyrene ps nps were used in this study which should theoretically stimulate cd metal cation instead of as negatively charged oxyanion leaching if direct adsorption accounted for co transport surprisingly ps nps enhanced the leaching of as by up to over 5 times p value 0 05 but had almost no effect on cd leaching p value 0 05 a novel indirect displacement model was therefore developed to describe the phenomenon of enhanced as leaching it has been

accumulation of plastics in the environment has raised global concern macleod et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 it is estimated that 2200 tg of produced plastic carbon was in use whereas 4100 tg were discarded to the open environment altogether accounting for 6300 tg accumulation that had exceeded human and total animal biomass stubbins et al 2021 although initial interest in plastic research stems from its accumulation in the ocean it is now clear that plastic also poses a threat to terrestrial ecosystems dioses salinas et al 2020 stubbins et al 2021 after entering the soil environment microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps may either be integrated semi permanently into the soil matrix prior to full mineralization maclean et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 or migrate vertically to deeper soils and horizontally to the rhizosphere causing potential threats to both drinking water and food security li et al 2020 ren et al 2021 wang et al 2022a worse still the well developed porous structure and surface functional groups of these tiny polymer particles makes it possible to adsorb considerable amounts of other contaminants bank et al 2020 bradney et al 2019 including organic molecules such as fullerene dong et al 2019 bisphenol a cortés arriagada 2021 and pyrene liu et al 2018 and heavy metals such as cu sun et al 2022 cd fan et al 2021 and pb lin et al 2021b work in aquatic systems on the basis of batch adsorption isotherm and kinetics studies as well as surface characterization methods such as sem xps and ftir analyzes similar results have been reported from previous studies specifically that mps and nps can bind significant amounts of other contaminants which may pose serious threats to aquatic ecosystems however none of these previous observations can directly be used to assess the risks associated with mps nps in soil since the critical role of contaminated soil matrices has been neglected to what extent these previous observations reflect actual plastic contaminant interactions in soil remains unclear we therefore need to ask if in the natural soil environment mps nps still largely interact with contaminants in that direct way observed in aqueous media among various soil contaminants metal loid s are one of the most serious threats of land degradation in china spreading over tens of millions of the nations agricultural land jin et al 2021 yang et al 2022 centuries or decades of mining smelting manufacturing activities use of metal loid rich agrochemicals plus natural weathering of metal loid rich parent rocks are all potential sources of metal loid accumulation in natural soils hou et al 2020 wang et al 2021b risks associated with metal loid contamination in soil is directly linked with their mobilization during rainfall events labile pools e g exchangeable forms and those bound to carbonates tend to desorb and solubilize from solid matrix to pore water during rainfall leaching whereas recalcitrant ones those bound to fe and mn hydr oxides and silicate minerals would be retained in soil rendering much lower mobility alloway 2012 caporale and violante 2016 tessier et al 1979 considering the wide distribution and overlap of soil plastic and metal loid contamination this study explores how nps affect metal loid i e as and cd leaching from a natural soil surprisingly we find that nps did not stimulate cd leaching but greatly enhanced leaching of metalloid as it s hypothesized that nps facilitated as leaching via an indirect manner instead of direct adsorption an indirect displacement model is therefore put forward which can well depict this phenomenon furthermore effects of uv irradiation on metalloid release enhancement are also examined given that photochemical aging is a major cause of plastic weathering prior to its final deposition to soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design historically contaminated agricultural soil was collected during a field survey in january 2020 in a catchment in southwest china where mining activities since the late 1950s have led to as and cd accumulation which were 7 0 and 10 6 times that of the national risk control standard respectively detailed soil properties and soil characterization methods are provided in supplementary material table s1 text s1 ps nps aqueous suspension 2 5 w w were purchased from baseline chromtech research centre tianjin china and subjected to uv irradiation simulating the effects of atmospheric photochemical oxidation on np facilitated metal loid leaching text s2 after crushing and sieving 2 mm soil was packed into glass columns and subjected to leaching tests fig s1 text s3 a total of 8 year rainfall induced metal loid leaching was simulated detailed experimental design is presented in the supplementary material text s1 s3 2 2 indirect displacement model establishment 2 2 1 background metal loid leaching pattern without nps metals and metalloids accumulate in soil as different geochemical fractions alloway 2012 highly labile pools such as water soluble and acid soluble fractions can be easily leached into pore water in comparison less labile pools including those bound with metal oxides and soil organic matter and the recalcitrant pool which is bound to crystal structure of soil primary and secondary minerals can hardly be leached out in nature palansooriya et al 2020 tessier et al 1979 it is noteworthy that redistribution among geochemical fractions occurs when metal loid s contaminate the soil for instance soluble fractions of metal loid s are abundant in water bodies contaminated by industrial and mining wastewater which will adsorb to the soil solid matrix during wastewater irrigation or flooding events and gradually redistribute into less labile and recalcitrant pools with time alloway 2012 han et al 2021 for historically contaminated soils enriched with heavy metals and metalloids one should bear in mind that these elements may have entered the soil environment decades or centuries ago brown et al 1999 wang et al 2020 which had already been incorporated into soil primary and secondary silicate minerals recalcitrant organic matter and metal oxides alloway 2012 brown et al 1999 tack and verloo 1995 rendering much lower leachability and mobility as compared with newly introduced contaminants kim et al 2015 rao et al 2008 the labile fraction of metal loid s may only account for a small proportion as is the case in this study fig s2 during rainfall events labile fraction of these elements solubilize in soil pore water thus migrating to deeper soil layers with infiltrated water flow brady and weil 2017 soil pore volume pv ml can be calculated with the following equation eq 1 1 p v n v where n is soil porosity dimensionless v is soil volume cm3 the amount of water penetrating soil columns can be expressed as the number of pore volumes n p v dimensionless eq 2 2 n p v v r a i n n v where v r a i n is the volume of rain ml an equilibrium partition assumption was adopted here where solid liquid partitioning reaches equilibrium during rainfall induced infiltration which was also widely adopted by previous studies degryse et al 2009 elzinga et al 1999 hou et al 2013 eq 3 3 q e k f c e α where q e is the solid phase remaining concentration of a certain element at equilibrium mg kg 1 c e is the liquid phase concentration of the element at equilibrium mg l 1 k f mg1 α kg 1 lα and α dimensionless are two constants note that although eq 3 shares the same form with the freundlich adsorption isotherm it actually depicts the release of metals from the soil a freundlich type isotherm is widely used to depict metal partition between soil and pore water degryse et al 2009 besides another widely used assumption is linear partition where the value of α is set to 1 allison j d and t l allison 2005 total metal loid concentration in soil before leaching c s o i l mg kg 1 can be measured following digestion text s1 leaching leads to metal loid loss whose proportion can be described as background released proportion without nps φ b k dimensionless therefore the solid phase remaining concentration in eq 3 can be calculated as c s o i l 1 φ b k the liquid phase concentration can also be calculated from the total leached mass m l e a c h mg and the total volume of the leachate v r a i n ml hence eq 3 can be rewritten where the relationship between the number of pore volume n p v and background released proportion without nps φ b k dimensionless are shown eq 4 4 c s o i l 1 φ b k

relationship between φ b k and n p v reveal with the following governing equation eq 5 5 1 φ b k φ b k α k f c s o i l α 1 ρ b α n α n p v α 0 the main focus of this study however is changes in metal loid leaching characteristics in the presence of nps which will be discussed in detail below 2 2 2 indirect displacement of nps although limited evidence from batch adsorption tests has shown that nps may adsorb with these toxic elements in aqueous solution directly davranche et al 2019 it is still unclear whether nps can facilitate metal loid transport directly in soil that is enriched with toxic elements due to historical anthropogenic activities based on discussions above we propose that nps will not directly facilitate metal loid leaching via adsorption but instead in an indirect manner acting with less labile pools of these elements section 2 2 1 it has long been established that electrostatic interactions play vital roles for the adsorption leaching pattern of metal loid s bound to soil organic matter benedetti et al 1996 tipping and hurley 1992 and minerals bowell 1994 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 hence it is assumed that oxyanions sharing the same surface charge with np will compete for soil available binding sites i e displacement by contrast for metal cations possessing a different charge np will not compete for binding sites it is assumed that when np attach onto a certain site oxyanion from these less labile pools that is originally bound electrostatically to this site will be released into soil solution eq 6 6 φ φ b k φ e h where φ e h is the enhanced leaching fraction dimensionless with the presence of nps φ is the total leached proportion 0 φ 1 of a certain metal loid as compared with its total concentration in soil for simplicity we assume that all sites are identical sharing the same metal np interaction patterns and that enhanced leaching of metal loid s is directly linked to the proportion of attached sites the higher the proportion of attached sites the higher the enhanced leaching will be eq 7 7 φ e h p where p is the proportion of np attached sites among all available sites in soil that can be theoretically attached it is of note that at the initial stage natural soil itself inevitably contains nps with np attached proportion being a constant p 0 which is usually below 0 001 section 3 the indirect displacement model is depicted as follows eq 8 8 d p d n p v k a t t p 1 p k e s c p where k a t t and k e s c are two key parameters dimensionless due to the fact that p is the attached proportion namely attachment factor and escape factor respectively eq 8 implies a competition between np attachment and np loss from a certain soil profile the rate of change in attached sites during leaching d p d n p v is depicted as a function of attachment rate of nps k a t t p 1 p and the leaching loss rate of nps k e s c p from a certain soil profile the rate of attachment is proportional to 1 the number of available vacant sites 1 p and 2 the number of nps in the system p which can detach from one site and attach to another one intra system transfer k e s c p represents the escape process during which nps leach from certain soil profile higher attached rate i e p also indicates higher probability of detachment and leaching integrating eq 8 one can obtain the attachment pattern of np also metalloid leaching pattern as shown by eq 7 9 k a t t d n p v k a t t k a t t k e s c 1 p k a t t k e s c k a t t 1 p d p 10 p k att k esc k att 1 k att k esc k att p 0 1 e k att k esc n pv the equilibrium value of p namely p e can be calculated when d p d n p v 0 which serves as a direct representative of the ability of nps to facilitate metalloid leaching eq 11 11 p e 1 k e s c k a t t underlying mechanisms controlling these factors will be discussed further section 3 2 3 mechanistic investigations to investigate whether metal loid s adsorbed directly onto nps batch adsorption tests were conducted in 200 mg l 1 np suspension at ph 7 with initial as or cd concentration being 0 1 mg l 1 after 24 h as and cd concentration in remaining solution was measured with icp ms after passing through 0 22 μm glass fiber filters besides batch partition tests with or without nps were conducted simulating metal partition between soil solid phase and pore water in brief fresh or aged nps 10 or 100 mg l 1 were prepared in 0 01 mol l 1 kno3 solution sauvé et al 2000 after that the contaminated soil was extracted with either np free solution or np containing solution at solid to liquid ratio 1 2 for 20 min during which labile as and cd are leached to the aqueous phase from soil this procedure simulates metal loid partition in a real soil profile where kno3 was used to induce dispersion of colloidal clay and soil organic matter sauvé et al 2000 aqueous phase as and cd concentrations were also measured with icp ms understanding the interactions between np particles and the soil matrix is fundamental to understand whether and how nps attach onto available soil sites in this context calculations were made using extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory compared with traditional dlvo theory that takes lifshitz van der waals lw and electrostatic double layer el interactions into account xdlvo calculations also consider lewis acid base ab interactions which can better depict np np and np soil interactions in porous media liu et al 2019 van oss 2008 detailed calculation methods are provided in supplementary material text s4 furthermore to seek direct evidence of indirect displacement soil profiles after simulated 8 year leaching were characterized with both field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem geminisem 500 zeiss germany and computed x ray microtomography imaging μct diondo d2 diondo gmbh germany 2 4 statistical analysis and quality control metal leaching experiments were conducted in triplicates with standard error values presented in figures note that the error propagation formula was used when converting original concentration data to the leached proportion values one way analysis of variance was used to examine differences among groups at the significance level of 0 05 fisher s lsd test plotting and modeling were performed with originpro 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoplastic enhanced as leaching via indirect displacement the background leaching pattern of as and cd followed a linear desorption mode fig s3 both fresh and aged np had little effect p value 0 05 on cd leaching fig 1 a but substantially stimulated as leaching p value 0 05 from historically contaminated soil fig 1b suggesting that indirect displacement rather than direct adsorption accounted for stimulated metal loid leaching fig 1c this mechanism is further explored in section 3 2 in particular uv aged nps with an initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 had the strongest effect on as mobilization for instance after simulated 8 year leaching total leached proportion from soil increased from 3 4 to 20 7 as compared with the background leaching group without np passing through fig 1b we observed a lag response of enhanced leaching fig 1b that only after 4 years simulated leaching corresponding npv 140 did the enhancement effect appear for all columns containing different amounts of soil the indirect displacement model could well depict as leaching patterns p value 0 001 for all fittings fig 2 table s3 when comparing nps ability for promoting as leaching a general trend of uv np 100 mg l 1 fresh np 100 mg l 1 fresh np 10 mg l 1 uv np 10 mg l 1 was observed fig 2 the attachment factor k a t t of nps ranged from 0 263 0 557 while escape factor k e s c for all experiments were smaller than attachment factor ranging from 0 163 0 521 suggesting that a considerable amount of nps will be retained during leaching which was well corroborated by outflow np concentrations fig s8 another parameter p 0 ranged from 1 92 10 6 3 77 10 4 revealing that the natural soil samples also contained nps attached onto metalloid arsenic s soil binding sites although this initially attached proportion was negligible table s3 most importantly the equilibrium value p e was calculated to be 0 0636 0 379 which was directly associated with both original inlet np concentration and soil mass the higher the initial concentration and soil mass the higher p e was obtained table s3 the crucial role of photochemical aging in enhancing the leaching of metalloids was also investigated for artificial rain containing high np concentration i e 100 mg l 1 uv irradiation greatly enhanced as leaching from the less labile pool as compared with fresh np fig 2 however when np concentration were much lower i e 10 mg l 1 the enhancement effect was reduced even leading to lower φ e h values compared to fresh nps fig 2 again aging had no effect on cd leaching from natural soil p value 0 05 fig 1a the underlying mechanisms leading to enhanced leaching is discussed in the following section 3 2 mechanistic insights first of all the key finding is that nps in soil pore water are more likely to heteroaggregate onto soil particles i e attachment rather than form homoaggregates in aqueous media fig 3 c f table 1 total energy barrier height for np np ϕ m n p n p was above 1200 kt 1294 kt for fresh nps 1239 kt for aged nps while that value for np soil ϕ m n p s o i l was much smaller for nps 296 kt for fresh nps 363 kt for aged nps suggesting that nps in the soil solution tend to deposit into soil particles more easily as compared with forming homoaggregates in soil pore water carstens et al 2019 shani et al 2008 wang et al 2013 lifshitz van der waals lw interactions are always attractive while electrostatic double layer el interactions are always repulsive fig 3c f gregory 1981 ohshima 2012 it is noteworthy that at shorter separation distances lewis acid base ab interactions played a vital role fig 3c f van oss 1993 van oss 2006 for instance the absolute value of interaction energies of ab interactions i e 2470 2870 kt at separation distance below 0 1 nm was 8 11 times that of el interactions i e 251 304 kt for a fresh np soil system fig 3e when it comes to aged np soil system the absolute values for ab interactions i e 294 342 kt were also slightly higher than that of el interactions i e 189 229 kt fig 3f it was due to the exponential relationship between separation distance and the ab interactions van oss 2008 text s4 the traditional dlvo theory assumed that the liquid where colloid were immersed was lyophobic however it is not true for soil porous media where hydration is a key process determining the environmental fate of a colloid van oss 1993 2008 previous studies investigating colloidal interactions in the soil porous media also observed a similar phenomenon that the crucial role of ab interactions must not be overlooked liu et al 2019 for both fresh and aged nps separation distance when total energy reaches maximum energy barrier in the homoaggregation mode d m n p n p were both smaller than that in the heteroaggregation mode d m n p s o i l fig 3c f table 1 which also confirms that ps nps tend to attach onto soil particles instead of forming aggregates as their ultimate fate in the soil solution brant and childress 2002 hoek and agarwal 2006 besides the relatively low d m n p s o i l value with a few nanometers for both fresh and aged nps also explained why there existed a lagging effect during first few years fig 1b according to xdlvo theory only when separation distance becomes smaller than d m n p s o i l could heteroaggregation occur thus trapping np particles onto soil surfaces van oss 2008 we suggest that at the initial stage nps passed through soil particles without reaching that critical distance however with continuous injection of np containing water flow the attached proportion p increased gradually during indirect displacement fig 2 making it much easier to reach d m n p s o i l secondly an important finding supporting indirect displacement is that nps did not interact with metal loid s directly in soil pore water via adsorption batch adsorption of cd and as by nps in aqueous solution suggested that adsorption did occur in aqueous solution adsorption capacity of cd and as for fresh nps were 0 098 mg g 1 and 0 0083 mg g 1 for aged nps were 0 054 mg g 1 and 0 037 mg g 1 respectively after 24 h in 0 5 mmol l 1 nacl the adsorption capacity value in this study was comparable with those previous works investigating adsorption phenomena between plastics and metal loid s whose adsorption capacities were summarized in table 2 most studies suggested that physical adsorption rather than chemical adsorption mechanisms accounted for plastic metal loid interaction table 2 however if adsorption were the main mechanism cd rather than as leaching would be stimulated due to higher adsorption capacity besides batch partition tests simulating metal loid equilibrium partition between soil pore water and solid matrix also suggested that no significant promoting effect was observed with nps fig s9 both findings suggest that direct adsorption did not account for enhanced leaching in this case instead attached nps competed with as in the less labile pool with available electrostatic binding sites which corroborated well with tessier sequential extraction results fig s2 that less labile pools of as including oxide bound and organic matter bound forms were leached out in the presence of nps furthermore aging caused much complexity and uncertainty in this system photochemical aging resulted in changes in physicochemical properties thus affecting displacement behaviors firstly surfaces of uv aged nps became much rougher figs s10 and s11 additionally surface oxidation occurred generating more co functional groups on the np surface figs 3a b and s12 it was attributed to the peeling effect of uv irradiation during which a surface layer was peeled off the bulk matrix tian et al 2019 changes in hydrodynamic diameter also confirmed this table 1 apart from becoming smaller uv aged np also had greater negative surface potential thus increasing its stability in solution table 1 however energy barrier height for homoaggregation in turn decreased which was likely due to the joint effect of decreasing surface potential and particle diameter and well as increasing hydrophilicity as confirmed by contact angle measurements in different systems to calculate interfacial tension values for np with young dupré equation and finally calculate hamaker constant table 1 text s4 aging did not reverse the trend that nps tend to attach to soil particles more easily as compared to forming homoaggregates in solution table 1 however aging changed the affinity of nps toward soil binding sites which can be described with the p e value table s3 for low concentration groups p e decreased suggesting φ e h value for aged np would be smaller while for high concentration groups p e increased suggesting φ e h value for aged np would be larger corroborating well with the experimental results fig 1b the decrease in p e value at low concentration was directly associated with the increase of ϕ m n p s o i l and decrease of d m n p s o i l making it harder for attachment table 1 fig 3c f while the reverse trend under a high original np concentration may be caused by other forces such as physical trapping i e straining the p e value was calculated with the attachment factor k a t t and escape factor k e s c from this model eq 10 the attachment factor is a direct representative of the probability of nps attaching onto soil binding sites which is a dependent on both original np concentrations and interaction energy barrier in contrast the escape factor is directly linked to total soil mass representing the probability of nps to escape from this system a linear trend was observed between soil mass and the k e s c value fig s13 table s4 direct evidence of displacement was also investigated via both fesem and μct fig 4 a single np attaching onto a single site fig 4a two nps attaching onto adjacent sites fig 4b a cluster of nps attaching onto a number of sites fig 4c and np that was not attached fig 4d were observed showing different displacement patterns the flow channels of soil can be quantified by counting its area by the auto threshold processing of the image j software after simulated 8 year leaching little change was observed for the flow channels as revealed by the percentage of blank area in a given profile was calculated to be 33 0 and 31 9 for columns after simulated 8 year leaching without and with nps respectively fig s14 supporting the indirect displacement hypothesis that np spheres only attached onto soil available sites but did not form homoaggregates in soil pore water which will block soil pores fig 4ef 3 3 environmental implications numerous studies have shown that nps interact with heavy metal loid s directly in aqueous media thus leading to the notion of np particles as adsorbents and carriers for several pollutants table 2 however results from this study suggested that direct adsorption cannot accurately depict np metal loid interactions in natural soils in a soil system with a solid phase consisting of organic matter and minerals an aqueous phase with pore water solutes and colloids as well as air in the unsaturated zone namely vadose zone in this case brady and weil 2017 np metal loid soil interactions are much more complicated findings from this study suggest that metal loid s sharing the same surface charges rather than opposite ones will be subjected to elevated risks of leaching in the presence of nps in this case nps served as the key to pandora s box boosting the leaching of these toxic elements after entering the soil environment although existing transport models such as the convection dispersion equation have provided a route to model solute transport in the vadose zone for specific contaminants radcliffe and simunek 2018 it is difficult to fully understand the interactions between nps and metalloids in that manner the indirect displacement model proposed in this study regards the np metal loid soil ternary system as a dynamic one from an ecological point of view rockwood 2015 where np and metal loid compete with each other for resources namely available sites for electrostatic interactions thus simplifying this complicated system while providing useful parameters describing how easily nps will attach or escape this system understanding np metal loid soil interactions is crucial for the risk assessment and mitigation of both np migration and metal loid leaching infiltration acts as an important process of incoming water i e precipitation causing contaminant to migrate to groundwater aquifers brady and weil 2017 we observed that both fresh nps and aged nps greatly accelerated as leaching from natural soil thus elevating the risks associated with contaminant transport although the formation of heteroaggregates with soil is usually regarded as an effective means to mitigate the risks results of this study suggest that this may lead to enhanced leaching of metalloids from less labile pools future modeling efforts of nps and other contaminants in soils should take this indirect interaction into account in addition effective approaches e g amendments that can simultaneously inhibit the migration of np and associated contaminants are worthy of further investigations it is also noteworthy that soil properties may affect np metal loid interactions unlike np metal loid interactions in the aqueous solution the critical role of soil matrix in this displacement phenomenon should be addressed future studies may explore the effects of different soil taxonomies textures aggregation behaviors organic matter contents and mineral compositions on this indirect displacement phenomenon for instance it was found that the partition coefficients of metal loid s in different soils may range between 4 and 5 orders of magnitude e g 2 00 20 000 l kg 1 for as n 21 1 26 100 000 l kg 1 for cd n 37 allison j d and t l allison 2005 when nps were added to different soils with such a big difference in metal loid mobility it could be expected that distinct interaction mechanisms may occur 4 conclusion in this study it was found that ps nps had little effect on cd leaching but greatly enhanced as leaching from historically contaminated soil indicating that indirect displacement i e between np and as for soil binding sites rather than direct adsorption accounted for this phenomenon the underlying mechanisms were explored via both theoretical calculations xdlvo and direct characterization i e sem and μct nps tended to deposit onto the soil matrix rather than form homoaggregates in pore water an indirect displacement model was developed to further depict this indirect interaction phenomenon which could be further integrated into transport modeling studies to better assess the risks associated with np facilitated metalloid leaching from natural soil environments

15962,it is generally believed that the ability of nanoplastics nps to mobilize other contaminants is due to direct adsorption however this intuitive belief is questioned in this study when it comes to a historically contaminated soil where mining activities since 1958 have resulted in arsenic as and cadmium cd enrichment negatively charged polystyrene ps nps were used in this study which should theoretically stimulate cd metal cation instead of as negatively charged oxyanion leaching if direct adsorption accounted for co transport surprisingly ps nps enhanced the leaching of as by up to over 5 times p value 0 05 but had almost no effect on cd leaching p value 0 05 a novel indirect displacement model was therefore developed to describe the phenomenon of enhanced as leaching it has been found that negatively charged nps interacted with as via competition for soil binding sites underlying mechanistic insights were further explored via both theoretical calculations with the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo approach and direct characterization using scanning electron microscopy sem and computed x ray microtomography μct showing binding sites and flow channels

stems from its accumulation in the ocean it is now clear that plastic also poses a threat to terrestrial ecosystems dioses salinas et al 2020 stubbins et al 2021 after entering the soil environment

structure and surface functional groups of these tiny polymer particles makes it possible to adsorb considerable amounts of other contaminants bank et al 2020 bradney et al 2019 including organic molecules such as fullerene dong et al 2019 bisphenol a cortés arriagada 2021 and pyrene liu et al 2018 and heavy metals such as cu sun et al 2022 cd fan et al 2021 and pb lin et al 2021b work in aquatic systems on the basis of batch adsorption isotherm and kinetics studies as well as surface characterization methods such as sem xps and ftir analyzes similar results have been reported from previous studies specifically that mps and nps can bind significant amounts of other contaminants which may pose serious threats to aquatic ecosystems however none of these previous observations can directly be used to assess the risks associated with mps nps in soil since the critical role of contaminated soil matrices has been neglected to what extent these previous observations reflect actual plastic contaminant interactions in soil remains unclear we therefore need to ask if in the natural soil environment mps nps still largely interact with contaminants in that direct way observed in aqueous media among various soil contaminants metal loid s are one of the most serious threats of land degradation in china spreading over tens of millions of the nations agricultural land jin et al 2021 yang et al 2022 centuries or decades of mining smelting manufacturing activities use of metal loid rich agrochemicals plus natural weathering of metal loid rich parent rocks are all potential sources of metal loid accumulation in natural soils hou et al 2020 wang et al 2021b risks associated with metal loid contamination in soil is directly linked with their mobilization during rainfall events labile pools e g exchangeable forms and those bound to carbonates tend to desorb and solubilize from solid matrix to pore water during rainfall leaching whereas recalcitrant ones those bound to

overlap of soil plastic and metal loid contamination this study explores how nps affect metal loid i e as and cd leaching from a natural soil surprisingly we find that nps did not stimulate cd leaching but greatly enhanced leaching of metalloid as it s hypothesized that nps facilitated as leaching via an indirect manner instead of direct adsorption an indirect displacement model is therefore put forward which can well depict this phenomenon furthermore effects of uv irradiation on metalloid release enhancement are also examined given that photochemical aging is a major cause of plastic weathering prior to its final deposition to soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design historically contaminated agricultural soil was collected during a field survey in january 2020 in a catchment in southwest china where mining activities since the late 1950s have led to as and cd accumulation which were 7 0 and 10 6 times that of the national risk control standard respectively detailed soil properties and soil characterization methods are provided in supplementary material table s1 text s1 ps nps aqueous suspension 2 5 w w were purchased from baseline chromtech research centre tianjin china and subjected to uv irradiation simulating the effects of atmospheric photochemical oxidation on np facilitated metal loid leaching text s2 after crushing and sieving 2 mm soil

supplementary material text s1 s3 2 2 indirect displacement model establishment 2 2 1 background metal loid leaching pattern without nps metals and metalloids accumulate in soil as different geochemical fractions alloway 2012 highly labile pools such as water soluble and acid soluble fractions can be easily leached into pore water in comparison less labile pools including those bound with metal oxides and soil organic matter and the recalcitrant pool which is bound to crystal structure of soil primary and secondary minerals can hardly be leached out in nature palansooriya et al 2020 tessier et al 1979 it is noteworthy that redistribution among geochemical fractions occurs when metal loid s contaminate the soil for instance soluble fractions of metal loid s are abundant in water bodies contaminated by industrial and mining wastewater which will adsorb to the soil solid matrix during wastewater irrigation or flooding events and gradually redistribute into less labile and recalcitrant pools with time alloway 2012 han et al 2021 for historically contaminated soils enriched with heavy metals and metalloids one should bear in mind that these elements may have entered the soil environment decades or centuries ago brown et al 1999 wang et al 2020 which had already been incorporated into soil primary and secondary silicate minerals recalcitrant organic matter and metal oxides alloway 2012 brown et al 1999 tack and verloo 1995 rendering much lower leachability and mobility as compared with newly introduced contaminants kim et al 2015 rao et al 2008 the labile fraction of metal loid s may only account for a small proportion as is the case in this study fig s2 during rainfall events labile fraction of these elements solubilize in soil pore water thus migrating to deeper soil layers with infiltrated water flow brady and weil 2017 soil pore volume pv ml can be calculated with the following equation eq 1 1 p v n v where n is soil porosity dimensionless v is soil volume cm3 the amount of water penetrating soil columns can be expressed as the number of pore volumes n p v dimensionless eq 2 2 n p v v r a i n n v where v r a i n is the volume of rain ml an equilibrium partition assumption was adopted here where solid liquid partitioning reaches equilibrium during rainfall induced infiltration which was also widely adopted by previous studies degryse et al 2009 elzinga et al 1999 hou et al 2013 eq 3 3 q e k f c e α where q e is the solid phase remaining concentration of a certain element at equilibrium mg kg 1 c e is the liquid phase concentration of the element at equilibrium mg l 1 k f mg1 α kg 1 lα and α dimensionless are two constants note that although eq 3 shares the same form with the freundlich adsorption isotherm it actually depicts the release of metals from the soil a freundlich type isotherm is widely used to depict metal partition between soil and pore water degryse et al 2009 besides another widely used assumption is linear partition where the value of α is set to 1 allison j d and t l allison 2005 total metal loid concentration in soil before leaching c s o i l mg kg 1 can be measured following digestion text s1 leaching leads to metal loid loss whose proportion can be described as background released proportion without nps φ b k dimensionless therefore the solid phase remaining concentration in eq 3 can be calculated as c s o i l 1 φ b k the liquid phase concentration can also be calculated from the total leached mass m l e a c h mg and the total volume of the leachate v r a i n ml hence eq 3 can be rewritten where the relationship between the number of pore volume n p v and background released proportion without nps φ b k dimensionless are shown eq 4 4 c s o i l 1 φ b k

relationship between φ b k and n p v reveal with the following governing equation eq 5 5 1 φ b k φ b k α k f c s o i l α 1 ρ b α n α n p v α 0 the main focus of this study however is changes in metal loid leaching characteristics in the presence of nps which will be discussed in detail below 2 2 2 indirect displacement of nps although limited evidence from batch adsorption tests has shown that nps may adsorb with these toxic elements in aqueous solution directly davranche et al 2019 it is still unclear whether nps can facilitate metal loid transport directly in soil that is enriched with toxic elements due to historical anthropogenic activities based on discussions above we propose that nps will not directly facilitate metal loid leaching via adsorption but instead in an indirect manner acting with less labile pools of these elements section 2 2 1 it has long been established that electrostatic interactions play vital roles for the adsorption leaching pattern of metal loid s bound to soil organic matter benedetti et al 1996 tipping and hurley 1992 and minerals bowell 1994 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 hence it is assumed that oxyanions sharing the same surface charge with np will compete for soil available binding sites i e displacement by contrast for metal cations possessing a different charge np will not compete for binding sites it is assumed that when np attach onto a certain site oxyanion from these less labile pools that is originally bound electrostatically to this site will be released into soil solution eq 6 6 φ φ b k φ e h where φ e h is the enhanced leaching fraction dimensionless with the presence of nps φ is the total leached proportion 0 φ 1 of a certain metal loid as compared with its total concentration in soil for simplicity we assume that all sites are identical sharing the same metal np interaction patterns and that enhanced leaching of metal loid s is directly linked to the proportion of attached sites the higher the proportion of attached sites the higher the enhanced leaching will be eq 7 7 φ e h p where p is the proportion of np attached sites among all available sites in soil that can be theoretically attached it is of note that at the initial stage natural soil itself inevitably contains nps with np attached proportion being a constant p 0 which is usually below 0 001 section 3 the indirect displacement model is depicted as follows eq 8 8 d p d n p v k a t t p 1 p k e s c p where k a t t and k e s c are two key parameters dimensionless due to the fact that p is the attached proportion namely attachment factor and escape factor respectively eq 8 implies a competition between np attachment and np loss from a certain soil profile the rate of change in attached sites during leaching d p d n p v is depicted as a function of attachment rate of nps k a t t p 1 p and the leaching loss rate of nps k e s c p from a certain soil profile the rate of attachment is proportional to 1 the number of available vacant sites 1 p and 2 the number of nps in the system p which can detach from one site and attach to another one intra system transfer k e s c p represents the escape process during which nps leach from certain soil profile higher attached rate i e p also indicates higher probability of detachment and leaching integrating eq 8 one can obtain the attachment pattern of np also metalloid leaching pattern as shown by eq 7 9 k a t t d n p v k a t t k a t t k e s c 1 p k a t t k e s c k a t t 1 p d p 10 p k att k esc k att 1 k att k esc k att p 0 1 e k att k esc n pv the equilibrium value of p namely p e can be calculated when d p d n p v 0 which serves as a direct representative of the ability of nps to facilitate metalloid leaching eq 11 11 p e 1 k e s c k a t t underlying mechanisms controlling these factors will be discussed further section 3 2 3 mechanistic investigations to investigate whether metal loid s adsorbed directly onto nps batch adsorption tests were conducted in 200 mg l 1 np suspension at ph 7 with initial as or cd concentration being 0 1 mg l 1 after 24 h as and cd concentration in remaining solution was measured with icp ms after passing through 0 22 μm glass fiber filters besides batch partition tests with or without nps were conducted simulating metal partition between soil solid phase and pore water in brief fresh or aged nps 10 or 100 mg l 1 were prepared in 0 01 mol l 1 kno3 solution sauvé et al 2000 after that the contaminated soil was extracted with either np free solution or np containing solution at solid to liquid ratio 1 2 for 20 min during which labile as and cd are leached to the aqueous phase from soil this procedure simulates metal loid partition in a real soil profile where kno3 was used to induce dispersion of colloidal clay and soil organic matter sauvé et al 2000 aqueous phase as and cd concentrations were also measured with icp ms understanding the interactions between np particles and the soil matrix is fundamental to understand whether and how nps attach onto available soil sites in this context calculations were made using extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory compared with traditional dlvo theory that takes lifshitz van der waals lw and electrostatic double layer el interactions into account xdlvo calculations also consider lewis acid base ab interactions which can better depict np np and np soil interactions in porous media liu et al 2019 van oss 2008 detailed calculation methods are provided in supplementary material text s4 furthermore to seek direct evidence of indirect displacement soil profiles after simulated 8 year leaching were characterized with both field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem geminisem 500 zeiss germany and computed x ray microtomography imaging μct diondo d2 diondo gmbh germany 2 4 statistical analysis and quality control metal leaching experiments were conducted in triplicates with standard error values presented in figures note that the error propagation formula was used when converting original concentration data to the leached proportion values one way analysis of variance was used to examine differences among groups at the significance level of 0 05 fisher s lsd test plotting and modeling were performed with originpro 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoplastic enhanced as leaching via indirect displacement the background leaching pattern of as and cd followed a linear desorption mode fig s3 both fresh and aged np had little effect p value 0 05 on cd leaching fig 1 a but substantially stimulated as leaching p value 0 05 from historically contaminated soil fig 1b suggesting that indirect displacement rather than direct adsorption accounted for stimulated metal loid leaching fig 1c this mechanism is further explored in section 3 2 in particular uv aged nps with an initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 had the strongest effect on as mobilization for instance after simulated 8 year leaching total leached proportion from soil increased from 3 4 to 20 7 as compared with the background leaching group without np passing through fig 1b we observed a lag response of enhanced leaching fig 1b that only after 4 years simulated leaching corresponding npv 140 did the enhancement effect appear for all columns containing different amounts of soil the indirect displacement model could well depict as leaching patterns p value 0 001 for all fittings fig 2 table s3 when comparing nps ability for promoting as leaching a general trend of uv np 100 mg l 1 fresh np 100 mg l 1 fresh np 10 mg l 1 uv np 10 mg l 1 was observed fig 2 the attachment factor k a t t of nps ranged from 0 263 0 557 while escape factor k e s c for all experiments were smaller than attachment factor ranging from 0 163 0 521 suggesting that a considerable amount of nps will be retained during leaching which was well corroborated by outflow np concentrations fig s8 another parameter p 0 ranged from 1 92 10 6 3 77 10 4 revealing that the natural soil samples also contained nps attached onto metalloid arsenic s soil binding sites although this initially attached proportion was negligible table s3 most importantly the equilibrium value p e was calculated to be 0 0636 0 379 which was directly associated with both original inlet np concentration and soil mass the higher the initial concentration and soil mass the higher p e was obtained table s3 the crucial role of photochemical aging in enhancing the leaching of metalloids was also investigated for artificial rain containing high np concentration i e 100 mg l 1 uv irradiation greatly enhanced as leaching from the less labile pool as compared with fresh np fig 2 however when np concentration were much lower i e 10 mg l 1 the enhancement effect was reduced even leading to lower φ e h values compared to fresh nps fig 2 again aging had no effect on cd leaching from natural soil p value 0 05 fig 1a the underlying mechanisms leading to enhanced leaching is discussed in the following section 3 2 mechanistic insights first of all the key finding is that nps in soil pore water are more likely to heteroaggregate onto soil particles i e attachment rather than form homoaggregates in aqueous media fig 3 c f table 1 total energy barrier height for np np ϕ m n p n p was above 1200 kt 1294 kt for fresh nps 1239 kt for aged nps while that value for np soil ϕ m n p s o i l was much smaller for nps 296 kt for fresh nps 363 kt for aged nps suggesting that nps in the soil solution tend to deposit into soil particles more easily as compared with forming homoaggregates in soil pore water carstens et al 2019 shani et al 2008 wang et al 2013 lifshitz van der waals lw interactions are always attractive while electrostatic double layer el interactions are always repulsive fig 3c f gregory 1981 ohshima 2012 it is noteworthy that at shorter separation distances lewis acid base ab interactions played a vital role fig 3c f van oss 1993 van oss 2006 for instance the absolute value of interaction energies of ab interactions i e 2470 2870 kt at separation distance below 0 1 nm was 8 11 times that of el interactions i e 251 304 kt for a fresh np soil system fig 3e when it comes to aged np soil system the absolute values for ab interactions i e 294 342 kt were also slightly higher than that of el interactions i e 189 229 kt fig 3f it was due to the exponential relationship between separation distance and the ab interactions van oss 2008 text s4 the traditional dlvo theory assumed that the liquid where colloid were immersed was lyophobic however it is not true for soil porous media where hydration is a key process determining the environmental fate of a colloid van oss 1993 2008 previous studies investigating colloidal interactions in the soil porous media also observed a similar phenomenon that the crucial role of ab interactions must not be overlooked liu et al 2019 for both fresh and aged nps separation distance when total energy reaches maximum energy barrier in the homoaggregation mode d m n p n p were both smaller than that in the heteroaggregation mode d m n p s o i l fig 3c f table 1 which also confirms that ps nps tend to attach onto soil particles instead of forming aggregates as their ultimate fate in the soil solution brant and childress 2002 hoek and agarwal 2006 besides the relatively low d m n p s o i l value with a few nanometers for both fresh and aged nps also explained why there existed a lagging effect during first few years fig 1b according to xdlvo theory only when separation distance becomes smaller than d m n p s o i l could heteroaggregation occur thus trapping np particles onto soil surfaces van oss 2008 we suggest that at the initial stage nps passed through soil particles without reaching that critical distance however with continuous injection of np containing water flow the attached proportion p increased gradually during indirect displacement fig 2 making it much easier to reach d m n p s o i l secondly an important finding supporting indirect displacement is that nps did not interact with metal loid s directly in soil pore water via adsorption batch adsorption of cd and as by nps in aqueous solution suggested that adsorption did occur in aqueous solution adsorption capacity of cd and as for fresh nps were 0 098 mg g 1 and 0 0083 mg g 1 for aged nps were 0 054 mg g 1 and 0 037 mg g 1 respectively after 24 h in 0 5 mmol l 1 nacl the adsorption capacity value in this study was comparable with those previous works investigating adsorption phenomena between plastics and metal loid s whose adsorption capacities were summarized in table 2 most studies suggested that physical adsorption rather than chemical adsorption mechanisms accounted for plastic metal loid interaction table 2 however if adsorption were the main mechanism cd rather than as leaching would be stimulated due to higher adsorption capacity besides batch partition tests simulating metal loid equilibrium partition between soil pore water and solid matrix also suggested that no significant promoting effect was observed with nps fig s9 both findings suggest that direct adsorption did not account for enhanced leaching in this case instead attached nps competed with as in the less labile pool with available electrostatic binding sites which corroborated well with tessier sequential extraction results fig s2 that less labile pools of as including oxide bound and organic matter bound forms were leached out in the presence of nps furthermore aging caused much complexity and uncertainty in this system photochemical aging resulted in changes in physicochemical properties thus affecting displacement behaviors firstly surfaces of uv aged nps became much rougher figs s10 and s11 additionally surface oxidation occurred generating more co functional groups on the np surface figs 3a b and s12 it was attributed to the peeling effect of uv irradiation during which a surface layer was peeled off the bulk matrix tian et al 2019 changes in hydrodynamic diameter also confirmed this table 1 apart from becoming smaller uv aged np also had greater negative surface potential thus increasing its stability in solution table 1 however energy barrier height for homoaggregation in turn decreased which was likely due to the joint effect of decreasing surface potential and particle diameter and well as increasing hydrophilicity as confirmed by contact angle measurements in different systems to calculate interfacial tension values for np with young dupré equation and finally calculate hamaker constant table 1 text s4 aging did not reverse the trend that nps tend to attach to soil particles more easily as compared to forming homoaggregates in solution table 1 however aging changed the affinity of nps toward soil binding sites which can be described with the p e value table s3 for low concentration groups p e decreased suggesting φ e h value for aged np would be smaller while for high concentration groups p e increased suggesting φ e h value for aged np would be larger corroborating well with the experimental results fig 1b the decrease in p e value at low concentration was directly associated with the increase of ϕ m n p s o i l and decrease of d m n p s o i l making it harder for attachment table 1 fig 3c f while the reverse trend under a high original np concentration may be caused by other forces such as physical trapping i e straining the p e value was calculated with the attachment factor k a t t and escape factor k e s c from this model eq 10 the attachment factor is a direct representative of the probability of nps attaching onto soil binding sites which is a dependent on both original np concentrations and interaction energy barrier in contrast the escape factor is directly linked to total soil mass representing the probability of nps to escape from this system a linear trend was observed between soil mass and the k e s c value fig s13 table s4 direct evidence of displacement was also investigated via both fesem and μct fig 4 a single np attaching onto a single site fig 4a two nps attaching onto adjacent sites fig 4b a cluster of nps attaching onto a number of sites fig 4c and np that was not attached fig 4d were observed showing different displacement patterns the flow channels of soil can be quantified by counting its area by the auto threshold processing of the image j software after simulated 8 year leaching little change was observed for the flow channels as revealed by the percentage of blank area in a given profile was calculated to be 33 0 and 31 9 for columns after simulated 8 year leaching without and with nps respectively fig s14 supporting the indirect displacement hypothesis that np spheres only attached onto soil available sites but did not form homoaggregates in soil pore water which will block soil pores fig 4ef 3 3 environmental implications numerous studies have shown that nps interact with heavy metal loid s directly in aqueous media thus leading to the notion of np particles as adsorbents and carriers for several pollutants table 2 however results from this study suggested that direct adsorption cannot accurately depict np metal loid interactions in natural soils in a soil system with a solid phase consisting of organic matter and minerals an aqueous phase with pore water solutes and colloids as well as air in the unsaturated zone namely vadose zone in this case brady and weil 2017 np metal loid soil interactions are much more complicated findings from this study suggest that metal loid s sharing the same surface charges rather than opposite ones will be subjected to elevated risks of leaching in the presence of nps in this case nps served as the key to pandora s box boosting the leaching of these toxic elements after entering the soil environment although existing transport models such as the convection dispersion equation have provided a route to model solute transport in the vadose zone for specific contaminants radcliffe and simunek 2018 it is difficult to fully understand the interactions between nps and metalloids in that manner the indirect displacement model proposed in this study regards the np metal loid soil ternary system as a dynamic one from an ecological point of view rockwood 2015 where np and metal loid compete with each other for resources namely available sites for electrostatic interactions thus simplifying this complicated system while providing useful parameters describing how easily nps will attach or escape this system understanding np metal loid soil interactions is crucial for the risk assessment and mitigation of both np migration and metal loid leaching infiltration acts as an important process of incoming water i e precipitation causing contaminant to migrate to groundwater aquifers brady and weil 2017 we observed that both fresh nps and aged nps greatly accelerated as leaching from natural soil thus elevating the risks associated with contaminant transport although the formation of heteroaggregates with soil is usually regarded as an effective means to mitigate the risks results of this study suggest that this may lead to enhanced leaching of metalloids from less labile pools future modeling efforts of nps and other contaminants in soils should take this indirect interaction into account in addition effective approaches e g amendments that can simultaneously inhibit the migration of np and associated contaminants are worthy of further investigations it is also noteworthy that soil properties may affect np metal loid interactions unlike np metal loid interactions in the aqueous solution the critical role of soil matrix in this displacement phenomenon should be addressed future studies may explore the effects of different soil taxonomies textures aggregation behaviors organic matter contents and mineral compositions on this indirect displacement phenomenon for instance it was found that the partition coefficients of metal loid s in different soils may range between 4 and 5 orders of magnitude e g 2 00 20 000 l kg 1 for as n 21 1 26 100 000 l kg 1 for cd n 37 allison j d and t l allison 2005 when nps were added to different soils with such a big difference in metal loid mobility it could be expected that distinct interaction mechanisms may occur 4 conclusion in this study it was found that ps nps had little effect on cd leaching but greatly enhanced as leaching from historically contaminated soil indicating that indirect displacement i e between np and as for soil binding sites rather than direct adsorption accounted for this phenomenon the underlying mechanisms were explored via both theoretical calculations xdlvo and direct characterization i e sem and μct nps tended to deposit onto the soil matrix rather than form homoaggregates in pore water an indirect displacement model was developed to further depict this indirect interaction phenomenon which could be further integrated into transport modeling studies to better assess the risks associated with np facilitated metalloid leaching from natural soil environments

15963,because of their low cost and high bacterial interception efficiency large scale membrane separation technologies like microfiltration mf have been widely implemented for water disinfection however lack of antibacterial ability and low sustainability are two major drawbacks of most petroleum based mf membranes which are normally associated with hazardous issues including biofouling and nonbiodegradable waste in this work abundant animal hides which are by products of the meat processing industry were proposed as raw materials to fabricate a sustainable mf membrane due to their natural hierarchical and renewable collagen fibrous network cfn with inherent biodegradability after the removal of non collagen compositions from animal hides such as hair and fat through a facile pretreating process base on green chemistry principles a thin cfn based membrane cfn m with a similar micropore size to that of commercial mf membranes could be produced furthermore inspired by conventional leather tanning technology tannic acids ta were selected as plant polyphenol tanning agent to modify collagen fibers based on tanning chemistry to improve the thermal stability of cfn m

millions of deaths annually due to the consumption of contaminated water containing pathogenic microorganisms caicedo et al 2019 tang et al 2019 particularly the global population growth and the ongoing covid 19 pandemic have undoubtedly heightened the challenge of securing access to safe water since the 21st century membrane separation technologies have been applied in large scale

traditional disinfection technologies such as the addition of a chemical disinfectant the water disinfection mechanism of membrane technology is dependent on the size exclusion of the membrane s porous structure that can physically remove a wide variety of contaminants through filtration which is basically a chemical free process castro muñoz et al 2021 tan et al 2018b tunuguntla et al 2017 wang et al 2016 particularly the developed microfiltration mf membrane owing to its microporous structure with superior filtration flux and high bacterial interception efficiency has been regarded as one of the most mature low cost and energy saving technologies for water disinfection in developing communities kumar et al 2021 ling et al 2017 zeng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 although mf membrane technology has been widely implemented for centralized water treatment over the past 20 years drawbacks have gradually been exposed in its rapid development process kang et al 2020 razali et al 2015 wang et al 2020c from the perspective of the entire life cycle low sustainability is considered to be the major drawback of mf membrane xie et al 2019 castro muñoz 2020b i since the birth of membrane technology due to inevitable contact with microbials and lack of antibacterial activity biofouling on membrane surfaces has consistently been a bottleneck that not only restricts sustainable water purification but can also become a potential pathogenic contaminant risk liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020b ii secondly most of the raw materials for manufacturing mf membranes such as polysulfone psu poly ether sulfone pesu and poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf ji et al 2020 are nonbiodegradable petroleum based polymers which are difficult to recycle and are typically associated with disposal burdens at the end of their lifetime leading to hazardous plastic pollution george et al 2001 nataraj et al 2012 tan et al 2018a and iii large amounts of polar organic solvents are commonly involved in the phase inversion fabrication processes of porous mf membranes which pose a series of health and environmental risks an et al 2011 baig et al 2020 figoli et al 2014 thus in light of the improved sustainability of membrane technology attention should be given to the next generation of sustainable membranes from the green chemistry principle anastas et al 2010 bolisetty et al 2019 huang et al

survivability and morphologies of bacteria the long term antifouling property of samples were determined by the change of water flux and sem images the more details could be found in materials and methods of supporting information si 3 result and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of tannic acid cross linked collagen fibrous network membranes ta cfn ms as shown in fig 1a b thin cfn ms with a white color and an average thickness of 0 24 mm were prepared by pretreatment processes including unhairing liming enzyme bating and shaving at this stage the non collagen compositions were completely removed from the natural skin leading to the formation of a microporous and hierarchical network structure fig 1c d in the sem images the typical cross striation pattern of collagen fibrils with a d period of 67 nm can be clearly observed and an average diameter of collagen fibrils in fig 1e was calculated to be 71 nm in the next step tas were used to modify the cfn m through cross linking modification according to conventional tanning theory as illustrated in fig 1a the cross linking is formed due to the hydrogen bond interaction and schiff base reaction of tas with collagen fibers yielding a ta cfn m sample with a brown color it is worth noting that the ta cfn m exhibited a larger average thickness 0 26 mm than that of the pristine cfn m because of the looser collagen fiber network fig 1f g h indicating the cross linking tanning effect based on the molecular engineering of ta more importantly the average diameter of collagen fibrils of the ta cfn m increased to 124 nm fig 1i subsequently the cross linking effect enables ta cfn m to exhibit a higher porosity 56 and a much lower average pore size 8 μm than that of a pristine cfn m 44 20 μm which is due to the dispersal of collagen fibers and collagen fibrils as presented in fig 1j k owing to the highly microporous hierarchical architecture and small pore size it was expected that the ta cfn m could be used for mf moreover the flexibility of the ta cfn m 8 1 mm was higher than that of the pristine cfn m 6 6 mm fig 1l which is suitable for the application of spiral wound membrane modules additionally the tensile stress of the ta cfn m was about 9 0 mpa fig 1m which is more than twice that of the commercial mixed cellulose esters mce membrane 4 1 mpa millipore gswp the enhancement of the mechanical properties could be ascribed to the cross linking effect of the ta which involved 3d network deformation and collagen fibril stretch the results implied that ta cfn ms have the potential to be used as commercial mf membranes 3 2 robust mechanical and chemical properties of ta cfn m to further investigate the functionalization process the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m were studied in detail as shown in fig 2a compared with the pristine cfn m the n 1 s signal of ta cfn m was noticeably reduced which can be indicated by the depletion of amino groups on the cfn m moreover the high resolution spectrum of n 1 s for cfn m in fig 2b presents an individual characteristic peak at 398 1 ev which may be ascribed to the aliphatic cn amino groups and amido bond of cfn m on the contrary the n 1 s spectrum of the ta cfn m was deconvoluted into three separated peaks at 398 7 401 0 and 401 9 ev fig 2c which could be caused by the aliphatic cn of cfn m the aromatic c n of the schiff base and the aromatic cn from the michael addition the results implied that the tas cross linked with collagen through michael addition and schiff base reactions furthermore the surface chemistry of the ta cfn m has been characterized using atr ftir spectroscopy as shown in fig 2d the absorbance intensity at 1200 cm 1 increased corresponding to the hydroxyl oh stretch after the introduction of phenolic oh groups the peak at 1615 cm 1 is assigned to the c n stretching implying schiff base formation meanwhile xrd patterns of the pristine cfn m and the ta cfn m were performed and exhibited in fig 2e compared with the pristine cfn m the characteristic peak of collagen at 19 8 d 0 44 nm becomes smoother in the ta cfn m due to the introduction of ta in addition the ta cfn m was comparatively stable in an aqueous solution and exhibited few oxidizing reactions therefore it is not considered to generate disinfection by products dbps after leaching the ta cfn m solution the content of ta in the filtrate was tested by uv vis absorbance spectrum and the resultant water showed a slight increase in total organic carbon toc 0 2 ppm and total dissolved solids tds 0 31 ppm in one day the leaching of tas from the ta cfn m was measured and displayed in fig 2f moreover the ta loading amount was determined to be 3 55 via the foline phenol reagent more importantly the dynamic immersing stability of the ta cfn m was evaluated as demonstrated in fig 2f the released tas were less than 0 5 μg day in a week exhibiting the outstanding durability of the ta cfn m the excellent water stability implied the potential application in water treatment thermal stability performances are important factors for water treatment membranes furthermore the hydrothermal stability of the pristine cfn m and the ta cfn m were evaluated by measuring the shrinkage temperature ts as shown in fig 2g the ts of the ta cfn m 85 ºc was much higher than that of the pristine cfn m 70 ºc which exhibited the robust cross linking of tas moreover as demonstrated from thermogravimetric analysis tga in fig 2h the ta cfn m presented two typical weight loss stages with the increase in temperature overall the decomposition temperature of the ta cfn m 333 7 ºc was higher than that of the pristine cfn m 327 3 ºc the differential scanning calorimetry dsc results exhibited by the ta cfn m 83 4 ºc showed higher thermal stability than that of the pristine cfn m 68 6 ºc fig 2i 3 3 assessment of the microfiltration performance of sub micro particles as mf membranes as a proof of concept the top surface morphologies and roughnesses of the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m were detected by lscm as presented in fig 3a the top surface of the pristine cfn m with an average roughness 17 3 μm was quite dense and rough as exhibited in fig 3b in comparison the ta cfn m presented a smoother surface and the average roughness decreased to 12 1 μm hydrophilicity and water flux are two important parameters to evaluate the capability of the mf membranes zhang et al 2016 tang et al 2020 the water contact angle wca was performed to assess the hydrophilicity of the ta cfn m as shown in fig 3c the original wca of the pristine cfn m was 64 8 and remained unchanged in 20 s exhibiting relative hydrophobicity and poor wettability on the contrary the wca of the ta cfn m was measured with the original contact angle decreasing from 26 7 to 0 in 20 s therefore it may be concluded that the hydrophilicity of the ta cfn m was predominantly attributed to the introduction of ta the water permeation flux of the pristine cfn m and the ta cfn m was studied with the results being shown in fig 3d the ta cross linking of the cfn m exhibited a positive impact on water flux via gravity driven operation 10 cm 1 kpa under the fixed transmembrane pressure of 1 kpa the water permeation flux of the pristine cfn m and the ta cfn m was 138 4 12 0 and 174 5 9 4 l m2 h p values 0 05 respectively therefore the above results proved that the modifications enhanced the water transport performance of the ta cfn m to realize commercial application the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m with a large scale size of 70 50 cm2 were prepared and used as the mf membrane for the removal of micro scale tio2 microparticles from a liquid solution fig 3e f tang et al 2019 as shown in fig 3g the ta cfn m exhibited a high rejection efficiency 99 for obstructing micro scale tio2 microparticles under robust water permeation flux 170 l m 2 h 1 the high removal efficiency of the ta cfn m could be attributed to its 3d hierarchical collagen fiber network structure furthermore the removal efficiency decreased moderately with the increase in concentration in the tio2 suspension fig 3g which may be due to the rapid formation of filter cakes in dead end filtration systems to investigate the microcosmic separation processes of the ta cfn m the surface of the ta cfn m after filtration was observed by sem as shown in fig 3h the tio2 microparticles have been intercepted by and collected on the surface of the ta cfn m the results exhibited that the hydrophilic microporous structure of ta cfn m is conducive to removing micron scale contaminants such as microplastic particles tang et al 2020 3 4 assessment of the antibacterial performance and antibacterial mechanism exploration the adhered bacteria live or dead bacteria on membrane surfaces could cause serious membrane fouling zhang et al 2016 therefore the bacterial adhesion onto the surface of pristine cfn m and ta cfn m was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm fluorescent images of live dead staining assay displayed that only strong green fluorescence was observed in bacteria after coming into contact with the cfn m fig 4a in comparison the bacteria on the ta cfn m exhibited weak green fluorescence together with weak red fluorescence implying the excellent antibacterial and anti adhesive properties of the ta cfn m in addition the morphology of different bacteria was observed by sem after adhesion onto the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m as shown in the insert images of fig 4a many live bacteria adhered to the surface of pristine cfn m with intact and smooth surfaces in contrast few bacteria could be found on the surface of the ta cfn m implying the strong capability of bacterial anti adhesion according to previous studies guo et al 2021 liu et al 2016 yan et al 2020 ta has been demonstrated to display powerful antibacterial properties against many microorganisms through inhibiting the expression of proteins involved in the bacterial cell wall membrane synthesis and the biosynthesis of the cell constituents cell signaling and dna as illustrated in fig 4b the repel and kill strategy of the ta cfn m exhibited excellent anti adhesive and antibacterial abilities which can be ascribed to the gallol and catechol groups of ta castro muñoz 2020b moreover as shown in fig 4c the ta cfn m has a more negative charge zeta potential 6 4 mv than that of the pristine cfn m zeta potential 4 8 mv in a neutral aqueous solution ph 7 due to the dissociation of the phenolic hydroxyl group on the ta the anionic carboxyl groups on the surface of the ta cfn m could effectively repel bacterial adhesion via electrostatic repulsive forces in addition the relative reactive oxygen species ros level of the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m was marked via and measured using the fluorescent probe dcfh da as shown in fig 4d the ros level of the ta cfn m was much higher than that of the pristine cfn m this result indicated that the introduction of tas endowed the ta cfn m with excellent bactericidal properties firstly gallol groups may allow reduction reaction to occur with oxygen o2 to simultaneously generate ros hydrogen peroxide h2o2 afterward the formed h2o2 instantaneously releases from the ta cfn m to the contaminated water and the concentration of ros in the water remains at a high level according to previous studies guo et al 2021 liu et al 2016 xia et al 2017 yan et al 2020 ta can bind to bacterial proteins a kind of important intracellular component which inhibits the activity of bacterial enzymes and proves cytoplasmic leakage and cell membrane damage fig 4e demonstrates that the leakage of the bacterial protein with the ta cfn m rose dramatically in comparison with the cfn m implying its intrinsic antibacterial mechanism 3 5 water disinfection application and antifouling performance evaluation of ta cfn m to evaluate the effect of the water treatment the performances of the ta cfn m as a biocidal membrane were investigated zeng et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 5a different bacteria contaminated water 104 cfu ml 1 were considered as model bacteria containing water to assess the water disinfection performance of the ta cfn m the sem images of bacteria e coli s aureus mrsa and p aeruginosa were presented to assess the bacterial morphological changes before and after filtration by cfn m and ta cfn m figs 5a and s2 herein the four different bacteria e coli s aureus mrsa and p aeruginosa exhibited a plump and integrated state before filtration however the bacteria were observed with a shrunk and collapsed surface demonstrating the broken cell membrane during the filtration process as shown in figs 5b and s2 the filtrated bacteria were investigated as assessed with a live dead viability kit under an epifluorescent microscope numerous bacteria exhibited a great number of green dots before filtration and after filtration by cfn m meaning that most of the bacteria were alive on the contrary after being filtrated by the ta cfn m the bacteria showed plenty of red dots and a few green dots indicating the excellent biocidal activity of the ta cfn m the insert images of agar plates presented the bactericidal results of e coli s aureus mrsa and p aeruginosa cells and a few bacteria can be observed revealing the excellent performance of water disinfection of the ta cfn m via gravity driven operation the water disinfection performance log reduction value lrv of the cfn m 1 lrv and ta cfn m 3 lrv without the consumption of electricity is shown in fig 5c the results of four cyclic water disinfection assays proved that the bactericidal ability of the ta cfn m exhibited 3 lrv against e coli s aureus mrsa and p aeruginosa demonstrating the stability and reusability of ta cross linking fig 5d the results certified that the ta cfn m possessed robust reusability superior stability and excellent broad spectrum bacterial decontamination capability bacteria adhering onto the membrane surface could cause serious biofouling and even biofilm which could cause severe flux decline and affect the quality of the filtered water accordingly the anti biofilm performance of the commercial mce pristine cfn and ta cfn m was observed by sem after severe biofouling fig 6a the biofilms on the surface of the commercial mce and pristine cfn were thick and dense indicating the poor anti biofouling property in realistic applications on the contrary fewer bacteria adhered to the ta cfn m than that of the pristine cfn due to its excellent anti biofouling property which maintained a microporous structure for water transport furthermore the water flux and the bacteria were measured with the increase in filtration amount as observed in fig 6b the permeation flux of the ta cfn m remained at 150 l m 2 h 1 and the e coli were less than 10 cfu ml after being treated by the ta cfn m which meets the criterion of the who drinking water guideline less than 100 cfu ml dankovich and gray 2011 dankovich and smith 2014 liu et al 2016 in addition the adhered bacteria released from the pristine cfn and ta cfn m were investigated with the releasing time as exhibited in fig 6c the number of bacteria released from the pristine cfn 103 cfu ml was much higher than that of the ta cfn m 10 cfu ml the anti biofouling behavior of the commercial mce pristine cfn and ta cfn m was assessed by dynamic biofouling assay using simulated wastewater under gravity driven operation as shown in fig 6d the biofilm formed on the commercial mce and pristine cfn obstructed water transport leading to a great flux decline 90 and 70 in comparison the slight water flux decline less than 10 demonstrated that the ta cfn m acquired enhanced antifouling ability against wastewater the pressure of the transmembrane gravity driven filtration system reduced the compression and adhesion of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances eps which mitigated the formation of biofilm in water channels the hydrophilic molecular engineering of ta on the surface of collagen fibrils could bind with water molecules to form an antifouling hydration layer which endows the ta cfn m with excellent anti adhesive property the synergetic effect of the hydrophilic property anti adhesive ability and bactericidal capacity endowed the ta cfn m with excellent anti biofouling performance to better understand the innovation of this work the comparison results in table s1 indicate that this sustainable hydrophilic antibacterial biodegradable and reliable collagen based membrane is a promising candidate for antifouling water disinfection applications 4 conclusion in summary a new type of water purification membrane by immobilized ta on the 3d hierarchically fibrous structured ta cfn m was successfully developed the strategy proposed in this work is facile low cost and sustainable which is suitable for large scale preparation additionally the ta cfn m showed ordered and hierarchical collagen fiber networks enabling it to be applied to high performance thin film composites owing to the facile and green scalable fabrication of the ta cfn m via ta cross linking the method paved the way for the novel thinking of multifunctional mf membranes these results suggest the ta cfn m shows multifarious desirable abilities novel hierarchical network excellent mechanical stability outstanding hydrophilicity and superb antibacterial ability the ta cfn m possessed unexceptionable properties toward multifunctional mf membranes of liquid separation even for micron scale microplastic particles and antifouling water disinfection as expected the ta cfn m inspired collagen fibrous network based membranes revealed various attempts for the further development of water purification and provided a new strategy for utilizing the synergistic effect between 3d cfn m and tas which would explore wide applications in water purification catalysis

15963,because of their low cost and high bacterial interception efficiency large scale membrane separation technologies like microfiltration mf have been widely implemented for water disinfection however lack of antibacterial ability and low sustainability are two major drawbacks of most petroleum based mf membranes which are normally associated with hazardous issues including biofouling and nonbiodegradable waste in this work abundant animal hides which are by products of the meat processing industry were proposed as raw materials to fabricate a sustainable mf membrane due to their natural hierarchical and renewable collagen fibrous network cfn with inherent biodegradability after the removal of non collagen compositions from animal hides such as hair and fat through a facile pretreating process base on green chemistry principles a thin cfn based membrane cfn m with a similar micropore size to that of commercial mf membranes could be produced furthermore inspired by conventional leather tanning technology tannic acids ta were selected as plant polyphenol tanning agent to modify collagen fibers based on tanning chemistry to improve the thermal stability of cfn m moreover the ta cross linked cfn m ta cfn m exhibited excellent antibacterial properties due to the production of reactive oxygen species ros by the catechol functional group the resulting ta cfn m achieved 99 9 water disinfection efficiency with a flux of 150 l m 2 h 1 via gravity driven operation while simultaneously showing admirable anti biofouling ability different from the commercial mf

introduction safe and clean drinking water is a universal and essential need for human beings castro muñoz 2020a kumar et al 2017 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 however achieving a reliable and affordable supply of clean water is still a great challenge to the sustainability of modern society wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2016 zhong et al 2020 worldwide waterborne diseases cause millions of deaths annually due to the consumption of contaminated water containing pathogenic microorganisms caicedo et al 2019 tang et al 2019 particularly the global population growth and the ongoing covid 19 pandemic have undoubtedly heightened the challenge of securing access to safe water since the 21st century membrane separation technologies have been applied in large scale applications for water disinfection due to their high efficiency compact and modular design and high level of automation nunes et al 2020 ren et al 2018 werber et al 2016 yang et al 2018b compared to traditional disinfection technologies such as the addition of a chemical disinfectant the water disinfection mechanism of membrane technology is dependent on the size exclusion of the membrane s porous structure that can physically remove a wide variety of contaminants through filtration which is basically a chemical free process castro muñoz et al 2021 tan et al 2018b tunuguntla et al 2017 wang et al 2016 particularly the developed microfiltration mf membrane owing to its microporous structure with superior filtration flux and high bacterial interception efficiency has been regarded as one of the most mature low cost and energy saving technologies for water disinfection in developing communities kumar et al 2021 ling et al 2017 zeng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 although mf membrane technology has been widely implemented for centralized water treatment over the past 20 years drawbacks have gradually been exposed in its rapid development process kang et al 2020 razali et al 2015 wang et al 2020c from the perspective of the entire life cycle low sustainability is considered to be the major drawback of mf membrane xie et al 2019 castro muñoz 2020b i since the birth of membrane technology due to inevitable contact with microbials and lack of antibacterial activity biofouling on membrane surfaces has consistently been a bottleneck that not only restricts sustainable water purification but can also become a potential pathogenic contaminant risk liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020b ii secondly most of the raw materials for manufacturing mf membranes such as polysulfone psu poly ether sulfone pesu and poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf ji et al 2020 are nonbiodegradable petroleum based polymers which are difficult to recycle and are typically associated with disposal burdens at the end of their lifetime leading to hazardous plastic pollution george et al 2001 nataraj et al 2012 tan et al 2018a and iii large amounts of polar organic solvents are commonly involved in the phase inversion fabrication processes of porous mf membranes which pose a series of health and environmental risks an et al 2011 baig et al 2020 figoli et al 2014 thus in light of the improved sustainability of membrane technology attention should be given to the next generation of sustainable membranes from the green chemistry principle anastas et al 2010 bolisetty et al 2019 huang et al 2021 accordingly biobased polymers such as bacterial fermentation poly butylene succinate and poly lactic acid castro muñoz et al 2019 le phuong et al 2019 vegetable sources cellulose lignin and alginate janakiram et al 2020 yang et al 2018a and animal sources chitosan collagen and sericin bolisetty et al 2016 castro muñoz et al 2022 chaudhary et al 2014 esfahani et al 2020 khajavian et al 2022 have been employed in the membrane manufacturing process grant et al 2016 halanur et al 2019 hu et al 2013 however constructing a highly porous and antibacterial membrane in a facile and green pore forming manner is still a great challenge cao et al 2021 cranford et al 2012 mohanty et al 2018 animal skins which are a by product of animal husbandry exhibit natural hierarchical networks after the pretreatment unhairing liming and enzyme bating of the leather making process due to the removal of the non collagen compositions leather based collagen fibrous membranes cfms with their attractive merits of hydrophilicity renewability and easy accessibility can be regarded as an ideal 3d hierarchically porous matrix for fabricating high performance mf membranes in addition plant polyphenol a green and nontoxic plant biomass has been widely used for the cross linking of leather to endow it with excellent heat and microbial stability guo et al 2021 liu et al 2016 yan et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 zimmerman et al 2020 among them tannic acids tas are a promising material for membrane fabrication modification due to their renewable nature good hydrophilicity excellent antibacterial activity superior adsorption and chemical stability in this work a microporous and hierarchical collagen fibrous network membrane cfn m derived from natural sheepskin animal biomass was applied as the raw material for membrane manufacturing in addition ta plant biomass was used as a cross linking and disinfecting agent for membrane modification and application tannic acid cross linked collagen fibrous network membranes ta cfn ms exhibiting the high sustainability of raw materials membrane manufacturing and membrane application were proposed the introduced reactive ta into the cfn m will bind the amino groups through hydrogen bonds schiff base reaction and michael addition consequently the ta cfn m could effectively reject micro scale contaminant tio2 microparticles and disinfect the broad spectrum bacteria with robust permeation flux even under gravity driven operation which also showed desirable reusability favorable efficiency and superior antifouling performance as far as we know it is the first time that the large scale low cost sustainable and antibacterial collagen fiber based membrane was facilely fabricated this desirable performance along with the natural abundance of animal skin materials scalable and facile fabrication process and substantially lower cost positions the 3d hierarchical ta cfn m as a sustainable and highly efficient replacement

s aureus mrsa and p aeruginosa were selected for the testing the water disinfection performance and antifouling property the bacteria containing water were filtered by the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m for water disinfection the bacteria before and after filtration by ta cfn m were calculated by plate count method further the sem images and clsm images were performed for the observing the survivability and morphologies of bacteria the long term antifouling property of samples were determined by the change of water flux and sem images the more details could be found in materials and methods of supporting information si 3 result and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of tannic acid cross linked collagen fibrous network membranes ta cfn ms as shown in fig 1a b thin cfn ms with a white color and an average thickness of 0 24 mm were prepared by pretreatment processes including unhairing liming enzyme bating and shaving at this stage the non collagen compositions were completely removed from the natural skin leading to the formation of a microporous and hierarchical network structure fig 1c d in the sem images the typical cross striation pattern of collagen fibrils with a d period of 67 nm can be clearly observed and an average diameter of collagen fibrils in fig 1e was calculated to be 71 nm in the next step tas were used to modify the cfn m through cross linking modification according to conventional tanning theory as illustrated in fig 1a the cross linking is formed due to the hydrogen bond interaction and schiff base reaction of tas with collagen fibers yielding a ta cfn m sample with a brown color it is worth noting that the ta cfn m exhibited a larger average thickness 0 26 mm than that of the pristine cfn m because of the looser collagen fiber network fig 1f g h indicating the cross linking tanning effect based on the molecular engineering of ta more importantly the average diameter of collagen fibrils of the ta cfn m increased to 124 nm fig 1i subsequently the cross linking effect enables ta cfn m to exhibit a higher porosity 56 and a much lower average pore size 8 μm than that of a pristine cfn m 44 20 μm which is due to the dispersal of collagen fibers and collagen fibrils as presented in fig 1j k owing to the highly microporous hierarchical architecture and small pore size it was expected that the ta cfn m could be used for mf moreover the flexibility of the ta cfn m 8 1 mm was higher than that of the pristine cfn m 6 6 mm fig 1l which is suitable for the application of spiral wound membrane modules additionally the tensile stress of the ta cfn m was about 9 0 mpa fig 1m which is more than twice that of the commercial mixed cellulose esters mce membrane 4 1 mpa millipore gswp the enhancement of the mechanical properties could be ascribed to the cross linking effect of the ta which involved 3d network deformation and collagen fibril stretch the results implied that ta cfn ms have the potential to be used as commercial mf membranes 3 2 robust mechanical and chemical properties of ta cfn m to further investigate the functionalization process the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m were studied in detail as shown in fig 2a compared with the pristine cfn m the n 1 s signal of ta cfn m was noticeably reduced which can be indicated by the depletion of amino groups on the cfn m moreover the high resolution spectrum of n 1 s for cfn m in fig 2b presents an individual characteristic peak at 398 1 ev which may be ascribed to the aliphatic cn amino groups and amido bond of cfn m on the contrary the n 1 s spectrum of the ta cfn m was deconvoluted into three separated peaks at 398 7 401 0 and 401 9 ev fig 2c which could be caused by the aliphatic cn of cfn m the aromatic c n of the schiff base and the aromatic cn from the michael addition the results implied that the tas cross linked with collagen through michael addition and schiff base reactions furthermore the surface chemistry of the ta cfn m has been characterized using atr ftir spectroscopy as shown in fig 2d the absorbance intensity at 1200 cm 1 increased corresponding to the hydroxyl oh stretch after the introduction of phenolic oh groups the peak at 1615 cm 1 is assigned to the c n stretching implying schiff base formation meanwhile xrd patterns of the pristine cfn m and the ta cfn m were performed and exhibited in fig 2e compared with the pristine cfn m the characteristic peak of collagen at 19 8 d 0 44 nm becomes smoother in the ta cfn m due to the introduction of ta in addition the ta cfn m was comparatively stable in an aqueous solution and exhibited few oxidizing reactions therefore it is not considered to generate disinfection by products dbps after leaching the ta cfn m solution the content of ta in the filtrate was tested by uv vis absorbance spectrum and the resultant water showed a slight increase in total organic carbon toc 0 2 ppm and total dissolved solids tds 0 31 ppm in one day the leaching of tas from the ta cfn m was measured and displayed in fig 2f moreover the ta loading amount was determined to be 3 55 via the foline phenol reagent more importantly the dynamic immersing stability of the ta cfn m was evaluated as demonstrated in fig 2f the released tas were less than 0 5 μg day in a week exhibiting the outstanding durability of the ta cfn m the excellent water stability implied the potential application in water treatment thermal stability performances are important factors for water treatment membranes furthermore the hydrothermal stability of the pristine cfn m and the ta cfn m were evaluated by measuring the shrinkage temperature ts as shown in fig 2g the ts of the ta cfn m 85 ºc was much higher than that of the pristine cfn m 70 ºc which exhibited the robust cross linking of tas moreover as demonstrated from thermogravimetric analysis tga in fig 2h the ta cfn m presented two typical weight loss stages with the increase in temperature overall the decomposition temperature of the ta cfn m 333 7 ºc was higher than that of the pristine cfn m 327 3 ºc the differential scanning calorimetry dsc results exhibited by the ta cfn m 83 4 ºc showed higher thermal stability than that of the pristine cfn m 68 6 ºc fig 2i 3 3 assessment of the microfiltration performance of sub micro particles as mf membranes as a proof of concept the top surface morphologies and roughnesses of the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m were detected by lscm as presented in fig 3a the top surface of the pristine cfn m with an average roughness 17 3 μm was quite dense and rough as exhibited in fig 3b in comparison the ta cfn m presented a smoother surface and the average roughness decreased to 12 1 μm hydrophilicity and water flux are two important parameters to evaluate the capability of the mf membranes zhang et al 2016 tang et al 2020 the water contact angle wca was performed to assess the hydrophilicity of the ta cfn m as shown in fig 3c the original wca of the pristine cfn m was 64 8 and remained unchanged in 20 s exhibiting relative hydrophobicity and poor wettability on the contrary the wca of the ta cfn m was measured with the original contact angle decreasing from 26 7 to 0 in 20 s therefore it may be concluded that the hydrophilicity of the ta cfn m was predominantly attributed to the introduction of ta the water permeation flux of the pristine cfn m and the ta cfn m was studied with the results being shown in fig 3d the ta cross linking of the cfn m exhibited a positive impact on water flux via gravity driven operation 10 cm 1 kpa under the fixed transmembrane pressure of 1 kpa the water permeation flux of the pristine cfn m and the ta cfn m was 138 4 12 0 and 174 5 9 4 l m2 h p values 0 05 respectively therefore the above results proved that the modifications enhanced the water transport performance of the ta cfn m to realize commercial application the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m with a large scale size of 70 50 cm2 were prepared and used as the mf membrane for the removal of micro scale tio2 microparticles from a liquid solution fig 3e f tang et al 2019 as shown in fig 3g the ta cfn m exhibited a high rejection efficiency 99 for obstructing micro scale tio2 microparticles under robust water permeation flux 170 l m 2 h 1 the high removal efficiency of the ta cfn m could be attributed to its 3d hierarchical collagen fiber network structure furthermore the removal efficiency decreased moderately with the increase in concentration in the tio2 suspension fig 3g which may be due to the rapid formation of filter cakes in dead end filtration systems to investigate the microcosmic separation processes of the ta cfn m the surface of the ta cfn m after filtration was observed by sem as shown in fig 3h the tio2 microparticles have been intercepted by and collected on the surface of the ta cfn m the results exhibited that the hydrophilic microporous structure of ta cfn m is conducive to removing micron scale contaminants such as microplastic particles tang et al 2020 3 4 assessment of the antibacterial performance and antibacterial mechanism exploration the adhered bacteria live or dead bacteria on membrane surfaces could cause serious membrane fouling zhang et al 2016 therefore the bacterial adhesion onto the surface of pristine cfn m and ta cfn m was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm fluorescent images of live dead staining assay displayed that only strong green fluorescence was observed in bacteria after coming into contact with the cfn m fig 4a in comparison the bacteria on the ta cfn m exhibited weak green fluorescence together with weak red fluorescence implying the excellent antibacterial and anti adhesive properties of the ta cfn m in addition the morphology of different bacteria was observed by sem after adhesion onto the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m as shown in the insert images of fig 4a many live bacteria adhered to the surface of pristine cfn m with intact and smooth surfaces in contrast few bacteria could be found on the surface of the ta cfn m implying the strong capability of bacterial anti adhesion according to previous studies guo et al 2021 liu et al 2016 yan et al 2020 ta has been demonstrated to display powerful antibacterial properties against many microorganisms through inhibiting the expression of proteins involved in the bacterial cell wall membrane synthesis and the biosynthesis of the cell constituents cell signaling and dna as illustrated in fig 4b the repel and kill strategy of the ta cfn m exhibited excellent anti adhesive and antibacterial abilities which can be ascribed to the gallol and catechol groups of ta castro muñoz 2020b moreover as shown in fig 4c the ta cfn m has a more negative charge zeta potential 6 4 mv than that of the pristine cfn m zeta potential 4 8 mv in a neutral aqueous solution ph 7 due to the dissociation of the phenolic hydroxyl group on the ta the anionic carboxyl groups on the surface of the ta cfn m could effectively repel bacterial adhesion via electrostatic repulsive forces in addition the relative reactive oxygen species ros level of the pristine cfn m and ta cfn m was marked via and measured using the fluorescent probe dcfh da as shown in fig 4d the ros level of the ta cfn m was much higher than that of the pristine cfn m this result indicated that the introduction of tas endowed the ta cfn m with excellent bactericidal properties firstly gallol groups may allow reduction reaction to occur with oxygen o2 to simultaneously generate ros hydrogen peroxide h2o2 afterward the formed h2o2 instantaneously releases from the ta cfn m to the contaminated water and the concentration of ros in the water remains at a high level according to previous studies guo et al 2021 liu et al 2016 xia et al 2017 yan et al 2020 ta can bind to bacterial proteins a kind of important intracellular component which inhibits the activity of bacterial enzymes and proves cytoplasmic leakage and cell membrane damage fig 4e demonstrates that the leakage of the bacterial protein with the ta cfn m rose dramatically in comparison with the cfn m implying its intrinsic antibacterial mechanism 3 5 water disinfection application and antifouling performance evaluation of ta cfn m to evaluate the effect of the water treatment the performances of the ta cfn m as a biocidal membrane were investigated zeng et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 5a different bacteria contaminated water 104 cfu ml 1 were considered as model bacteria containing water to assess the water disinfection performance of the ta cfn m the sem images of bacteria e coli s aureus mrsa and p aeruginosa were presented to assess the bacterial morphological changes before and after filtration by cfn m and ta cfn m figs 5a and s2 herein the four different bacteria e coli s aureus mrsa and p aeruginosa exhibited a plump and integrated state before filtration however the bacteria were observed with a shrunk and collapsed surface demonstrating the broken cell membrane during the filtration process as shown in figs 5b and s2 the filtrated bacteria were investigated as assessed with a live dead viability kit under an epifluorescent microscope numerous bacteria exhibited a great number of green dots before filtration and after filtration by cfn m meaning that most of the bacteria were alive on the contrary after being filtrated by the ta cfn m the bacteria showed plenty of red dots and a few green dots indicating the excellent biocidal activity of the ta cfn m the insert images of agar plates presented the bactericidal results of e coli s aureus mrsa and p aeruginosa cells and a few bacteria can be observed revealing the excellent performance of water disinfection of the ta cfn m via gravity driven operation the water disinfection performance log reduction value lrv of the cfn m 1 lrv and ta cfn m 3 lrv without the consumption of electricity is shown in fig 5c the results of four cyclic water disinfection assays proved that the bactericidal ability of the ta cfn m exhibited 3 lrv against e coli s aureus mrsa and p aeruginosa demonstrating the stability and reusability of ta cross linking fig 5d the results certified that the ta cfn m possessed robust reusability superior stability and excellent broad spectrum bacterial decontamination capability bacteria adhering onto the membrane surface could cause serious biofouling and even biofilm which could cause severe flux decline and affect the quality of the filtered water accordingly the anti biofilm performance of the commercial mce pristine cfn and ta cfn m was observed by sem after severe biofouling fig 6a the biofilms on the surface of the commercial mce and pristine cfn were thick and dense indicating the poor anti biofouling property in realistic applications on the contrary fewer bacteria adhered to the ta cfn m than that of the pristine cfn due to its excellent anti biofouling property which maintained a microporous structure for water transport furthermore the water flux and the bacteria were measured with the increase in filtration amount as observed in fig 6b the permeation flux of the ta cfn m remained at 150 l m 2 h 1 and the e coli were less than 10 cfu ml after being treated by the ta cfn m which meets the criterion of the who drinking water guideline less than 100 cfu ml dankovich and gray 2011 dankovich and smith 2014 liu et al 2016 in addition the adhered bacteria released from the pristine cfn and ta cfn m were investigated with the releasing time as exhibited in fig 6c the number of bacteria released from the pristine cfn 103 cfu ml was much higher than that of the ta cfn m 10 cfu ml the anti biofouling behavior of the commercial mce pristine cfn and ta cfn m was assessed by dynamic biofouling assay using simulated wastewater under gravity driven operation as shown in fig 6d the biofilm formed on the commercial mce and pristine cfn obstructed water transport leading to a great flux decline 90 and 70 in comparison the slight water flux decline less than 10 demonstrated that the ta cfn m acquired enhanced antifouling ability against wastewater the pressure of the transmembrane gravity driven filtration system reduced the compression and adhesion of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances eps which mitigated the formation of biofilm in water channels the hydrophilic molecular engineering of ta on the surface of collagen fibrils could bind with water molecules to form an antifouling hydration layer which endows the ta cfn m with excellent anti adhesive property the synergetic effect of the hydrophilic property anti adhesive ability and bactericidal capacity endowed the ta cfn m with excellent anti biofouling performance to better understand the innovation of this work the comparison results in table s1 indicate that this sustainable hydrophilic antibacterial biodegradable and reliable collagen based membrane is a promising candidate for antifouling water disinfection applications 4 conclusion in summary a new type of water purification membrane by immobilized ta on the 3d hierarchically fibrous structured ta cfn m was successfully developed the strategy proposed in this work is facile low cost and sustainable which is suitable for large scale preparation additionally the ta cfn m showed ordered and hierarchical collagen fiber networks enabling it to be applied to high performance thin film composites owing to the facile and green scalable fabrication of the ta cfn m via ta cross linking the method paved the way for the novel thinking of multifunctional mf membranes these results suggest the ta cfn m shows multifarious desirable abilities novel hierarchical network excellent mechanical stability outstanding hydrophilicity and superb antibacterial ability the ta cfn m possessed unexceptionable properties toward multifunctional mf membranes of liquid separation even for micron scale microplastic particles and antifouling water disinfection as expected the ta cfn m inspired collagen fibrous network based membranes revealed various attempts for the further development of water purification and provided a new strategy for utilizing the synergistic effect between 3d cfn m and tas which would explore wide applications in water purification catalysis

15964,anthropogenic nutrient inputs have led to nutrient enrichment in many waterbodies worldwide including chesapeake bay usa river water quality integrates the spatial and temporal changes of watersheds and forms the foundation for disentangling the effects of anthropogenic inputs we demonstrate with the chesapeake bay non tidal monitoring network that machine learning approaches i e hierarchical clustering and random forest rf classification can be combined to better understand the regional patterns and drivers of total nitrogen tn trends in large monitoring networks resulting in information useful for watershed management cluster analysis revealed regional patterns of short term tn trends 2007 2018 and categorized the stations into three distinct trend clusters namely v shape n 23 monotonic decline n 35 and monotonic increase n 26 rf models identified regional drivers of tn trend clusters by quantifying the effects of watershed characteristics land use geology physiography and major n sources on the trend clusters results provide encouraging evidence that improved agricultural nutrient management has resulted in declines in agricultural nonpoint sources which in turn contributed to water quality improvement in our period of analysis moreover water quality improvements are more likely in watersheds underlain by carbonate rocks reflecting the relatively quick groundwater transport of this terrain by contrast water quality improvements are less likely in coastal plain watersheds reflecting the effect of legacy n in groundwater notably results show degrading trends in forested watersheds suggesting new and or remobilized sources that may compromise management efforts finally the developed rf models were used to predict tn trend clusters for the entire chesapeake bay watershed at the fine scale of river segments n 979 providing fine spatial information that can facilitate targeted watershed management including unmonitored areas more broadly this combined use of clustering and classification approaches can be applied to other regional monitoring networks to address similar water quality questions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality anthropogenic sources watershed management cluster analysis random forest monitoring network 1 introduction nutrient enrichment is a major issue to many inland and coastal waterbodies worldwide boesch 2019 cloern 2001 malone and newton 2020 excessive nutrients primarily nitrogen and phosphorus can originate from a variety of anthropogenic sources e g wastewater treatment facilities fertilizer atmospheric deposition whose relative contributions vary among watersheds boyer et al 2002 sabo et al 2019 van breemen et al 2002 rivers are integrators connecting source zones and receiving waterbodies e g lakes and estuaries they manifest the spatial and temporal changes in watersheds and thus provide essential information for watershed management river water quality monitoring stations have been established in many regions to quantify nutrient loads and their temporal trends which form the foundation for disentangling the effects of anthropogenic inputs one example of nutrient enrichment is chesapeake bay the largest estuary in the united states to alleviate this issue coordinated reductions of nutrient and sediment loads from the bay watershed began in the 1980s and are enforced through the 2010 chesapeake bay total maximum daily load tmdl u s environmental protection agency 2010 efforts have been made by the partnership to reduce nutrients from point sources boynton et al 2008 fisher et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b agricultural fertilizer and manure applications keisman et al 2018 and atmospheric deposition burns et al 2021 eshleman and sabo 2016 eshleman et al 2013 linker et al 2013b sabo 2018 despite some documented progress in the restoration efforts lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2022 murphy et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 continued nutrient reductions are imperative to achieve the tmdl goals in this context better understanding of regional patterns and drivers of riverine nitrogen trends is critical for effective watershed management quantifying and understanding river water quality trends have been an extensive area of research for decades yet several typical challenges remain which are relevant to chesapeake bay and elsewhere first water quality trend studies often focus on one or a few monitoring locations making conclusions difficult to generalize eshleman and sabo 2016 eshleman et al 2013 watersheds are complex entities that often exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity consequently river water quality is affected by a multitude of drivers related to nutrient sources transport and transformation which can be challenging to uncover ator et al 2020 ator et al 2019 chanat and yang 2018 nonetheless much can be learned from the similarity in water quality signals and the similarity in water quality responses to natural and anthropogenic drivers which is made possible by data from regional monitoring networks ator et al 2020 ator et al 2019 chanat and yang 2018 in this regard clustering approaches can be especially useful for categorizing regional patterns of water quality trends such approaches can reveal similarity in water quality trends among monitoring stations in the network in addition the assigned trend clusters can be further analyzed toward identifying likely drivers of trends leading to insights that are more generalizable from a whole watershed perspective relative to studies focusing on one or a few locations another challenge in understanding water quality trends is that trend attribution analyses do not often evaluate all major input sources leading to potentially inaccurate inferences from the individual studies or even contradictory inferences among studies focused on different sources in the case of chesapeake bay temporal trends of total nitrogen tn have been attributed to a diverse list of often disparate factors including atmospheric deposition ator et al 2020 burns et al 2021 eshleman and sabo 2016 eshleman et al 2013 hyer et al 2021 point sources ator et al 2020 boynton et al 2008 fisher et al 2021 hyer et al 2021 and land based nonpoint sources chanat and yang 2018 these disparities are related to the differences in the methods and data used e g n sources spatial scale temporal coverage making it challenging to uncover generalizable drivers to the entire watershed therefore it will be beneficial to systematically evaluate all major sources of n for the majority of the bay watershed with a consistent period of analysis such sources include atmospheric deposition point sources and agricultural fertilizer and manure as well as agricultural surplus that has reportedly declined across the watershed but has not yet been incorporated into any attribution analysis sabo et al 2022 in this regard classification approaches such as random forest rf can be especially useful for relating tn trend clusters which is a categorical variable to potential drivers that include watershed characteristics and major n sources a third challenge is that river monitoring networks do not necessarily cover the entire watershed resulting in missing information in ungauged subwatersheds in this regard rf models once developed based on the monitored areas can be used to predict water quality trends in the unmonitored areas in addition water quality trend analyses are often aimed at multi decadal scales consistent with the temporal span of the monitoring network ator et al 2019 chanat and yang 2018 eshleman et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 which automatically disqualify recently established stations therefore an analysis of short term trends 12 years can not only leverage valuable data from recently established stations but also provide current information for facilitating watershed management the main aim of our research was to address the above challenges and demonstrate the utility of machine learning approaches more specifically the combined use of hierarchical clustering and rf classification to reveal regional patterns and drivers of nitrogen trends we use chesapeake bay as a case study specifically the 100 stations comprising the chesapeake bay non tidal monitoring network ntn moyer and langland 2020 tango and batiuk 2016 this research involved three objectives that were achieved in a sequential manner 1 use of hierarchical clustering to categorize tn trends from 2007 2018 at the ntn stations into distinct clusters 2 development of rf models to identify the most influential explanatory variables for the tn trend clusters and 3 application of the rf models to predict tn trend clusters for the entire bay watershed at the fine scale of river segments n 979 mean area 168 km2 figure s1 overall this research provides new information to the chesapeake bay management community regarding regional patterns and drivers of short term tn trends in the field of water resources clustering approaches have been used in studies of stream health sanchez et al 2015 flood frequency sun et al 2015 and watershed characteristics wolfe et al 2019 rf and other classification approaches have been used in studies of water level guyennon et al 2021 flow indices prieto et al 2019 groundwater contamination pennino et al 2020 tesoriero et al 2017 and river water quality lin et al 2021 sabo 2018 however to our knowledge a combined use of these two types of approaches has not yet been implemented toward understanding regional patterns and drivers of water quality trends and this research is the first such attempt although this research is aimed toward the chesapeake bay watershed the combined use of clustering and classification approaches can be applied to other regional monitoring networks to address similar water quality questions 2 data and methods 2 1 ntn stations and data the chesapeake bay ntn contains 115 monitoring stations moyer and langland 2020 tango and batiuk 2016 these ntn stations have been sampled using standardized protocols and quality assurance procedures designed to compute pollutant loads and assess changes in pollutant loads over time tango and batiuk 2016 for tn and other major water quality constituents routine samples are collected monthly and eight additional storm event samples are collected per year to obtain at least 20 samples per year tango and batiuk 2016 annual flow normalized loads fnls of tn were estimated using the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds method hirsch et al 2010 and obtained from the u s geological survey moyer and langland 2020 fnls better account for the interannual variability in streamflow and are a standard product used by the chesapeake bay program partnership to communicate water quality trends across the chesapeake bay watershed the appropriateness of the wrtds method for riverine trend analysis specifically its flow normalization approach has been well documented in the literature chanat et al 2016 hirsch et al 2010 moyer et al 2012 and has been used by many national and regional water quality investigations dupas et al 2020 murphy and sprague 2019 oelsner and stets 2019 stets et al 2020 zhang and blomquist 2018 our work focuses on annual fnls of tn at the ntn stations for the period of 2007 2018 which are available at 84 stations the year 2007 was selected because 34 stations were added to the network in 2005 2007 annual fnls at three example stations are presented in fig 1 a c 2 2 hierarchical cluster analysis clustering approaches can reveal similarity in tn trends among the monitoring stations and the assigned trend clusters can be further analyzed toward identifying likely drivers of trends leading to insights that are more generalizable from a whole watershed perspective in this work agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was used to categorize fnls at the 84 ntn stations into groups that have similar temporal trends prior to cluster analysis fnls at each station were standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one to facilitate comparison of trends as opposed to magnitudes 1 f n l i t s t a n d a r d i z e d f n l i t m e a n f n l i s d f n l i where i represents a station and t represents year which ranges between 2007 and 2018 for the three example stations the standardized fnls show monotonic declines in patuxent river and opequon creek but a monotonic increase in choptank river fig 1 d f dissimilarity between the standardized fnls at the individual stations was measured using euclidean distance and linkage between clusters was determined using ward s minimum variance method ward 1963 the euclidean distance between two time series of fnls is calculated as the square root of the sum of their squared differences in each year between 2007 and 2018 fig 1 g i based on the euclidean distances patuxent river and opequon creek are most similar to each other among the three example stations while patuxent river and choptank river are most dissimilar the cluster analysis was performed in r using the hclust function in the stats r package with the ward d2 method r core team 2019 the optimal number of clusters 3 was determined by the silhouette method and visual inspection of the dendrogram kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 the dendrogram which shows the hierarchical relationship between the stations is presented in fig 2 moreover the overall trends and spatial distribution of the clusters are presented in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively as an unsupervised method cluster analysis cannot be validated using traditional approaches e g k fold cross validation since the data have no predefined labels classes nonetheless validation is still important because the clustering results depend on choices on similarity measure clustering algorithm and linkage method toward that end we adopted the resampling and re classifying procedure of wolfe et al 2019 to assess the robustness of our clustering results figure s2 specifically the 84 stations were divided into 12 independent subsets each containing seven stations subsequently 12 iterations of the cluster analysis were run in each iteration one subset of the stations n 7 was removed from the original data and the remaining stations n 77 were reanalyzed using the same clustering procedure the number of clusters was set at three to be consistent with the full data analysis the cluster assignments from these 12 iterations were then compared with those from the full data analysis to assess agreement of the assigned clusters figure s2 2 3 rf model features rf was chosen to identify factors that affect the tn trend clusters for four reasons first rf has been successful as a general purpose classification and regression approach biau and scornet 2016 and has been used in many water resources studies see references listed above it is appropriate for our work since the trend clusters are a categorical variable second rf is comparatively less sensitive to outliers and can efficiently handle non linear variables breiman 2001 hastie et al 2009 third compared with other approaches e g classification and regression tree breiman 1984 rf can produce generally more stable results due to its bagging algorithm that builds multiple trees and glues them together hastie et al 2009 fourth rf can reveal additional insights on the effects of the explanatory variables by quantifying the relative importance of the variables and the marginal effects of the variables breiman 2001 hastie et al 2009 a total of 16 explanatory variables features were considered for predicting the trend clusters i e the response variable table 1 these candidate features fall into the categories of land use n 4 geology n 1 physiography n 5 and n source trends n 6 these variables were selected because their effects on n loads and trends have been documented for the chesapeake bay watershed and elsewhere ator et al 2020 ator et al 2019 chanat and yang 2018 clune et al 2020 djodjic et al 2021 dupas et al 2016 eshleman et al 2013 hyer et al 2021 terziotti et al 2017 we note that the tn trend clusters may be further explained by other variables such as management practice implementation lintern et al 2020 sekellick et al 2019 legacy n chang et al 2021 sanford and pope 2013 riparian buffers golden et al 2019 lowrance et al 1997 and landscape configuration casquin et al 2021 however these variables were not considered in this research due to the lack of data for the ntn stations and the river segments for each station land use variables expressed in percent were quantified using the chesapeake bay program s chesapeake assessment scenario tool chesapeake bay program 2017 geology variables in percent were obtained from the u s conterminous wall to wall anthropogenic land use trends dataset falcone 2015 physiographic region variables in percent were obtained from the u s geological survey wieczorek et al 2018 for each variable above the median of annual values in the period of 2007 2018 was used for each station in addition for each station n source data were obtained from the chesapeake assessment scenario tool for applicable river segments which were summed up to obtain the annual mass rate in kg n year for each major source these annual time series were scaled by their respective long term medians to facilitate comparison of interannual trends then mann kendall trends kendall

function in the wq r package jassby and cloern 2016 for point source mk trends were computed for the 2007 2018 period consistent with the period of the response variable for the other sources mk trends were computed for the 1997 2018 period to allow for a 10 year extension that may account for lag effects chang et al 2021 chen et al 2014 sabo 2018 among three options of lag tested i e 10 year 5 year and 0 year the 10 year lag was determined to be most effective in modeling the response variable i e clusters due to missing values in some features the number of records for the rf analysis reduced from 84 to 78 stations see table s1 for full data each candidate feature was separately evaluated against the response variable using the one way analysis of variance anova test to examine if each feature had significant differences among the three clusters figure s3 moreover all candidate features were used to build a base model using the train function in the caret r package kuhn et al 2020 to quantify the relative importance of these features on the clusters figure s4a furthermore the spearman s correlation was calculated for each pair of features figure s4b which is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation spearman 1904 lastly for the base rf model figure s5 and subsequently selected rf models fig 5 partial dependence plots were developed using the partialplot function in the randomforest r package liaw and wiener 2002 to show the marginal effect of each feature in the model on the probability of predicted cluster i e the relationship between the predicted response and each feature while holding all other features constant 2 4 exhaustive search algorithm to determine the optimal rf model s an exhaustive search algorithm was developed and implemented in r to evaluate all possible combinations of the candidate features to constrain model complexity this algorithm was set to allow no more than six features in the rf model experimentation showed that the model accuracy reached plateau at about six features and additional features failed to improve the model accuracy see figure s6 for an example for each candidate model rf was run using the randomforest function in the randomforest r package liaw and wiener 2002 with the same parameterization i e ntree 1 000 nodesize 1 and the model performance was evaluated using the out of bag oob accuracy hastie et al 2009 2 o o b a c c u r a c y 100 o o b e r r o r similar to hold out validation techniques the oob accuracy is a powerful validation technique used especially for rf models hastie et al 2009 specifically the original data are resampled to form bootstrap samples which are used for model training records that are not contained in the bootstrap samples are called oob samples which are used for model validation by calculating the oob error i e the proportion of incorrect classifications hastie et al 2009 three optimal models with the highest oob accuracies were selected by the exhaustive search algorithm table 2 all of which showed better performance than the base model figure s7a to further evaluate these optimal models leave one out cross validation loocv was conducted which also showed better performance by the optimal models than the base model figure s7b 2 5 ensemble model approach the optimal rf models were applied to predict the cluster assignment for each ntn station in addition to the predicted classes rf also reported the probability associated with each class as determined by the proportion of votes of the trees in the ensemble the probability associated with the cluster was used as a measure of likelihood specifically a predicted cluster is deemed to have a high likelihood if probability 0 667 a medium likelihood if 0 5 probability 0 667 or a low likelihood if probability 0 5 an ensemble model approach was adopted to combine the strengths of the selected optimal models zhang et al 2021a specifically predictions from the optimal models were compared for each station and the prediction with the highest likelihood was always selected by the ensemble model approach figure s8a see table s2 for full data 2 6 rf prediction for the entire watershed the optimal rf models were applied to the entire chesapeake bay watershed to predict tn trend clusters at a finer resolution that is directly relevant for watershed management specifically we used the river segments n 979 of the chesapeake bay program s watershed model chesapeake bay program 2017 which are subwatersheds of chesapeake bay unlike the ntn stations the river segments have similar areas mean 168 km2 and they do not overlap with each other figure s1 for each river segment the tn trend cluster was predicted in two steps first the model features were prepared in the same manner as the ntn stations see fig 6 and figure s9 for maps of these features second the three optimal rf models were applied to these features to predict the trend cluster and compute the likelihood associated with each model s prediction the prediction with the highest likelihood was recorded by the ensemble model approach figure s8b see table s3 for full data note that these model predictions assume that subwatersheds should show similar riverine tn trends if they have similar watershed characteristics land use geology physiography and similar trends of n sources this is reasonable because many of the river segments are encompassed by the ntn watersheds 3 results and discussion 3 1 cluster analysis revealed distinct tn trend clusters objective 1 three clusters of annual flow normalized tn loads were identified by the cluster analysis fig 2 see table s1 for full data these clusters show unique short term 2007 2018 trends of tn load fig 3 cluster 1 n 23 has a v shape trend with an inflection point around 2011 because this inflection point coincides with an extremely wet year 2011 due to hurricane irene and tropical storm lee one possible explanation is that increasing amounts of n were mobilized and exported to streams in the following years vidon et al 2018 cluster 2 n 35 shows a monotonic decline whereas cluster 3 n 26 shows a monotonic increase these two clusters represent improving and degrading trends respectively note that these clusters focus on tn temporal trends as opposed to magnitudes for each pair of ntn stations the clustering approach quantified the similarity of their full time series using the euclidean distance e g fig 1 g i thereby dampening the influence of any extreme values in the time series moreover the sensitivity analysis showed that cluster assignment was consistent among all iterations for almost all watersheds lending confidence in the clustering results figure s2 the spatial distribution of the three clusters is shown in fig 4 perhaps the most striking pattern is that cluster 2 watersheds tend to be major agricultural regions in and around the great appalachian valley including the shenandoah valley as well as the lower susquehanna river region in comparison cluster 1 watersheds tend to be distributed in more forested areas in the western and northern parts of the watershed whereas cluster 3 watersheds are more scattered 3 2 rf models identified regional drivers of tn trend clusters objective 2 the exhaustive search algorithm identified three optimal rf models with similar overall oob accuracy i e 70 5 70 5 and 69 2 table 2 figure s7 these three models had the highest accuracy for cluster 1 76 cluster 2 75 and cluster 3 81 respectively indicating that each of the three models settled on a specific set of features that are most effective in explaining one of the three clusters table 2 these models have similar forms as they all include natural pct deposition mk fertilizer mk and a few other variables that represent agriculture geology and or physiography the ensemble model approach presents an advancement that combines the strength of all three optimal rf models figure s8a overall the predicted clusters for the ntn stations by the ensemble model see table s2 for full data is quite consistent with the direct result of the cluster analysis fig 4 several candidate features showed statistically significant differences among the three clusters based on the anova analysis namely natural pct deposition mk fertilizer mk crop pct and carb pct table 1 in addition the base rf model with all candidate features showed that the most important features were natural pct deposition mk fertilizer mk pointsource mk agsurplus mk manure mk and crop pct figure s4a according to the base model watersheds with declines in nitrogen loads i e cluster 2 generally correspond to watersheds with a lower percentage of natural cover a higher percentage of cropland a smaller decline in atmospheric n deposition a greater decline in agricultural fertilizer and a larger percentage of carbonate geology figure s3 moreover spearman s correlation between all the predictive features is generally low suggesting that these features provide useful and unique information toward explaining the clusters figure s4b compared with the anova analysis above partial dependence plots from the rf models provided a simultaneous and more rigorous assessment of the marginal effects of each feature thereby enhancing our capability to capture the effects of regional drivers of tn trends fig 5 for brevity we focus on cluster 2 i e declining tn loads and we note that inference of feature effects is generally consistent between cluster 2 and cluster 3 as shown by the partial dependence plots fig 5 cluster 2 is more likely to occur in watersheds with a small value of nature pct a large value of crop pct a large value of carb pct or a small value of coastal pct in terms of sources cluster 2 is more likely to occur in watersheds with large declines in fertilizer mk or agsurplus mk however the opposite effect is surprisingly observed with deposition mk these relationships are consistent with the base rf model in terms of marginal effects figure s5 these results are particularly useful for making informed management decisions when choosing priority watersheds to achieve water quality goals as well as identifying emerging risks which are summarized below 3 2 1 message 1 agricultural nutrient management contributed to water quality improvement our results show that declining tn trends cluster 2 are more likely to occur in watersheds with large declines of agricultural nonpoint sources i e agsurplus mk and fertilizer mk fig 5 it has been previously documented that declining point sources and atmospheric deposition improved water quality across the chesapeake bay watershed but agricultural nonpoint sources were thought to have limited progress however we note that these studies focused on multi decadal scales i e 1980s 2010s and did not explicitly account for agricultural surpluses agsurplus mk which indeed have been declining since the 1980s sabo et al 2022 besides being more pertinent for communicating progress to decision makers and stakeholders sabo et al 2021 agricultural surplus is likely a more relevant and temporally variable metric that captures the impacts of agriculture on n export compared to the more temporally static metrics e g land use geology physiography lin et al 2021 sabo 2018 by explicitly incorporating agricultural surpluses into the rf models this research provides a new finding toward explaining tn trends specifically our results associated with agsurplus mk suggest that tn loads in agricultural basins with historically high surpluses are more responsive to declines in agricultural surpluses than previously described sanford and pope 2013 van meter et al 2018 overall these results provide encouraging evidence to watershed managers that efforts to reduce agricultural nonpoint sources e g nutrient management plans contributed to water quality improvement in our period of analysis however more recent short term trend analysis indicates that this promising change in agricultural surplus is beginning to reverse in some areas of the bay watershed sabo et al 2022 the findings of our study are therefore relevant because river water quality depends on the progress of reducing agricultural surpluses in this regard efforts aimed toward enhancing nutrient use efficiency in agricultural production will be instrumental for further the restoration efforts chang et al 2021 sabo et al 2022 3 2 2 message 2 water quality improvements are more likely in carbonate areas but less likely in coastal plain areas our results show that cluster 2 is more likely to occur in watersheds with a large value of carb pct fig 5 this is consistent with recent findings that tn loads have declined from cropland to streams in carbonate areas of the chesapeake bay watershed ator et al 2020 ator et al 2019 due to solution cavities carbonate terrain tends to have relatively quick infiltration and faster groundwater transport than other geologic settings resulting in relatively young groundwater ages ator et al 2020 terziotti et al 2017 consequently historic n loads in groundwater from carbonate terrain were much higher than other geologic settings during periods of greater agricultural n inputs and surpluses conversely as agricultural inputs and surpluses decrease water quality improvements can be achieved more quickly i e a shorter lag in watersheds underlain by carbonate by contrast cluster 2 is less likely to occur in watersheds with a large value of coastal pct fig 5 this is consistent with recent findings that the low lying coastal plain areas have large accumulations of legacy n in the groundwater due to historical agricultural inputs and surpluses combined with longer groundwater residence times sanford and pope 2013 consequently watersheds in these areas are expected to require a much longer time to achieve water quality improvements chang et al 2021 sanford and pope 2013 zhang et al 2015 3 2 3 message 3 degrading trends in forested areas are concerning and suggest new and or remobilized n sources our results show that improving trends cluster 2 are less likely to occur in watersheds with larger proportions of forest natural pct and or greater declines in atmospheric deposition deposition mk fig 5 consistent with this pattern degrading trends cluster 3 are more likely to occur in watersheds with larger natural pct this finding is unexpected considering recent reports of declining nitrate export in some predominantly forested watersheds from the 1980s to 2012 eshleman and sabo 2016 eshleman et al 2013 and given recent evidence of n limitation in forests in similar periods mclauchlan et al 2017 sabo et al 2020 a key distinction between our work and the studies cited above is that we focus on the more recent period i e 2007 2018 therefore the degrading trends in the forested watersheds is likely a recent phenomenon which may impede the progress of watershed management toward the bay restoration while the exact mechanisms driving the degrading trends cannot be inferred from the rf models these trends can likely be explained by recent increases in n sources other than atmospheric deposition and additional data and literature provide clues to at least two explanations one apparent explanation is increasing n inputs to non forest regions of the predominantly forested watersheds in this regard independent data show that forests have generally been lost at the expense of development across the bay watershed with natural area reduced by 2 400 km2 but developed area expanded by 8 100 km2 between 1985 2018 chesapeake bay program 2017 such changes can result in increased n loads because developed lands typically export much more n than forested lands on a per unit area basis ator et al 2011 jordan et al 1997 zhang et al 2016 associated with these land use trends recently published nutrient inventories revealed increasing inputs of septic n and urban fertilizer n sources generally associated with human development sabo et al 2022 therefore expansion of human development into predominantly forested areas can at least partially explain the increased tn trend in the forested watersheds another more speculative explanation is mobilization of n from internal pools which is associated with deacidification of forest soils previously impacted by acid deposition groffman et al 2018 newcomer et al 2021 recent work suggests that decomposition in some forests is increasing as soils recover from acid deposition lawrence et al 2020 sabo et al 2020 scanlon et al 2021 which can result in increased stream tn loads despite increased vegetative uptake marinos et al 2018 rosi marshall et al 2016 3 3 rf models predicted tn trend clusters for the entire bay watershed objective 3 a strength of the optimal rf models is the ability to predict clusters of tn trends for the entire chesapeake bay watershed at the finer spatial scale of river segments the spatial distribution of the selected features at the scale of river segments is shown in fig 6 and figure s9 in general agsurplus mk and fertilizer mk show declines in most river segments over the period of record fig 6 a b similarly deposition mk shows declines in all river segments in the watershed figure s9 natural pct is the highest in the uplands and mountain ridges fig 6 c carb pct is the highest along the valley floor of the great appalachian valley fig 6 d among the 979 river segments 292 30 392 40 and 295 30 were classified as cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 respectively fig 7 see table s3 for full data for all the predicted clusters 85 had high or medium likelihood in general cluster 2 segments are located in the lower susquehanna river the eastern shore the maryland western shore and the shenandoah valley great appalachian valley cluster 3 segments are in the western susquehanna river the lower rappahannock river and the james river cluster 1 segments are on the northern and western edges of the watershed that are mainly forested and mountainous these spatial patterns are broadly consistent with the patterns of the ntn stations fig 4 notably the three clusters are not evenly distributed in terms of proximity to the bay fig 8 in general cluster 2 dominates the areas closer to the bay as distance to the bay increases the three clusters have more comparable cumulative areas these predictions are encouraging in two aspects first a large proportion 40 of the river segments have declining tn trends cluster 2 and the majority 58 of these predictions have high likelihoods 0 667 second these declining trend cluster 2 watersheds are much closer to the bay than the v shaped cluster 1 or increasing trend cluster 3 watersheds the proximity of declining trend cluster 2 watersheds to the bay can boost restoration efforts because water quality improvements in areas closer and with a direct connection to the bay are expected to have a more immediate impact on the estuarine water quality than improvements in upland areas chesapeake bay program 2017 clune et al 2021 linker et al 2013a shenk and linker 2013 overall these predictions are useful for understanding likely tn trends across the bay watershed including new information on tn trends and responses in the unmonitored areas 4 conclusions we demonstrate that machine learning approaches i e hierarchical clustering and random forest can be combined to better understand the regional patterns and drivers of tn trends in large river monitoring networks resulting in information useful for watershed management to our knowledge a combined use of these two types of machine learning approaches has not yet been implemented toward understanding regional patterns and drivers of water quality trends although this research is aimed toward the chesapeake bay watershed the combined use of clustering and classification approaches can be applied to other regional monitoring networks to address similar water quality questions our work has several contributions from both methodological and management perspectives which are summarized below 1 cluster analysis revealed distinct tn trend clusters objective 1 watersheds are complex entities that exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity but cluster analysis can help reveal similarities for the ntn stations tn trends show three distinct clusters which formed the response variable of the rf models toward identifying trend drivers leading to insights that are more generalizable from a whole watershed perspective 2 rf models identified regional drivers of tn trend clusters objective 2 the exhaustive search algorithm developed here can provide an objective way of identifying the optimal combination of explanatory variables for rf or other classification approaches the optimal rf models selected by this search algorithm can be used to quantify the relative importance and marginal effects of explanatory variables toward cluster assignments including management relevant variables that are actionable in addition our rf models explicitly incorporated temporal trends in agricultural fertilizer manure and agricultural input as well as agricultural surplus results provide encouraging evidence that improved nutrient management has resulted in declines in agricultural nonpoint sources which in turn contributed to water quality improvement in our period of analysis results also show that water quality improvements are more likely in watersheds underlain by carbonate rocks reflecting the relatively quick groundwater transport of this terrain by contrast water quality improvements are less likely in watersheds in the coastal plain reflecting the effect of legacy n in groundwater lastly results show degrading trends in forested watersheds suggesting new and or remobilized sources of n that may compromise the restoration efforts 3 rf models

15964,anthropogenic nutrient inputs have led to nutrient enrichment in many waterbodies worldwide including chesapeake bay usa river water quality integrates the spatial and temporal changes of

keywords water quality anthropogenic sources watershed management cluster analysis random forest monitoring network 1 introduction nutrient enrichment is a major issue to many inland and coastal waterbodies worldwide boesch 2019 cloern 2001 malone and newton 2020 excessive nutrients primarily nitrogen and phosphorus can originate from a variety of anthropogenic sources e g wastewater treatment facilities fertilizer atmospheric deposition whose relative contributions vary among watersheds boyer et al 2002 sabo et al 2019 van breemen et al 2002 rivers are integrators connecting source zones and receiving waterbodies e g lakes and estuaries they manifest the spatial and temporal changes in watersheds and thus provide essential information for watershed management river water quality monitoring stations have been established in many regions to quantify nutrient loads and their temporal trends which form the foundation for disentangling the effects of anthropogenic inputs one example of nutrient enrichment is chesapeake bay the largest estuary in the united states to alleviate this issue coordinated reductions of nutrient and sediment loads from the bay watershed began in the 1980s and are enforced through the 2010 chesapeake bay total maximum daily load tmdl u s environmental protection agency 2010 efforts have been made by the partnership to reduce nutrients from point sources boynton et al 2008 fisher et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b agricultural fertilizer and manure applications keisman et al 2018 and atmospheric deposition burns et al 2021 eshleman and sabo 2016 eshleman et al 2013 linker et al 2013b sabo 2018 despite some documented progress in the restoration efforts lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2022 murphy et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 continued nutrient reductions are imperative to achieve the tmdl goals in this context better understanding of regional patterns and drivers of riverine nitrogen trends is critical for effective watershed management quantifying and understanding river water quality trends have been an extensive area of research for decades yet several typical challenges remain which are relevant to chesapeake bay and elsewhere first water quality trend studies often focus on one or a few monitoring locations making conclusions difficult to generalize eshleman and sabo 2016 eshleman et al 2013 watersheds are complex entities that often exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity consequently river water quality is affected by a multitude of drivers related to nutrient sources transport and transformation which can be challenging to uncover ator et al 2020 ator et al 2019 chanat and yang 2018 nonetheless much can be learned from the similarity in water quality signals and the similarity in water quality responses to natural and anthropogenic drivers which is made possible by data from regional monitoring networks ator et al 2020 ator et al 2019 chanat and yang 2018 in this regard clustering approaches can be especially useful for categorizing regional patterns of water quality trends such approaches can reveal similarity in water quality trends among monitoring stations in the network in addition the assigned trend clusters can be further analyzed toward identifying likely drivers of trends leading to insights that are more generalizable from a whole watershed perspective relative to studies focusing on one or a few locations another challenge in understanding water quality trends is that trend attribution analyses do not often evaluate all major input sources leading to potentially inaccurate inferences from the individual studies or even contradictory inferences among studies focused on different sources in the case of chesapeake bay temporal trends of total nitrogen tn have been attributed to a diverse list of often disparate factors including atmospheric deposition ator et al 2020 burns et al 2021 eshleman and sabo 2016 eshleman et al 2013 hyer et al 2021 point sources ator et al 2020 boynton et al 2008 fisher et al 2021 hyer et al 2021 and land based nonpoint sources chanat and yang 2018 these disparities are related to the differences in the methods and data used e g n sources spatial scale temporal coverage making it challenging to uncover generalizable drivers to the entire watershed therefore it will be beneficial to systematically evaluate all major sources of n for the majority of the bay watershed with a consistent period of analysis such sources include atmospheric deposition point sources and agricultural fertilizer and manure as well as agricultural surplus that has reportedly declined across the watershed but has not yet been incorporated into any attribution analysis sabo et al 2022 in this regard classification approaches such as random forest rf can be especially useful for relating tn trend clusters which is a categorical variable to potential drivers that include watershed characteristics and major n sources a third challenge is that river monitoring networks do not necessarily cover the entire watershed resulting in missing information in ungauged subwatersheds in this regard rf models once developed based on the monitored areas can be used to predict water quality trends in the unmonitored areas in addition water quality trend analyses are often aimed at multi decadal scales consistent with the temporal span of the monitoring network ator et al 2019 chanat and yang 2018 eshleman et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 which automatically disqualify recently established stations therefore an analysis of short term trends 12 years can not only leverage valuable data from recently established stations but also provide current information for facilitating watershed management the main aim of our research was to address the above challenges and demonstrate the utility of machine learning approaches more specifically the combined use of hierarchical clustering and rf classification to reveal regional patterns and drivers of nitrogen trends we use chesapeake bay as a case study specifically the 100 stations comprising the chesapeake bay non tidal monitoring network ntn moyer and langland 2020 tango and batiuk 2016 this research involved three objectives that were achieved in a sequential manner 1 use of hierarchical clustering to categorize tn trends from 2007 2018 at the ntn stations into distinct clusters 2 development of rf models to identify the most influential explanatory variables for the tn trend clusters and 3 application of the rf models to predict tn trend clusters for the entire bay watershed at the fine scale of river segments n 979 mean area 168 km2 figure s1 overall this research provides new information to the chesapeake bay management community regarding regional patterns and drivers of short term tn trends in the field of water resources clustering approaches have been used in studies of stream health sanchez et al 2015 flood frequency sun et al 2015 and watershed characteristics wolfe et al 2019 rf and other classification approaches have been used in studies of water level guyennon et al 2021 flow indices prieto et al 2019 groundwater contamination pennino et al 2020 tesoriero et al 2017 and river water quality lin et al 2021 sabo 2018 however to our knowledge a combined use of these two types of approaches has not yet been implemented toward understanding regional patterns and drivers of water quality trends and this research is the first such attempt although this research is aimed toward the chesapeake bay watershed the combined use of clustering and classification approaches can be applied to other regional monitoring networks to address similar water quality questions 2 data and methods 2 1 ntn stations and data the chesapeake bay ntn contains 115 monitoring stations moyer and langland 2020 tango and batiuk 2016 these ntn stations have been sampled using standardized protocols and quality assurance procedures designed to compute pollutant loads and assess changes in pollutant loads over time tango and batiuk 2016 for tn and other major water quality constituents routine samples are collected monthly and eight additional storm event samples are collected per year to obtain at least 20 samples per year tango and batiuk 2016 annual flow normalized loads fnls of tn were estimated using the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds method hirsch et al 2010 and obtained from the u s geological survey moyer and langland 2020 fnls better account for the interannual variability in streamflow and are a standard product used by the chesapeake bay program partnership to communicate water quality trends across the chesapeake bay watershed the appropriateness of the wrtds method for riverine trend analysis specifically its flow normalization approach has been well documented in the literature chanat et al 2016 hirsch et al 2010 moyer et al 2012 and has been used by many national and regional water quality investigations dupas et al 2020 murphy and sprague 2019 oelsner and stets 2019 stets et al 2020 zhang and blomquist 2018 our work focuses on annual fnls of tn at the ntn stations for the period of 2007 2018 which are available at 84 stations the year 2007 was selected because 34 stations were added to the network in 2005 2007 annual fnls at three example stations are presented in fig 1 a c 2 2 hierarchical cluster analysis clustering approaches can reveal similarity in tn trends among the monitoring stations and the assigned trend clusters can be further analyzed toward identifying likely drivers of trends leading to insights that are more generalizable from a whole watershed perspective in this work agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was used to categorize fnls at the 84 ntn stations into groups that have similar temporal trends prior to cluster analysis fnls at each station were standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one to facilitate comparison of trends as opposed to magnitudes 1 f n l i t s t a n d a r d i z e d f n l i t m e a n f n l i s d f n l i where i represents a station and t represents year which ranges between 2007 and 2018 for the three example stations the standardized fnls show monotonic declines in patuxent river and opequon creek but a monotonic increase in choptank river fig 1 d f dissimilarity between the standardized fnls at the individual stations was measured using euclidean distance and linkage between clusters was determined using ward s minimum variance method ward 1963 the euclidean distance between two time series of fnls is calculated as the square root of the sum of their squared differences in each year between 2007 and 2018 fig 1 g i based on the euclidean distances patuxent river and opequon creek are most similar to each other among the three example stations while patuxent river and choptank river are most dissimilar the cluster analysis was performed in r using the hclust function in the stats r package with the ward d2 method r core team 2019 the optimal number of clusters 3 was determined by the silhouette method and visual inspection of the dendrogram kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 the dendrogram which shows the hierarchical relationship between the stations is presented in fig 2 moreover the overall trends and spatial distribution of the clusters are presented in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively as an unsupervised method cluster analysis cannot be validated using traditional approaches e g k fold cross validation since the data have no predefined labels classes nonetheless validation is still important because the clustering results depend on choices on similarity measure clustering algorithm and linkage method toward that end we adopted the resampling and re classifying procedure of wolfe et al 2019 to assess the robustness of our clustering results figure s2 specifically the 84 stations were divided into 12 independent subsets each containing seven stations subsequently 12 iterations of the cluster analysis were run in each iteration one subset of the stations n 7 was removed from the original data and the remaining stations n 77 were reanalyzed using the same clustering procedure the number of clusters was set at three to be consistent with the full data analysis the cluster assignments from these 12 iterations were then compared with those from the full data analysis to assess agreement of the assigned clusters figure s2 2 3 rf model features rf was chosen to identify factors that affect the tn trend clusters for four reasons first rf has been successful as a general purpose classification and regression approach biau and scornet 2016 and has been used in many water resources studies see references listed above it is appropriate for our work since the trend clusters are a categorical variable second rf is comparatively less sensitive to outliers and can efficiently handle non linear variables breiman 2001 hastie et al 2009 third compared with other approaches e g classification and regression tree breiman 1984 rf can produce generally more stable results due to its bagging algorithm that builds multiple trees and glues them together hastie et al 2009 fourth rf can reveal additional insights on the effects of the explanatory variables by quantifying the relative importance of the variables and the marginal effects of the variables breiman 2001 hastie et al 2009 a total of 16 explanatory variables features were considered for predicting the trend clusters i e the response variable table 1 these candidate features fall into the categories of land use n 4 geology n 1 physiography n 5 and n source trends n 6 these variables were selected because their effects on n loads and trends have been documented for the chesapeake bay watershed and elsewhere ator et al 2020 ator et al 2019 chanat and yang 2018 clune et al 2020 djodjic et al 2021 dupas et al 2016 eshleman et al 2013 hyer et al 2021 terziotti et al 2017 we note that the tn trend clusters may be further explained by other variables such as management practice implementation lintern et al 2020 sekellick et al 2019 legacy n chang et al 2021 sanford and pope 2013 riparian buffers golden et al 2019 lowrance et al 1997 and landscape configuration casquin et al 2021 however these variables were not considered in this research due to the lack of data for the ntn stations and the river segments for each station land use variables expressed in percent were quantified using the chesapeake bay program s chesapeake assessment scenario tool chesapeake bay program 2017 geology variables in percent were obtained from the u s conterminous wall to wall anthropogenic land use trends dataset falcone 2015 physiographic region variables in percent were obtained from the u s geological survey wieczorek et al 2018 for each variable above the median of annual values in the period of 2007 2018 was used for each station in addition for each station n source data were obtained from the chesapeake assessment scenario tool for applicable river segments which were summed up to obtain the annual mass rate in kg n year for each major source these annual time series were scaled by their respective long term medians to facilitate comparison of interannual trends then mann kendall trends kendall 1975 and sen s slopes sen 1968 were computed for point source pointsource mk atmospheric deposition deposition mk manure manure mk agricultural fertilizer fertilizer mk agricultural input aginput mk aginput agricultural fertilizer agricultural manure legume fixation and agricultural surplus agsurplus mk agsurplus aginput atmospheric deposition to agricultural land crop removal using the mannken function in the wq r package jassby and cloern 2016 for point source mk trends were computed for the 2007 2018 period consistent with the period of the response variable for the other sources mk trends were computed for the 1997 2018 period to allow for a 10 year extension that may account for lag effects chang et al 2021 chen et al 2014 sabo 2018 among three options of lag tested i e 10 year 5 year and 0 year the 10 year lag was determined to be most effective in modeling the response variable i e clusters due to missing values in some features the number of records for the rf analysis reduced from 84 to 78 stations see table s1 for full data each candidate feature was separately evaluated against the response variable using the one way analysis of variance anova test to examine if each feature had significant differences among the three clusters figure s3 moreover all candidate features were used to build a base model using the train function in the caret r package kuhn et al 2020 to quantify the relative importance of these features on the clusters figure s4a furthermore the spearman s correlation was calculated for each pair of features figure s4b which is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation spearman 1904 lastly for the base rf model figure s5 and subsequently selected rf models fig 5 partial dependence plots were developed using the partialplot function in the randomforest r package liaw and wiener 2002 to show the marginal effect of each feature in the model on the probability of predicted cluster i e the relationship between the predicted response and each feature while holding all other features constant 2 4 exhaustive search algorithm to determine the optimal rf model s an exhaustive search algorithm was developed and implemented in r to evaluate all possible combinations of the candidate features to constrain model complexity this algorithm was set to allow no more than six features in the rf model experimentation showed that the model accuracy reached plateau at about six features and additional features failed to improve the model accuracy see figure s6 for an example for each candidate model rf was run using the randomforest function in the randomforest r package liaw and wiener 2002 with the same parameterization i e ntree 1 000 nodesize 1 and the model performance was evaluated using the out of bag oob accuracy hastie et al 2009 2 o o b a c c u r a c y 100 o o b e r r o r similar to hold out validation techniques the oob accuracy is a powerful validation technique used especially for rf models hastie et al 2009 specifically the original data are resampled to form bootstrap samples which are used for model training records that are not contained in the bootstrap samples are called oob samples which are used for model validation by calculating the oob error i e the proportion of incorrect classifications hastie et al 2009 three optimal models with the highest oob accuracies were selected by the exhaustive search algorithm table 2 all of which showed better performance than the base model figure s7a to further evaluate these optimal models leave one out cross validation loocv was conducted which also showed better performance by the optimal models than the base model figure s7b 2 5 ensemble model approach the optimal rf models were applied to predict the cluster assignment for each ntn station in addition to the predicted classes rf also reported the probability associated with each class as determined by the proportion of votes of the trees in the ensemble the probability associated with the cluster was used as a measure of likelihood specifically a predicted cluster is deemed to have a high likelihood if probability 0 667 a medium likelihood if 0 5 probability 0 667 or a low likelihood if probability 0 5 an ensemble model approach was adopted to combine the strengths of the selected optimal models zhang et al 2021a specifically predictions from the optimal models were compared for each station and the prediction with the highest likelihood was always selected by the ensemble model approach figure s8a see table s2 for full data 2 6 rf prediction for the entire watershed the optimal rf models were applied to the entire chesapeake bay watershed to predict tn trend clusters at a finer resolution that is directly relevant for watershed management specifically we used the river segments n 979 of the chesapeake bay program s watershed model chesapeake bay program 2017 which are subwatersheds of chesapeake bay unlike the ntn stations the river segments have similar areas mean 168 km2 and they do not overlap with each other figure s1 for each river segment the tn trend cluster was predicted in two steps first the model features were prepared in the same manner as the ntn stations see fig 6 and figure s9 for maps of these features second the three optimal rf models were applied to these features to predict the trend cluster and compute the likelihood associated with each model s prediction the prediction with the highest likelihood was recorded by the ensemble model approach figure s8b see table s3 for full data note that these model predictions assume that subwatersheds should show similar riverine tn trends if they have similar watershed characteristics land use geology physiography and similar trends of n sources this is reasonable because many of the river segments are encompassed by the ntn watersheds 3 results and discussion 3 1 cluster analysis revealed distinct tn trend clusters objective 1 three clusters of annual flow normalized tn loads were identified by the cluster analysis fig 2 see table s1 for full data these clusters show unique short term 2007 2018 trends of tn load fig 3 cluster 1 n 23 has a v shape trend with an inflection point around 2011 because this inflection point coincides with an extremely wet year 2011 due to hurricane irene and tropical storm lee one possible explanation is that increasing amounts of n were mobilized and exported to streams in the following years vidon et al 2018 cluster 2 n 35 shows a monotonic decline whereas cluster 3 n 26 shows a monotonic increase these two clusters represent improving and degrading trends respectively note that these clusters focus on tn temporal trends as opposed to magnitudes for each pair of ntn stations the clustering approach quantified the similarity of their full time series using the euclidean distance e g fig 1 g i thereby dampening the influence of any extreme values in the time series moreover the sensitivity analysis showed that cluster assignment was consistent among all iterations for almost all watersheds lending confidence in the clustering results figure s2 the spatial distribution of the three clusters is shown in fig 4 perhaps the most striking pattern is that cluster 2 watersheds tend to be major agricultural regions in and around the great appalachian valley including the shenandoah valley as well as the lower susquehanna river region in comparison cluster 1 watersheds tend to be distributed in more forested areas in the western and northern parts of the watershed whereas cluster 3 watersheds are more scattered 3 2 rf models identified regional drivers of tn trend clusters objective 2 the exhaustive search algorithm identified three optimal rf models with similar overall oob accuracy i e 70 5 70 5 and 69 2 table 2 figure s7 these three models had the highest accuracy for cluster 1 76 cluster 2 75 and cluster 3 81 respectively indicating that each of the three models settled on a specific set of features that are most effective in explaining one of the three clusters table 2 these models have similar forms as they all include natural pct deposition mk fertilizer mk and a few other variables that represent agriculture geology and or physiography the ensemble model approach presents an advancement that combines the strength of all three optimal rf models figure s8a overall the predicted clusters for the ntn stations by the ensemble model see table s2 for full data is quite consistent with the direct result of the cluster analysis fig 4 several candidate features showed statistically significant differences among the three clusters based on the anova analysis namely natural pct deposition mk fertilizer mk crop pct and carb pct table 1 in addition the base rf model with all candidate features showed that the most important features were natural pct deposition mk fertilizer mk pointsource mk agsurplus mk manure mk and crop pct figure s4a according to the base model watersheds with declines in nitrogen loads i e cluster 2 generally correspond to watersheds with a lower percentage of natural cover a higher percentage of cropland a smaller decline in atmospheric n deposition a greater decline in agricultural fertilizer and a larger percentage of carbonate geology figure s3 moreover spearman s correlation between all the predictive features is generally low suggesting that these features provide useful and unique information toward explaining the clusters figure s4b compared with the anova analysis above partial dependence plots from the rf models provided a simultaneous and more rigorous assessment of the marginal effects of each feature thereby enhancing our capability to capture the effects of regional drivers of tn trends fig 5 for brevity we focus on cluster 2 i e declining tn loads and we note that inference of feature effects is generally consistent between cluster 2 and cluster 3 as shown by the partial dependence plots fig 5 cluster 2 is more likely to occur in watersheds with a small value of nature pct a large value of crop pct a large value of carb pct or a small value of coastal pct in terms of sources cluster 2 is more likely to occur in watersheds with large declines in fertilizer mk or agsurplus mk however the opposite effect is surprisingly observed with deposition mk these relationships are consistent with the base rf model in terms of marginal effects figure s5 these results are particularly useful for making informed management decisions when choosing priority watersheds to achieve water quality goals as well as identifying emerging risks which are summarized below 3 2 1 message 1 agricultural nutrient management contributed to water quality improvement our results show that declining tn trends cluster 2 are more likely to occur in watersheds with large declines of agricultural nonpoint sources i e agsurplus mk and fertilizer mk fig 5 it has been previously documented that declining point sources and atmospheric deposition improved water quality across the chesapeake bay watershed but agricultural nonpoint sources were thought to have limited progress however we note that these studies focused on multi decadal scales i e 1980s 2010s and did not explicitly account for agricultural surpluses agsurplus mk which indeed have been declining since the 1980s sabo et al 2022 besides being more pertinent for communicating progress to decision makers and stakeholders sabo et al 2021 agricultural surplus is likely a more relevant and temporally variable metric that captures the impacts of agriculture on n export compared to the more temporally static metrics e g land use geology physiography lin et al 2021 sabo 2018 by explicitly incorporating agricultural surpluses into the rf models this research provides a new finding toward explaining tn trends specifically our results associated with agsurplus mk suggest that tn loads in agricultural basins with historically high surpluses are more responsive to declines in agricultural surpluses than previously described sanford and pope 2013 van meter et al 2018 overall these results provide encouraging evidence to watershed managers that efforts to reduce agricultural nonpoint sources e g nutrient management plans contributed to water quality improvement in our period of analysis however more recent short term trend analysis indicates that this promising change in agricultural surplus is beginning to reverse in some areas of the bay watershed sabo et al 2022 the findings of our study are therefore relevant because river water quality depends on the progress of reducing agricultural surpluses in this regard efforts aimed toward enhancing nutrient use efficiency in agricultural production will be instrumental for further the restoration efforts chang et al 2021 sabo et al 2022 3 2 2 message 2 water quality improvements are more likely in carbonate areas but less likely in coastal plain areas our results show that cluster 2 is more likely to occur in watersheds with a large value of carb pct fig 5 this is consistent with recent findings that tn loads have declined from cropland to streams in carbonate areas of the chesapeake bay watershed ator et al 2020 ator et al 2019 due to solution cavities carbonate terrain tends to have relatively quick infiltration and faster groundwater transport than other geologic settings resulting in relatively young groundwater ages ator et al 2020 terziotti et al 2017 consequently historic n loads in groundwater from carbonate terrain were much higher than other geologic settings during periods of greater agricultural n inputs and surpluses conversely as agricultural inputs and surpluses decrease water quality improvements can be achieved more quickly i e a shorter lag in watersheds underlain by carbonate by contrast cluster 2 is less likely to occur in watersheds with a large value of coastal pct fig 5 this is consistent with recent findings that the low lying coastal plain areas have large accumulations of legacy n in the groundwater due to historical agricultural inputs and surpluses combined with longer groundwater residence times sanford and pope 2013 consequently watersheds in these areas are expected to require a much longer time to achieve water quality improvements chang et al 2021 sanford and pope 2013 zhang et al 2015 3 2 3 message 3 degrading trends in forested areas are concerning and suggest new and or remobilized n sources our results show that improving trends cluster 2 are less likely to occur in watersheds with larger proportions of forest natural pct and or greater declines in atmospheric deposition deposition mk fig 5 consistent with this pattern degrading trends cluster 3 are more likely to occur in watersheds with larger natural pct this finding is unexpected considering recent reports of declining nitrate export in some predominantly forested watersheds from the 1980s to 2012 eshleman and sabo 2016 eshleman et al 2013 and given recent evidence of n limitation in forests in similar periods mclauchlan et al 2017 sabo et al 2020 a key distinction between our work and the studies cited above is that we focus on the more recent period i e 2007 2018 therefore the degrading trends in the forested watersheds is likely a recent phenomenon which may impede the progress of watershed management toward the bay restoration while the exact mechanisms driving the degrading trends cannot be inferred from the rf models these trends can likely be explained by recent increases in n sources other than atmospheric deposition and additional data and literature provide clues to at least two explanations one apparent explanation is increasing n inputs to non forest regions of the predominantly forested watersheds in this regard independent data show that forests have generally been lost at the expense of development across the bay watershed with natural area reduced by 2 400 km2 but developed area expanded by 8 100 km2 between 1985 2018 chesapeake bay program 2017 such changes can result in increased n loads because developed lands typically export much more n than forested lands on a per unit area basis ator et al 2011 jordan et al 1997 zhang et al 2016 associated with these land use trends recently published nutrient inventories revealed increasing inputs of septic n and urban fertilizer n sources generally associated with human development sabo et al 2022 therefore expansion of human development into predominantly forested areas can at least partially explain the increased tn trend in the forested watersheds another more speculative explanation is mobilization of n from internal pools which is associated with deacidification of forest soils previously impacted by acid deposition groffman et al 2018 newcomer et al 2021 recent work suggests that decomposition in some forests is increasing as soils recover from acid deposition lawrence et al 2020 sabo et al 2020 scanlon et al 2021 which can result in increased stream tn loads despite increased vegetative uptake marinos et al 2018 rosi marshall et al 2016 3 3 rf models predicted tn trend clusters for the entire bay watershed objective 3 a strength of the optimal rf models is the ability to predict clusters of tn trends for the entire chesapeake bay watershed at the finer spatial scale of river segments the spatial distribution of the selected features at the scale of river segments is shown in fig 6 and figure s9 in general agsurplus mk and fertilizer mk show declines in most river segments over the period of record fig 6 a b similarly deposition mk shows declines in all river segments in the watershed figure s9 natural pct is the highest in the uplands and mountain ridges fig 6 c carb pct is the highest along the valley floor of the great appalachian valley fig 6 d among the 979 river segments 292 30 392 40 and 295 30 were classified as cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 respectively fig 7 see table s3 for full data for all the predicted clusters 85 had high or medium likelihood in general cluster 2 segments are located in the lower susquehanna river the eastern shore the maryland western shore and the shenandoah valley great appalachian valley cluster 3 segments are in the western susquehanna river the lower rappahannock river and the james river cluster 1 segments are on the northern and western edges of the watershed that are mainly forested and mountainous these spatial patterns are broadly consistent with the patterns of the ntn stations fig 4 notably the three clusters are not evenly distributed in terms of proximity to the bay fig 8 in general cluster 2 dominates the areas closer to the bay as distance to the bay increases the three clusters have more comparable cumulative areas these predictions are encouraging in two aspects first a large proportion 40 of the river segments have declining tn trends cluster 2 and the majority 58 of these predictions have high likelihoods 0 667 second these declining trend cluster 2 watersheds are much closer to the bay than the v shaped cluster 1 or increasing trend cluster 3 watersheds the proximity of declining trend cluster 2 watersheds to the bay can boost restoration efforts because water quality improvements in areas closer and with a direct connection to the bay are expected to have a more immediate impact on the estuarine water quality than improvements in upland areas chesapeake bay program 2017 clune et al 2021 linker et al 2013a shenk and linker 2013 overall these predictions are useful for understanding likely tn trends across the bay watershed including new information on tn trends and responses in the unmonitored areas 4 conclusions we demonstrate that machine learning approaches i e hierarchical clustering and random forest can be combined to better understand the regional patterns and drivers of tn trends in large river monitoring networks resulting in information useful for watershed management to our knowledge a combined use of these two types of machine learning approaches has not yet been implemented toward understanding regional patterns and drivers of water quality trends although this research is aimed toward the chesapeake bay watershed the combined use of clustering and classification approaches can be applied to other regional monitoring networks to address similar water quality questions our work has several contributions from both methodological and management perspectives which are summarized below 1 cluster analysis revealed distinct tn trend clusters objective 1 watersheds are complex entities that exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity but cluster analysis can help reveal similarities for the ntn stations tn trends show three distinct clusters which formed the response variable of the rf models toward identifying trend drivers leading to insights that are more generalizable from a whole watershed perspective 2 rf models identified regional drivers of tn trend clusters objective 2 the exhaustive search algorithm developed here can provide an objective way of identifying the optimal combination of explanatory variables for rf or other classification approaches the optimal rf models selected by this search algorithm can be used to quantify the relative importance and marginal effects of explanatory variables toward cluster assignments including management relevant variables that are actionable in addition our rf models explicitly incorporated temporal trends in agricultural fertilizer manure and agricultural input as well as agricultural surplus results provide encouraging evidence that improved nutrient management has resulted in declines in agricultural nonpoint sources which in turn contributed to water quality improvement in our period of analysis results also show that water quality improvements are more likely in watersheds underlain by carbonate rocks reflecting the relatively quick groundwater transport of this terrain by contrast water quality improvements are less likely in watersheds in the coastal plain reflecting the effect of legacy n in groundwater lastly results show degrading trends in forested watersheds suggesting new and or remobilized sources of n that may compromise the restoration efforts 3 rf models
