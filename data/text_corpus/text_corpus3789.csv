18945,algal derived dissolved organic matter adom originating from lysed microcystis aeruginosa cells was investigated as precursor material to form disinfection by products upon disinfection with free chlorine non targeted ultrahigh resolution 12 t negative mode electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms revealed high molecular diversity in solid phase extracted and ionizable components of microcystis aeruginosa adom the toxin microcystin lr was effectively degraded by free chlorine which was expected however we found a high diversity of disinfection by products associated with the addition of free chlorine to the water soluble and solid phase extractable fraction of adom and of double bond moieties in abundant and known unsaturated fatty acids aromatic dom precursors were absent from known metabolites of microcystis aeruginosa and no evidence for aromatic disinfection by products dbps was found despite n containing compounds a large diversification of n containing molecular formulas was observed after chlorination which seems indicative for the breakdown and oxidation of larger peptides additionally a diverse group of n compounds with presumed chloramine functional groups was observed this study highlights the importance to evaluate adom and its ability to form different dbps when compared to allochthonous or terrestrially derived dom keywords microcystis aeruginosa disinfection by products ft icr ms non target screening algal dom 1 introduction chloroform was the first discovered disinfection by product dbp and others followed in the 1970s rook 1974 dbps have been shown to be cytotoxic carcinogenic mutagenic and to be responsible for miscarriage and also birth defects bull et al 2011 costet et al 2012 savitz et al 2006 waller et al 1998 the known dbps are largely caused by chlorination reactions but brominated and iodinated compounds have also been discovered hua and reckhow 2006 ichihashi et al 1999 in recent years nitrogen containing dbps have been added to the dbp list bond et al 2011 chuang et al 2013 and some of these n dbps showed a drastically increased toxicity e g n nitrosodimethylamine ndma mitch et al 2003 wagner et al 2012 the first u s environmental protection agency epa regulation on dbps was introduced in 1979 after it was confirmed that chloroform and other dbps caused toxic effects regulations on dbps were expanded in 1998 and 2006 epa 2006 during the last almost 50 years of dbp research it was established that dissolved organic matter dom precursors are responsible for the formation of dbps hence research has been focused on linking specific dbps to dom ichihashi et al 1999 khiari et al 1996 zhang and minear 2002 despite tremendous effort in dbp research it is still not possible to explain the loss of about 50 of the reactive chlorine after it reacts with dom krasner et al 2006 this fact seems surprising but the tremendous complexity of dom has hampered research and the elucidation of all formed dbps hence there are remaining challenges to fully understand toxicity of still unknown dbps and the discovery of new dbps remains an active field of research to date analytical advances have supplied new approaches and tools to tackle the discovery of unknown dbps and in particular ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry has been used to decipher complex organic matrices at the molecular level mass spectrometry based non targeted screening for unknown molecular compositions have been successfully used to investigate the complexity of effluent organic matter gonsior et al 2011b tseng et al 2013 freshwater gonsior et al 2016 kellerman et al 2014 stubbins et al 2010 and marine dom abdulla et al 2010 d andrilli et al 2010 gonsior et al 2011a hurdzan et al 2008 koch et al 2008 koch et al 2005 lechtenfeld et al 2014 mopper et al 2007 perdue et al 2010 timko et al 2015 very recently this technique has also been used in dbp research gong and zhang 2015 gonsior et al 2014 lavonen et al 2013 2015 powers and gonsior 2018 zhai et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 these numerous studies have painted a complex picture of a very diverse suite of dbps that are waiting to be structurally elucidated some studies have already determined exact molecular formulas of hundreds of new dbps gong and zhang 2015 gonsior et al 2014 2015 lavonen et al 2013 2015 luek et al 2017 yu et al 2015 zhai et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 2014 most studies to date investigated dom and its linked production of dbp during disinfection with dom that was largely comprised of allochthonous material often referred to as terrestrially derived dom it still remains uncertain what kind of dbps can be formed from dom that is derived from autochthonous material or algal derived dom adom it has been recently shown that adom contributes significantly to the precursors that form known dbps goslan et al 2017 liao et al 2015 tomlinson et al 2016 yang et al 2011 additionally the formation of n dbps arising from chlorination chloramination of adom have been reported and in particular the formation of organic chloramines zhang et al 2016 adom is a substantial component of the dom pool during algal blooms zhang et al water research 2014 which is concerning if toxin producing cyanobacteria are involved the spatial extend of toxic algal blooms have been increasing in recent years and microcystin lr is a famous example of an algal toxin that is produced within cells of the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa honkanen et al 1990 this toxin producing alga has caused numerous drinking water advisories in recent years falconer 1999 jetoo et al 2015 qin et al 2010 upon disinfection with free chlorine the microcystin toxins are effectively degraded tsuji et al 1997 but disinfection also lyses cells that quickly release more toxins from within the cell zhang et al 2017 hence additional cell lysis should be avoided and removal of cells is critical prior to chlorination to avoid the release of toxins into the water in fact additional operational changes should be implemented at drinking water treatment facilities to destroy the toxin but also to prevent lysis of these cyanobacteria cells westrick et al 2010 for example activated carbon can effectively remove microcystins and it is often used in mitigating problems arising from toxic algal blooms dixon et al 2011 falconer et al 1989 roegner et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 but other treatments have also been applied roegner et al 2014 a recent study modeled the degradation of microcystin lr upon treatment with free chlorine and also uv chlorine duan et al 2018 a combined approach of activated carbon and chlorination with free chlorine is implemented in most cases himberg et al 1989 although chlorination inactivates microcystin lr little is known about additional disinfection by products dbps that can be formed as a result of the chlorination of adom previous work has largely focused on dbps formed from terrestrially derived dom refs with a largely polyphenolic composition and is very different from adom zhang et al 2014 furthermore most studies on adom to date have been focused on evaluating the production of known and regulated dbps tomlinson et al 2016 this approach is limited because adom may have very different precursors and hence may produce very different dbps that may have not yet been discovered the risk of adom related dbps has been recently acknowledged zong et al 2015 and warrants a more in depth investigation the use of non targeted approaches like high resolution mass spectrometry provides the opportunity to study adom related dbps in a more holistic way in this study non targeted screening of unknown dbps that formed during disinfection of adom generated from lysed microcystis aeruginosa cells was conducted using negative mode electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms this non targeted approach is capable of determining exact molecular formulas of dbps gonsior et al 2014 2015 lavonen et al 2013 that can then be directly related to adom sources furthermore a network approach was used to visualize proposed reaction pathways of hypochlorous acid and dbp precursor molecules 2 methods 2 1 culturing of microcystis aeruginosa the culture medium to grow m aeruginosa was based on the sn recipe waterbury et al 1986 but was modified to contain no nacl and organic ingredients no edta and vitamin b12 a m aeruginosa strain le3 containing high levels of microcystin lr was initially maintained in bg11 medium with added vitamin b12 utex org on a 12 h light dark cycle at 50 μmols photons cm 2 s 1 the media was then changed to the sn recipe exchanged weekly and cultures were scaled to 1 l prior to harvest after 2 weeks 2 2 lysis of cells and chlorination experiments the cellular fraction of cultured m aeruginosa was collected by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min the supernatant was decanted and cell pellets were suspended in 2 ml of deionized water in each centrifuge vial resulting in a total volume of 50 ml suspended cells in the 50 ml solution were lysed using a barocycler pressure biosciences with 30 cycles at 34 k psi for 45 s with 15 s intervals in polypropylene tubes the media that contained no cells was vacuum filtered through heat treated 4 h at 500 c 0 7 μm gf f glass fiber filters whatman approximately 200 ml of the diluted media sample without cells was reserved and underwent no further treatment blank sample 50 mg l 1 heat treated 500 c nacl extra pure acros chemicals was added to another 200 ml of initial media solution nacl blank the remaining 1147 ml of the 50 mg l 1 nacl media solution no cells was chlorinated for 3 h using an electrochlorination unit chlormaker saltwater chlorine generator controlomatic inc to achieve a free chlorine concentration of about 10 mg l 1 exact free chlorine concentration is given in table 1 the electrochlorination system was used because commercially available hypochlorite solutions are not sufficiently pure to be used in sensitive mass spectrometric approaches this 10 mg l 1 free chlorine nacl media solution was then divided into 3 samples in heate treated 500 c borosilicate bottles and reacted for 24 h at room temperature this blank treatment was undertaken to compare with the chlorinated lysate samples and to account for potential halogenated products that might have been caused by organic compounds present in the media itself free chlorine concentrations were determined at the beginning of the experiments and again after 24 h free chlorine contact time using hach method 8021 usepa dpd method for free chlorine with a hach auto analyzer and the hach free chlorine reagent 10 ml standards were generated by diluting a 27 6 0 1 mg l 1 low range chlorine standard solution hach with ultrapure water for all lysate experiments solutions were created by adding highly concentrated lysate solution to achieve a concentration of about 10 mg l 1in pure water and then samples were filtered through 0 7 μm gf f glass fiber filters a lysate blank and nacl blank were prepared in the same way than the media samples table 1 but 50 mg l 1 nacl was added to one of the two lysate blank solutions about 650 ml of 50 mg l 1 nacl solution containing no lysate was then chlorinated for 2 h using the electro chlorination unit to reach a free chlorine concentration of 11 1 mg l 1 this free chlorine containing solution was then divided into three replicates and concentrated lysate solution was added to each replicate to reach final dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of about 10 mg l 1 exact concentrations of free chlorine doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn are given in table 1 the lysate was then chlorinated for 24 h and sub samples were used to analyze the remaining free chlorine doc and tdn concentrations and to determine optical properties the remaining solutions of each replicate sample media blanks and lysates were acidified to ph 2 using concentrated hcl and solid phase extracted described below exact extraction volumes of each sample are given in table 1 the ph during all chlorination experiments was at ph 5 which meant that hypochlorous acid hocl was the predominant reactive species it cannot be ruled out that other reactive species play a role in chlorination of adom during the solid phase extraction procedure at ph 2 but the contact time at ph 2 was held short and below 1 h 2 3 dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn analyses subsamples of the untreated and treated lysate and media samples were 0 2 μm filtered whatman acetate cellulose syringe filters and acidified to ph 2 5 using concentrated hcl pure 32 ca solution in water sigma aldrich for doc and tdn analysis doc and tdn concentrations were determined using a shimadzu total carbon analyzer toc vcph analyzer with tnm 1 unit with potassium hydrogen phthalate and potassium nitrate as standards respectively 2 4 determination of optical properties of adom all samples were filtered through 0 2 μm whatman acetate cellulose syringe filters and then filled into a 1 cm fluorescence cuvette the cuvette was placed in a horiba aqualog system which is able to simultaneously measure absorbance and fluorescence for each absorbance excitation wavelength a fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded at 3 28 nm intervals at a fixed range between 220 4 and 596 9 nm and a 5 s integration time to generate excitation emission matrix spectra eems because dom always fluoresces at longer wavelengths than it absorbs only emission data from excitation wavelengths 220 550 nm were considered for generating eem spectra rayleigh and raman scattering signals were removed from all eem spectra in matlab using methods described previously zepp et al 2004 and any inner filter effects were corrected using the aqualog software eem spectra were then normalized to the emission at 450 nm of a starna standard reference 1 ppm quinine sulfate solution in 0 1 m hclo4 using 0 1 m hclo4 as the quinine sulfate blank excitation at 347 5 nm 3 28 nm emission interval 5 s integration 2 5 solid phase extraction spe of adom to be able to use mass spectrometry all samples needed to be desalted and we used an established solid phase extraction spe procedure dittmar et al 2008 using the proprietary polymeric agilent bond elut ppl resin all sample blanks and chlorinated samples were acidified to ph 2 as described above these samples were then drawn through clean teflon tubing rinsed with ph 2 ultrapure water and connected to 200 mg agilent ppl cartridges at a flow rate of 5 ml min until sample solutions had passed through the cartridges after extraction all cartridges were rinsed with 2 ml 0 1 formic acid water sigma aldrich dried under n2 and eluted with 2 ml pure methanol lc ms chromasolv sigma aldrich into heat treated 500 c amber glass vials all methanol extracts were stored at 20 c prior to mass spectrometric analysis the extraction efficiency was about 10 possibly due to extensive loss of highly polar saccharides and small organic acids which are too polar to be extracted however dbp precursors are expected to be extracted due to the required presence of various degrees of unsaturation or aromaticity in the carbon backbone and hence enhanced hydrophobic or mesophilic interaction with the resin the results from replicates indicated that the extractable component was very reproducible between samples regardless highly polar dbps are lost during solid phase extraction and the presented results are only addressing the extractable and ionizable component of adom 2 6 ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry we used ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to characterize adom and the possible production of dbps upon chlorination and a bruker solarix 12 t fourier transform ft ion cyclotron resonance icr mass spectrometer ionization was achieved using negative ion mode electrospray ionization esi the spray voltage was set to 3 6 kv the methanolic adom sample was diluted with pure methanol sigma aldrich chromasolv at a ratio of 1 20 to avoid oversaturation and possible space charge effects in the ion cyclotron resonance trap the flow rate was held constant a 2 μl min 1 and 500 scans were averaged the autosampler was programmed to wash with 600 μl 80 meoh 20 water between each run to lower the risk of carryover blank methanol samples were run between samples mass accuracy was 0 2 ppm and accurate molecular formula assignments were combinatorial based on the following atomic numbers 12c0 1h0 16o0 30 14n0 10 32s0 2 and 35cl0 5 as well as the 13c 34s and 37cl isotopologues more details about accurate formula assignments and post calibration can be found elsewhere gonsior et al 2009 2011a koch et al 2007 van krevelen or elemental diagrams dittmar 2008 flerus et al 2012 gonsior et al 2009 2011a 2013 hertkorn et al 2008 kim et al 2003 sleighter and hatcher 2008 and a modified kendrick plot gonsior et al 2013 shakeri yekta et al 2012 were used to visualize ft icr ms data additionally the aromaticity equivalent xc parameter yassine et al 2014 was used to visualize the saturation stages of presumed chlorinated fatty acids this xc is essentially a proxy for the degree of saturation of each annotated molecular formula 2 7 mass difference network reconstruction theoretical ion masses of the above assigned cho molecular formulas were used to generate the mass difference network theoretical ion masses nodes were connected by edges if their mass differences were equal 0 ppm to the theoretical mass differences of δhocl 51 971593 amu mass difference networks were visualized using the open source gephi software yifan hu layout this technique has been previously described in greater detail tziotis et al 2011 3 results and discussion the chlorination of water soluble microcystis aeruginosa dom or adom revealed that between 4 3 and 5 1 mg l 1 free chlorine was consumed table 1 within 24 h the initial free chlorine concentration was 11 1 mg l 1 and initial doc concentrations ranged between 8 3 and 9 5 mg l 1 c changes in doc and tdn concentrations were minimal during chlorination adom showed a few absorbance features e g peaks at 320 440 and 680 nm that were not present after chlorination supplementary material fig s1a absorbance of the media blank also decreased after chlorination figs s1a b this result is not surprising because a decrease in absorbance and electron donating capacity of dom is expected and decreases in absorbance of three dom isolates from the international humic substances society suwannee river fulvic acid suwannee river humic acid and pony lake fulvic acid were also previously observed when reacted with free chlorine wenk et al 2013 eem spectra revealed 3 distinct fluorescence features with peaks at excitation emission wavelength pairs of 275 325 nm 270 450 nm and a broad peak at 350 380 420 480 nm supplementary material figs s1c and d fluorescence signals with large stokes shifts have typically been attributed to humic like materials e g 250 450 but have also been observed in picocyanobacteria dom zhao et al 2017 it is interesting to note that aromatic compounds and humic material in general typically yields higher dbp formation when compared to non humic materials tak and vellanki 2018 integrated fluorescence normalized to absorbance spectra showed that excitation at 270 nm was most efficient followed by a peak at 360 nm for algal dom supplementary material figs s1e and f these fluorescence features were completely destroyed below detection limit after 24 h chlorination supplementary material figs s1e h indicating that the compounds responsible for these fluorescence signatures are likely dbp precursors the chemodiversity as defined by all assigned molecular formulas of adom confirmed the very different nature of adom when compared to freshwater or estuarine dom in van krevelen space van krevelen 1950 fig 1 this is not surprising given the limited molecular diversity of biomolecules arising from lysed cyanobacteria cells abundant features in adom were fatty acids and some high intensity nitrogen containing compounds which are likely peptides however any suggested structures cannot be confirmed by ft icr ms alone because ft icr ms does not give any information on structure beyond that what can be inferred from a molecular formula alone overall the majority of assigned formulas have a h c ratio greater than 1 2 within the analytical window of negative mode esi ft icr ms and indicates that this pool is unlikely to contain substantial aromatic moieties even if aliphatic side chains are present however slightly unsaturated compounds h c ratios of 1 2 2 are present and are rather diverse in the cho pool heteroatomic formulas containing nitrogen or sulfur spanning also a specific range of h c 1 2 2 2 and o c 0 1 0 6 ratios in van krevelen space figs 1 and 3 within the nitrogen containing formulas chno nitrogen containing aromatic rings may be present at around h c of 1 2 e g pyrroles with aliphatic side chains which might explain the observed fluorescence in adom as suggested in a previous study however this assessment is based on previous work on picocyanobacteria and has not been confirmed using nmr in this study zhao et al 2017 a large increase in chemodiversity was observed after chlorination and the production of diverse dbps was demonstrated before and after chlorination an arbitrary example of the observed differences between mass spectra is given at nominal mass nm 369 fig 2 it is clear from the comparison between ms spectra before and after chlorination that adom was substantially changed figs 2 and 3 including the complete removal of compounds i e molecular formulas found before chlorination that were not present after chlorination based on formula assignment criteria and the production of new compounds i e molecular formulas that were not assigned before chlorination a more in depth direct comparison of non halogenated compounds showed that all high intensity c18 molecular ions containing two oxygen atoms were transformed or degraded upon chlorination fig 3 and the cho pool decreased in diversity occupying a smaller area within van krevelen space and fewer formula assignments similarly the highest abundant nitrogen containing ions were completely degraded which gives rise to the suggestion that these molecular ions represent peptides because peptides are effectively degraded upon chlorination including the microcystin lr toxin itself fig 3 in contrast to the cho pool the chemodiversity of chno molecular ions dramatically increased from 231 to 1362 assigned molecular formulas this increase could also indicate the effective degradation of peptides or proteins into smaller molecules upon chlorination a comparison between the molecular weight before and after chlorination also confirmed the production of complex smaller n containing m z ions supplementary material fig s2 another possible explanation of the extreme diversification of chno signatures is that the precursors of the produced chno formulas were chemically modified in such a way that they became much more efficient in forming ions during electrospray ionization all of these newly formed chno molecules have to be considered as dbps the chos signatures that could not be explained with presumably sulfonic acids and surfactants see red circles fig 3 were also effectively degraded this comparison between molecular signatures before and after chlorination without the incorporation of chlorine atoms already demonstrated that chlorination transformed the adom in a profound way however most regulated dbps are halogenated and the production of organohalides upon disinfection remains a focus in dbp research formula assignments with up to 5 chlorine atoms were assessed to elaborate the production of new chlorinated dbps arising from chlorination of adom all these assigned chlorine containing formulas were confirmed using isotope simulation for an example see supplementary material fig s3 the most abundant chlorinated dbps were assigned to a c18 backbone and contained between 1 and 5 chlorine atoms the most abundant c18 dbps contained 3 chlorine atoms fig 4 but several c18 dbps with 2 and 4 chlorines were also observed c18 dbps that contained 5 chlorine atoms could be assigned to four specific m z ions to visualize the abundance and aromaticity equivalent of all c18 molecular formulas we used van krevelen and the so called xc diagram yassine et al 2014 fig 4 the parameter xc was previously introduced as a measure for aromaticity and in this case to separate c18 compounds of different degree of unsaturation different numbers of xc at any given carbon number e g c18 may indicate different numbers of double bonds where higher numbers mean a higher degree of double bonds it can be clearly seen that at carbon number 18 the saturation of double bonds decreased sharply the xc after chlorination fig 4 panel b and c indicative of the addition reaction of free chlorine to double bonds in these presumed fatty acids another way to look at changes in saturation is using the carbon oxidation state cos of each assigned formula it can be clearly seen that all molecular formulas with 18 carbon atoms changed to a higher carbon oxidation state including an increase in molecular weight due to the incorporation of chlorine supplementary material fig s4 these chlorinated c18 dbps showed the highest intensity in the ms spectra and raised the question about possible precursors given the observed complete removal no m z ions found in chlorinated samples of c18 molecular ions upon chlorination and the likely very low degree of aromatic structures within the cho pool leads to the assumption that only additions of free chlorine on double bonds are viable options for compounds not containing any heteroatoms other than oxygen cho compounds only to test this hypothesis a mass difference network was computed to probe transformation pathways that represent hocl addition reactions in this data driven analytical approach nodes represent experimental m z values and edges connections within the network represent exact mass differences which are equivalent to a net molecular formula of a chemical reaction tziotis et al 2011 comprehensive chemical reactivity of thousands of different molecules can be studied simultaneously via this approach ruf et al 2017 here this network analysis was performed with c18 compounds only as inferred from experimental ft icr ms data reaction equivalent chemical transformations of 1 up to 5 hocl molecules with any given c18ho molecular formula present prior chlorination were investigated fig 5 the results indicate that all 42 chlorinated c18 dbps might be related to the observed 43 c18ho precursors via hocl addition reactions in other words all molecular formulas tested c18 compounds with and without chlorine can be related by the transformations or nodes in the network fig 5 we hypothesize that the lost c18 precursors are all unsaturated fatty acids of various degrees it should be noted here that although esi ft icr ms allows for unambiguous and exact molecular formula assignments structures cannot be determined due to the unknown number of isomers for any given molecular formula however the fatty acid composition of microcystis aeruginosa is well known and most abundant unsaturated fatty acids are 18 4ω3 18 3ω3 18 3ω6 and 18 2ω6 which had reported concentrations of 4 95 4 05 1 57 and 0 87 mg fatty acids g 1 respectively hayakawa et al 2002 making them the likely c18 precursors for the chlorinated c18 dbps these fatty acids correspond to the trivial names of stearidonic acid α linolenic acid γ linolenic acid and linoleic acid respectively all these unsaturated fatty acids are well documented in algal cells and corresponded to the presumed fatty acids that were removed upon chlorination thus we undertook collision induced dissociation ms ms experiments on three of the proposed fatty acids to confirm structures supplementary material fig s9 although we cannot determine concentrations of these fatty acids using this approach the ms ms spectra of stearidonic linolenic and linoleic acid matched published spectral records mt000005 mt000072 and mt000114 respectively in the massbank database horai et al 2010 supplementary material fig s9 a diverse group of hydroxylated unsaturated fatty acids also might be present in adom due to oxidative transformations or via other hydroxylated unsaturated fatty acids that are present in metabolic pathways proposed putative reactions of these fatty acids to form chlorinated fatty acid dbps are given in supplementary material figs s5 s7 the presence of additional c18 dbps indicated their formation via hydroxylated unsaturated fatty acids in the adom 17 hydroxylinolenic acid is known to be involved in α linolenic acid metabolism this compound might be an additional precursor for dbps its proposed reaction pathway with hocl is given in the supplementary material fig s8 previous studies showed that chlorination of fatty acids is likely due to the reaction with hocl and not ocl winterbourn et al 1992 furthermore the addition of single hocl molecules was not the only reaction observed but also the addition of 2 chlorine atoms on a single double bond which is consistent with previous studies dembitsky and srebnik 2002 winterbourn et al 1992 the multiple addition of hocl on all existing double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids have been shown to be fast and almost stoichiometric winterbourn et al 1992 the presence of chlorinated fatty acids with 5 cl atoms can only be explained by the addition of two chlorine atoms to at least one double bond of the stearidonic acid supplementary online material fig s7 we would have found a single addition of hocl on linolenic or stearidonic acid if a single addition of hocl would be possible on unsaturated fatty acids containing several double bonds which was not the case the mass difference network analysis creates a framework of possible transformation pathways and it took only the addition of hocl into account fig 5 these results underline the feasibility to explain the formation of all observed c18 dbps fig 5 isotopically labeled hocl was previously used to trace its incorporation into lipids ghanbari et al 1982 and the authors confirmed two chlorinated products after the reaction of oleic acid and ho36cl a fast addition of hocl on fatty acids was also shown in the context of drinking water disinfection gibson et al 1986 chlorinated nitrogen containing dbps were also confirmed that predominantly showed the incorporation of one chlorine atom but a few two and three chlorine single molecules were also found fig 6 in total 283 chlorinated n dbps were confirmed using isotope simulation fig 6 a very diverse suite of non halogenatedn dbps with a large molecular weight range between 200 da and 700 da and an intensity weighted center of mass of 456 5 were also observed fig 6 no change in the degree of saturation was observed after chlorination as expressed in the xc diagrams fig 6 which suggests the formation of chloramines rather than any reaction of chlorine on the carbon backbone the large diversification of unchlorinated n dbps might be due to fragmentation of larger peptides or proteins but this hypothesis remains to be confirmed in future studies the newly described dbps in this study demonstrated the need to describe adom related dbps in greater detail and the used non targeted approach demonstrated the existence of a very diverse group of dbps that are specific to adom results from this study might be used to address potential toxicity of halogenated fatty acids furthermore the very high diversity of n dbps halogenated and non halogenated is equally of concern and should be a focus point of additional studies 4 conclusions algal derived dom from lysed microcystis aeruginosa cells was drastically transformed upon chlorination with free chlorine no changes in doc concentration were observed after chlorination but adom absorbance peaks were removed and or reduced and adom fluorescence signals were completely removed supplementary material fig s1 because only a portion of the entire adom absorbs and fluoresces light non targeted high resolution mass spectrometry was used to gain molecular level understanding of the changes in adom before and after chlorination this adom showed a chlorination of presumed unsaturated fatty acids containing up to 5 chlorine atoms and could be explained by addition of hocl to the double bonds in individual fatty acids although we could not determine concentrations of these fatty acids in our adom sample which would be critical for determining potential toxicity chlorinated fatty acids have been previously confirmed as dbps in effluent from paper mills that still used chlorination for bleaching voss and rapsomatiotis 1985 wesén et al 1992 furthermore diverse suite of halogenated fatty acids have been confirmed to occur naturally and are summarized elsewhere dembitsky and srebnik 2002 thus chlorinated fatty acids warrant further investigation when algal dom is a major dbp precursor or bloom conditions are present the diversity of n containing dbps with and without chlorine present increased almost 10 fold and chlorinated n dbps might reflect an effective production of complex and high molecular weight chloramines but their stability remains unknown a potential anthropogenic source of chlorinated lipids is of interest because they may be involved in inflammatory disease spickett 2007 and has been a focus point in recent years this study warrants further studies in quantifying halogenated fatty acids and in understanding the formation of diverse n dbps from adom and potentially other algal dom sources

other dbps caused toxic effects regulations on dbps were expanded in 1998 and 2006 epa 2006 during the last almost 50 years of dbp research it was established that dissolved organic matter dom precursors are responsible for the formation of dbps hence research has been focused on linking specific dbps to dom ichihashi et al 1999 khiari et al 1996 zhang and minear 2002 despite tremendous effort in dbp research it is still not possible to explain the loss of about 50 of the reactive chlorine after it reacts with dom krasner et al 2006 this fact seems surprising but the tremendous complexity of dom has hampered research and the elucidation of all formed dbps hence there are remaining challenges to fully understand toxicity of still unknown dbps and the discovery of new dbps remains an active field of research to date analytical advances have supplied new approaches and tools to tackle the discovery of unknown dbps and in particular ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry has been used to decipher complex organic matrices at the molecular level mass spectrometry based non targeted screening for unknown molecular compositions have been successfully used to investigate the complexity of effluent organic matter gonsior et al 2011b tseng et al 2013 freshwater gonsior et al 2016 kellerman et al 2014 stubbins et al 2010 and marine dom abdulla et al 2010 d andrilli et al 2010 gonsior et al 2011a hurdzan et al 2008 koch et al 2008 koch et al 2005 lechtenfeld et al 2014 mopper et al 2007 perdue et al 2010 timko et al 2015 very recently this technique has also been used in dbp research gong and zhang 2015 gonsior et al 2014 lavonen et al 2013 2015 powers and gonsior 2018 zhai et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 these numerous studies have painted a complex picture of a very diverse suite of dbps that are waiting to be structurally elucidated some studies have already determined exact molecular formulas of hundreds of new dbps gong and zhang 2015 gonsior et al 2014 2015 lavonen et al 2013 2015 luek et al 2017 yu et al 2015 zhai et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 2014 most studies to date investigated dom and its linked production of dbp during disinfection with dom that was largely comprised of allochthonous material often referred to as terrestrially derived dom it still remains uncertain what kind of dbps can be formed from dom that is derived from autochthonous material or algal derived dom adom it has been recently shown that adom contributes significantly to the precursors that form known dbps goslan et al 2017 liao et al 2015 tomlinson et al 2016 yang et al 2011 additionally the formation of n dbps arising from chlorination chloramination of adom have been reported and in particular the formation of organic chloramines zhang et al 2016 adom is a substantial component of the dom pool during algal blooms zhang et al water research 2014 which is concerning if toxin producing cyanobacteria are involved the spatial extend of toxic algal blooms have been increasing in recent years and microcystin lr is a famous example of an algal toxin that is produced within cells of the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa honkanen et al 1990 this toxin producing alga has caused numerous drinking water advisories in recent years falconer 1999 jetoo et al 2015 qin et al 2010 upon disinfection with free chlorine the microcystin toxins are effectively degraded tsuji et al 1997 but disinfection also lyses cells that quickly release more toxins from within the cell zhang et al 2017 hence additional cell lysis should be avoided and removal of cells is critical prior to chlorination to avoid the release of toxins into the water in fact additional operational changes should be implemented at drinking water treatment facilities to destroy the toxin but also to prevent lysis of these cyanobacteria cells westrick et al 2010 for example activated carbon can effectively remove microcystins and it is often used in mitigating problems arising from toxic algal blooms dixon et al 2011 falconer et al 1989 roegner et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 but other treatments have also been applied roegner et al 2014 a recent study modeled the degradation of microcystin lr upon treatment with free chlorine and also uv chlorine duan et al 2018 a combined approach of activated carbon and chlorination with free chlorine is implemented in most cases himberg et al 1989 although chlorination inactivates microcystin lr little is known about additional disinfection by products dbps that can be formed as a result of the chlorination of adom previous work has largely focused on dbps formed from terrestrially derived dom refs with a largely polyphenolic composition and is very different from adom zhang et al 2014 furthermore most studies on adom to date have been focused on evaluating the production of known and regulated dbps tomlinson et al 2016 this approach is limited because adom may have very different precursors and hence may produce very different dbps that may have not yet been discovered the risk of adom related dbps has been recently acknowledged zong et al 2015 and warrants a more in depth investigation the use of non targeted approaches like high resolution mass spectrometry provides the opportunity to study adom related dbps in a more holistic way in this study non targeted screening of unknown dbps that formed during disinfection of adom generated from lysed microcystis aeruginosa cells was conducted using negative mode electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms this non targeted approach is capable of determining exact molecular formulas of dbps gonsior et al 2014 2015 lavonen et al 2013 that can then be directly related to adom sources furthermore a network approach was used to visualize proposed reaction pathways of hypochlorous acid and dbp precursor molecules 2 methods 2 1 culturing of microcystis aeruginosa the culture medium to grow m aeruginosa was based on the sn recipe waterbury et al 1986 but was modified to contain no nacl and organic ingredients no edta and vitamin b12 a m aeruginosa strain le3 containing high levels of microcystin lr was initially maintained in bg11 medium with added vitamin b12 utex org on a 12 h light dark cycle at 50 μmols photons cm 2 s 1 the media was then changed to the sn recipe exchanged weekly and cultures were scaled to 1 l prior to harvest after 2 weeks 2 2 lysis of cells and chlorination experiments the cellular fraction of cultured m aeruginosa was collected by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min the supernatant was decanted and cell pellets were suspended in 2 ml of deionized water in each centrifuge vial resulting in a total volume of 50 ml suspended cells in the 50 ml solution were lysed using a barocycler pressure biosciences with 30 cycles at 34 k psi for 45 s with 15 s intervals in polypropylene tubes the media that contained no cells was vacuum filtered through heat treated 4 h at 500 c 0 7 μm gf f glass fiber filters whatman approximately 200 ml of the diluted media sample without cells was reserved and underwent no further treatment blank sample 50 mg l 1 heat treated 500 c nacl extra pure acros chemicals was added to another 200 ml of initial media solution nacl blank the remaining 1147 ml of the 50 mg l 1 nacl media solution no cells was chlorinated for 3 h using an electrochlorination unit chlormaker saltwater chlorine generator controlomatic inc to achieve a free chlorine concentration of about 10 mg l 1 exact free chlorine concentration is given in table 1 the electrochlorination system was used because commercially available hypochlorite solutions are not sufficiently pure to be used in sensitive mass spectrometric approaches this 10 mg l 1 free chlorine nacl media solution was then divided into 3 samples in heate treated 500 c borosilicate bottles and reacted for 24 h at room temperature this blank treatment was undertaken to compare with the chlorinated lysate samples and to account for potential halogenated products that might have been caused by organic compounds present in the media itself free chlorine concentrations were determined at the beginning of the experiments and again after 24 h free chlorine contact time using hach method 8021 usepa dpd method for free chlorine with a hach auto analyzer and the hach free chlorine reagent 10 ml standards were generated by diluting a 27 6 0 1 mg l 1 low range chlorine standard solution hach with ultrapure water for all lysate experiments solutions were created by adding highly concentrated lysate solution to achieve a concentration of about 10 mg l 1in pure water and then samples were filtered through 0 7 μm gf f glass fiber filters a lysate blank and nacl blank were prepared in the same way than the media samples table 1 but 50 mg l 1 nacl was added to one of the two lysate blank solutions about 650 ml of 50 mg l 1 nacl solution containing no lysate was then chlorinated for 2 h using the electro chlorination unit to reach a free chlorine concentration of 11 1 mg l 1 this free chlorine containing solution was then divided into three replicates and concentrated lysate solution was added to each replicate to reach final dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of about 10 mg l 1 exact concentrations of free chlorine doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn are given in table 1 the lysate was then chlorinated for 24 h and sub samples were used to analyze the remaining free chlorine doc and tdn concentrations and to determine optical properties the remaining solutions of each replicate sample media blanks and lysates were acidified to ph 2 using concentrated hcl and solid phase extracted described below exact extraction volumes of each sample are given in table 1 the ph during all chlorination experiments was at ph 5 which meant that hypochlorous acid hocl was the predominant reactive species it cannot be ruled out that other reactive species play a role in chlorination of adom during the solid phase extraction procedure at ph 2 but the contact time at ph 2 was held short and below 1 h 2 3 dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn analyses subsamples of the untreated and treated lysate and media samples were 0 2 μm filtered whatman acetate cellulose syringe filters and acidified to ph 2 5 using concentrated hcl pure 32 ca solution in water sigma aldrich for doc and tdn analysis doc and tdn concentrations were determined using a shimadzu total carbon analyzer toc vcph analyzer with tnm 1 unit with potassium hydrogen phthalate and potassium nitrate as standards respectively 2 4 determination of optical properties of adom all samples were filtered through 0 2 μm whatman acetate cellulose syringe filters and then filled into a 1 cm fluorescence cuvette the cuvette was placed in a horiba aqualog system which is able to simultaneously measure absorbance and fluorescence for each absorbance excitation wavelength a fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded at 3 28 nm intervals at a fixed range between 220 4 and 596 9 nm and a 5 s integration time to generate excitation emission matrix spectra eems because dom always fluoresces at longer wavelengths than it absorbs only emission data from excitation wavelengths 220 550 nm were considered for generating eem spectra rayleigh and raman scattering signals were removed from all eem spectra in matlab using methods described previously zepp et al 2004 and any inner filter effects were corrected using the aqualog software eem spectra were then normalized to the emission at 450 nm of a starna standard reference 1 ppm quinine sulfate solution in 0 1 m hclo4 using 0 1 m hclo4 as the quinine sulfate blank excitation at 347 5 nm 3 28 nm emission interval 5 s integration 2 5 solid phase extraction spe of adom to be able to use mass spectrometry all samples needed to be desalted and we used an established solid phase extraction spe procedure dittmar et al 2008 using the proprietary polymeric agilent bond elut ppl resin all sample blanks and chlorinated samples were acidified to ph 2 as described above these samples were then drawn through clean teflon tubing rinsed with ph 2 ultrapure water and connected to 200 mg agilent ppl cartridges at a flow rate of 5 ml min until sample solutions had passed through the cartridges after extraction all cartridges were rinsed with 2 ml 0 1 formic acid water sigma aldrich dried under n2 and eluted with 2 ml pure methanol lc ms chromasolv sigma aldrich into heat treated 500 c amber glass vials all methanol extracts were stored at 20 c prior to mass spectrometric analysis the extraction efficiency was about 10 possibly due to extensive loss of highly polar saccharides and small organic acids which are too polar to be extracted however dbp precursors are expected to be extracted due to the required presence of various degrees of unsaturation or aromaticity in the carbon backbone and hence enhanced hydrophobic or mesophilic interaction with the resin the results from replicates indicated that the extractable component was very reproducible between samples regardless highly polar dbps are lost during solid phase extraction and the presented results are only addressing the extractable and ionizable component of adom 2 6 ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry we used ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to characterize adom and the possible production of dbps upon chlorination and a bruker solarix 12 t fourier transform ft ion cyclotron resonance icr mass spectrometer ionization was achieved using negative ion mode electrospray ionization esi the spray voltage was set to 3 6 kv the methanolic adom sample was diluted with pure methanol sigma aldrich chromasolv at a ratio of 1 20 to avoid oversaturation and possible space charge effects in the ion cyclotron resonance trap the flow rate was held constant a 2 μl min 1 and 500 scans were averaged the autosampler was programmed to wash with 600 μl 80 meoh 20 water between each run to lower the risk of carryover blank methanol samples were run between samples mass accuracy was 0 2 ppm and accurate molecular formula assignments were combinatorial based on the following atomic numbers 12c0 1h0 16o0 30 14n0 10 32s0 2 and 35cl0 5 as well as the 13c 34s and 37cl isotopologues more details about accurate formula assignments and post calibration can be found elsewhere gonsior et al 2009 2011a koch et al 2007 van krevelen or elemental diagrams dittmar 2008 flerus et al 2012 gonsior et al 2009 2011a 2013 hertkorn et al 2008 kim et al 2003 sleighter and hatcher 2008 and a modified kendrick plot gonsior et al 2013 shakeri yekta et al 2012 were used to visualize ft icr ms data additionally the aromaticity equivalent xc parameter yassine et al 2014 was used to visualize the saturation stages of presumed chlorinated fatty acids this xc is essentially a proxy for the degree of saturation of each annotated molecular formula 2 7 mass difference network reconstruction theoretical ion masses of the above assigned cho molecular formulas were used to generate the mass difference network theoretical ion masses nodes were connected by edges if their mass differences were equal 0 ppm to the theoretical mass differences of δhocl 51 971593 amu mass difference networks were visualized using the open source gephi software yifan hu layout this technique has been previously described in greater detail tziotis et al 2011 3 results and discussion the chlorination of water soluble microcystis aeruginosa dom or adom revealed that between 4 3 and 5 1 mg l 1 free chlorine was consumed table 1 within 24 h the initial free chlorine concentration was 11 1 mg l 1 and initial doc concentrations ranged between 8 3 and 9 5 mg l 1 c changes in doc and tdn concentrations were minimal during chlorination adom showed a few absorbance features e g peaks at 320 440 and 680 nm that were not present after chlorination supplementary material fig s1a absorbance of the media blank also decreased after chlorination figs s1a b this result is not surprising because a decrease in absorbance and electron donating capacity of dom is expected and decreases in absorbance of three dom isolates from the international humic substances society suwannee river fulvic acid suwannee river humic acid and pony lake fulvic acid were also previously observed when reacted with free chlorine wenk et al 2013 eem spectra revealed 3 distinct fluorescence features with peaks at excitation emission wavelength pairs of 275 325 nm 270 450 nm and a broad peak at 350 380 420 480 nm supplementary material figs s1c and d fluorescence signals with large stokes shifts have typically been attributed to humic like materials e g 250 450 but have also been observed in picocyanobacteria dom zhao et al 2017 it is interesting to note that aromatic compounds and humic material in general typically yields higher dbp formation when compared to non humic materials tak and vellanki 2018 integrated fluorescence normalized to absorbance spectra showed that excitation at 270 nm was most efficient followed by a peak at 360 nm for algal dom supplementary material figs s1e and f these fluorescence features were completely destroyed below detection limit after 24 h chlorination supplementary material figs s1e h indicating that the compounds responsible for these fluorescence signatures are likely dbp precursors the chemodiversity as defined by all assigned molecular formulas of adom confirmed the very different nature of adom when compared to freshwater or estuarine dom in van krevelen space van krevelen 1950 fig 1 this is not surprising given the limited molecular diversity of biomolecules arising from lysed cyanobacteria cells abundant features in adom were fatty acids and some high intensity nitrogen containing compounds which are likely peptides however any suggested structures cannot be confirmed by ft icr ms alone because ft icr ms does not give any information on structure beyond that what can be inferred from a molecular formula alone overall the majority of assigned formulas have a h c ratio greater than 1 2 within the analytical window of negative mode esi ft icr ms and indicates that this pool is unlikely to contain substantial aromatic moieties even if aliphatic side chains are present however slightly unsaturated compounds h c ratios of 1 2 2 are present and are rather diverse in the cho pool heteroatomic formulas containing nitrogen or sulfur spanning also a specific range of h c 1 2 2 2 and o c 0 1 0 6 ratios in van krevelen space figs 1 and 3 within the nitrogen containing formulas chno nitrogen containing aromatic rings may be present at around h c of 1 2 e g pyrroles with aliphatic side chains which might explain the observed fluorescence in adom as suggested in a previous study however this assessment is based on previous work on picocyanobacteria and has not been confirmed using nmr in this study zhao et al 2017 a large increase in chemodiversity was observed after chlorination and the production of diverse dbps was demonstrated before and after chlorination an arbitrary example of the observed differences between mass spectra is given at nominal mass nm 369 fig 2 it is clear from the comparison between ms spectra before and after chlorination that adom was substantially changed figs 2 and 3 including the complete removal of compounds i e molecular formulas found before chlorination that were not present after chlorination based on formula assignment criteria and the production of new compounds i e molecular formulas that were not assigned before chlorination a more in depth direct comparison of non halogenated compounds showed that all high intensity c18 molecular ions containing two oxygen atoms were transformed or degraded upon chlorination fig 3 and the cho pool decreased in diversity occupying a smaller area within van krevelen space and fewer formula assignments similarly the highest abundant nitrogen containing ions were completely degraded which gives rise to the suggestion that these molecular ions represent peptides because peptides are effectively degraded upon chlorination including the microcystin lr toxin itself fig 3 in contrast to the cho pool the chemodiversity of chno molecular ions dramatically increased from 231 to 1362 assigned molecular formulas this increase could also indicate the effective degradation of peptides or proteins into smaller molecules upon chlorination a comparison between the molecular weight before and after chlorination also confirmed the production of complex smaller n containing m z ions supplementary material fig s2 another possible explanation of the extreme diversification of chno signatures is that the precursors of the produced chno formulas were chemically modified in such a way that they became much more efficient in forming ions during electrospray ionization all of these newly formed chno molecules have to be considered as dbps the chos signatures that could not be explained with presumably sulfonic acids and surfactants see red circles fig 3 were also effectively degraded this comparison between molecular signatures before and after chlorination without the incorporation of chlorine atoms already demonstrated that chlorination transformed the adom in a profound way however most regulated dbps are halogenated and the production of organohalides upon disinfection remains a focus in dbp research formula assignments with up to 5 chlorine atoms were assessed to elaborate the production of new chlorinated dbps arising from chlorination of adom all these assigned chlorine containing formulas were confirmed using isotope simulation for an example see supplementary material fig s3 the most abundant chlorinated dbps were assigned to a c18 backbone and contained between 1 and 5 chlorine atoms the most abundant c18 dbps contained 3 chlorine atoms fig 4 but several c18 dbps with 2 and 4 chlorines were also observed c18 dbps that contained 5 chlorine atoms could be assigned to four specific m z ions to visualize the abundance and aromaticity equivalent of all c18 molecular formulas we used van krevelen and the so called xc diagram yassine et al 2014 fig 4 the parameter xc was previously introduced as a measure for aromaticity and in this case to separate c18 compounds of different degree of unsaturation different numbers of xc at any given carbon number e g c18 may indicate different numbers of double bonds where higher numbers mean a higher degree of double bonds it can be clearly seen that at carbon number 18 the saturation of double bonds decreased sharply the xc after chlorination fig 4 panel b and c indicative of the addition reaction of free chlorine to double bonds in these presumed fatty acids another way to look at changes in saturation is using the carbon oxidation state cos of each assigned formula it can be clearly seen that all molecular formulas with 18 carbon atoms changed to a higher carbon oxidation state including an increase in molecular weight due to the incorporation of chlorine supplementary material fig s4 these chlorinated c18 dbps showed the highest intensity in the ms spectra and raised the question about possible precursors given the observed complete removal no m z ions found in chlorinated samples of c18 molecular ions upon chlorination and the likely very low degree of aromatic structures within the cho pool leads to the assumption that only additions of free chlorine on double bonds are viable options for compounds not containing any heteroatoms other than oxygen cho compounds only to test this hypothesis a mass difference network was computed to probe transformation pathways that represent hocl addition reactions in this data driven analytical approach nodes represent experimental m z values and edges connections within the network represent exact mass differences which are equivalent to a net molecular formula of a chemical reaction tziotis et al 2011 comprehensive chemical reactivity of thousands of different molecules can be studied simultaneously via this approach ruf et al 2017 here this network analysis was performed with c18 compounds only as inferred from experimental ft icr ms data reaction equivalent chemical transformations of 1 up to 5 hocl molecules with any given c18ho molecular formula present prior chlorination were investigated fig 5 the results indicate that all 42 chlorinated c18 dbps might be related to the observed 43 c18ho precursors via hocl addition reactions in other words all molecular formulas tested c18 compounds with and without chlorine can be related by the transformations or nodes in the network fig 5 we hypothesize that the lost c18 precursors are all unsaturated fatty acids of various degrees it should be noted here that although esi ft icr ms allows for unambiguous and exact molecular formula assignments structures cannot be determined due to the unknown number of isomers for any given molecular formula however the fatty acid composition of microcystis aeruginosa is well known and most abundant unsaturated fatty acids are 18 4ω3 18 3ω3 18 3ω6 and 18 2ω6 which had reported concentrations of 4 95 4 05 1 57 and 0 87 mg fatty acids g 1 respectively hayakawa et al 2002 making them the likely c18 precursors for the chlorinated c18 dbps these fatty acids correspond to the trivial names of stearidonic acid α linolenic acid γ linolenic acid and linoleic acid respectively all these unsaturated fatty acids are well documented in algal cells and corresponded to the presumed fatty acids that were removed upon chlorination thus we undertook collision induced dissociation ms ms experiments on three of the proposed fatty acids to confirm structures supplementary material fig s9 although we cannot determine concentrations of these fatty acids using this approach the ms ms spectra of stearidonic linolenic and linoleic acid matched published spectral records mt000005 mt000072 and mt000114 respectively in the massbank database horai et al 2010 supplementary material fig s9 a diverse group of hydroxylated unsaturated fatty acids also might be present in adom due to oxidative transformations or via other hydroxylated unsaturated fatty acids that are present in metabolic pathways proposed putative reactions of these fatty acids to form chlorinated fatty acid dbps are given in supplementary material figs s5 s7 the presence of additional c18 dbps indicated their formation via hydroxylated unsaturated fatty acids in the adom 17 hydroxylinolenic acid is known to be involved in α linolenic acid metabolism this compound might be an additional precursor for dbps its proposed reaction pathway with hocl is given in the supplementary material fig s8 previous studies showed that chlorination of fatty acids is likely due to the reaction with hocl and not ocl winterbourn et al 1992 furthermore the addition of single hocl molecules was not the only reaction observed but also the addition of 2 chlorine atoms on a single double bond which is consistent with previous studies dembitsky and srebnik 2002 winterbourn et al 1992 the multiple addition of hocl on all existing double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids have been shown to be fast and almost stoichiometric winterbourn et al 1992 the presence of chlorinated fatty acids with 5 cl atoms can only be explained by the addition of two chlorine atoms to at least one double bond of the stearidonic acid supplementary online material fig s7 we would have found a single addition of hocl on linolenic or stearidonic acid if a single addition of hocl would be possible on unsaturated fatty acids containing several double bonds which was not the case the mass difference network analysis creates a framework of possible transformation pathways and it took only the addition of hocl into account fig 5 these results underline the feasibility to explain the formation of all observed c18 dbps fig 5 isotopically labeled hocl was previously used to trace its incorporation into lipids ghanbari et al 1982 and the authors confirmed two chlorinated products after the reaction of oleic acid and ho36cl a fast addition of hocl on fatty acids was also shown in the context of drinking water disinfection gibson et al 1986 chlorinated nitrogen containing dbps were also confirmed that predominantly showed the incorporation of one chlorine atom but a few two and three chlorine single molecules were also found fig 6 in total 283 chlorinated n dbps were confirmed using isotope simulation fig 6 a very diverse suite of non halogenatedn dbps with a large molecular weight range between 200 da and 700 da and an intensity weighted center of mass of 456 5 were also observed fig 6 no change in the degree of saturation was observed after chlorination as expressed in the xc diagrams fig 6 which suggests the formation of chloramines rather than any reaction of chlorine on the carbon backbone the large diversification of unchlorinated n dbps might be due to fragmentation of larger peptides or proteins but this hypothesis remains to be confirmed in future studies the newly described dbps in this study demonstrated the need to describe adom related dbps in greater detail and the used non targeted approach demonstrated the existence of a very diverse group of dbps that are specific to adom results from this study might be used to address potential toxicity of halogenated fatty acids furthermore the very high diversity of n dbps halogenated and non halogenated is equally of concern and should be a focus point of additional studies 4 conclusions algal derived dom from lysed microcystis aeruginosa cells was drastically transformed upon chlorination with free chlorine no changes in doc concentration were observed after chlorination but adom absorbance peaks were removed and or reduced and adom fluorescence signals were completely removed supplementary material fig s1 because only a portion of the entire adom absorbs and fluoresces light non targeted high resolution mass spectrometry was used to gain molecular level understanding of the changes in adom before and after chlorination this adom showed a chlorination of presumed unsaturated fatty acids containing up to 5 chlorine atoms and could be explained by addition of hocl to the double bonds in individual fatty acids although we could not determine concentrations of these fatty acids in our adom sample which would be critical for determining potential toxicity chlorinated fatty acids have been previously confirmed as dbps in effluent from paper mills that still used chlorination for bleaching voss and rapsomatiotis 1985 wesén et al 1992 furthermore diverse suite of halogenated fatty acids have been confirmed to occur naturally and are summarized elsewhere dembitsky and srebnik 2002 thus chlorinated fatty acids warrant further investigation when algal dom is a major dbp precursor or bloom conditions are present the diversity of n containing dbps with and without chlorine present increased almost 10 fold and chlorinated n dbps might reflect an effective production of complex and high molecular weight chloramines but their stability remains unknown a potential anthropogenic source of chlorinated lipids is of interest because they may be involved in inflammatory disease spickett 2007 and has been a focus point in recent years this study warrants further studies in quantifying halogenated fatty acids and in understanding the formation of diverse n dbps from adom and potentially other algal dom sources

disintegration and cell membrane permeability xie et al 2009 because the sudden collapse of cavitation microbubbles generated around the sonotrode upon reaching critical dimension lead to a large amount of energy released as heat pressure turbulence and intensive shearing force romero pareja et al 2017 so far ultrasonication has been successfully applied in pretreatment for sludge reduction and anaerobic digestion romero pareja et al 2017 yang et al 2012 and detailed techno economic investigation is required for the combination of ultrasonication with sludge reduction in this study assr were coupled with membrane bioreactors mbr to construct a process with efficient pollutants removal and sludge reduction because mbr showed advantages of efficient solid separation small footprint enriching nitrifiers etc cheng et al 2017 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 four pilot scale mbrs including an anaerobic oxic mbr ao mbr for control an mbr with assr a mbr a mbr with assr packed with carriers ap mbr and an ap mbr with part of sludge ultrasonicated before fed into assr aup mbr fig 1 were operated in parallel to investigate enhancing effects of ultrasonication and packing carriers on sludge reduction and pollutants removal performance effect of temperature was also evaluated analyses on cell integrity total adenosine triphosphate atp and protease activity were conducted to reveal possible sludge reduction mechanisms miseq sequencing was applied to correlate microbial community structure and population composition with process performance the results are expected to clarify enhancement mechanisms of ultrasonication and carriers on performance of assr 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch tests for sludge ultrasonication and hydrolysis a series of batch tests were conducted with sludge pretreated by ultrasonication and then hydrolyzed through cell lysis cryptic growth the was used in this study was collected from ras line of the dongqu wwtp shanghai china with an anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process the main characteristics of was sample were as follows ph of 7 88 0 05 mixed liquor suspended solid mlss of 4 70 0 10 g l mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of 3 33 0 23 g l and filtrate total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn of 1 36 0 13 mg l a 200 ml was sample was pretreated by a jy98 iiin ultrasonic cell disruptor ningbo xinzhi china with energy density of 0 raw sludge 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 w ml for 10 min and ultrasonication time of 0 5 10 15 and 20 min at energy density of 0 2 w ml then the pretreated sludge was mixed with 1 8 l of sludge collected from assr all the batch reactors were continuously stirred at 200 rpm for 24 h at 20 0 0 1 c a 100 ml sludge sample was withdrawn at 0 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h and filtered through 0 45 μm vinyl cellulose membrane to analyze sludge concentration variation and tkn release in the hydrolysis process 2 2 hydrolysis kinetics for sludge after ultrasonication the hydrolysis rate of sludge after ultrasonic disintegration follows a first order kinetic equation shown in eq 1 1 d x d t k x x i where x and x i are concentrations of hydrolysable sludge and sludge inert to hydrolysis mg l k is the first order kinetic constant d 1 integration of eq 1 gives 2 x x 0 x i e k t x i where x 0 is the initial sludge concentration mg l the dissociation of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the release of intracellular substances are accompanied by sludge disintegration in the hydrolysis process and manifested by the increase of soluble cod nitrogen phosphorus etc assume a certain substrate is evenly distributed in the sludge then its released concentration in the hydrolysis process is proportional to the concentration of disintegrated sludge namely 3 d s i d t α i d x d t α i k x where s i is the concentration of substrate i mg l α i is the proportion of substrate i in the sludge substituting eq 2 into eq 3 gives 4 s i s i 0 α i x 0 x i 1 e k t where s i 0 is the initial concentration of substrate i mg l 2 3 pilot scale experimental system and operating conditions four pilot scale mbrs including an ao mbr and three assr mbrs a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr fig 1 were operated in parallel for 141 days in dongqu wwtp shanghai china and fed with wastewater from the grit chamber effective volumes of anoxic tank mbr and assr were 16 7 50 and 50 l respectively the anoxic tank and assr were equipped with an agitator to maintain sludge suspended in each mbr flat sheet pvdf membrane with an average pore size of 0 2 μm and a total effective filtration area of 0 25 m2 was mounted vertically each mbr system consisted of an air diffuser a pressure gauge and three peristaltic pumps that had been described in a previous paper cheng et al 2017 to mitigate membrane fouling intermittent filtration mode with 2 min pause for every 10 min suction was employed mechanical cleaning and in place chemical cleaning with 0 5 v v naclo solution were conducted for membranes when the trans membrane pressure exceeded 25 kpa in ap mbr and aup mbr system the assr was packed with cylindrical shaped polyethylene carrier elements specific density of 0 96 0 98 g cm3 spr 1 with filling rate of 15 the packing cylinders are 24 mm in diameter and 12 mm in height with a cross inside the cylinder and longitudinal stripes on the outside concentrations of dissolved oxygen do in the four mbrs were all maintained at 4 0 5 0 mg l the four mbrs were operated without temperature control and thus went through three stages according to temperature variation stage i at 21 6 4 9 c for the first 64 days stage ii at 6 5 1 7 c from day 65 120 stage iii at 2 6 1 4 c for the last 21 days the wastewater was continuously fed into the four mbrs with membrane flux of 15 l m2 h at stage i and 12 l m2 h at stage ii and iii to prevent severe membrane fouling the mixed liquor recirculation ratios were all controlled at 250 for the four mbrs and 40 of the recirculation was passed through the assr in the three assr mbrs in aup mbr sludge with flow rate of 5 l d was taken from the 40 recirculation and fed into ultrasonic treatment reactor utr for ultrasonication with energy density of 0 2 w ml for 10 min obtained by batch tests before discharged to assr the concentration of mlss in each mbr was maintained at 6500 mg l by discharging was from the mbr 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 cell integrity analysis flow cytometry fcm for the rapid quantification of intact or ruptured cells in bacterial population has been applied in various studies for multi parametric and single cell analysis foladori et al 2015 han et al 2016 cell membrane integrity tests were performed by a double staining method using calcein am cam for live cells and propidium iodide pi for dead cells han et al 2017 samples collected from mbr utr and assr were centrifugated at 8000 g for 5 min after discarding supernatant the remaining pellet was washed by hepes buffer prior to being re suspended and diluted for 100 times in 15 4 mm nacl solution then the bacterial suspension was subject to ultrasonication with a power density of 1 3 w ml for 2 min to disperse the microbial cells then the suspension was diluted to a final concentration of 2 mg l by pre determined cam and pi and incubated for 30 min in the dark as a consequence intact and ruptured bacteria emit green and red fluorescence respectively fcm accuri c6 bection dickinson usa was then used to determine cell integrity at a flow rate of 10 μl min fluorescence emission of live and dead cells was detected at the fl1 channel 530 nm and fl2 channel 585 nm respectively data acquisition gates were set on green and red fluorescence distribution to eliminate non bacterial particles and debris at least 10 000 cells were analyzed for each sample in a few minutes providing good statistical data 2 4 2 atp and protease activity determination atp and protease activity were measured for samples collected from mbr utr and assr by using the elisa kit shanghai hengyuan biotech the sludge samples were diluted for 5 times and incubated on the enzyme plate at 37 c for 30 min the cycle for discarding the supernatant injecting washing solution and incubation for 30 min was repeated for 5 times after that the enzyme standard reagent was added and incubated for 30 min 50 μl reagents a and b from the elisa kit were added into the sample sequentially and mix at 37 c for 15 min in the dark finally 50 μl termination agent was added to stop the reaction and the absorbance of the samples was measured by labsystems multiskan ms at 450 nm in 15 min 2 4 3 microbial community analysis ten sludge samples were gathered from three assrs assra assrap and assraup four mbrs ao mbr mbra mbrap and mbraup utr and sludge attached on the surface of carriers in assrap and assraup pap and paup on day 138 for miseq sequencing deoxyribonucleic acid extraction polymerase chain reaction amplifications and amplicons purification were conducted in accordance with the reported methods cheng et al 2017 after purification amplicons from the samples were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology china finally more than 32943 high quality 16s rrna sequences were produced and then normalized to 32943 by the sub sample command of mothur program for fairly comparison samples at the same sequencing depth then the 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with an average length of 440 bp by setting a 3 distance limit α based on the cluster information chao ace shannon simpson and good s coverage indices were calculated according to our previous study zhou et al 2015 2 4 4 analytical methods of other items chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and alkalinity in the influent effluent and mixed liquor filtrate were analyzed every two days according to standard methods chinese nepa 2012 mlss and mlvss were measured every day orp do and ph values were monitored using an hq30d portable meter hach usa three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra were measured using a rf 5301pc fluorospectrophotometer shimadzu japan and decomposed by parallel factor parafac analysis in matlab r2013a mathworks usa using the dom fluor niu et al 2016b the ammonium uptake rate aur was measured according to sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 at the last day of stage i and iii under the regulated temperature of 21 6 and 2 6 c respectively 2 5 statistic and calculation methods differences of pollutants in the effluent were compared by one way factor analysis of variance anova using office excel 2010 microsoft usa the observed sludge yield y obs g ss g cod was calculated according to the reported methods pang et al 2018 5 y obs x i v i q w x w t q i s 0 s e t where δx i is the varied sludge concentration in reactor i mg l δt is duration of the operation period d v i is the volume of reactor i l q w is flow rate of was l d x w is sludge concentration in was mg l s 0 and s e is substrate concentration of influent and effluent respectively mg cod l for the aup mbr the effect of ultrasonic treatment on sludge should be deducted and the y obs was calculated as eq 6 6 y obs x i v i q w x w t q u x u q i s 0 s e t where q u is the flow rate of ultrasonication sludge l d δx u is the reduced sludge concentration after ultrasonication in aup mbr mg l the sludge decay coefficient k d of assr tank was calculated according to jiang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch tests for ultrasonic condition optimization fig 2 shows variations of mlss and tkn of passr sludge treated under different ultrasonic energy densities and times ultrasonication disintegrated sludge and resulted in lower mlss fig 2a and smaller particle size table 1 than that without pretreatment which accelerated sludge hydrolysis and release of intracellular compounds e g tkn for raw sludge sludge hydrolysis fig 2a and c is synchronized to tkn release and both tended to a constant level at about 12 h while the hydrolysis of ultrasonicated sludge was completed at 6 8 h the attacks of large cavitation bubbles and powerful hydrodynamic shear force created by the low frequency ultrasound on sludge particles van de moortel et al 2017 lead to the destruction of cell wall of microorganism further resulting in not only the release of intracellular compounds but also breakage of aggregates flocs and maybe cells variations of mlss and tkn in supernatant with time under different ultrasonic energy densities and times were fitted by eq 2 and eq 4 respectively and the results are shown in table 1 the high coefficients of determination in the fit curve lend credibility to the first order kinetics with ultrasonic energy density increasing from 0 to 0 8 w ml first order kinetic constants of mlss disintegration k 1 and tkn release k 2 both increased firstly and then decreased indicating peak values of 0 349 and 0 660 d 1 at 0 2 w ml respectively the same trends of k 1 and k 2 varied with ultrasonication time are also observed with peak values of 0 370 and 0 504 d 1 observed at 10 min respectively the results indicated that low intensity ultrasound was more efficient in solubilizing activated sludge and disrupting the sludge floc foladori et al 2010 the higher value of k 2 than k 1 indicated that the rate tkn release was higher than that of solid disintegration and it was attributed to the uneven distribution of proteins which were mainly distributed in tb eps fraction a small fraction in slime eps and very low in lb eps niu et al 2016a in addition the α i reached the highest value of 10 58 when the sludge was pretreated under energy density of 0 2 w ml and 5 16 when the ultrasonic time was 10 min respectively changes of k and α i were both firstly increased to the maxima and then gradually decreased with energy density ranged from 0 to 0 8 w ml and ultrasonic time prolonged from 0 to 20 min the results can be explained that low strength and or short time ultrasonication elevated biosynthesis of hydrolytic enzymes and facilitated their secretion caused by the disruption of cell wall and increased activities of the enzymes led to proportional increase of hydrolysis rates cho et al 2017 the microorganisms were damaged gradually by ultrasound although microbial activity still increased due to further improvement in mass transfer up to a point where further ultrasonic cavitation damaged the cells and sludge activity decreased drastically huan et al 2009 therefore sludge was ultrasonicated at 0 2 w ml for 10 min and then pumped to passr for posterior hydrolysis for 6 0 h 3 2 process performance during long term experiment 3 2 1 pollutant removal after microbial acclimation period the four systems were continuously operated for 141 days the pollutant removal performance and regression lines of biomass production were illustrated in fig 3 the ph value and alkalinity of influent wastewater were 7 80 0 14 and 346 1 5 6 mg caco3 l respectively and the mass ratio of alkalinity to nh4 n was 17 13 g caco3 g n which is adequate to buffer alkalinity consumption of nitrification sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 in stage i the four systems were almost equally effective in the removal of cod 90 3 91 3 and nh4 n 97 6 98 6 the one way anova α 0 05 results showed that cod removal and nitrification of ao mbr were not impaired after inserting assrs compared to ao mbr with tn removal of 41 0 a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr achieved higher efficiency of 59 9 60 9 and 69 6 respectively anova α 0 05 showed that there was significant difference among tn concentrations in the effluents of the four mbrs in stage ii and iii under low temperature cod removal was not affected and it was in agreement with arévalo et al 2014 who reported that no significant effect was observed on cod removal with temperature varied from 9 to 33 c aur values of sludge in ao mbr a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr were 1 14 0 09 0 71 0 01 0 86 0 04 and 0 81 0 02 mg n g ss h in stage i at 21 6 c and reduced to 0 15 0 01 0 21 0 02 0 25 0 02 and 0 39 0 01 mg n g ss h in stage iii at 2 6 c respectively the results indicated that low temperature in stage ii and iii deteriorated nh4 n removal and thus tn removal because nitrification is the premise of denitrification hoang et al 2014 concentrations of nh4 n and tn in the effluent were increased rapidly to 5 27 11 49 and 15 72 19 30 mg l in stage ii even though hrt was prolonged from 6 7 to 8 3 h by reducing membrane flux in stage iii nh4 n and tn removal was remarkably improved compared to stage ii tn removal was the highest in aup mbr 73 8 and the lowest in a mbr 48 8 suggesting that ultrasonication and carriers promoted organic substrate release which served as internal carbon sources for denitrification kampas et al 2007 3 2 2 sludge reduction performance as shown in fig 3d applying linear regression to the curve plotting cumulative biomass production against cumulative consumed substrate leads to y obs of 0 171 and 0 143 g ss g cod at normal temperature stage i and low temperature stage ii and iii for ao mbr the values were much lower than the value of 0 35 g ss g cod reported for the conventional activated sludge process wang et al 2011 due to the long srt of 108 d in ao mbr meanwhile y obs values of a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr were 0 139 0 131 and 0 109 g ss g cod in stage i and 0 131 0 118 and 0 096 g ss g cod in stage ii and iii respectively low temperature affects microbial growth rates and microbial populations hulsen et al 2016 thus resulting in lower y obs in stage ii and iii than that in stage i sre of a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr were 18 6 23 4 and 36 5 at normal temperature and decreased to 8 2 17 1 and 32 6 at low temperature the results indicated that sludge reduction of a mbr was sensitive to temperature decrease while packing carriers and ultrasonication alleviated the deterioration and greatly improved sre at low temperature 3 3 sludge reduction mechanism analysis 3 3 1 cell lysis enhancement fig 4 summarized the degree of cell breakage that occurred in each unit the number of ruptured cells in assr was increased from 1 61 104 in assra to 1 90 104 in assrap and further to 2 49 104 cells g ss in assraup it was calculated that the number of ruptured cells increased by 15 3 and 23 7 after packing carriers and ultrasonication the ruptured cells in assraup were the highest since the direct contribution of utr 20 0 could be almost negligible if considering the dilution it was reported that cells were damaged under anaerobic conditions while maintained their cellular structure and bacteria lysis occurred principally under aerobic conditions foladori et al 2015 therefore the number of ruptured cells were 1 26 1 49 1 68 and 1 96 104 cells g ss in ao mbr mbra mbrap mbraup indicating that inserting assr packing carriers and ultrasonication gradually enhanced cell lysis in the mbr system the calculated k d values were 0 0328 0 0359 and 0 0528 d 1 in assra assrap and assraup respectively which was in the range of literature data 0 02 0 05 d 1 for the stabilization process martínezgarcía et al 2014 moreover the orp of assra assrap and assraup was 32 6 55 8 and 111 3 mv respectively the results confirmed that sludge endogenous decay occurred rather quickly due to a more stressful environment created by packing carrier and vulnerable structure of sludge under low intensity ultrasound pretreatment it was concluded that the transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions resulted as being much more effective towards the decay of raptures cells foladori et al 2015 and lower orp in assr induced more cell lysis in mbr under continuous aeration 3 3 2 secondary substrate release and hydrolysis fig 5 a showed that dom was released in assrs with scod in the effluent of 4 72 9 04 and 10 82 mg l higher than that in the influent of assra assrap and assraup deducting ultrasonication release of 1 26 mg l considering scod consumption for denitrification in assr cheng et al 2017 the contribution of packing carriers and ultrasonication to the enhancement of scod release was 14 8 and 26 0 respectively foladori et al 2010 found that dom release after ultrasonication was not due to cell membrane breakage but more probably to the solubilization of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides and increasing scod parafac analysis of fluorescence spectra from four systems was conducted to further investigate dom release and sludge hydrolysis fig 5c component a b and c centered at the ex em of 225 275 320 235 330 360 and 245 450 nm were identified as aromatic protein like tryptophan protein like and humic acid like substances respectively cheng et al 2018 as shown in fig 5b fi values of refractory aromatic protein component a increased by 24 52 29 24 and 31 62 deducted ultrasonication contribution of 7 03 while that of biodegradable tryptophan protein component b decreased by 6 70 13 71 and 24 55 from mbr to assr in a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr respectively compared to assr packing carriers and ultrasonication enhanced fi values of component a by 4 72 and 9 41 suggesting that ultrasonication was more conducive to refractory substrate release the released refractory substrate was non biodegradable in the anoxic tank and mbr which resulted in the highest cod in the effluent of aup mbr fig 2a dom release and utilization is closely related to hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria cheng et al 2018a which was major functional biomass responsible for sludge reduction the enhanced hydrolysis of biodegradable fraction could be interpreted by more abundant secondary substance provided by ultrasonication and more diverse biomass related to sludge reduction attached on carriers 3 3 3 hydrolysis enhancement and uncoupling analysis as shown in fig 6 protease activities of sludge in mbra mbrap and mbraup were all greatly lower than that in ao mbr 18 7 10 3 u g ts which was related to the highest relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria in ao mbr in particular the phylum proteobacteria responsible for cell lysis and intracellular substances release cheng et al 2018a was enriched in ao mbr 47 7 and induced the production of protease the cellular debris caused by cell lysis was mainly proteins and lipids which could be consumed by a certain class of bacteria related to cryptic growth with low sludge yield lujan facundo et al 2018 the protease activity of assra assrap and assraup was 8 23 13 0 and 17 8 10 3u g ts respectively and assraup showed the highest protease activity the result was coincident with dom variations in fig 5 the longer srt in assrap and assraup increase the presence of bulk enzymes romero pareja et al 2015 furthermore significant increase of enzyme activity by packing carriers could be explained by that hydrolyzed bacteria tended to gather on packing carriers and formed thicker biofilms to resist low temperature thus increased the protease activity to ensure utilization of macromolecular substrates low strength ultrasonication has been reported to stimulate various bioprocesses such as cell growth enzyme synthesis and microbial fermentation kwiatkowska et al 2011 ultrasonication enhanced enzyme activity could result from increased mass transfer due to higher specific surface area and permeability cho et al 2017 the significant increase of protease activity from mbrs to corresponding assr was strongly associated with the release of secondary matrix in assrs and the higher concentration of refractory aromatic protein in assr fig 5b confirmed the deduction furthermore the degradation of biodegradable tryptophan protein released in assr was beneficial to the enhancement of protease activity low intensity ultrasound and packing carriers improved the protease activity and enhanced protein hydrolysis afterwards which contributed to sludge reduction through particle hydrolysis and lysis cryptic growth the atp content showed a significantly decreasing trend with the order of ao mbr mbra mbrap and mbraup fig 6 inserting assr decreased the atp content in the mainstream reactors and resulted in anabolic resistance indicated that high do practically eliminated the atp generation implying a negligible anabolism activity ferrer polonio et al 2017 and thus led to the uncoupling between anabolism and catabolism keskes et al 2013 packing carriers and ultrasonication strengthened the uncoupling effects and obtained lower sludge production once the sludge flowed to assr under lower do atp production increased the atp contents in assra assrap and assraup were 5 99 5 20 and 7 00 u g ts respectively electrons were transferred from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to o2 via cytochrome and proteins bounded in cell membrane protons are simultaneously pumped out of the cell cytoplasm thus a proton motive gradient is generated across the membrane providing the driving force for the flow of protons back into the cytoplasm atp within the cell provides energy for a variety of cell functions since the carriers formed anaerobic environment and ultrasonication promoted the destruction of cell membrane cytochrome and membrane bound proteins might be denatured driving to a diminution of the proton gradient across cell membrane therefore impaired electron transport capability which decreased the atp generation ferrer polonio et al 2017 decreasing atp in the heterotrophic metabolism process available for biosynthesis would in turn reduce biomass production han et al 2016 3 4 comparison on microbial community structures 3 4 1 richness and diversity of bacteria a comprehensive evaluation of the microbial community on richness and diversity of the ten sludge samples is shown in table 2 it indicated that inserting assr played a key role on improving richness chao and diversity shannon of microbial community microbial communities in assrap were richer and more diverse than in assra and the richness of microbial communities in pap was greatly higher than assrap and assra it was determined that packing carriers enriched biomass with long generation time and formed longer microbial food chains and thus enhanced microbial richness and diversity in assr cheng et al 2018b compared to mbraup the microbial population richness and diversity in utr was improved obviously demonstrating that low intensity ultrasonic technology could increase sludge microbial activity huan et al 2009 particularly assraup exhibited lower richness and greater diversity than assrap the possible cause was that low intensity ultrasonic cavitation promoted reversible permeation accelerated the permeability and selectivity of cell membrane and wall and changed nutrition or molecule transport through cell membranes thereby affected the abundance and diversity of microbial populations dai et al 2003 3 4 2 taxonomic complexity and function of the bacterial community microbial community structures of four mbrs at genus level were demonstrated by a hierarchically clustered heatmap in fig 7 norank ns9 marine group norank saprospiraceae and norank saccharibacteria were the most dominant genera the total relative abundance of nitrospira and norank ns9 marine group responsible for nitrification were the highest in mbraup 10 7 and assraup 10 4 the three major mechanisms of sludge reduction namely hydrolysis of particulate organic matters slow growth and lysis of bacterial biomass are achieved by enriching hydrolytic slow growing and predatory bacteria in sludge reduction systems cheng et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 the genera of bacteria responsible for sludge reduction were investigated in the four mbrs according to fig 7 the relative abundance of certain kinds of hydrolytic bacteria including norank saccharibacteria dechloromonas woodsholea and ferruginibacter was higher in assr mbrs than that in the ao mbr which enhanced sludge reduction in assr mbrs the genus of norank saccharibacteria was greatly enriched in mbraup assraup and utr with the relative abundance of 8 5 9 9 and 12 7 respectively genetic studies indicated that norank saccharibacteria was a phylogenetically diverse group and played an important role in degrading various organic compounds under aerobic nitrate reducing and anaerobic conditions kindaichi et al 2016 carriers intensified the enrichment of dechloromonas with relative abundance in pap 3 2 and paup 2 7 higher than assrap 2 9 and assraup 2 2 the relative abundance of woodsholea related to hydrolysis of organic matters he et al 2018 was the highest in paup of 2 6 ferruginibacter was associated with glucose fermentation lee et al 2014 and preferentially enriched in mbraup 2 6 assraup 2 6 and paup 2 2 low strength ultrasonication disintegrated sludge flocs to fine particles and soluble large molecules and favored the growth of hydrolytic bacteria which played important roles in hydrolysis of inactive particles the denitrifying bacteria candidatus accumulibacter dechloromonas thauera sulfuritalea and azospira were also classified as slow growing bacteria with low sludge yield jiang et al 2018 candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas classified as denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms were preferentially enriched on the surface of carriers compared to mixed liquor the total relative abundance of another three genera of denitrifying bacteria thauera sulfuritalea and azospira which were also classified as slow growers jiang et al 2018 were the highest in assrap 5 9 it is indicated that assr mbr by packing carriers showed higher denitrification potential and lower sludge production from the microbiological perspective the accumulation of predatory bacteria also enhanced by packing carriers and ultrasonication with norank saprospiraceae showed the highest relative abundance in assrap of 14 1 and bdellovibrio preferentially enriched in aup mbr with relative abundance of 0 5 which facilitated the lysis cryptic growth and was partly responsible for sludge reduction in assr mbrs cheng et al 2017 in this study enhancement of sludge reduction was achieved by packing carriers and ultrasonication especially under low temperature carriers provide habitat for functional bacteria responsible for hydrolysis and slow growing create a more stressing environment with low orp for cell lysis and hydrolysis of inactive fractions ultrasonication keeps cells in a vulnerable state prone to cell lysis promotes the release of intracellular substances yang et al 2012 stimulates hydrolytic enzyme excretion and enhances uncoupling effects together with carriers in assr however ultrasonication is often not so economic to reach higher enhancement of sludge reduction foladori et al 2010 because it requires very high energy levels of 1 09 kj g reduced ss in aup mbr which is comparable to literature of ultrasonication yang et al 2015 but greatly higher than conventional sludge treatment and disposal 218 315 ton ss therefore packing carriers is probably more cost effective and advantageous to enhance sludge reduction by partial damage to bacterial cells and promoting better interaction between bacteria enzymes and substrates to favor particles hydrolysis 4 conclusion effects of low temperature were negligible on cod removal deteriorated nh4 n and tn removal and decreased sre in assr mbr packing carriers in assr and ultrasonication before assr both enhanced sludge reduction in assr mbr especially under low temperature sres of a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr were 8 2 17 1 and 32 6 at 1 0 9 0 c packing carriers and ultrasonication increased cell rupture by 11 1 and 14 5 in aerobic mbr enhanced protease activity in assr by 60 0 and 116 3 and reduced atp content for heterotrophic metabolism by 31 4 and 7 3 respectively miseq sequencing results showed that packing carriers enriched hydrolytic bacteria terrimonas dechloromonas and woodsholea slow growers sulfuritalea thauera and azospira and predatory bacteria bdellovibrio and norank saprospiraceae while ultrasonication further enriched hydrolytic bacteria norank saccharibacteria and ferruginibacter acknowledgment this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china china 51878403

18946,the sludge in situ reduction process by inserting an anaerobic side stream reactor assr in a sludge return line provides a cost effective approach to reduce sludge production in activated sludge systems in this study four pilot scale membrane bioreactors mbrs including an ao mbr for control assr coupled mbr assr mbr a mbr with assr packed with carriers ap mbr and an ap mbr with part of sludge ultrasonicated before fed into assr aup mbr were operated in parallel to investigate enhancing effects of ultrasonication and packing carriers on sludge reduction and pollutants removal performance under both normal and low temperature low temperature showed negligible impact on cod removal deteriorated nh4 n and tn removal from 98 3 to 69 7 at 21 6 c to 92 5 and 48 8 at 2 6 c and decreased sludge reduction efficiency sre in assr mbr packing carriers and ultrasonication both enhanced sludge reduction especially under low temperature with sre values increased from 8 2 of assr mbr to 17 1 of ap mbr and 32 6 of aup mbr at 4 5 2 5 c packing carriers and ultrasonication increased cell rupture by 11 1 and 14 5 in aerobic mbr enhanced protease activity in assr by 60 0 and 116 3 and reduced atp content for heterotrophic metabolism by 31 4 and 7 3 respectively miseq sequencing results showed that packing carriers enriched hydrolytic bacteria terrimonas dechloromonas and woodsholea slow

inevitable by product of wastewater treatment plants wwtps waste activated sludge was requires complicated processes for stabilization dewatering and disposal accounting for 25 65 of the total operation cost of wwtps saby et al 2003 zhou et al 2015 many sludge in situ reduction sir approaches have been proposed as a cost efficient way to decrease was production within the biological wastewater treatment process niu et al 2016b biological process with an anaerobic side stream reactor assr placed in the sludge return loop and its derivation oxic settling anaerobic process have been intensively studied in lab pilot and full scale systems cheng et al 2017 troiani et al 2011 velho et al 2016 effects of oxidation reduction potential orp level saby et al 2003 wang et al 2015 hydraulic retention time hrt jiang et al 2018 semblante et al 2016 ye et al 2008 and side stream ratio cheng et al 2017 on sludge reduction performance has been investigated to optimize operational parameters and identify the main mechanism governing sludge reduction nevertheless wide fluctuations in sludge reduction efficiency sre of assr 0 2 66 were observed in literature foladori et al 2015 pang et al 2018 with a long hrt of assr 6 7 h comparable to the main stream therefore exploring enhancement strategies for assr to ensure high and stable sre are important for its practical application packing carriers was proved to effectively improve sre of assr by enriching functional bacteria and accelerating sludge reduction with more abundant microbial communities and longer microbial food chains cheng et al 2018b physicochemical pretreatments aiming at destructing sludge flocs and disrupting cells are also an alternative of all physicochemical options ultrasonication shows advantages over chemical oxidation for generating no hazardous residue in sludge and promoting enzymatic activity at low intensity foladori et al 2010 ultrasonication also improves sludge disintegration and cell membrane permeability xie et al 2009 because the sudden collapse of cavitation microbubbles generated around the sonotrode upon reaching critical dimension lead to a large amount of energy released as heat pressure turbulence and intensive shearing force romero pareja et al 2017 so far ultrasonication has been successfully applied in pretreatment for sludge reduction and anaerobic digestion romero pareja et al 2017 yang et al 2012 and detailed techno economic investigation is required for the combination of ultrasonication with sludge reduction in this study assr were coupled with membrane bioreactors mbr to construct a process with efficient pollutants removal and sludge reduction because mbr showed advantages of efficient solid separation small footprint enriching nitrifiers etc cheng et al 2017 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 four pilot scale mbrs including an anaerobic oxic mbr ao mbr for control an mbr with assr a mbr a mbr with assr packed with

on sludge reduction and pollutants removal performance effect of temperature was also evaluated analyses on cell integrity total adenosine triphosphate atp and protease activity were conducted to reveal possible sludge reduction mechanisms miseq sequencing was applied to correlate microbial community structure and population composition with process performance the results are expected to clarify enhancement mechanisms of ultrasonication and carriers on performance of assr 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch tests for sludge ultrasonication and hydrolysis a series of batch tests were conducted with sludge pretreated by ultrasonication and then hydrolyzed through cell lysis cryptic growth the was used in this study was collected from ras line of the dongqu wwtp shanghai china with an anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process the main characteristics of was sample were as follows ph of 7 88 0 05 mixed liquor suspended solid mlss of 4 70 0 10 g l mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of 3 33 0 23 g l and filtrate total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn of 1 36 0 13 mg l a 200 ml was sample was pretreated by a jy98 iiin ultrasonic cell disruptor ningbo xinzhi china with energy density of 0 raw sludge 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 w ml for 10 min and ultrasonication time of 0 5 10 15 and 20 min at energy density of 0 2 w ml then the pretreated sludge was mixed with 1 8 l of sludge collected from assr all the batch reactors were continuously stirred at 200 rpm for 24 h at 20 0 0 1 c a 100 ml sludge sample was withdrawn at 0 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h and filtered through 0 45 μm vinyl cellulose membrane to analyze sludge concentration variation and tkn release in the hydrolysis process 2 2 hydrolysis kinetics for sludge after ultrasonication the hydrolysis rate of sludge after ultrasonic disintegration follows a first order kinetic equation shown in eq 1 1 d x d t k x x i where x and x i are concentrations of hydrolysable sludge and sludge inert to hydrolysis mg l k is the first order kinetic constant d 1 integration of eq 1 gives 2 x x 0 x i e k t x i where x 0 is the initial sludge concentration mg l the dissociation of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the release of intracellular substances are accompanied by sludge disintegration in the hydrolysis process and manifested by the increase of soluble cod nitrogen phosphorus etc assume a certain substrate is evenly distributed in the sludge then its released concentration in the hydrolysis process is proportional to the concentration of disintegrated sludge namely 3 d s i d t α i d x d t α i k x where s i is the concentration of substrate i mg l α i is the proportion of substrate i in the sludge substituting eq 2 into eq 3 gives 4 s i s i 0 α i x 0 x i 1 e k t where s i 0 is the initial concentration of substrate i mg l 2 3 pilot scale experimental system and operating conditions four pilot scale mbrs including an ao mbr and three assr mbrs a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr fig 1 were operated in parallel for 141 days in dongqu wwtp shanghai china and fed with wastewater from the grit chamber effective volumes of anoxic tank mbr and assr were 16 7 50 and 50 l respectively the anoxic tank and assr were equipped with an agitator to maintain sludge suspended in each mbr flat sheet pvdf membrane with an average pore size of 0 2 μm and a total effective filtration area of 0 25 m2 was mounted vertically each mbr system consisted of an air diffuser a pressure gauge and three peristaltic pumps that had been described in a previous paper cheng et al 2017 to mitigate membrane fouling intermittent filtration mode with 2 min pause for every 10 min suction was employed mechanical cleaning and in place chemical cleaning with 0 5 v v naclo solution were conducted for membranes when the trans membrane pressure exceeded 25 kpa in ap mbr and aup mbr system the assr was packed with cylindrical shaped polyethylene carrier elements specific density of 0 96 0 98 g cm3 spr 1 with filling rate of 15 the packing cylinders are 24 mm in diameter and 12 mm in height with a cross inside the cylinder and longitudinal stripes on the outside concentrations of dissolved oxygen do in the four mbrs were all maintained at 4 0 5 0 mg l the four mbrs were operated without temperature control and thus went through three stages according to temperature variation stage i at 21 6 4 9 c for the first 64 days stage ii at 6 5 1 7 c from day 65 120 stage iii at 2 6 1 4 c for the last 21 days the wastewater was continuously fed into the four mbrs with membrane flux of 15 l m2 h at stage i and 12 l m2 h at stage ii and iii to prevent severe membrane fouling the mixed liquor recirculation ratios were all controlled at 250 for the four mbrs and 40 of the recirculation was passed through the assr in the three assr mbrs in aup mbr sludge with flow rate of 5 l d was taken from the 40 recirculation and fed into ultrasonic treatment reactor utr for ultrasonication with energy density of 0 2 w ml for 10 min obtained by batch tests before discharged to assr the concentration of mlss in each mbr was maintained at 6500 mg l by discharging was from the mbr 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 cell integrity analysis flow cytometry fcm for the rapid quantification of intact or ruptured cells in bacterial population has been applied in various studies for multi parametric and single cell analysis foladori et al 2015 han et al 2016 cell membrane integrity tests were performed by a double staining method using calcein am cam for live cells and propidium iodide pi for dead cells han et al 2017 samples collected from mbr utr and assr were centrifugated at 8000 g for 5 min after discarding supernatant the remaining pellet was washed by hepes buffer prior to being re suspended and diluted for 100 times in 15 4 mm nacl solution then the bacterial suspension was subject to ultrasonication with a power density of 1 3 w ml for 2 min to disperse the microbial cells then the suspension was diluted to a final concentration of 2 mg l by pre determined cam and pi and incubated for 30 min in the dark as a consequence intact and ruptured bacteria emit green and red fluorescence respectively fcm accuri c6 bection dickinson usa was then used to determine cell integrity at a flow rate of 10 μl min fluorescence emission of live and dead cells was detected at the fl1 channel 530 nm and fl2 channel 585 nm respectively data acquisition gates were set on green and red fluorescence distribution to eliminate non bacterial particles and debris at least 10 000 cells were analyzed for each sample in a few minutes providing good statistical data 2 4 2 atp and protease activity determination atp and protease activity were measured for samples collected from mbr utr and assr by using the elisa kit shanghai hengyuan biotech the sludge samples were diluted for 5 times and incubated on the enzyme plate at 37 c for 30 min the cycle for discarding the supernatant injecting washing solution and incubation for 30 min was repeated for 5 times after that the enzyme standard reagent was added and incubated for 30 min 50 μl reagents a and b from the elisa kit were added into the sample sequentially and mix at 37 c for 15 min in the dark finally 50 μl termination agent was added to stop the reaction and the absorbance of the samples was measured by labsystems multiskan ms at 450 nm in 15 min 2 4 3 microbial community analysis ten sludge samples were gathered from three assrs assra assrap and assraup four mbrs ao mbr mbra mbrap and mbraup utr and sludge attached on the surface of carriers in assrap and assraup pap and paup on day 138 for miseq sequencing deoxyribonucleic acid extraction polymerase chain reaction amplifications and amplicons purification were conducted in accordance with the reported methods cheng et al 2017 after purification amplicons from the samples were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology china finally more than 32943 high quality 16s rrna sequences were produced and then normalized to 32943 by the sub sample command of mothur program for fairly comparison samples at the same sequencing depth then the 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with an average length of 440 bp by setting a 3 distance limit α based on the cluster information chao ace shannon simpson and good s coverage indices were calculated according to our previous study zhou et al 2015 2 4 4 analytical methods of other items chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and alkalinity in the influent effluent and mixed liquor filtrate were analyzed every two days according to standard methods chinese nepa 2012 mlss and mlvss were measured every day orp do and ph values were monitored using an hq30d portable meter hach usa three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra were measured using a rf 5301pc fluorospectrophotometer shimadzu japan and decomposed by parallel factor parafac analysis in matlab r2013a mathworks usa using the dom fluor niu et al 2016b the ammonium uptake rate aur was measured according to sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 at the last day of stage i and iii under the regulated temperature of 21 6 and 2 6 c respectively 2 5 statistic and calculation methods differences of pollutants in the effluent were compared by one way factor analysis of variance anova using office excel 2010 microsoft usa the observed sludge yield y obs g ss g cod was calculated according to the reported methods pang et al 2018 5 y obs x i v i q w x w t q i s 0 s e t where δx i is the varied sludge concentration in reactor i mg l δt is duration of the operation period d v i is the volume of reactor i l q w is flow rate of was l d x w is sludge concentration in was mg l s 0 and s e is substrate concentration of influent and effluent respectively mg cod l for the aup mbr the effect of ultrasonic treatment on sludge should be deducted and the y obs was calculated as eq 6 6 y obs x i v i q w x w t q u x u q i s 0 s e t where q u is the flow rate of ultrasonication sludge l d δx u is the reduced sludge concentration after ultrasonication in aup mbr mg l the sludge decay coefficient k d of assr tank was calculated according to jiang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch tests for ultrasonic condition optimization fig 2 shows variations of mlss and tkn of passr sludge treated under different ultrasonic energy densities and times ultrasonication disintegrated sludge and resulted in lower mlss fig 2a and smaller particle size table 1 than that without pretreatment which accelerated sludge hydrolysis and release of intracellular compounds e g tkn for raw sludge sludge hydrolysis fig 2a and c is synchronized to tkn release and both tended to a constant level at about 12 h while the hydrolysis of ultrasonicated sludge was completed at 6 8 h the attacks of large cavitation bubbles and powerful hydrodynamic shear force created by the low frequency ultrasound on sludge particles van de moortel et al 2017 lead to the destruction of cell wall of microorganism further resulting in not only the release of intracellular compounds but also breakage of aggregates flocs and maybe cells variations of mlss and tkn in supernatant with time under different ultrasonic energy densities and times were fitted by eq 2 and eq 4 respectively and the results are shown in table 1 the high coefficients of determination in the fit curve lend credibility to the first order kinetics with ultrasonic energy density increasing from 0 to 0 8 w ml first order kinetic constants of mlss disintegration k 1 and tkn release k 2 both increased firstly and then decreased indicating peak values of 0 349 and 0 660 d 1 at 0 2 w ml respectively the same trends of k 1 and k 2 varied with ultrasonication time are also observed with peak values of 0 370 and 0 504 d 1 observed at 10 min respectively the results indicated that low intensity ultrasound was more efficient in solubilizing activated sludge and disrupting the sludge floc foladori et al 2010 the higher value of k 2 than k 1 indicated that the rate tkn release was higher than that of solid disintegration and it was attributed to the uneven distribution of proteins which were mainly distributed in tb eps fraction a small fraction in slime eps and very low in lb eps niu et al 2016a in addition the α i reached the highest value of 10 58 when the sludge was pretreated under energy density of 0 2 w ml and 5 16 when the ultrasonic time was 10 min respectively changes of k and α i were both firstly increased to the maxima and then gradually decreased with energy density ranged from 0 to 0 8 w ml and ultrasonic time prolonged from 0 to 20 min the results can be explained that low strength and or short time ultrasonication elevated biosynthesis of hydrolytic enzymes and facilitated their secretion caused by the disruption of cell wall and increased activities of the enzymes led to proportional increase of hydrolysis rates cho et al 2017 the microorganisms were damaged gradually by ultrasound although microbial activity still increased due to further improvement in mass transfer up to a point where further ultrasonic cavitation damaged the cells and sludge activity decreased drastically huan et al 2009 therefore sludge was ultrasonicated at 0 2 w ml for 10 min and then pumped to passr for posterior hydrolysis for 6 0 h 3 2 process performance during long term experiment 3 2 1 pollutant removal after microbial acclimation period the four systems were continuously operated for 141 days the pollutant removal performance and regression lines of biomass production were illustrated in fig 3 the ph value and alkalinity of influent wastewater were 7 80 0 14 and 346 1 5 6 mg caco3 l respectively and the mass ratio of alkalinity to nh4 n was 17 13 g caco3 g n which is adequate to buffer alkalinity consumption of nitrification sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 in stage i the four systems were almost equally effective in the removal of cod 90 3 91 3 and nh4 n 97 6 98 6 the one way anova α 0 05 results showed that cod removal and nitrification of ao mbr were not impaired after inserting assrs compared to ao mbr with tn removal of 41 0 a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr achieved higher efficiency of 59 9 60 9 and 69 6 respectively anova α 0 05 showed that there was significant difference among tn concentrations in the effluents of the four mbrs in stage ii and iii under low temperature cod removal was not affected and it was in agreement with arévalo et al 2014 who reported that no significant effect was observed on cod removal with temperature varied from 9 to 33 c aur values of sludge in ao mbr a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr were 1 14 0 09 0 71 0 01 0 86 0 04 and 0 81 0 02 mg n g ss h in stage i at 21 6 c and reduced to 0 15 0 01 0 21 0 02 0 25 0 02 and 0 39 0 01 mg n g ss h in stage iii at 2 6 c respectively the results indicated that low temperature in stage ii and iii deteriorated nh4 n removal and thus tn removal because nitrification is the premise of denitrification hoang et al 2014 concentrations of nh4 n and tn in the effluent were increased rapidly to 5 27 11 49 and 15 72 19 30 mg l in stage ii even though hrt was prolonged from 6 7 to 8 3 h by reducing membrane flux in stage iii nh4 n and tn removal was remarkably improved compared to stage ii tn removal was the highest in aup mbr 73 8 and the lowest in a mbr 48 8 suggesting that ultrasonication and carriers promoted organic substrate release which served as internal carbon sources for denitrification kampas et al 2007 3 2 2 sludge reduction performance as shown in fig 3d applying linear regression to the curve plotting cumulative biomass production against cumulative consumed substrate leads to y obs of 0 171 and 0 143 g ss g cod at normal temperature stage i and low temperature stage ii and iii for ao mbr the values were much lower than the value of 0 35 g ss g cod reported for the conventional activated sludge process wang et al 2011 due to the long srt of 108 d in ao mbr meanwhile y obs values of a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr were 0 139 0 131 and 0 109 g ss g cod in stage i and 0 131 0 118 and 0 096 g ss g cod in stage ii and iii respectively low temperature affects microbial growth rates and microbial populations hulsen et al 2016 thus resulting in lower y obs in stage ii and iii than that in stage i sre of a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr were 18 6 23 4 and 36 5 at normal temperature and decreased to 8 2 17 1 and 32 6 at low temperature the results indicated that sludge reduction of a mbr was sensitive to temperature decrease while packing carriers and ultrasonication alleviated the deterioration and greatly improved sre at low temperature 3 3 sludge reduction mechanism analysis 3 3 1 cell lysis enhancement fig 4 summarized the degree of cell breakage that occurred in each unit the number of ruptured cells in assr was increased from 1 61 104 in assra to 1 90 104 in assrap and further to 2 49 104 cells g ss in assraup it was calculated that the number of ruptured cells increased by 15 3 and 23 7 after packing carriers and ultrasonication the ruptured cells in assraup were the highest since the direct contribution of utr 20 0 could be almost negligible if considering the dilution it was reported that cells were damaged under anaerobic conditions while maintained their cellular structure and bacteria lysis occurred principally under aerobic conditions foladori et al 2015 therefore the number of ruptured cells were 1 26 1 49 1 68 and 1 96 104 cells g ss in ao mbr mbra mbrap mbraup indicating that inserting assr packing carriers and ultrasonication gradually enhanced cell lysis in the mbr system the calculated k d values were 0 0328 0 0359 and 0 0528 d 1 in assra assrap and assraup respectively which was in the range of literature data 0 02 0 05 d 1 for the stabilization process martínezgarcía et al 2014 moreover the orp of assra assrap and assraup was 32 6 55 8 and 111 3 mv respectively the results confirmed that sludge endogenous decay occurred rather quickly due to a more stressful environment created by packing carrier and vulnerable structure of sludge under low intensity ultrasound pretreatment it was concluded that the transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions resulted as being much more effective towards the decay of raptures cells foladori et al 2015 and lower orp in assr induced more cell lysis in mbr under continuous aeration 3 3 2 secondary substrate release and hydrolysis fig 5 a showed that dom was released in assrs with scod in the effluent of 4 72 9 04 and 10 82 mg l higher than that in the influent of assra assrap and assraup deducting ultrasonication release of 1 26 mg l considering scod consumption for denitrification in assr cheng et al 2017 the contribution of packing carriers and ultrasonication to the enhancement of scod release was 14 8 and 26 0 respectively foladori et al 2010 found that dom release after ultrasonication was not due to cell membrane breakage but more probably to the solubilization of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides and increasing scod parafac analysis of fluorescence spectra from four systems was conducted to further investigate dom release and sludge hydrolysis fig 5c component a b and c centered at the ex em of 225 275 320 235 330 360 and 245 450 nm were identified as aromatic protein like tryptophan protein like and humic acid like substances respectively cheng et al 2018 as shown in fig 5b fi values of refractory aromatic protein component a increased by 24 52 29 24 and 31 62 deducted ultrasonication contribution of 7 03 while that of biodegradable tryptophan protein component b decreased by 6 70 13 71 and 24 55 from mbr to assr in a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr respectively compared to assr packing carriers and ultrasonication enhanced fi values of component a by 4 72 and 9 41 suggesting that ultrasonication was more conducive to refractory substrate release the released refractory substrate was non biodegradable in the anoxic tank and mbr which resulted in the highest cod in the effluent of aup mbr fig 2a dom release and utilization is closely related to hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria cheng et al 2018a which was major functional biomass responsible for sludge reduction the enhanced hydrolysis of biodegradable fraction could be interpreted by more abundant secondary substance provided by ultrasonication and more diverse biomass related to sludge reduction attached on carriers 3 3 3 hydrolysis enhancement and uncoupling analysis as shown in fig 6 protease activities of sludge in mbra mbrap and mbraup were all greatly lower than that in ao mbr 18 7 10 3 u g ts which was related to the highest relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria in ao mbr in particular the phylum proteobacteria responsible for cell lysis and intracellular substances release cheng et al 2018a was enriched in ao mbr 47 7 and induced the production of protease the cellular debris caused by cell lysis was mainly proteins and lipids which could be consumed by a certain class of bacteria related to cryptic growth with low sludge yield lujan facundo et al 2018 the protease activity of assra assrap and assraup was 8 23 13 0 and 17 8 10 3u g ts respectively and assraup showed the highest protease activity the result was coincident with dom variations in fig 5 the longer srt in assrap and assraup increase the presence of bulk enzymes romero pareja et al 2015 furthermore significant increase of enzyme activity by packing carriers could be explained by that hydrolyzed bacteria tended to gather on packing carriers and formed thicker biofilms to resist low temperature thus increased the protease activity to ensure utilization of macromolecular substrates low strength ultrasonication has been reported to stimulate various bioprocesses such as cell growth enzyme synthesis and microbial fermentation kwiatkowska et al 2011 ultrasonication enhanced enzyme activity could result from increased mass transfer due to higher specific surface area and permeability cho et al 2017 the significant increase of protease activity from mbrs to corresponding assr was strongly associated with the release of secondary matrix in assrs and the higher concentration of refractory aromatic protein in assr fig 5b confirmed the deduction furthermore the degradation of biodegradable tryptophan protein released in assr was beneficial to the enhancement of protease activity low intensity ultrasound and packing carriers improved the protease activity and enhanced protein hydrolysis afterwards which contributed to sludge reduction through particle hydrolysis and lysis cryptic growth the atp content showed a significantly decreasing trend with the order of ao mbr mbra mbrap and mbraup fig 6 inserting assr decreased the atp content in the mainstream reactors and resulted in anabolic resistance indicated that high do practically eliminated the atp generation implying a negligible anabolism activity ferrer polonio et al 2017 and thus led to the uncoupling between anabolism and catabolism keskes et al 2013 packing carriers and ultrasonication strengthened the uncoupling effects and obtained lower sludge production once the sludge flowed to assr under lower do atp production increased the atp contents in assra assrap and assraup were 5 99 5 20 and 7 00 u g ts respectively electrons were transferred from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to o2 via cytochrome and proteins bounded in cell membrane protons are simultaneously pumped out of the cell cytoplasm thus a proton motive gradient is generated across the membrane providing the driving force for the flow of protons back into the cytoplasm atp within the cell provides energy for a variety of cell functions since the carriers formed anaerobic environment and ultrasonication promoted the destruction of cell membrane cytochrome and membrane bound proteins might be denatured driving to a diminution of the proton gradient across cell membrane therefore impaired electron transport capability which decreased the atp generation ferrer polonio et al 2017 decreasing atp in the heterotrophic metabolism process available for biosynthesis would in turn reduce biomass production han et al 2016 3 4 comparison on microbial community structures 3 4 1 richness and diversity of bacteria a comprehensive evaluation of the microbial community on richness and diversity of the ten sludge samples is shown in table 2 it indicated that inserting assr played a key role on improving richness chao and diversity shannon of microbial community microbial communities in assrap were richer and more diverse than in assra and the richness of microbial communities in pap was greatly higher than assrap and assra it was determined that packing carriers enriched biomass with long generation time and formed longer microbial food chains and thus enhanced microbial richness and diversity in assr cheng et al 2018b compared to mbraup the microbial population richness and diversity in utr was improved obviously demonstrating that low intensity ultrasonic technology could increase sludge microbial activity huan et al 2009 particularly assraup exhibited lower richness and greater diversity than assrap the possible cause was that low intensity ultrasonic cavitation promoted reversible permeation accelerated the permeability and selectivity of cell membrane and wall and changed nutrition or molecule transport through cell membranes thereby affected the abundance and diversity of microbial populations dai et al 2003 3 4 2 taxonomic complexity and function of the bacterial community microbial community structures of four mbrs at genus level were demonstrated by a hierarchically clustered heatmap in fig 7 norank ns9 marine group norank saprospiraceae and norank saccharibacteria were the most dominant genera the total relative abundance of nitrospira and norank ns9 marine group responsible for nitrification were the highest in mbraup 10 7 and assraup 10 4 the three major mechanisms of sludge reduction namely hydrolysis of particulate organic matters slow growth and lysis of bacterial biomass are achieved by enriching hydrolytic slow growing and predatory bacteria in sludge reduction systems cheng et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 the genera of bacteria responsible for sludge reduction were investigated in the four mbrs according to fig 7 the relative abundance of certain kinds of hydrolytic bacteria including norank saccharibacteria dechloromonas woodsholea and ferruginibacter was higher in assr mbrs than that in the ao mbr which enhanced sludge reduction in assr mbrs the genus of norank saccharibacteria was greatly enriched in mbraup assraup and utr with the relative abundance of 8 5 9 9 and 12 7 respectively genetic studies indicated that norank saccharibacteria was a phylogenetically diverse group and played an important role in degrading various organic compounds under aerobic nitrate reducing and anaerobic conditions kindaichi et al 2016 carriers intensified the enrichment of dechloromonas with relative abundance in pap 3 2 and paup 2 7 higher than assrap 2 9 and assraup 2 2 the relative abundance of woodsholea related to hydrolysis of organic matters he et al 2018 was the highest in paup of 2 6 ferruginibacter was associated with glucose fermentation lee et al 2014 and preferentially enriched in mbraup 2 6 assraup 2 6 and paup 2 2 low strength ultrasonication disintegrated sludge flocs to fine particles and soluble large molecules and favored the growth of hydrolytic bacteria which played important roles in hydrolysis of inactive particles the denitrifying bacteria candidatus accumulibacter dechloromonas thauera sulfuritalea and azospira were also classified as slow growing bacteria with low sludge yield jiang et al 2018 candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas classified as denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms were preferentially enriched on the surface of carriers compared to mixed liquor the total relative abundance of another three genera of denitrifying bacteria thauera sulfuritalea and azospira which were also classified as slow growers jiang et al 2018 were the highest in assrap 5 9 it is indicated that assr mbr by packing carriers showed higher denitrification potential and lower sludge production from the microbiological perspective the accumulation of predatory bacteria also enhanced by packing carriers and ultrasonication with norank saprospiraceae showed the highest relative abundance in assrap of 14 1 and bdellovibrio preferentially enriched in aup mbr with relative abundance of 0 5 which facilitated the lysis cryptic growth and was partly responsible for sludge reduction in assr mbrs cheng et al 2017 in this study enhancement of sludge reduction was achieved by packing carriers and ultrasonication especially under low temperature carriers provide habitat for functional bacteria responsible for hydrolysis and slow growing create a more stressing environment with low orp for cell lysis and hydrolysis of inactive fractions ultrasonication keeps cells in a vulnerable state prone to cell lysis promotes the release of intracellular substances yang et al 2012 stimulates hydrolytic enzyme excretion and enhances uncoupling effects together with carriers in assr however ultrasonication is often not so economic to reach higher enhancement of sludge reduction foladori et al 2010 because it requires very high energy levels of 1 09 kj g reduced ss in aup mbr which is comparable to literature of ultrasonication yang et al 2015 but greatly higher than conventional sludge treatment and disposal 218 315 ton ss therefore packing carriers is probably more cost effective and advantageous to enhance sludge reduction by partial damage to bacterial cells and promoting better interaction between bacteria enzymes and substrates to favor particles hydrolysis 4 conclusion effects of low temperature were negligible on cod removal deteriorated nh4 n and tn removal and decreased sre in assr mbr packing carriers in assr and ultrasonication before assr both enhanced sludge reduction in assr mbr especially under low temperature sres of a mbr ap mbr and aup mbr were 8 2 17 1 and 32 6 at 1 0 9 0 c packing carriers and ultrasonication increased cell rupture by 11 1 and 14 5 in aerobic mbr enhanced protease activity in assr by 60 0 and 116 3 and reduced atp content for heterotrophic metabolism by 31 4 and 7 3 respectively miseq sequencing results showed that packing

18947,total dissolved gas supersaturation tdgs downstream caused by spill discharge from high dams can easily cause fish to suffer from gas bubble disease gbd one potential approach to mitigate the impact of tdgs is at the confluence of a downstream tributary where the introduction of low tdg water might provide refuge space for fish in this study we carried out a series of flume experimental cases and established a three dimensional tdgs model at confluences the formula of the dissipation coefficient of tdgs had been obtained by parts of experiment cases the other parts of experimental cases were carried out to validate the established tdgs model the biggest relative error of tdg concentration between the experiment and simulation was 5 7 the results show that the convergence of tributary water tdg 100 can affect the mainstream water tdg 140 150 significantly the two most obvious features are the presence of the separation zone and secondary flow which become more significant as the flow rate increases the separation zone area at the bottom is smaller than that at the surface there are two secondary circulations on transversal planes which decrease as the longitudinal distance increases in addition the area below 110 and 120 of tdgs in different planes of different cases were compared in detail this study can provide scientific basis for the utilization of the low tdg saturation region to protect fish from the damage of tdgs at confluences during high dam discharge graphical abstract image 1 keywords confluence total dissolved gas supersaturation separation zone secondary flow low tdg saturation 1 introduction fish and other aquatic behaviors are not only related to their physiological status and life habits but also influenced by the water environment cai et al 2011 he et al 2017 wagner et al 2018 li et al 2018 arlos et al 2018 total dissolved gas tdg supersaturation caused by a high dam discharge can lead to an increased incidence of gas bubble disease and fish mortality in the river reach downstream of a dam beiningen and wesley 1970 earl and wesley 1975 this problem is a recognized and serious negative environmental effect of many dams including those with only low to moderate head discharge weitkamp and katz 1980 weitkamp et al 2003 proposed mitigation measures have included both reducing supersaturated tdg generation united states army corps of engineers 1984 parametrix 1997 and increasing tdg dissipation at the dam politano et al 2009 tang 2011 for example politano et al 2009 used spillway flow deflectors to redirect spilled water horizontally thereby forming a surface jet that prevents bubbles from plunging to depth in the stilling basin to minimize the supersaturation of tdg at hydropower dams unfortunately approaches that are appropriate for at the dam mitigation of low head and medium head dams can be impractical for high dams where overflow structures e g ski jump spillways are required to handle monsoon level discharges thus there is a need for mitigation measures in the downstream river reach to reduce the impacts of supersaturated tdg when its generation is unavoidable in many cases the downstream reach below a dam is a tributary joining a main stream river or conversely a dam on the main stream river is joined by a tributary as shown in fig 1 such confluences are recognized as important fish habitat due to the combination of water and nutrients from different sources ginney 2001 rice et al 2001 we argue that the confluence where naturally low tdg water joins the dam affected supersaturated tdg water provides potential for tdg mitigation and fish refuge depending on the local mixing characteristics at the confluence and the fish tolerance behaviors chen et al 2012 previous studies show that some fish can detect and avoid supersaturated tdg wang et al 2015 although there are questions as to whether this holds true for migrating salmon johnson et al 2007 for fish that can avoid supersaturated tdg any confluence region with lower tdg is a potential shelter unfortunately little is known about the mixing and dissipation behavior of supersaturated tdg at a confluence confluence experimental and numerical studies have focused on hydrodynamics without tdg e g best and reid 1984 shumate 1998 park and johnson 1998 weber et al 2001 gualtieri 2010 constantinescu et al 2011 luo et al 2017 an exception being our recent numerical model shen et al 2016 but this model is just a two dimensional model which does not show a change of tdg saturation in the direction of water depth in addition transport effects of a confluence have been studied with reference to both sediment gualtieri 2018 and salinity kang 2011 but their influence on density is opposite of tdg s effects so such studies are of little importance for understanding tdg behavior the hydrodynamics of a confluence are complex mosley and paul 1976 ramamurthy 1994 and depend on the geometry planform and junction angle of the confluence the momentum flux ratio of the merging streams mr and the level of concordance between channel beds at the confluence entrance and the any differences in the water characteristics temperature conductivity suspended sediment concentration the flow at a confluence is fundamentally 3d best 1987 with a turbulent separation zone downstream of the junction and secondary flows in the transverse plane bradbrook et al 1998 constantinescu et al 2011 the separation zone provides a potential zone for higher retention time of low tdg water in the main stream and the secondary flow provides a possible advection path for bottom water high tdg moving up to the surface and enhancing tdg dissipation there are more than four decades of field laboratory and numerical studies of tdg in rivers and the effects on fish e g nebeker et al 2011 orlins and gulliver 2000 politano et al 2007 the area is deserving of a thorough review which is beyond the scope of the present paper of particular importance is that the rate of tdg dissipation which is not identical to that of dissolved oxygen li et al 2013 so extensive prior studies of oxygen behavior cannot be used as proxies for tdg feng et al 2010 developed a formula on the basis of field observation on several rivers in china by defining a comprehensive coefficient replacing the molecular diffusion coefficient proposed by u s army corps of engineers 2005 the main physical factors affecting the dissipation of tdg were analyzed and summarized by feng et al 2014 most of the previous researches on the river confluences are focused on the hydrodynamics especially the junction angle and flow ratio which are the key factors affecting the special phenomenon of the separation zone and the secondary flow by many physical model experiments best and reid 1984 shumate 1998 weber et al 2001 the numerical simulation involves the general mathematical model of the one dimensional e g hsu et al 1998a hsu et al 1998b mao et al 2004 rice et al 2006 two dimensional e g chen and peng 2006 gualtieri 2010 and the three dimensional flow model e g weerakoon and tamai 1989 wang et al 2015 thus previous research presented was either a separate experimental study or a separate simulation study which is not systematic enough of research method coupled simulations and experiments of confluences that have been previously done but have lacked anything about tdg experimental and numerical study of the dissipation of supersaturated total dissolved gas at the confluence are carried out in the present paper a three dimensional supersaturated tdg transportation and dissipation model at the confluence is established and has been verified by experiment data which is of great importance in providing guidance for human to protect fishes avoiding from the damage of the supersaturated tdg during flood discharge by studying the distribution law of tdg and searching low tdg water space at the confluence 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach 2 1 1 design of experimental device and measurement points the experimental setup with mainstream and tributary flumes is shown in fig 2 the tributary flume has a junction angle which is 45 from the upstream section of the mainstream flume the inlet of mainstream flume is a triangular weir and the inlet of tributary is a rectangular weir flows are held steady by maintaining constant water levels at the weirs a deep water bucket with a weep hole is used to control the outflow and maintain a constant water depth in the flume the flumes are made of plexiglass with 0 1 slope and flat bottom the effective length of the test section intersection and the tributary are 11 m 3 m and 2 m respectively the cross sections are rectangular and uniform the width of both flumes are 0 5 m and the heights are 0 4 m a supersaturated tdg water tank supplies the mainstream flume and a fresh water tank supplies the tributary flume the supersaturated tdg water was generated by an invention device authorization number is 2009 1 0164299 3 as shown in fig 2 twenty 20 monitoring cross sections were set in the mainstream flume with six 6 profile measuring stations at each cross section at each profile station in the vertical dimension there were five 5 measuring points for velocity and three 3 measuring points for tdg concentration 2 1 2 measurement method an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was used to measure velocity in the x y and z three directions the accuracy of velocity is 0 01 and the sampling rate is 200 hz tdg saturation and temperature were measured with a polaris tgp the accuracy of tdg measurement is 0 1 the sampling duration at each point is about 10 min to ensure the stability of the measurement the accuracy of temperature is 0 2 c the experimental cases are shown in table 1 2 2 numerical modeling strategy a three dimensional model of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics and transportation of tdg at the confluences the numerical modeling was carried out using openfoam 2 2 1 hydrodynamic equations the rans model uses the continuity and momentum equations 1 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i x j ρ ν ν t u i x j ρ g where ρ kg m 3 is the fluid density t s is time u i m s is the vector flow velocity p pa is pressure g m s2 is gravitational acceleration ν m2 s is the molecular viscosity coefficient and ν t m2 s indicates the eddy viscosity coefficient modeled as 3 ν t c μ k 2 ε where c μ is an empirical parameter the turbulent kinetic energy is k m2 s2 and ε is turbulent dissipation rate based on the verification and comparison results of turbulence models the simulation results of the rng k ε model renormalization group k ε turbulence model of yakhot and orszag 1986 is more consistent with the experimental data than the rsm model and the standard k ε model it can capture the characteristics of a more complete secondary circulation this scheme differs from the standard k ε turbulence scheme in that it accounts for non equilibrium strain rates added in the turbulence dissipation equation which is considered valuable when streamline curvature such as a confluence is expected the rng approach employs different values for the model coefficients from the standard k ε turbulence scheme the transport equations for kinetic energy and the dissipation rate are 4 k t u j k x j u i u j u i x j x j k m k σ k x j ε 5 ε t u j ε x j c ε 1 ε k u i u j u i x j x j k m ε σ ε x j c ε 2 ε 2 k r where

equilibrium strain rate term η is the dimensionless shear rate coefficients c ε 1 and c ε 2 are empirical constants usually determined from benchmark experiments taken as 1 42 and 1 68 respectively σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl numbers of the turbulence kinetic energy k and the turbulence dissipation rate ε respectively both are taken as 0 7179 and β is an empirical constant taken as 0 012 the information of the values of the parameters are listed in table 2 2 2 2 transportation equations the transport equation for supersaturated tdg is 9 ρ c t ρ u i c x i x j ρ ν ν t σ t c x j ρ s c where the source term is 10 s c k t c s c in s c mg l s with c s represents the saturation solubility of tdg corresponding to local atmospheric pressure and temperature and the dissipation coefficient represented as a functional relationship 11 k t f ν t h in the above σ t is the schmidt number taken as 1 0 based on gualtieri 2006 and gualtieri et al 2017 c mg l is the concentration of supersaturated tdg h m is the mean water depth ϕ t is a non dimensional parameter that must be determined and verified by experimental data 2 2 3 discretization and solving method the finite volume method was used to discretize the equations in finite volume discretization the difference scheme was used for discretization of time terms the pimple algorithm merged piso and simple was used to solve the equations pimplefoam solver based on openfoam platform was used for large time step transient for incompressible in this paper that means the simple steady algorithm was used to solve equations in each time step and the piso algorithm was taken for the step of time step 2 2 4 boundary conditions and domain meshes the computational domain conforms with the experiment as shown in fig 3 the boundary condition of inlet 1 in the mainstream inlet 2 in the tributary and outlet in the mainstream are set as velocity velocity and zerogradient respectively the surface of the mainstream and tributary flume is set as atmospheric pressure the initial tdg saturation is 100 and the tdg saturation of tributary and mainstream inlet are determined according to table 1 the initial value of turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent dissipation rate ε are calculated as follows 12 k i n 0 00375 v i n 2 13 ε i n k i n 0 4 h i n where v i n m s is inlet flow velocity h i n m is initial water depth the mesh in the local area of the confluence is shown in the lower left corner of fig 4 the model uses 850663 grid cells with unstructured quadrilateral meshes and finer grids were imposed on the region close to the junction and the walls where significant gradients are expected as shown in fig 4 the mesh convergence study has been done the size of a single cell in the free stream region is 12 5 mm 12 5 mm 15 0 mm while the size of a single cell next to the channel boundary is 12 5 mm 10 0 mm 12 5 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 data analysis of experiment fig 5 shows parts of the measuring results in experimental for case 1 case 4 and case 6 the figure shows that the naturally low tdg water of tributary significantly reduces the tdg saturation at the confluence because of the significant difference of tdg saturation between the mainstream and the tributary and there is a low tdg saturation region in the separation zone close to tributary side as shown in figs 5 a 2 b and 2 c the isoline of tdg saturation in the right bank tributary side is lower than that of the left bank the opposite side of the tributary the low tdg saturation region becomes larger with the increase of flow ratio while the relatively high saturation area of the tdg in the left bank becomes smaller indicating that the low tdg saturation region extends laterally toward opposite sidewal gradually with increase of flow ratio the longitudinal distribution of tdg in fig 5 d demonstrates that the tdg saturation drops sharply between section r x 0 707 m and section a x 0 m because of the mixing of the clean water in tributary which can lead to the dilution of the water body in mainstream in addition the two streams in the mainstream and tributary mixed and support each other at the confluence area resulting in the increase in turbulence intensity in the area which can promote the dissipation process for tdg supersaturation vertical data in fig 5 d shows that low tdg saturation region become smaller with the increase of water depth and the change rate of the distribution of tdg on the plane is increasing 3 2 calibration of the dissipation coefficient fig 6 shows the correlation of the tdg dissipation coefficient with froude number fr from case 1 to case 5 the fr here is divided into froude number of the entrance of main stream fra froude number of the entrance of tributary frb and froude number of the entrance of tributary to main stream frc it shows that the tdg dissipation coefficient increases as fra increases and decreases as frc increases with a little bit of fluctuation from 0 25 to 0 45 and its relationship with frb is not obvious the coefficient of determination for fra frb and frc are 0 791 0 004 and 0 710 respectively according to the dimensional analysis the formula for estimating the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg at the confluence can be written as 14 k t ϕ t ν t h 2 a regression analysis of the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg k t with the turbulent viscosity coefficient ν t and the water depth h at the confluence under different turbulent conditions from case 1 to case 5 are carried out the cases are shown in table 5 as shown in fig 7 the results show that there is a good correlation of the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg with the turbulent viscosity coefficient and the water depth at the confluence the coefficient of determination is 0 9512 the fitting formula for estimating dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg is shown in eq 15 15 k t 0 7071 ν t h 2 the fitting result shows that the non dimensional parameter ϕ t value is 0 7071 which was calibrated by experimental data in this paper it should be noted that the equation is based on the measured water temperature 25 6 c the dissipation coefficient at normal temperature 20 c can be converted according to shen et al 2014 compared with fr the turbulent viscosity coefficient and the water depth are more appropriate factors to reflect the change of the dissipation coefficient of tdg at the confluence due to the existence of separation zone and shear layer at the confluence zone and secondary circulation in the downstream 3 3 application of the dissipation coefficient in numerical simulation 3 3 1 verification of flow field in an experimental study of the 90 degree confluence canal weber et al 2001 measured the three dimensional flow field at the confluence area kang 2011 used weber s experimental data to validate the established model in this paper the mathematical model of tdg in confluences was verified by the flume experiment the comparison results of velocity between simulations and experiments for case 2 case 3 and case 5 are demonstrated in fig 8 horizontal planes and fig 9 transverse planes the black arrow represents the calculated results while the red arrow represents that of the measurement the comparison results of turbulent kinetic energy between simulations and experiments for case 5 is demonstrated in fig 10 the quantitative information about the relative error of velocity are showed in table 3 horizontal planes and table 4 transversal planes the maximum relative error of turbulent kinetic energy in all cases is 5 3 which showed in fig 10 that give a good agreement between model and experiment results from the figures and tables as shown in fig 8 there exists a region with small flow velocity near the side wall of the tributary which is called separation zone the shape of separation zone is not very different between the three cases the flow velocity downstream of the confluence near the right bank is smaller than that in the left bank due to the extrusion from the tributary the velocity of the central region is slightly larger than that in the left bank of the same cross section in addition the size of separation zone on surface plane is slightly larger than that on bottom plane fig 9 shows the comparative results of velocity in three transversal planes x 2 0 m x 3 7 m and x 6 2 m between simulation and experiment for the three cases it gives a good agreement between model and experiment results it can be noticed from fig 9 that the secondary flow phenomenon is appeared in the cross section downstream of the confluence area and there are two different directions of circulation in the nine transversal planes displayed one near the tributary side is clockwise and the other one near the opposite bank is counterclockwise that s partly due to the unique curve features flow line which is deflected obviously after the tributary water flowing into the mainstream flume at the same time there is a second secondary flow due to anisotropic turbulence with the increase of the distance from x direction the secondary circulation flow near the tributary side becomes less significant and the velocity of this area in the v w plane gets smaller it can also be seen from the figure that the secondary flow makes the velocity near the water surface and bottom smaller than the velocity in the middle layer of the water body in addition fig 9 indicates that the greater the flow radio the more significant the secondary flow characteristics in particular the phenomenon of secondary flow is almost vanishing at the x 3 7 m position 3 3 2 verification of tdg supersaturation distribution of tdg supersaturation and comparison between simulation and experiment in different horizontal planes z 0 05 m z 0 12 m and z 0 20 m for case 6 are presented in fig 11 the small square blocks on the graph represent the experimental values calculated and experimental results are compared and the results indicate that the error values at the measurement points between the two varied from 5 7 to 5 3 and the biggest relative error value 5 7 of all the measurement points occur at the coordinate point 6 2 0 2 0 12 in case 6 the calculated concentration of tdg supersaturation and the variation trend are in agreement to the experiment as shown in fig 11 there is a low tdg saturation region the tdg saturation is less than 105 near the tributary side at the confluence which is coincides almost with the separation zone the range of the area increases with the decrease of water depth which are 1 05 m2 z 0 05 m 1 21 m2 z 0 12 m and 1 52 m2 z 0 20 m respectively 3 4 discussion on the distribution of tdg supersaturation at confluences fig 12 a shows the distribution of flow field and tdg supersaturation on transversal plane a for case 3 the calculated results show the great influence of flow field on tdg supersaturation the velocity in x direction is small near the tributary side and the saturation of tdg supersaturation is correspondingly lower in this region than other zones the velocity in y z cross section is big enough to exhibit the obvious secondary flow the maximum saturation of tdg in the middle and bottom layers occurs at the side far from the tributary it means the influence of the tributary is more obvious on the surface than that on the bottom and the water surface blending more intense fig 12 b shows the calculated distribution of tdg supersaturation in different horizontal planes for case 2 case 3 and case 5 fig 12 c shows the calculated distribution of tdg supersaturation in different horizontal planes for the three cases in the four figures the water body supersaturated with less than 110 and 120 tdg are marked and highlighted the detail area ratio statistics of the low tdg saturation area with less than 110 s110 and 120 s120 of supersaturated tdg concentration which can provide a better shelter area for fish survival and reproduction are exhibited in table 6 horizontal plane and table 7 transversal plane fig 12 d shows the correlation of the area ratio low tdg saturation area to the horizontal plane area of flume downstream the confluence with flow ratio in different horizontal and transversal planes of the six cases it can be noticed that the greater the flow ratio the more obvious the influence of the tributary on the mainstream flume and the larger the low tdg saturation area according to fig 12 and table 6 the areas below 110 and 120 of tdg supersaturation in horizontal plane get smaller as the depth or the flow ratio decreases the lengths get shorter as the depth increase the maximum area ratio value 0 39 of s110 is located in the surface layer of case 6 while the minimum area ratio value 0 01 present to the bottom layer of case 1 meanwhile the maximum and minimum area ratio value 0 59 and 0 02 of s120 are located in the same positions of the same cases as the s110 it can be seen that the area value on the surface is far from the middle and lower layer while the middle layer and water bottom are very close to each other the surface layer area is closer to uniformity than middle layer and bottom layer which means the influence of tributary on the mainstream become stronger as the depth decreases as shown in fig 12 and table 7 the s110 in transversal planes get smaller as the longitudinal distance or the flow ratio decreases however the s120 get larger as the longitudinal distance or the flow ratio increases the maximum area ratio value 0 36 of s110 is located in the cross section x 2 0 m for case 6 while the minimum area ratio value 0 06 present to the cross section x 6 2 m for case 1 meanwhile the maximum and minimum area ratio value 0 52 and 0 16 of s120 are located in the cross section x 6 2 m for case 6 and cross section x 2 0 m for case 1 thus the s110 in three transverse planes increases gradually while the s120 decrease gradually with the increase of the longitudinal distance to obtain the relationship between the area ratio of low tdg saturation water and the flow ratio many more numerical simulation studies have been carried out in this paper fig 13 shows the correlation of the area ratio of low tdg saturation water in the middle layer of horizontal plane and middle cross section of separation zone with flow ratio the regression between s110 or s120 and flow ratio is illustrated in fig 13 the correlation between the two parameters in horizontal plane and cross section is high which can provide an important scientific basis for the prediction of the dissipation process of tdg supersaturation and low tdg water area for fish refuge at confluences above all the experimental and calculated results in figures show that the convergence of the tributary flume which has a natural low tdg saturation level 100 can affect the high tdg saturation level of the mainstream flume an obvious difference in tdg levels occurred after the tributary flowed into the main flume this flow which mainly comes from the tributary flume occupies a narrow range on the right side of the mainstream with lower velocity and tdg concentration which is located in the separation zone downstream of the confluence that means the distribution of flow field has a significant impaction on the tdg distribution in addition the results in horizontal planes and transversal planes indicate that the bigger flow ratio the larger the low tdg saturation area the low tdg saturation area increases as the depth decreases in a word the deeper the water depth or the farther the longitudinal distance the more uniform the tdg distribution 4 conclusions the experiments and simulations of the supersaturated tdg distribution at confluences under different conditions were carried out in this paper a three dimensional supersaturated tdg transportation and dissipation model at the confluence was established and had been verified by experiment data we have investigated the quantitative relationships between the area ratio of low tdg saturation water and the flow ratio in typical planes the calculation and experimental results reveal the distribution mechanism and situation of supersaturated tdg at the confluences specifically the convergence of the tributary water reduces the tdg saturation in the mainstream there is a low tdg saturation zone in the separation zone where provide a better shelter area for fish survival and reproduction based on research characterizing fish tolerance the 3d tdg model at confluences is established and verified by experimental data of which maximum relative error presents as 5 7 the build relationship among the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg with turbulent viscosity coefficient and water depth at the confluence can be described as k t 0 7071 ν t h 2 the regression between s110 or s120 and flow ratio λ in the middle layer of horizontal planes and middle cross section of separation zone are illustrated as follows s 110 0 1532 λ 2 0 6116 λ s 110 0 2361 λ 2 0 8058 λ s 120 0 1816 ln λ 0 559 s 120 0 2201 n λ 0 6008 this study provides a scientific basis for the utilization of a low tdg saturation region at the confluences to improve the river ecosystem and provides a digital basis for fishes shelter space to escape the impact of supersaturated tdg future multiple modeling and field observation efforts are suggested to combine the endurance of fish with respect to supersaturated tdg at the confluence in

impact of tdgs is at the confluence of a downstream tributary where the introduction of low tdg water might provide refuge space for fish in this study we carried out a series of flume experimental

used as proxies for tdg feng et al 2010 developed a formula on the basis of field observation on several rivers in china by defining a comprehensive coefficient replacing the molecular diffusion coefficient proposed by u s army corps of engineers 2005 the main physical factors affecting the dissipation of tdg were analyzed and summarized by feng et al 2014 most of the previous researches on the river confluences are focused on the hydrodynamics especially the junction angle and flow ratio which are the key factors affecting the special phenomenon of the separation zone and the secondary flow by many physical model experiments best and reid 1984 shumate 1998 weber et al 2001 the numerical simulation involves the general mathematical model of the one dimensional e g hsu et al 1998a hsu et al 1998b mao et al 2004 rice et al 2006 two dimensional e g chen and peng 2006 gualtieri 2010 and the three dimensional flow model e g weerakoon and tamai 1989 wang et al 2015 thus previous research presented was either a separate experimental study or a separate simulation study which is not systematic enough of research method coupled simulations and experiments of confluences that have been previously done but have lacked anything about tdg experimental and numerical study of the dissipation of supersaturated total dissolved gas at the confluence are carried out in the present paper a three dimensional supersaturated tdg transportation and dissipation model at the confluence is established and has been verified by experiment data which is of great importance in providing guidance for human to protect fishes avoiding from the damage of the supersaturated tdg during flood discharge by studying the distribution law of tdg and searching low tdg water space at the confluence 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach 2 1 1 design of experimental device and measurement points the experimental setup with mainstream and tributary flumes is shown in fig 2 the tributary flume has a junction angle which is 45 from the upstream section of the mainstream flume the inlet of mainstream flume is a triangular weir and the inlet of tributary is a rectangular weir flows are held steady by maintaining constant water levels at the weirs a deep water bucket with a weep hole is used to control the outflow and maintain a constant water depth in the flume the flumes are made of plexiglass with 0 1 slope and flat bottom the effective length of the test section intersection and the tributary are 11 m 3 m and 2 m respectively the cross sections are rectangular and uniform the width of both flumes are 0 5 m and the heights are 0 4 m a supersaturated tdg water tank supplies the mainstream flume and a fresh water tank supplies the tributary flume the supersaturated tdg water was generated by an invention device authorization number is 2009 1 0164299 3 as shown in fig 2 twenty 20 monitoring cross sections were set in the mainstream flume with six 6 profile measuring stations at each cross section at each profile station in the vertical dimension there were five 5 measuring points for velocity and three 3 measuring points for tdg concentration 2 1 2 measurement method an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was used to measure velocity in the x y and z three directions the accuracy of velocity is 0 01 and the sampling rate is 200 hz tdg saturation and temperature were measured with a polaris tgp the accuracy of tdg measurement is 0 1 the sampling duration at each point is about 10 min to ensure the stability of the measurement the accuracy of temperature is 0 2 c the experimental cases are shown in table 1 2 2 numerical modeling strategy a three dimensional model of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics and transportation of tdg at the confluences the numerical modeling was carried out using openfoam 2 2 1 hydrodynamic equations the rans model uses the continuity and momentum equations 1 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i x j ρ ν ν t u i x j ρ g where ρ kg m 3 is the fluid density t s is time u i m s is the vector flow velocity p pa is pressure g m s2 is gravitational acceleration ν m2 s is the molecular viscosity coefficient and ν t m2 s indicates the eddy viscosity coefficient modeled as 3 ν t c μ k 2 ε where c μ is an empirical parameter the turbulent kinetic energy is k m2 s2 and ε is turbulent dissipation rate based on the verification and comparison results of turbulence models the simulation results of the rng k ε model renormalization group k ε turbulence model of yakhot and orszag 1986 is more consistent with the experimental data than the rsm model and the standard k ε model it can capture the characteristics of a more complete secondary circulation this scheme differs from the standard k ε turbulence scheme in that it accounts for non equilibrium strain rates added in the turbulence dissipation equation which is considered valuable when streamline curvature such as a confluence is expected the rng approach employs different values for the model coefficients from the standard k ε turbulence scheme the transport equations for kinetic energy and the dissipation rate are 4 k t u j k x j u i u j u i x j x j k m k σ k x j ε 5 ε t u j ε x j c ε 1 ε k u i u j u i x j x j k m ε σ ε x j c ε 2 ε 2 k r where

equilibrium strain rate term η is the dimensionless shear rate coefficients c ε 1 and c ε 2 are empirical constants usually determined from benchmark experiments taken as 1 42 and 1 68 respectively σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl numbers of the turbulence kinetic energy k and the turbulence dissipation rate ε respectively both are taken as 0 7179 and β is an empirical constant taken as 0 012 the information of the values of the parameters are listed in table 2 2 2 2 transportation equations the transport equation for supersaturated tdg is 9 ρ c t ρ u i c x i x j ρ ν ν t σ t c x j ρ s c where the source term is 10 s c k t c s c in s c mg l s with c s represents the saturation solubility of tdg corresponding to local atmospheric pressure and temperature and the dissipation coefficient represented as a functional relationship 11 k t f ν t h in the above σ t is the schmidt number taken as 1 0 based on gualtieri 2006 and gualtieri et al 2017 c mg l is the concentration of supersaturated tdg h m is the mean water depth ϕ t is a non dimensional parameter that must be determined and verified by experimental data 2 2 3 discretization and solving method the finite volume method was used to discretize the equations in finite volume discretization the difference scheme was used for discretization of time terms the pimple algorithm merged piso and simple was used to solve the equations pimplefoam solver based on openfoam platform was used for large time step transient for incompressible in this paper that means the simple steady algorithm was used to solve equations in each time step and the piso algorithm was taken for the step of time step 2 2 4 boundary conditions and domain meshes the computational domain conforms with the experiment as shown in fig 3 the boundary condition of inlet 1 in the mainstream inlet 2 in the tributary and outlet in the mainstream are set as velocity velocity and zerogradient respectively the surface of the mainstream and tributary flume is set as atmospheric pressure the initial tdg saturation is 100 and the tdg saturation of tributary and mainstream inlet are determined according to table 1 the initial value of turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent dissipation rate ε are calculated as follows 12 k i n 0 00375 v i n 2 13 ε i n k i n 0 4 h i n where v i n m s is inlet flow velocity h i n m is initial water depth the mesh in the local area of the confluence is shown in the lower left corner of fig 4 the model uses 850663 grid cells with unstructured quadrilateral meshes and finer grids were imposed on the region close to the junction and the walls where significant gradients are expected as shown in fig 4 the mesh convergence study has been done the size of a single cell in the free stream region is 12 5 mm 12 5 mm 15 0 mm while the size of a single cell next to the channel boundary is 12 5 mm 10 0 mm 12 5 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 data analysis of experiment fig 5 shows parts of the measuring results in experimental for case 1 case 4 and case 6 the figure shows that the naturally low tdg water of tributary significantly reduces the tdg saturation at the confluence because of the significant difference of tdg saturation between the mainstream and the tributary and there is a low tdg saturation region in the separation zone close to tributary side as shown in figs 5 a 2 b and 2 c the isoline of tdg saturation in the right bank tributary side is lower than that of the left bank the opposite side of the tributary the low tdg saturation region becomes larger with the increase of flow ratio while the relatively high saturation area of the tdg in the left bank becomes smaller indicating that the low tdg saturation region extends laterally toward opposite sidewal gradually with increase of flow ratio the longitudinal distribution of tdg in fig 5 d demonstrates that the tdg saturation drops sharply between section r x 0 707 m and section a x 0 m because of the mixing of the clean water in tributary which can lead to the dilution of the water body in mainstream in addition the two streams in the mainstream and tributary mixed and support each other at the confluence area resulting in the increase in turbulence intensity in the area which can promote the dissipation process for tdg supersaturation vertical data in fig 5 d shows that low tdg saturation region become smaller with the increase of water depth and the change rate of the distribution of tdg on the plane is increasing 3 2 calibration of the dissipation coefficient fig 6 shows the correlation of the tdg dissipation coefficient with froude number fr from case 1 to case 5 the fr here is divided into froude number of the entrance of main stream fra froude number of the entrance of tributary frb and froude number of the entrance of tributary to main stream frc it shows that the tdg dissipation coefficient increases as fra increases and decreases as frc increases with a little bit of fluctuation from 0 25 to 0 45 and its relationship with frb is not obvious the coefficient of determination for fra frb and frc are 0 791 0 004 and 0 710 respectively according to the dimensional analysis the formula for estimating the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg at the confluence can be written as 14 k t ϕ t ν t h 2 a regression analysis of the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg k t with the turbulent viscosity coefficient ν t and the water depth h at the confluence under different turbulent conditions from case 1 to case 5 are carried out the cases are shown in table 5 as shown in fig 7 the results show that there is a good correlation of the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg with the turbulent viscosity coefficient and the water depth at the confluence the coefficient of determination is 0 9512 the fitting formula for estimating dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg is shown in eq 15 15 k t 0 7071 ν t h 2 the fitting result shows that the non dimensional parameter ϕ t value is 0 7071 which was calibrated by experimental data in this paper it should be noted that the equation is based on the measured water temperature 25 6 c the dissipation coefficient at normal temperature 20 c can be converted according to shen et al 2014 compared with fr the turbulent viscosity coefficient and the water depth are more appropriate factors to reflect the change of the dissipation coefficient of tdg at the confluence due to the existence of separation zone and shear layer at the confluence zone and secondary circulation in the downstream 3 3 application of the dissipation coefficient in numerical simulation 3 3 1 verification of flow field in an experimental study of the 90 degree confluence canal weber et al 2001 measured the three dimensional flow field at the confluence area kang 2011 used weber s experimental data to validate the established model in this paper the mathematical model of tdg in confluences was verified by the flume experiment the comparison results of velocity between simulations and experiments for case 2 case 3 and case 5 are demonstrated in fig 8 horizontal planes and fig 9 transverse planes the black arrow represents the calculated results while the red arrow represents that of the measurement the comparison results of turbulent kinetic energy between simulations and experiments for case 5 is demonstrated in fig 10 the quantitative information about the relative error of velocity are showed in table 3 horizontal planes and table 4 transversal planes the maximum relative error of turbulent kinetic energy in all cases is 5 3 which showed in fig 10 that give a good agreement between model and experiment results from the figures and tables as shown in fig 8 there exists a region with small flow velocity near the side wall of the tributary which is called separation zone the shape of separation zone is not very different between the three cases the flow velocity downstream of the confluence near the right bank is smaller than that in the left bank due to the extrusion from the tributary the velocity of the central region is slightly larger than that in the left bank of the same cross section in addition the size of separation zone on surface plane is slightly larger than that on bottom plane fig 9 shows the comparative results of velocity in three transversal planes x 2 0 m x 3 7 m and x 6 2 m between simulation and experiment for the three cases it gives a good agreement between model and experiment results it can be noticed from fig 9 that the secondary flow phenomenon is appeared in the cross section downstream of the confluence area and there are two different directions of circulation in the nine transversal planes displayed one near the tributary side is clockwise and the other one near the opposite bank is counterclockwise that s partly due to the unique curve features flow line which is deflected obviously after the tributary water flowing into the mainstream flume at the same time there is a second secondary flow due to anisotropic turbulence with the increase of the distance from x direction the secondary circulation flow near the tributary side becomes less significant and the velocity of this area in the v w plane gets smaller it can also be seen from the figure that the secondary flow makes the velocity near the water surface and bottom smaller than the velocity in the middle layer of the water body in addition fig 9 indicates that the greater the flow radio the more significant the secondary flow characteristics in particular the phenomenon of secondary flow is almost vanishing at the x 3 7 m position 3 3 2 verification of tdg supersaturation distribution of tdg supersaturation and comparison between simulation and experiment in different horizontal planes z 0 05 m z 0 12 m and z 0 20 m for case 6 are presented in fig 11 the small square blocks on the graph represent the experimental values calculated and experimental results are compared and the results indicate that the error values at the measurement points between the two varied from 5 7 to 5 3 and the biggest relative error value 5 7 of all the measurement points occur at the coordinate point 6 2 0 2 0 12 in case 6 the calculated concentration of tdg supersaturation and the variation trend are in agreement to the experiment as shown in fig 11 there is a low tdg saturation region the tdg saturation is less than 105 near the tributary side at the confluence which is coincides almost with the separation zone the range of the area increases with the decrease of water depth which are 1 05 m2 z 0 05 m 1 21 m2 z 0 12 m and 1 52 m2 z 0 20 m respectively 3 4 discussion on the distribution of tdg supersaturation at confluences fig 12 a shows the distribution of flow field and tdg supersaturation on transversal plane a for case 3 the calculated results show the great influence of flow field on tdg supersaturation the velocity in x direction is small near the tributary side and the saturation of tdg supersaturation is correspondingly lower in this region than other zones the velocity in y z cross section is big enough to exhibit the obvious secondary flow the maximum saturation of tdg in the middle and bottom layers occurs at the side far from the tributary it means the influence of the tributary is more obvious on the surface than that on the bottom and the water surface blending more intense fig 12 b shows the calculated distribution of tdg supersaturation in different horizontal planes for case 2 case 3 and case 5 fig 12 c shows the calculated distribution of tdg supersaturation in different horizontal planes for the three cases in the four figures the water body supersaturated with less than 110 and 120 tdg are marked and highlighted the detail area ratio statistics of the low tdg saturation area with less than 110 s110 and 120 s120 of supersaturated tdg concentration which can provide a better shelter area for fish survival and reproduction are exhibited in table 6 horizontal plane and table 7 transversal plane fig 12 d shows the correlation of the area ratio low tdg saturation area to the horizontal plane area of flume downstream the confluence with flow ratio in different horizontal and transversal planes of the six cases it can be noticed that the greater the flow ratio the more obvious the influence of the tributary on the mainstream flume and the larger the low tdg saturation area according to fig 12 and table 6 the areas below 110 and 120 of tdg supersaturation in horizontal plane get smaller as the depth or the flow ratio decreases the lengths get shorter as the depth increase the maximum area ratio value 0 39 of s110 is located in the surface layer of case 6 while the minimum area ratio value 0 01 present to the bottom layer of case 1 meanwhile the maximum and minimum area ratio value 0 59 and 0 02 of s120 are located in the same positions of the same cases as the s110 it can be seen that the area value on the surface is far from the middle and lower layer while the middle layer and water bottom are very close to each other the surface layer area is closer to uniformity than middle layer and bottom layer which means the influence of tributary on the mainstream become stronger as the depth decreases as shown in fig 12 and table 7 the s110 in transversal planes get smaller as the longitudinal distance or the flow ratio decreases however the s120 get larger as the longitudinal distance or the flow ratio increases the maximum area ratio value 0 36 of s110 is located in the cross section x 2 0 m for case 6 while the minimum area ratio value 0 06 present to the cross section x 6 2 m for case 1 meanwhile the maximum and minimum area ratio value 0 52 and 0 16 of s120 are located in the cross section x 6 2 m for case 6 and cross section x 2 0 m for case 1 thus the s110 in three transverse planes increases gradually while the s120 decrease gradually with the increase of the longitudinal distance to obtain the relationship between the area ratio of low tdg saturation water and the flow ratio many more numerical simulation studies have been carried out in this paper fig 13 shows the correlation of the area ratio of low tdg saturation water in the middle layer of horizontal plane and middle cross section of separation zone with flow ratio the regression between s110 or s120 and flow ratio is illustrated in fig 13 the correlation between the two parameters in horizontal plane and cross section is high which can provide an important scientific basis for the prediction of the dissipation process of tdg supersaturation and low tdg water area for fish refuge at confluences above all the experimental and calculated results in figures show that the convergence of the tributary flume which has a natural low tdg saturation level 100 can affect the high tdg saturation level of the mainstream flume an obvious difference in tdg levels occurred after the tributary flowed into the main flume this flow which mainly comes from the tributary flume occupies a narrow range on the right side of the mainstream with lower velocity and tdg concentration which is located in the separation zone downstream of the confluence that means the distribution of flow field has a significant impaction on the tdg distribution in addition the results in horizontal planes and transversal planes indicate that the bigger flow ratio the larger the low tdg saturation area the low tdg saturation area increases as the depth decreases in a word the deeper the water depth or the farther the longitudinal distance the more uniform the tdg distribution 4 conclusions the experiments and simulations of the supersaturated tdg distribution at confluences under different conditions were carried out in this paper a three dimensional supersaturated tdg transportation and dissipation model at the confluence was established and had been verified by experiment data we have investigated the quantitative relationships between the area ratio of low tdg saturation water and the flow ratio in typical planes the calculation and experimental results reveal the distribution mechanism and situation of supersaturated tdg at the confluences specifically the convergence of the tributary water reduces the tdg saturation in the mainstream there is a low tdg saturation zone in the separation zone where provide a better shelter area for fish survival and reproduction based on research characterizing fish tolerance the 3d tdg model at confluences is established and verified by experimental data of which maximum relative error presents as 5 7 the build relationship among the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg with turbulent viscosity coefficient and water depth at the confluence can be described as k t 0 7071 ν t h 2 the regression between s110 or s120 and flow ratio λ in the middle layer of horizontal planes and middle cross section of separation zone are illustrated as follows s 110 0 1532 λ 2 0 6116 λ s 110 0 2361 λ 2 0 8058 λ s 120 0 1816 ln λ 0 559 s 120 0 2201 n λ 0 6008 this study provides a scientific basis for the utilization of a low tdg saturation region at the confluences to improve the river ecosystem and provides a digital basis for fishes shelter space to escape the impact of supersaturated tdg future multiple modeling and field observation efforts are suggested to combine the endurance of fish with respect to supersaturated tdg at the confluence in

18948,water is a resource that affects every aspect of life intentional terrorist or wartime events or accidental water contamination events could have a tremendous impact on public health behavior and morale quick detection of such events can mitigate their effects and reduce the potential damage continuous on line monitoring is the first line of defense for reducing contamination associated damage one of the available tools for such detection is the uv absorbance spectrophotometry where the absorbance spectra are compared against a set of normal and contaminated water fingerprints however as there are many factors at play that affect this comparison it is an elusive and tedious task further the comparison against a set of known fingerprints is futile when the water in the supply system are a mix with varying proportions of water from different sources which differ significantly in their physicochemical characteristics this study presents a new scheme for early detection of contamination events through uv absorbance under unknown routine conditions the detection mechanism is based on a new affinity measure fitness and a procedure similar to gram based amplification which result in a flexible mechanism to alert if a contamination is present the method was shown to be most effective when applied to a set of comprehensive experiments which examined the absorbance of various contaminants in drinking water in lab and real life configurations four datasets which contained real readings from either laboratory experiments or monitoring station of an operational water supply system were used to extend the testbed even further an artificial dataset simulating a vast array of proportions between specific water sources is also presented the results show that for all datasets high detection rates while maintaining low levels of false alarms were obtained by the algorithm graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality spectrophotometry early contamination detection event detection system 1 introduction assuring the safety of drinking water is a primary objective of water utilities throughout history intentional contaminations of drinking water as an act of war terrorism as well as accidental or unintentional contaminations by high concentrations of toxic materials such as cyanides phenols ammonia and pesticides were recorded green et al 2003 winston et al 2003 gleick 2006 rimhanen finne et al 2010 the first step towards responding and minimizing risks to public health can only be achieved through quick detection of contamination events by continuous monitoring asheri arnon et al 2018 many potential contaminants comprising caustic and corrosive substances cyanides heavy metals poisons hydrocarbons herbicides pesticides organic substances chemical warfare substances radioactive compounds pathogenic bacteria and viruses can be found in the water system usepa 2005 the large variety of potential contaminants and their diverse physicochemical characteristics render the detection task difficult among the various pollutants organic contaminants such as pesticides fuel products and organic solvents are widely used can be obtained relatively easily and can cause acute poisoning at relatively low concentrations and with relatively short exposure therefore developing instruments that can detect the presence of organic components in water in real time is an essential task commonly water contamination events detection studies infer routine water patterns or fingerprint by measuring indicator or surrogate physical and chemical parameters namely turbidity residual chlorine oxidation reduction potential orp total organic carbon toc conductivity and chloride and then applying various mechanisms to detect deviations from these patterns oliker and ostfelt 2014 kroll and king 2007 kroll and king 2007 hall et al 2007 murray et al 2010 pickard et al 2011 perelman et al 2012 asheri arnon et al 2018 the routine benign patterns are obtained from measurements of presumably non contaminated water using this methodology however is challenging due to the large array of potential contaminants all of which should be significantly measurable in order to be detected moreover changes in water quality parameters might reflect normal processes such as changes in the water treatment or by maintenance and operational routines such as the onset of a booster pump to cope with these limitations perelman et al 2012 used artificial neural networks for contamination detection through multivariate water quality parameters while accounting for possible outliers the events were identified based on consequent classification of errors and by updating a bayesian probability function arad et al 2013 developed a genetic algorithm based two stages dynamic thresholds scheme for contamination event detection in water distribution in another study of arad et al 2012 they used regression trees to detect outliers in water quality measurements oliker and ostfeld 2015 compared weighted support vector machine svm classifier with minimum volume ellipsoid mve following a sequence analysis for the classification of contamination events mckenna et al 2007 used binomial event discriminator to detect events while finding outliers within a time series hou et al 2013 used a method for detecting contamination events based on the dempster shafer evidence theory the method first utilizes an autoregressive model to predict future water quality parameters by using recent measurements from water quality sensors next the method assigns probabilities to the time series of residuals formed by comparing predicted water quality parameters with threshold values finally the dempster shafer fusion method searches for anomalous probabilities of the residuals and uses the search result to determine whether the current water meets the quality standards for drinking water hou et al 2014 used uv vis absorption spectroscopy data to modulate contamination events in water distribution systems by probabilistic principal component analysis together with a multivariate monitoring chart a well known system for early contamination detection is the canary software national homeland security research center 2010 murray et al 2010 developed by sandia national laboratories and the united states environmental protection agency the canary utilizes several algorithms to analyze multiple water quality measurements and runs a four step process to examine recent water quality data and identify significant deviations from these data to calculate the probability of a possible contamination events langergraber et al 2004 suggested the use of a commercial instrument to measure the absorbance spectrum between 190 and 720 nm uv vis and detects changes in water quality by monitoring the shape of the spectrum and responding to abnormal changes spectral alarms the spectrum is also used to derive more specific parameters such as turbidity nitrate concentration spectral absorbance coefficient at 254 nm sac254 total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod etc alarms are then generated using four different approaches static alarm thresholds dynamic alarm thresholds time gradients pattern recognition based and composite alarms all the aforementioned methods which use either short or long historical windows assume that the observed water s physicochemical characteristics if no contamination occurs present a limited set of possible values however this assumption might not hold for all water systems to illustrate one can consider systems that are fed from several sources each with its own water quality characteristics the israeli water system for example is fed from three main sources which differ significantly in their content of dissolved matter and chemical composition desalinated seawater surface water and groundwater this is in addition to within source types variability that may exist e g when different wells are used frolich et al 2017 moreover because the production from each source is based on its availability demand and energy costs the proportions of the sources may change on a seasonal daily and even hourly basis thus highly variable unknown water mixtures are produced this operational mode hinders the definition of water background fingerprint i e the normal water characteristics limiting the applicability of the common fingerprint approach despite the advancements in the study of water contamination event detection in recent years many of the existing methods still have major shortcomings the main weaknesses are 1 high rate of false positives and negatives 2 limited integration of multiple features to obtain an exhaustive result 3 cumbersome computationally demanding and unsuitability for online detection 4 the need for a large number of real contamination events for model training events which are rare and 5 disregarding varying background hou et al 2013 a recent study has presented the fitness method for identifying the water source surface water desalinated seawater or groundwater and for differentiating between contaminated and potable water when water from only one source is flowing through the system asheri arnon et al 2018 in the study here an algorithm for early nearly acute contamination detection which processes multivariate time series using the surrogate concept of measuring contaminants with a uv spectrophotometer here after uv sp is presented thus the fitness method is extended here to enable differentiation between potable and contaminated water while coping with varying background as a result of stochastically changing proportions of waters from multiple sources which feed the network 2 materials and methods the assumption here of highly varying characteristics of the routine water in the supply system hampers event detection algorithms as one cannot rely on steady background conditions to overcome this obstacle we first characterize the different water sources then these spectral absorbance readings serve as an index for changes in water composition of organic and inorganic components pollutants or natural asheri arnon et al 2018 hence based on the above characterization classify the water into potable or contaminated this approach is different from the aforementioned state of the art approaches which do not consider the water sources we validated this method using a combination of uv absorbance datasets from laboratory experiments and an operational water supply system these methodology and datasets were used to develop and then to test the detection algorithm in a manner which considers changes that stem from both the water sources and operational and maintenance actions in a supply system 2 1 uv spectrophotometer analyzer all data for this study were acquired by two on line continuous spectroscopy analyzers real spectrum analyzer pl3000 toc uva pc model real tech the device equipped with a deuterium lamp and a 1 cm path length flow cell measures uv absorbance within a range of 0 1 5 cm 1 at 117 different wavelengths between 197 8 and 370 8 nm with a resolution of 1 4 1 6 nm reading frequency was 1 2 5 min 1 a flow rate of 300 800 ml min was required for the continuous monitoring 2 2 data the data used here comprise two main sets real measurements section 2 2 1 and synthetic data section 2 2 2 the former was created by comprehensive laboratory experiments and in situ water measurements acquired from an operational water supply system the latter was produced by using super positioning benign routine real data acquired in the operational water system and the addition due to contamination as was measured in the lab experiments asheri arnon et al 2018 fig 1 depicts the structure of all the datasets used in this study 2 2 1 real measurements datasets the real measurements data comprise two distinctive sets of uv absorbance readings one of experimental data and the other of on line measurements from a water supply system in the lab configuration the data was obtained from tap water extracted from three sources groundwater from two adjacent wells from the mountain aquifer filtered surface water from the sea of galilee lake kinneret and desalinated mediterranean seawater section a of the supplementary material specifies the main physicochemical characteristics of the three water sources in addition distilled water with electrical conductivity of 0 15 0 57 μmho cm 0 15 0 57 μs microsiemens was tested serving as a reference of water without any substances considering these sources the contamination spiking experiments were held with water extracted from only one source i e single source the spiking experiments were conducted in either two or three steps for each of the water sources first uncontaminated water was continuously monitored in a container equipped with a recirculation system through the uv analyzer to create a baseline then while monitoring 1 mg l of an organic contaminant was added to the water at the last optional step a higher concentration of the contaminant was added to give a final concentration of 2 3 or 5 mg l these quantities of 1 2 3 or 5 mg l were chosen as for most contaminants in this study short exposure to these contaminants do not present any appreciable health risks thus detecting these chemicals at these levels would be more than sufficient to protect public health tangena et al 2012 section b of the supplementary material details the no observed adverse effect level noael or no observed effect level noel dosage the oral median lethal dose ld50 values and the pesticide group of the contaminants used the procedure was repeated for each water type with five different organic contaminants which cannot be specified due to security restrictions asheri arnon et al 2018 the mixed water experiments were conducted to simulate water mixtures which may flow in the supply distribution system these experiments were conducted in several stages at each stage we added a measured amount of a certain water source to the sample in proportions that may occur in the supply system fig 2 schematically describe the spiking and mixed water experiments and further information can be found in asheri arnon et al 2018 the on line readings were extracted from a central monitoring station of mekorot israel s national water company the uv sp mounted at this station continuously monitored unknown mixtures of drinking water from three sources surface water desalinated mediterranean sea water and groundwater the groundwater originates from several wells mostly from the coastal aquifer and a few from the mountain aquifer and constituted a minor portion of the total as compared to the surface water and the desalinated water absorbance datasets for real potable water hereafter potable water dataset were generated using data from 1 the monitoring station 3 238 6 280 measurements 2 laboratory mixed water experiments 412 measurements and 3 optional uncontaminated water of only one water type 1 073 measurements the readings from the first stage of laboratory contaminant spiking experiments 2 2 2 synthetic dataset obtaining exhaustive datasets characterizing a wide variety of potable and contaminated mixed water sources through laboratory experiments is a complex and expensive task we therefore created two types of synthetic datasets based on the lab experiments and on the measurements acquired from a real operational water system the following notation facilitate the description of the synthetic data sets let s t k be the absorbance spectrum acquired at time t t each vector element of the spectrum is the absorbance at k k wavelength in the present study k 117 the number of wavelengths measured by the sp analyzer each such stage is then characterized by the element wise median of all spectra s t k acquired in that stage to this end m j k 0 is the k elements absorbance spectrum for water originated from source j with no contamination and m j k c x is the k elements absorbance spectrum for water from source j with x mg l of contaminant c following the lab experiments described above 2 2 1 the contribution of each contaminant to the absorption spectra was obtained by deducting the background absorbance median uncontaminated water m j k 0 from the absorbance of the contaminated sample measured in the second or third stage of the spike experiments thus n j t k c x s j t k c x m j k 0 we refer to n j t k c x as net absorbance in generating these net absorbance templets priority was given to experiments conducted with distilled or desalinated water which have low background absorbance levels thirty net absorbance spectra of continues measurements for each of the five tested contaminants and for each of the two concentrations were created this way producing 300 net absorbance spectra for simulating contamination in a real network the potable water dataset was duplicated one served as a potable water dataset and the other as contaminated dataset after super positioning the net absorbance and real spectra asheri arnon et al 2018 simulating absorbance in this manner is practical for generating large datasets of contaminated mixed water which simulate contamination of the distribution network water containing a typical noise as would be present in the distribution network and the possible variation within contaminant readings four datasets were created using this method each containing data from a different period of the monitor station readings and data from either the mixed water experiments or the first stage of contaminant experiments or both in addition to the simulated datasets mentioned above we generated another dataset which we dubbed as artificial dataset to examine how the algorithm s performance was affected by both the dataset s size and the nature of the mixtures i e the variety and identity of the water sources in the mixture thus this dataset allows for pinpointing water sources to be included in specific mixtures of interest with which the algorithm can be trained and evaluated this flexibility allows to design a dataset which perfectly represents the water flowing in a specific monitoring station the artificial dataset was generated by creating 6 000 readings of potable water with random portions between the three examined water sources specifically each spectrum is a combination of different proportions of the three water source absorbance characteristic spectra m j k 0 1 m ˆ t k j 1 3 α j m j k 0 s t j 1 3 α j 1 α j 0 j the potable water dataset was then duplicated with one dataset representing potable water and the other representing contaminated water by super positioning n t k and m ˆ t k as described for the simulated datasets 2 3 algorithmic approach the suggest algorithm consists of four main elements 1 the fitness measure an affinity measure between each input spectrum and each water source spectrophotometric characteristic asheri arnon et al 2018 2 amplification of the fitness product to enhance the differences between potable and contaminated water 3 classification to categorize each measure whether it is contaminated or potable 4 post processing to determine whether there is a water contamination event the algorithm s flow and aims are summarized in table 1 and fig 3 its building blocks are described in detail in the following sections 2 4 algorithm stages 2 4 1 preprocessing since the water absorption baseline measurements may drift with time due to scaling leading to higher absorbance values the first stage was to correct this drift this was done by subtracting the minimal absorbance value among all wavelengths for each measurement from absorbance values at all wavelengths thus eliminating most of the drift effect 2 s ˆ t k s t k min k s t k 2 4 2 features analysis in a previous early water contamination detection study asheri arnon et al 2018 have presented a contamination detection mechanism which required the identification of the water source once the source is known its characteristic spectra m j k 0 was compared against the characteristic spectra of the examined sample by calculating the fitness measure between the tested measurement and m j k 0 for the entire spectrum this method essentially reduces the problem s dimensions to one the fitness values between a measurement and the water source characteristics thus this method is suitable when the differences between classes are considerable and the water originates from a single source and is not a mixture when the differences between classes are marginal reducing the problem to one dimension will make classification difficult to alleviate these hurdles three mechanisms are presented here a wavelength selection b sub band fitness computation and c feature amplification constituting the second third and fourth stages of the algorithm the wavelengths selection mechanism is designed so it identifies ℓ l wavelengths in which the difference between potable and contaminated water are most significant the algorithm is detailed in sub algorithm 1 once the l wavelengths are identified the spectrum is divided into sub bands and the fitness value is calculated for each sub band separately in this study the optimal l the number of wavelengths to use was found to be 57 these 57 channels were divided into 5 sub bands hence each sample spectrum obtains 15 fitness values 5 wavelength bands for each of the three water types 15 column fitness for t samples we obtain a tx15 elements matrix f image 2 sub algorithm 1 wavelength selection algorithm stage two of the algorithm 2 4 3 features amplification in order to allow better separation of potable and contaminated water in unknown background conditions in the fourth stage the outer product of each fitness vector is computed this yields a matrix of tx225 values 225 column fitness 2 of the 225 column fitness 2 only columns with relatively significant differences between potable and contaminated water were heuristically chosen for building the classifier for potable or contaminated water the algorithm choosing the relevant columns is detailed in sub algorithm 2 image 3 sub algorithm 2 relevant column selection of the 225 column fitness 2 algorithm stage four of the algorithm the chosen columns either 35 or 60 are the final products of the fourth stage the approach of amplifying and choosing the relevant columns in the fourth stage of the algorithm is supported by the mutual coherence of gram matrix elad 2010 for an arbitrary matrix a the mutual coherence μ a is defined as the largest absolute normalized inner product between different columns of a denoting the kth column in a by ak the mutual coherence is given by 3 μ a m a x a i t a j a i 2 a j 2 s t 1 i j m i j while both methods reveal the proximity between columns they are not identical in the fitness amplification method columns that reflect contamination result with higher proximity to each other which means that the method is amplifying the differences between data of contaminated and potable water however while elad 2010 defines the mutual coherence as the maximal value of the gram matrix between two normalized columns normalization enables comparison between coherence of all inner product of columns in this work the coherence can be defined as relative the relativity is in comparing between the number of elements in each column of the a i a j t matrix of contaminated water that are bigger than a threshold and the number of elements bigger than the same threshold in the corresponding columns of the potable water matrix 2 4 4 building the classifier at the fifth stage of the algorithm the processed data of the fitness amplification method was classified as potable or contaminated water using hard margin linear svm marsland 2009 svm was applied to 15 column fitness 35 column fitness and 60 column fitness datasets we tested four datasets of at least 6000 readings of both potable and contaminated water on each svm run the datasets were randomly divided to training and testing subsets at ratios between 25 50 and 75 50 respectively each dataset was tested several times to ensure robustness the results of this stage are presented in confusion matrices hodge and pollack 1962 the criteria for good results are high rates of both true negative and true positive i e high values of the top left and bottom right cells respectively in a confusion matrix which is arranged as presented in the results 2 4 5 post processing in the sixth and final stage of the algorithm after each measurement is classified as potable or contaminated using the svm model the algorithm determines whether or not an alarm should go off to reduce false alarms a two step sequential analysis is done 1 at the measurement level a measurement t is classified as contaminated only when at least 2 of the 3 following conditions are fulfilled a at least 2 of the measurements t 2 t 1 t indicate contamination b at least 2 of the measurements t 1 t t 1 indicate contamination c at least 2 of the measurements t t 1 t 2 indicate contamination 2 at the event level an alarm will go off only when three consecutive measurements at step 1 indicate contamination hence it takes two time intervals between three consecutive measurements in this study two time intervals are equal to 5 min thus the time lag in this study is five minutes from detection to alert while the alert is delayed in this time period this scheme significantly lowers the rate of false alarms the output of the post processing stage is illustrated in fig 4 where a snippet of the algorithm s output is presented with respect to the true presence of contamination dashdotted green before dotted blue and after dashed red the post processing stage 3 results and discussion applying svm to the 15 column fitness dataset produced the results displayed in the confusion matrix hodge and pollack 1962 presented in table 2 a the dataset consists of mixed water data extracted both from the laboratory experiments and the monitoring station containing 6476 readings of both potable and simulated contaminated water dataset a applying svm to the 35 column fitness dataset and to the 60 column fitness dataset which created by the same data produced the results displayed in table 2 b and c respectively results presented are the mean values and sd received after 9 5 and 17 svm runs for the 15 35 and 60 columns respectively between the three data processing approaches the best results for all tested datasets were consistently received when svm was applied to the 60 column fitness these results justified the fourth stage of feature amplification therefore for the rest of the analysis only the 60 column fitness svm s results are presented additional three simulated sets of mixed water readings datasets b c d were examined using the 60 column fitness scheme the results are detailed in table 3 between all tested datasets of both real and simulated data best results in terms of true and false alarms were obtained by applying 60 column fitness svm to the largest dataset of 12 560 readings dataset d these results may be due to the fact that the data were acquired from water containing mostly mixtures of the basic waters used to calibrate the algorithm and hence most data were in between the three absorbance characteristics another possible explanation is the size of the dataset since a large dataset provides a large training set which better trains the svm model worst results were obtained for dataset b which could be related to the fact that the water flowing through the station while monitoring took place were not comprised of the three basic water types alone fig 5 a illustrates these results for dataset b with comparison to the readings in dataset d which mostly represent mixtures of the basic waters fig 5 b the dashed lines depict the spectra characterizing the different single water source a mixture comprised of the basic waters is a superposition i e a linear combination of the water sources spectral characterization hence all measurements must be limited by the minimal and the maximal water sources spectral characterization as more measurements fall outside this range and the larger the deviation from this range the algorithm performance is expected to degrade to verify these assumptions we created an artificial dataset section 2 2 2 as a combination of the characteristic absorbance of the three water types which contained 12 000 readings of both potable and contaminated water the results of this simulation table 5 indicate the importance of using well characterized water sources and a large dataset finally post processing which is described in 2 4 4 was applied we present here the final results of dataset a which is relatively small and dataset d which is relatively large both datasets were quite well represented by the algorithm water source characteristics between all the simulated datasets tested the largest dataset d yielded the best results with no false alarms in seven algorithm runs 107 of 109 events 98 were detected once one contaminant at 1 mg l was twice not detected and in six runs 100 of the events were detected the smallest dataset a yielded the poorest results out of five algorithm runs one resulted with four false alarms and four resulted with two false alarms each in all five runs 95 of 108 events 88 were detected all 3 mg l contaminations were detected while out of the 1 mg l contaminations that were not detected one contaminant was very dominant both datasets were quite well represented by the water source characteristics since we divided the different datasets to training and validation portions the size of the datasets also affects the training set size in real life scenarios when the algorithm is applied to a specific monitoring station the training set s size depends on the water flow regime at a station i e the time it would take for representative water sources in varying mixture ratios to flow through the sensors table 4 presents the svm results for 12 000 artificial readings the algorithm with the post processing stage was run 10 times while using different samples in the dataset for training and testing in each run in all runs no false alarms were obtained and all contaminated events were detected this supports our assumptions that good results will be obtained when 1 the measurement data represent all water sources in the supply system which used to form the algorithm the medians and mixtures of these waters and 2 when a large dataset is used to train and define the model to evaluate the contribution of the stages of data processing preceding the classification i e the fitness and amplification stages classification was done by running svm with raw data this was done with the artificial dataset since it contains no monitoring station noise using this dataset in ten svm runs yielded minimal false alarms but a poor rate of true alarms table 5 these results indicate that the algorithm processing stages are essential to the algorithm success 4 conclusions an early warning algorithm for contamination events detection in drinking water with an unknown stochastic background is presented here the uncontaminated databases comprised mostly online readings of a uv sp at a mekorot supply system this kind of database enabled us to generate and test the algorithm in a real water supply system the simulated database for the contaminated water comprised the same data only with the addition of the contaminant s absorbance delta as measured in laboratory spiking experiments the algorithm is based on a novel affinity measure which was firstly described by asheri arnon 2018 the fitness measure which combines both the pearson correlation and the euclidean distance between the tested absorbance spectrum and the characteristic absorbance of the water types flowing in the water distribution system this measure of relationship strength between two spectral measurements or other pairs of quantitative continuous or multivariate variables reflects both the physical distance and the dependence between the variables therefore this method can potentially be implemented in any anomaly detection applications the fitness results were further amplified to better differentiate between potable and contaminated water and an svm classifier was computed to classify each reading to either category at the last stage a sequence analysis is performed to determine an event in order to achieve high detection rates while maintaining a low level of false alarms the model needs to be well trained and defined using a dataset with high variability which represents all the water sources which flow in the specific monitoring station for which the algorithm is designated this can be achieved using either real measurements or artificially generating data to simulate different mixing proportions of the basic waters absorbance values and by implementing the absorbance delta values of different contaminants the algorithm has two major strengths 1 it detects contaminants at relatively low concentrations with a very low rate of false positives if any even with stochastic and highly varying water characteristics 2 it can be initialized using absorbance characteristics of the waters which flow in the specific monitoring station without the need for a learning period these pivotal advantages enable the system of a uv sp combined with the algorithm to serve as an early warning system for drinking water at any supply system with simple and fast implementation declaration of interests the

18948,water is a resource that affects every aspect of life intentional terrorist or wartime events or accidental water contamination events could have a tremendous impact on public health behavior and morale quick detection of such events can mitigate their effects and reduce the potential damage continuous on line monitoring is the first line of defense for reducing contamination associated damage one of the available tools for such detection is the uv absorbance spectrophotometry where the absorbance spectra are compared against a set of normal and contaminated water fingerprints however as there are many factors at play that affect this comparison it is an elusive and tedious task further the comparison against a set of known fingerprints is futile when the water in the supply system are a mix with varying proportions of water from different sources which differ significantly in their physicochemical characteristics this study presents a new scheme for early detection of contamination events through uv absorbance under unknown routine conditions the detection mechanism is based on a new affinity measure fitness and a procedure similar to gram based amplification which result in a flexible mechanism to alert if a contamination is present the method was shown to be most effective when applied to a set of comprehensive experiments which examined the absorbance of various contaminants in drinking water in lab and real life configurations four datasets which contained real readings from either laboratory experiments or monitoring station of an operational water supply system were used to extend the testbed even further an artificial dataset simulating a vast array of proportions between specific water sources is also presented the results show that for all datasets high detection rates while maintaining low levels of false alarms were obtained by the algorithm graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality spectrophotometry early contamination detection event detection system 1 introduction assuring the safety of drinking water is a primary objective of water utilities throughout history intentional contaminations of drinking water as an act of war terrorism as well as accidental or unintentional contaminations by high concentrations of toxic materials such as cyanides phenols ammonia and pesticides were recorded green et al 2003 winston et al 2003 gleick 2006 rimhanen finne et al 2010 the first step towards responding and minimizing risks to public health can only be achieved through quick detection of contamination events by continuous monitoring asheri arnon et al 2018 many potential contaminants comprising caustic and corrosive substances cyanides heavy metals poisons hydrocarbons herbicides pesticides organic substances chemical warfare substances radioactive compounds pathogenic bacteria and viruses can be found in the water system usepa 2005 the large variety of potential contaminants and their diverse physicochemical characteristics render the detection task difficult among the various pollutants organic contaminants such as pesticides fuel products and organic solvents are widely used can be obtained relatively easily and can cause acute poisoning at relatively low concentrations and with relatively short exposure therefore developing instruments that can detect the presence of organic components in water in real time is an essential task commonly water contamination events detection studies infer routine water patterns or fingerprint by measuring indicator or surrogate physical and chemical parameters namely turbidity residual chlorine oxidation reduction potential orp total organic carbon toc conductivity and chloride and then applying various mechanisms to detect deviations from these patterns oliker and ostfelt 2014 kroll and king 2007 kroll and king 2007 hall et al 2007 murray et al 2010 pickard et al 2011 perelman et al 2012 asheri arnon et al 2018 the routine benign patterns are obtained from measurements of presumably non contaminated water using this methodology however is challenging due to the large array of potential contaminants all of which should be significantly measurable in order to be detected moreover changes in water quality parameters might reflect normal processes such as changes in the water treatment or by maintenance and operational routines such as the onset of a booster pump to cope with these limitations perelman et al 2012 used artificial neural networks for contamination detection through multivariate water quality parameters while accounting for possible outliers the events were identified based on consequent classification of errors and by updating a bayesian probability function arad et al 2013 developed a genetic algorithm based two stages dynamic thresholds scheme for contamination event detection in water distribution in another study of arad et al 2012 they used regression trees to detect outliers in water quality measurements oliker and ostfeld 2015 compared weighted support vector machine svm classifier with minimum volume ellipsoid mve following a sequence analysis for the classification of contamination events mckenna et al 2007 used binomial event discriminator to detect events while finding outliers within a time series hou et al 2013 used a method for detecting contamination events based on the dempster shafer evidence theory the method first utilizes an autoregressive model to predict future water quality parameters by using recent measurements from water quality sensors next the method assigns probabilities to the time series of residuals formed by comparing predicted water quality parameters with threshold values finally the dempster shafer fusion method searches for anomalous probabilities of the residuals and uses the search result to determine whether the current water meets the quality standards for drinking water hou et al 2014 used uv vis absorption spectroscopy data to modulate contamination events in water distribution systems by probabilistic principal component analysis together with a multivariate monitoring chart a well known system for early contamination detection is the canary software national homeland security research center 2010 murray et al 2010 developed by sandia national laboratories and the united states environmental protection agency the canary utilizes several algorithms to analyze multiple water quality measurements and runs a four step process to examine recent water quality data and identify significant deviations from these data to calculate the probability of a possible contamination events langergraber et al 2004 suggested the use of a commercial instrument to measure the absorbance spectrum between 190 and 720 nm uv vis and detects changes in water quality by monitoring the shape of the spectrum and responding to abnormal changes spectral alarms the spectrum is also used to derive more specific parameters such as turbidity nitrate concentration spectral absorbance coefficient at 254 nm sac254 total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod etc alarms are then generated using four different approaches static alarm thresholds dynamic alarm thresholds time gradients pattern recognition based and composite alarms all the aforementioned methods which use either short or long historical windows assume that the observed water s physicochemical characteristics if no contamination occurs present a limited set of possible values however this assumption might not hold for all water systems to illustrate one can consider systems that are fed from several sources each with its own water quality characteristics the israeli water system for example is fed from three main sources which differ significantly in their content of dissolved matter and chemical composition desalinated seawater surface water and groundwater this is in addition to within source types variability that may exist e g when different wells are used frolich et al 2017 moreover because the production from each source is based on its availability demand and energy costs the proportions of the sources may change on a seasonal daily and even hourly basis thus highly variable unknown water mixtures are produced this operational mode hinders the definition of water background fingerprint i e the normal water characteristics limiting the applicability of the common fingerprint approach despite the advancements in the study of water contamination event detection in recent years many of the existing methods still have major shortcomings the main weaknesses are 1 high rate of false positives and negatives 2 limited integration of multiple features to obtain an exhaustive result 3 cumbersome computationally demanding and unsuitability for online detection 4 the need for a large number of real contamination events for model training events which are rare and 5 disregarding varying background hou et al 2013 a recent study has presented the fitness method for identifying the water source surface water desalinated seawater or groundwater and for differentiating between contaminated and potable water when water from only one source is flowing through the system asheri arnon et al 2018 in the study here an algorithm for early nearly acute contamination detection which processes multivariate time series using the surrogate concept of measuring contaminants with a uv spectrophotometer here after uv sp is presented thus the fitness method is extended here to enable differentiation between potable and contaminated water while coping with varying background as a result of stochastically changing proportions of waters from multiple sources which feed the network 2 materials and methods the assumption here of highly varying characteristics of the routine water in the supply system hampers event detection algorithms as one cannot rely on steady background conditions to overcome this obstacle we first characterize the different water sources then these spectral absorbance readings serve as an index for changes in water composition of organic and inorganic components pollutants or natural asheri arnon et al 2018 hence based on the above characterization classify the water into potable or contaminated this approach is different from the aforementioned state of the art approaches which do not consider the water sources we validated this method using a combination of uv absorbance datasets from laboratory experiments and an operational water supply system these methodology and datasets were used to develop and then to test the detection algorithm in a manner which considers changes that stem from both the water sources and operational and maintenance actions in a supply system 2 1 uv spectrophotometer analyzer all data for this study were acquired by two on line continuous spectroscopy analyzers real spectrum analyzer pl3000 toc uva pc model real tech the device equipped with a deuterium lamp and a 1 cm path length flow cell measures uv absorbance within a range of 0 1 5 cm 1 at 117 different wavelengths between 197 8 and 370 8 nm with a resolution of 1 4 1 6 nm reading frequency was 1 2 5 min 1 a flow rate of 300 800 ml min was required for the continuous monitoring 2 2 data the data used here comprise two main sets real measurements section 2 2 1 and synthetic data section 2 2 2 the former was created by comprehensive laboratory experiments and in situ water measurements acquired from an operational water supply system the latter was produced by using super positioning benign routine real data acquired in the operational water system and the addition due to contamination as was measured in the lab experiments asheri arnon et al 2018 fig 1 depicts the structure of all the datasets used in this study 2 2 1 real measurements datasets the real measurements data comprise two distinctive sets of uv absorbance readings one of experimental data and the other of on line measurements from a water supply system in the lab configuration the data was obtained from tap water extracted from three sources groundwater from two adjacent wells from the mountain aquifer filtered surface water from the sea of galilee lake kinneret and desalinated mediterranean seawater section a

microsiemens was tested serving as a reference of water without any substances considering these sources the contamination spiking experiments were held with water extracted from only one source i e single source the spiking experiments were conducted in either two or three steps for each of the water sources first uncontaminated water was continuously monitored in a container equipped with a recirculation system through the uv analyzer to create a baseline then while monitoring 1 mg l of an organic contaminant was added to the water at the last optional step a higher concentration of the contaminant was added to give a final concentration of 2 3 or 5 mg l these quantities of 1 2 3 or 5 mg l were chosen as for most contaminants in this study short exposure to these contaminants do not present any appreciable health risks thus detecting these chemicals at these levels would be more than sufficient to protect public health tangena et al 2012 section b of the supplementary material details the no observed adverse effect level noael or no observed effect level noel dosage the oral median lethal dose ld50 values and the pesticide group of the contaminants used the procedure was repeated for each water type with five different organic contaminants which cannot be specified due to security restrictions asheri arnon et al 2018 the mixed water experiments were conducted to simulate water mixtures which may flow in the supply distribution system these experiments were conducted in several stages at each stage we added a measured amount of a certain water source to the sample in proportions that may occur in the supply system fig 2 schematically describe the spiking and mixed water experiments and further information can be found in asheri arnon et al 2018 the on line readings were extracted from a central monitoring station of mekorot israel s national water company the uv sp mounted at this station continuously monitored unknown mixtures of drinking water from three sources surface water desalinated mediterranean sea water and groundwater the groundwater originates from several wells mostly from the coastal aquifer and a few from the mountain aquifer and constituted a minor portion of the total as compared to the surface water and the desalinated water absorbance datasets for real potable water hereafter potable water dataset were generated using

readings from the first stage of laboratory contaminant spiking experiments 2 2 2 synthetic dataset obtaining exhaustive datasets characterizing a wide variety of potable and contaminated mixed water

from source j with x mg l of contaminant c following the lab experiments described above 2 2 1 the contribution of each contaminant to the absorption spectra was obtained by deducting the background absorbance median uncontaminated water m j k 0 from the absorbance of the contaminated sample measured in the second or third stage of the spike experiments thus n j t k c x s j t k c x m j k 0 we refer to n j t k c x as net absorbance in generating these net absorbance templets priority was given to experiments conducted with distilled or desalinated water which have low background absorbance

choosing the relevant columns in the fourth stage of the algorithm is supported by the mutual coherence of gram matrix elad 2010 for an arbitrary matrix a the mutual coherence μ a is defined as the largest absolute normalized inner product between different columns of a denoting the kth column in a by ak the mutual coherence is given by 3 μ a m a x a i t a j a i 2 a j 2 s t 1 i j m i j while both methods reveal the proximity between columns they are not identical in the fitness amplification method columns that reflect contamination result with higher proximity to each other which means that the method is amplifying the differences between data of contaminated and potable water however while elad 2010 defines the mutual coherence as the maximal value of the gram matrix between two normalized columns normalization enables comparison between coherence of all inner product of columns in this work the coherence can be defined as relative the relativity is in comparing between the number of elements in each column of the a i a j t matrix of contaminated water that are bigger than a threshold and the number of elements bigger than the same threshold in the corresponding columns of the potable water matrix 2 4 4 building the classifier at the fifth stage of the algorithm the processed data of the fitness amplification method was classified as potable or contaminated water using hard margin linear svm marsland 2009 svm was applied to 15 column fitness 35 column fitness and 60 column fitness datasets we tested four datasets of at least 6000 readings of both potable and contaminated water on each svm run the datasets were randomly divided to training and testing subsets at ratios between 25 50 and 75 50 respectively each dataset was tested several times to ensure robustness the results of this stage are presented in confusion matrices hodge and pollack 1962 the criteria for good results are high rates of both true negative and true positive i e high values of the top left and bottom right cells respectively in a confusion matrix which is arranged as presented in the results 2 4 5 post processing in the sixth and final stage of the algorithm after each measurement is classified as potable or contaminated using the svm model the algorithm determines whether or not an alarm should go off to reduce false alarms a two step sequential analysis is done 1 at the measurement level a measurement t is classified as contaminated only when at least 2 of the 3 following conditions are fulfilled a at least 2 of the measurements t 2 t 1 t indicate contamination b at least 2 of the measurements t 1 t t 1 indicate contamination c at least 2 of the measurements t t 1 t 2 indicate contamination 2 at the event level an alarm will go off only when three consecutive measurements at step 1 indicate contamination hence it takes two time intervals between three consecutive measurements in this study two time intervals are equal to 5 min thus the time lag in this study is five minutes from detection to alert while the alert is delayed in this time period this scheme significantly lowers the rate of false alarms the output of the post processing stage is illustrated in fig 4 where a snippet of the algorithm s output is presented with respect to the true presence of contamination dashdotted green before dotted blue and after dashed red the post processing stage 3 results and discussion applying svm to the 15 column fitness dataset produced the results displayed in the confusion matrix hodge and pollack 1962 presented in table 2 a the dataset consists of mixed water data extracted both from the laboratory experiments and the monitoring station containing 6476 readings of both potable and simulated contaminated water dataset a applying svm to the 35 column fitness dataset and to the 60 column fitness dataset which created by the same data produced the results displayed in table 2 b and c respectively results presented are the mean values and sd received after 9 5 and 17 svm runs for the 15 35 and 60 columns respectively between the three data processing approaches the best results for all tested datasets were consistently received when svm was applied to the 60 column fitness these results justified the fourth stage of feature amplification therefore for the rest of the analysis only the 60 column fitness svm s results are presented additional three simulated sets of mixed water readings datasets b c d were examined using the 60 column fitness scheme the results are detailed in table 3 between all tested datasets of both real and simulated data best results in terms of true and false alarms were obtained by applying 60 column fitness svm to the largest dataset of 12 560 readings dataset d these results may be due to the fact that the data were acquired from water containing mostly mixtures of the basic waters used to calibrate the algorithm and hence most data were in between the three absorbance characteristics another possible explanation is the size of the dataset since a large dataset provides a large training set which better trains the svm model worst results were obtained for dataset b which could be related to the fact that the water flowing through the station while monitoring took place were not comprised of the three basic water types alone fig 5 a illustrates these results for dataset b with comparison to the readings in dataset d which mostly represent mixtures of the basic waters fig 5 b the dashed lines depict the spectra characterizing the different single water source a mixture comprised of the basic waters is a superposition i e a linear combination of the water sources spectral characterization hence all measurements must be limited by the minimal and the maximal water sources spectral characterization as more measurements fall outside this range and the larger the deviation from this range the algorithm performance is expected to degrade to verify these assumptions we created an artificial dataset section 2 2 2 as a combination of the characteristic absorbance of the three water types which contained 12 000 readings of both potable and contaminated water the results of this simulation table 5 indicate the importance of using well characterized water sources and a large dataset finally post processing which is described in 2 4 4 was applied we present here the final results of dataset a which is relatively small and dataset d which is relatively large both datasets were quite well represented by the algorithm water source characteristics between all the simulated datasets tested the largest dataset d yielded the best results with no false alarms in seven algorithm runs 107 of 109 events 98 were detected once one contaminant at 1 mg l was twice not detected and in six runs 100 of the events were detected the smallest dataset a yielded the poorest results out of five algorithm runs one resulted with four false alarms and four resulted with two false alarms each in all five runs 95 of 108 events 88 were detected all 3 mg l contaminations were detected while out of the 1 mg l contaminations that were not detected one contaminant was very dominant both datasets were quite well represented by the water source characteristics since we divided the different datasets to training and validation portions the size of the datasets also affects the training set size in real life scenarios when the algorithm is applied to a specific monitoring station the training set s size depends on the water flow regime at a station i e the time it would take for representative water sources in varying mixture ratios to flow through the sensors table 4 presents the svm results for 12 000 artificial readings the algorithm with the post processing stage was run 10 times while using different samples in the dataset for training and testing in each run in all runs no false alarms were obtained and all contaminated events were detected this supports our assumptions that good results will be obtained when 1 the measurement data represent all water sources in the supply system which used to form the algorithm the medians and mixtures of these waters and 2 when a large dataset is used to train and define the model to evaluate the contribution of the stages of data processing preceding the classification i e the fitness and amplification stages classification was done by running svm with raw data this was done with the artificial dataset since it contains no monitoring station noise using this dataset in ten svm runs yielded minimal false alarms but a poor rate of true alarms table 5 these results indicate that the algorithm processing stages are essential to the algorithm success 4 conclusions an early warning algorithm for contamination events detection in drinking water with an unknown stochastic background is presented here the uncontaminated databases comprised mostly online readings of a uv sp at a mekorot supply system this kind of database enabled us to generate and test the algorithm in a real water supply system the simulated database for the contaminated water comprised the same data only with the addition of the contaminant s absorbance delta as measured in laboratory spiking experiments the algorithm is based on a novel affinity measure which was firstly described by asheri arnon 2018 the fitness measure which combines both the pearson correlation and the euclidean distance between the tested absorbance spectrum and the characteristic absorbance of the water types flowing in the water distribution system this measure of relationship strength between two spectral measurements or other pairs of quantitative continuous or multivariate variables reflects both the physical distance and the dependence between the variables therefore this method can potentially be implemented in any anomaly detection applications the fitness results were further amplified to better differentiate between potable and contaminated water and an svm classifier was computed to classify each reading to either category at the last stage a sequence analysis is performed to determine an event in order to achieve high detection rates while maintaining a low level of false alarms the model needs to be well trained and defined using a dataset with high variability which represents all the water sources which flow in the specific monitoring station for which the algorithm is designated this can be achieved using either real measurements or artificially generating data to simulate different mixing proportions of the basic waters absorbance values and by implementing the absorbance delta values of different contaminants the algorithm has two major strengths 1 it detects contaminants at relatively low concentrations with a very low rate of false positives if any even with stochastic and highly varying water characteristics 2 it can be initialized using absorbance characteristics of the waters which flow in the specific monitoring station without the need for a learning period these pivotal advantages enable the system of a uv sp combined with the algorithm to serve as an early warning system for drinking water at any supply system with simple and fast implementation declaration of interests the

18949,sialic acids have been discovered in the extracellular polymeric substances eps of seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge ags sialic acids are a group of monosaccharides with a nine carbon backbone commonly found in mammalian cells and pathogenic bacteria and frequently described to protect eps molecules and cells from attack by proteases or glycosidases in order to further understand the role of these compounds in ags lectin staining genome analysis of the dominant bacterial species and shielding tests were done fluorescence lectin bar coding flbc analysis showed an overlap with protein staining indicating presence of sialoglycoproteins in the eps matrix genome analysis gives a positive indication for putative production of sialic acids by the dominant bacteria candidatus accumulibacter ft ir analysis shows upon selective removal of sialic acids a decrease in carbohydrates extension of the protein side chain and exposure of penultimate sugars enzymatic removal of sialic acids results in the removal of galactose residues from the eps upon subsequent treatment with β galactosidase indicating a linkage between galactose and sialic acid at the terminus of glycan chains this work indicates the importance of sialic acids in the protection of penultimate sugar residues of glycoproteins in eps and provides basis for future research in the composition of eps from biofilms and granular sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge seawater salinity eps sialic acids glycoproteins neuraminic acid 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is an upcoming technology for wastewater treatment capable of simultaneously removing organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in a single process unit de kreuk et al 2005a yilmaz et al 2008 pronk et al 2015 the sludge granules consist of bacteria embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps seviour et al 2009 lin et al 2010 besides providing a structural matrix in which cells can grow eps also serve as a protection against adverse conditions in the bulk liquid sutherland et al 2001 wang et al 2007 eps are found in all kinds of granular sludge and a multitude of properties and compositions have been described as a result of different operating conditions mcswain et al 2005 sheng et al 2010 the application of ags technology in saline wastewater treatment has been reported before figueroa et al 2008 pronk et al 2014 corsino et al 2016 saline wastewater originates from many sources such as sea water either due to intrusion in sewer networks or due to application of seawater flushing industrial wastewaters such as from fish canning industries effluent from mining and mineral processing industries lefebvre and moletta 2006 adaptation of ags to high salinity leads to a change in eps composition e g higher protein fractions have been reported corsino et al 2017 as well as an increase in hydrophobicity wang et al 2015 higher concentrations of eps have been found as a response to growth in saline conditions campo et al 2018 these studies have mainly focused on quantification of carbohydrates and proteins in the eps by using colorimetric methods it is noted that not all carbohydrates can be measured with those most commonly used methods for instance sialic acids have a low response factor for colorimetric methods such as anthrone assay and phenol sulfuric acid assay so these sugars cannot be detected and quantified by these methods masuko et al 2005 le parc et al 2014 sialic acids are a group of special carbohydrates with a nine carbon backbone the most common member is n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac which has been observed on the surface of both mammalian cells and pathogenic bacteria severi et al 2007 sialic acids play important role in the stabilization of molecules and membranes as well as in modulating interactions with the environment they can also protect molecules and cells from attack by proteases or glycosidases extending their lifetime and function varki and schauer 2009 information of sialic acids presence in the eps of aerobic granules and their function in ags is significantly important to understand their role in maintaining the stability of granular sludge since sialic acids might be overlooked due to the detection limitation of commonly used colorimetric methods more effective methods to study eps components and their specific function are required to provide greater insight into the nature of ags one of the proven effective methods for eps glycoconjugates analysis is fluorescence lectin bar coding flbc neu and kuhlicke 2017 these lectins can bind to specific carbohydrate regions allowing for screening of glycoconjugates in a hydrated biofilm matrix this method has been successfully applied for analysis of saline anaerobic granular sludge gagliano et al 2018 carbohydrates were found to be present as glycoconjugates with sugar residues including mannose and n acetyl galactosamine other studies described mannosyl glucosyl and n acetyl glucosamine residues in anaerobic granular sludge bourven et al 2015 interestingly these sugars are often in conjunction with sialic acids which is similar as commonly found glycoconjugates in the mucin matrix in animals hilkens et al 1992 bennett et al 2012 lectin staining studies for sialic acids have been described in biofilms before but a detailed study on their position and function has not yet been conducted mlouka et al 2016 in this study glycoconjugates within eps from seawater adapted ags were analysed using lectin staining methods a genome analysis was performed on the major species that were found in this sludge to screen for putative production pathways for sialic acids selective removal of sugar residues from whole granules have been performed to give insight into the function of sialic acids in granular sludge a discussion is added about the evolutionary benefit for producing sialic acids in a granular sludge system 2 materials methods 2 1 reactor operation and dominant microorganisms 2 1 1 reactor operation seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in a 2 7 l bubble column 5 6 cm diameter operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr the reactor was inoculated with nereda sludge from wwtp utrecht the netherlands treating municipal wastewater the temperature was controlled at 20 c the ph was controlled at 7 0 0 1 by dosing either 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl the dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled at 3 7 mg l o2 50 saturation the average sludge retention time srt was 20 2 days reactor cycles consisted of 60 min of anaerobic feeding 170 min aeration 5 min settling and 5 min effluent withdrawal the feed of 1 5 l per cycle consisted of 1200 ml of artificial seawater instant ocean final concentration 35 g l 150 ml of medium a and 150 ml of medium b medium a contained 57 2 mm sodium acetate trihydrate medium b contained 42 8 mm nh4cl 4 2 mm k2hpo4 2 1 mm kh2po4 and 10 ml l trace elements solution vishniac and santer 1957 the combination of these feed streams led to influent concentrations of 366 mg l cod 60 mg l nh4 n and 9 3 mg l po4 3 p electrical conductivity of the influent equaled 40 μs cm 1 samples were taken from the reactor every 30 min during aeration and filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf filter acetate and phosphate concentrations were measured by using a thermo fisher gallery discrete analyzer thermos fisher scientific waltham usa 2 1 2 dominant microorganisms visualization by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish the handling fixation and staining of fish samples was performed as described in bassin et al 2011 a mixture of pao462 pao651 and pao846 probes paomix were used for visualizing polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao crocetti et al 2000 a mixture of gaoq431 and gaoq989 probes gaomix were used for visualizing glycogen accumulating organisms gao crocetti et al 2002 a mixture of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii probes were used for staining all bacteria amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 images were taken with a zeiss axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with filter set 26 bp 575e625 ft645 bp 660e710 20 bp 546 12 ft560 bp 575e640 17 bp 485 20 ft 510 bp 5515e565 for cy5 cy3 and fluos respectively 2 2 sialic acid visualization and quantification 2 2 1 sialic acid lectin staining the granules were stained and mounted in coverwell chambers with a 1 mm spacer in order to avoid squeezing of the samples glycoconjugates of the granules were examined by means of fluorescence lectin bar coding thus all commercially available lectins fitc or alexa488 were applied as an individual probe to one granule after this glycoconjugate screening granules were stained specifically for proteins and subsequently with sialic acid specific lectins protein stain solution sypro red was directly put on top of the granules after 3 h incubation the sample was washed two times with tap water and stained with sialic acid specific lectin solution for 1 h a total of 77 lectins were used for screening of glycoconjugates bennke et al 2013 the binding sites of the lectins that gave the strongest signal are listed in table 1 then the sample was washed with tap water for three times for 3d imaging a tcs sp5x confocal laser scanning microscope leica germany was employed the upright microscope was equipped with a super continuum light source and controlled by the software las af 2 4 1 the confocal datasets were recorded by using 25x na 0 95 and 63x na 1 2 water immersion lenses excitation was at 490 nm and 550 nm emission signals were detected simultaneously or sequentially with two photomultipliers from 505 to 600 nm lectins and 600 700 nm sypro red image data sets were projected using imaris version 9 1 2 bitplane switzerland for deconvolution of the image dataset in fig 3 the program huygens version 18 4 svi the netherlands was used 2 2 2 sialic acid quantification quantification of sialic acids n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac in the seawater adapted ags was performed with a sialic acid quantitation kit sigma aldrich usa granules were physically crushed and homogenized without disrupting cells similar to sludge handling for fish fixation as described in bassin et al 2011 afterwards the crushed granules were washed with tris hcl buffer ph 7 5 and resuspended in demineralized water 15 mg volatile solids granules per 5 ml final volume the protocol was followed as described in the manual supplied with the quantitation kit for a whole cell assay 80 μl of homogenized cells were mixed with 20 μl sialidase buffer and 1 μl of α 2 3 6 8 9 neuraminidase and incubated overnight at 37 c afterwards 20 μl 0 01 m β nadh solution 1 μl of n acetylneuraminic acid aldolase and 1 μl of lactic dehydrogenase were added and incubated at 37 c for 1 h absorbance at 340 nm was measured prior and after addition of the last enzymes and used for calculation of the neu5ac concentration standards were prepared with neu5ac from the same quantitation kit 2 3 genome analysis of enzymes for sialic acid synthesis forty eight available metagenome sequences of candidatus accumulibacter enrichments were obtained from jgi img database listed in table 2 results these metagenomes were compared with protein sequences of enzymes from known sialic acid synthesis pathways obtained from the ncbi protein database the species from which the reference protein sequences were taken were a range of pathogenic bacteria neisseria meningitides campylobacter jejuni helicobacter cetorum photobacterium damselae extremophiles chitinivibrio alkaliphilus psychrobacter arcticus salinibacter ruber halanaerobium praevalens and the common fruit fly drosophila melanogaster blastp was performed using the on line blastp tool by jgi img alignment was performed according to the algorithm as described in altschul et al 1997 and schäffer et al 2001 lower e values indicate a lower uncertainty in the presence of certain sequences values lower than 5e 25 were set as threshold for positive results petit et al 2018 2 4 function of sialic acids in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge 2 4 1 galactose removal tests granules were taken directly from the lab scale seawater fed reactor and washed by placing them in distilled water for 2 h equal numbers of granules were distributed over 2 eppendorf tubes and mixed with 400 μl distilled water and 100 μl sialidase buffer to the first tube 5 μl neuraminidase enzyme was added to the second tube 5 μl distilled water was added both eppendorf tubes were incubated overnight at 37 c afterwards the supernatant from both tubes was discarded and replaced with 450 μl 1x pbs buffer ph 7 4 and 50 μl β galactosidase roche diagnostics gmbh mannheim germany and incubated overnight at 37 c subsequently the supernatant was collected from both tubes and their galactose content was measured with high performance anion exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed electrochemical detection hpaec pad 2 4 2 ft ir analysis the fourier transform infra red ft ir spectrum of granular sludge was recorded on a ft ir spectrometer perkin elmer shelton usa at room temperature with a wavenumber range from 750 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 the spectra of granules with and without neuraminidase treatment were normalized at 1630 cm 1 3 results 3 1 reactor operation and dominant microorganisms seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge was taken from a lab scale reactor performing complete removal of cod acetate and phosphate the reactor was inoculated with nereda sludge and it took 8 weeks to reach a stable state as observed from an identical cycle to cycle behavior in the online ph and off gas measurements the reactor was sampled for eps analysis after operating in stable conditions for three srts the performance of a typical reactor cycle is shown in fig 1 acetate was completely consumed anaerobically within the first 60 min of the cycle while phosphate was released up to 75 mg po4 3 p l 5 9 net p mol release this corresponds to 0 34 p mol c mol of anaerobic phosphate release per carbon uptake which is in range of values for freshwater lab scale ags and only slightly lower than reported for enriched cultures of ca accumulibacter phosphatis schuler and jenkins 2003 de kreuk et al 2005b welles et al 2015 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis was performed for analysing the relative amounts of polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao large numbers of pao were observed in the seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge while gao specific probes gave no fluorescent signal in the sludge fig 2 a distinct and uniform pao cells were distinguished and seen in clusters of cells fig 2b these results indicate dominance of pao over gao in the system 3 2 sialic acid visualization and quantification 3 2 1 sialic acid lectin staining in granular sludge microorganisms are organized as microcolonies embedded in the eps eps consists of proteins polysaccharides glycoproteins and other substances such as lipids and dna lin et al 2018 fluorescently labelled lectins have been widely used to stain extracellular glycoconjugates in various biofilm and sludge mlouka et al 2016 in the current research to visualize the glycoconjugates in granular sludge 77 different lectins were used for screening bennke et al 2013 from these lectins the lfa lectin gave the strongest signal a layer of glycoconjugates containing sialic acids on the surface of granular sludge was visualized fig 3 as lfa binds to sialic acids at the termini of the glycan chains of glycoproteins cohen et al 2012 this is an indication that sialic acids are present in the granular sludge associated to glycoproteins sialoglycoproteins to study the distribution of sialic acids inside a granule and investigate if they are associated to glycoproteins granules were sliced and double stained the granules were first stained by a protein specific fluorochrome and then with one of four different sialic acid specific binding lectins fig 4 all four lectins hma maa psl and wga gave a strong signal implying sialic acids are widely distributed in granular sludge sialic acid signals originate from both the bacterial cell surface and the extracellular matrix interestingly the locations where lectins for sialic acid stained were overlapping with areas where proteins were visualized this strongly suggests that the glycan chains containing sialic acids bond to proteins as glycoproteins this is also in line with the specificity of the lectins maa and psl sialic acids binding to those two lectins are positioned as the terminal sugar residue of glycan chains of glycoproteins in addition the fact that binding with both maa and psl lectins means the link between sialic acids and the penultimate sugar might be α 2 3 linkage and or α 2 6 linkage geisler and jarvis 2011 kadirvelraj et al 2011 this information of the linkage is important to choose enzymes for sialic acids quantification 3 2 2 sialic acid quantification the result of lectin staining showed that sialic acids are abundantly distributed in granular sludge and the linkage between sialic acids and the penultimate sugar could be an α 2 3 and or α 2 6 linkage thus neuraminidase which cleaves n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac the most widespread form of sialic acids was applied for sialic acid quantification this enzyme specifically cleaves neu5ac that is α 2 3 6 8 9 linked to the penultimate sugar in the glycan chain subsequent quantification yields an amount of 11 33 3 80 mg n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac per gram of volatile solids vs 1 1 although the presence of sialic acids has been indicated by lectin staining in biofilms mlouka et al 2016 information of their amount is hardly found in comparison the normal range for sialic acids in human serum is 0 9 1 4 weight percentage o kennedy 1988 3 3 genome analysis the successful cleavage of neu5ac raises the question which microorganisms in granular sludge could produce sialic acids from fish analysis pao are the dominant microorganisms in the granular sludge fig 2 therefore the potential of sialic acid neu5ac synthesis by pao was assessed by means of in silico genome analysis as shown in fig 5 in the metabolic pathway of neu5ac glcnac 6 phosphate is epimerized to mannac 6 phosphate by glcnac 6 p 2 epimerase the phosphate groups gets removed to form mannac and neu5ac is formed by using phosphoenolpyruvate pep catalysed by neu5ac synthetase the active form cmp neu5ac is catalysed by cmp neu5ac synthetase this form is finally added to acceptor substrates by sialyl transferase these key enzymes for neu5ac production were analysed with blastp on metagenomes of ca accumulibacter which is the dominant pao in the system since ca accumulibacter has not yet been isolated in a pure culture 48 available metagenomes were used in the analysis which increases accuracy by covering a broad range of clades very low e values 1e 100 were found for glcnac 6 p 2 epimerase and neu5ac synthetase from enzymes from all tested reference species table 2 part of the analysed ca accumulibacter metagenomes contained genes that were annotated for neu5ac synthetase from c alkaliphilus d melanogaster s ruber cmp neu5ac synthetase from c jejuni and h cetorum were also annotated in some ca accumulibacter metagenomes cmp neu5ac synthetase from both c jejuni and h cetorum gave higher e values than glcnac 6 p 2 epimerase and neu5ac synthetase but were still in good range of 1e 40 1e 50 sialyl transferase from halanaerobium praevalens gave two very low e values of 1e 100 and three e values that are around 1e 20 the sialyl transferase from p damselae gave e values at around 1e 40 1e 50 overall the enzymes from the neu5ac production pathway show low e values 1e 40 during in silico genome analysis on ca accumulibacter these results indicate that there is high probability that ca accumulibacter possesses genes that can be transcribed into enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of neu5ac 3 4 function of sialic acids in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge 3 4 1 galactose removal tests sialic acids are commonly found in chains of sugars as the terminal residue rather than directly bound to proteins schauer et al 1984 in line with the specificity of mfa lfa and psl lectins for linkage between sialic acid and galactose fig 4 the shielding effect of sialic acids to underlying galactose residues was analysed whole granules were treated first with neuraminidase and subsequently with β galactosidase to selectively cleave off sialic acids and galactose residues respectively after this procedure a galactose peak was measured by hpaec pad analysis corresponding to a total of 0 37 mg l galactose appendix a granules that were treated with only β galactosidase and still have sialic acids in the outer layer of their eps did not result in a galactose peak in the chromatogram there was a slight shift in retention time between pure galactose reference samples 7 5 min and the observed peaks in our samples 7 8 min enzyme treated samples that were spiked with galactose also showed an increased peak height at 7 8 min along with the specificity of used β galactosidase this indicates that the measured peaks indeed correspond to galactose these results imply that sialic acids in the outer layer of granular sludge are bound to galactose and can play a role in protecting galactose from enzymatic hydrolysis cleavage of sialic acids from the granules was verified by ft ir analysis fig 6 after neuraminidase treatment the sharp peak at 1730 cm 1 which is assigned to cooh groups changed to a shoulder peak also the intensity of the peak at 1000 1200 cm 1 c o c bond in carbohydrates was decreased the change of the spectrum is due to the removal of sialic acids which have cooh groups and are linked with the penultimate sugar by c o c bond bonnin et al 1999 bramhachari et al 2007 lin et al 2010 due to the fact that neuraminidase only removed part of the sialic acids the remaining part is still present as a shoulder peak at 1730 cm 1 moreover the removal of sialic acids resulted in the extension of protein side chain increase of the peak intensity at 1560 cm 1 and the exposure of the penultimate sugar ch2 from c6 sugar with the peak intensity increase at 1450 cm 1 and 1370 cm 1 which is in agreement with the masking function of sialic acids to the molecules and glycoproteins andré et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 sialoglycoproteins found in the extracellular polymeric substances in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge sialic acids are unique nine carbon sugars they play significant roles in many biological processes of animals and humans both in the state of healthy cells and tissue e g recognition ion transport differentiation and in many important diseases e g cancer autoimmune diseases traving and schauer 1998 the presence of sialic acids in biofilms has been reported however information concerning their function and binding site in biofilms is hardly found this paper provides the first evidence for the presence of sialoglycoproteins in aerobic granular sludge lectin staining of sialic acids and protein staining have significant overlapping in the locations of their respective fluorescent signal fig 2 binding with specific lectins maa hma psl and wga provides indications that sialic acids locate at the termini of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins the penultimate sugar might be galactose or n acetyl galactosamine the presence of glycoproteins in biofilms has occasionally been described such as in marine biofilms ortega morales et al 2007 and full scale anaerobic granular sludge bourven et al 2015 interestingly presence of glycoconjugates has also been found in saline lab scale anaerobic granular sludge gagliano et al 2018 the major sugar monomers reported were mannose and n acetyl galactosamine galnac which is commonly found in conjunction with sialic acids in mammalian glycans and glycolipids bennett et al 2012 dalziel et al 2014 most bacteria are not described to produce sialic acids angata and varki 2002 when present sialic acids are found mostly in capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides instead of in glycoproteins unlike the situation in animal glycoconjugates the sialic acids in these bacterial polysaccharides mostly exist as internal residues rather than terminal residues angata and varki 2002 however in the current research sialic acids are present as sialoglycoproteins similar to animals therefore the wide distribution of sialoglycoproteins over the granular structure implies not only the importance of glycoproteins but also a specific function of sialic acids 4 2 function of sialic acids functionality of sialic acids has frequently been discussed in line of pathogenic bacteria severi et al 2007 sialylation of the cell surface can modify the interaction with the host and increase resistance against normal human serum bouchet et al 2003 vimr et al 2004 in the current research sialic acids have now also been found in non pathogenic bacteria which would imply a wider range of functions sialic acids show remarkable structural diversity with the family currently comprising over 50 naturally occurring members the diversity of sialic acids is reflected by its involvement in a variety of biological functions many stemming from its unique physical and chemical properties such as charge and size the carboxylate group of sialic acid can give a net negative charge allowing for binding of calcium cations which is known to be contributing to the stability of aerobic granular sludge schauer 1985 lin et al 2013 in addition sialic acids are nine carbon sugars so they have a much bigger size than fine carbon sugars e g xylose and six carbon sugars e g glucose varki and schauer 2009 staying on the terminal position in carbohydrate chains sialic acids can mask penultimate galactose residue and shield it from recognition by β galactosidases traving and schauer 1998 it has been found that after the loss of sialic acids galactose molecules and cells can be bound or can even be taken up and degraded by naturally occurring proteases daley et al 2008 varki and schauer 2009 this phenomenon has been most extensively studied with serum glycoproteins and blood cells karacali 2017 in the current research it is observed that removal of sialic acids from the outer layer of granules results in the hydrolysis of galactose by β galactosidase while galactose was not cleaved off without removing sialic acids this not only shows that sialic acids are linked to galactose but most importantly indicates that sialic acids play an important role in maintaining the stability of the sugar chain in the eps of granules by masking penultimate galactose residues once sialic acids are removed the sugar chain is prone to degradation resulting to the instability of the sialoglycoproteins and the eps matrix in the end in comparison in mammalian tissue sialic acids are involved in the stability turnover und function of glycoproteins hanisch et al 2013 therefore the function of sialic acids in granules might resemble that in mammalian tissue 4 3 evolutionary importance of sialic acids in granular sludge resemblance between bacterial and mammalian sialic acid structures and function can also give great insight into the evolutionary benefits presence of sialic acids is usually found in pathogenic bacteria where it is proposed to make the cell walls of the pathogens resemble more the glycocalyx of its host this would make these cells less detectable for the immune system of the host schauer 1985 severi et al 2007 kajiwara et al 2010 granular sludge generally does not contain a significant fraction of pathogens winkler et al 2013 an important similarity between these types of bacterial communities is the necessity of biofilm formation for their survival granular sludge is cultivated in an environment that simulates aggregation while pathogenic bacteria depend on adhesion to their host environment for successful infection the presence of sialic acids could therefore be a result of requirement for stable adhesion and recognition not only for pathogens but also for bacterial aggregates in general production pathways of sialic acids in bacteria have been frequently studied angata and varki 2002 lewis et al 2009 a link with the granular sludge microbiome has never been made in literature the genome analysis that was performed in this study gives a positive indication for a putative production of sialic acids by ca accumulibacter in aerobic granular sludge a general evolutionary benefit for sialic acid production for adhering bacteria is proposed similarly to both ca accumulibacter in aerobic granular sludge and pathogenic bacteria the presence of sialic acids would be expected for other types of adhering bacteria as well sialic acids could be more widely present than was previously described in literature in the current research the presence of sialic acids is only studied in saline aerobic granular sludge it is interesting to examine a broad range of biofilm sample under different conditions e g flocculent sludge granular sludge biofilm on carriers under saline and non saline conditions to explore if sialic acids present in different environmental samples and what function do they involve in to this end it is possible to understand comprehensively the biological roles of sialic acids in prokaryotes 4 4 challenge of sialic acids identification and quantification in environmental samples the sialic acid family comprises more than 50 natural derivatives of neuraminic acid unsubstituted neuraminic acid does not occur in nature the amino group of neuraminic acid is substituted either by an acetyl or glycolyl residue and the hydroxyl groups may be methylated or esterfied with sulfate phosphate acetyl or lactyl groups sometimes several of these substituents are present in one sialic acid molecule sialic acids are the only natural sugars to show this great variety schauer et al 1984 in addition a number of other nonulosonic acids are described in proteobacteria among which the 5 7 diamino 3 5 7 9 tetradeoxy d glycero d galacto nonulosonic acid legionaminic acid leg and the 5 7 diamino 3 5 7 9 tetradeoxy l glycero l manno nonulosonic acid pseudaminic acid pse which show structural biosynthetic and functional similarities to sialic acids goon et al 2003 mcnally et al 2007 therefore besides natural derivatives of sialic acids the existence of bacterial sialic acids e g leg and pse contributes to the complexity of sialic acid family identification in environmental samples enzymatic sialic acid quantification method is limited by the recognition of sialidase if due to the existence of substituents in bacterial sialic acids the sialidase could not recognize the structure the result of enzymatic quantification will underestimate the amount of sialic acid in granular sludge or other biofilm systems therefore more specific analytical methods e g mass spectroscopy which could identify different sialic acid species need to be adjusted towards bacterial sialic acids shah et al 2013 5 conclusions sialic acids are discovered and widely distributed in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge both on the bacterial cell surface and the extracellular matrix sialoglycoproteins with sialic acids as the terminal sugar residue of glycoproteins are components of the extracellular matrix ca accumulibacter in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge likely contains genes that encode for enzymes that are responsible for sialic acid metabolism sialic acids that are located in the outer layer of the extracellular matrix function as a shield protecting the underlying sugar chain from

18949,sialic acids have been discovered in the extracellular polymeric substances eps of seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge ags sialic acids are a group of monosaccharides with a nine carbon backbone commonly found in mammalian cells and pathogenic bacteria and frequently described to protect eps molecules and cells from attack by proteases or glycosidases in order to further understand the role of these compounds in ags lectin staining genome analysis of the dominant bacterial species and shielding tests were done fluorescence lectin bar coding flbc analysis showed an overlap with protein staining indicating presence of sialoglycoproteins in the eps matrix genome analysis gives a positive indication for putative production of sialic acids by the dominant bacteria candidatus accumulibacter ft ir analysis shows upon selective removal of sialic acids a decrease in carbohydrates extension of the protein side chain and exposure of penultimate sugars enzymatic removal of sialic acids results in the removal of galactose residues from the eps upon subsequent treatment with β galactosidase indicating a linkage between galactose and sialic acid at the terminus of glycan chains this work indicates the importance of sialic acids in the protection of penultimate sugar residues of glycoproteins in eps and provides basis for future research in the composition of eps from biofilms and granular sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge seawater salinity eps sialic acids glycoproteins neuraminic acid 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is an upcoming technology for wastewater treatment capable of simultaneously removing organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in a single process unit de kreuk et al 2005a yilmaz et al 2008 pronk et al 2015 the sludge granules consist of bacteria embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps seviour et al 2009 lin et al 2010 besides providing a structural matrix in which cells can grow eps also serve as a protection against adverse conditions in the bulk liquid sutherland et al 2001 wang et al 2007 eps are found in all kinds of granular sludge and a multitude of properties and compositions have been described as a result of different operating conditions mcswain et al 2005 sheng et al 2010 the application of ags technology in saline wastewater treatment has been reported before figueroa et al 2008 pronk et al 2014 corsino et al 2016 saline wastewater originates from many sources such as sea water either due to intrusion in sewer networks or due to application of seawater flushing industrial wastewaters such as from fish canning industries effluent from mining and mineral processing industries lefebvre and moletta 2006 adaptation of ags to high salinity leads to a change in eps composition e g higher protein fractions have been reported corsino et al 2017 as well as an increase in hydrophobicity wang et al 2015 higher concentrations of eps have been found as a response to growth in saline conditions campo et al 2018 these studies have mainly focused on quantification of carbohydrates and proteins in the eps by using colorimetric methods it is noted that not all carbohydrates can be measured with those most commonly used methods for instance sialic acids have a low response factor for colorimetric methods such as anthrone assay and phenol sulfuric acid assay so these sugars cannot be detected and quantified by these methods masuko et al 2005 le parc et al 2014 sialic acids are a group of special carbohydrates with a nine carbon backbone the most common member is n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac which has been observed on the surface of both mammalian cells and pathogenic bacteria severi et al 2007 sialic acids play important role in the stabilization of molecules and membranes as well as in modulating interactions with the environment they can also protect molecules and cells from attack by proteases or glycosidases extending their lifetime and function varki and schauer 2009 information of sialic acids presence in the eps of aerobic granules and their function in ags is significantly important to understand their role in maintaining the stability of granular sludge since sialic acids might be overlooked due to the detection limitation of commonly used colorimetric methods more effective methods to study eps components and their specific function are required to provide greater insight into the nature of ags one of the proven effective methods for eps glycoconjugates analysis is fluorescence lectin bar coding flbc neu and kuhlicke 2017 these lectins can bind to specific carbohydrate regions allowing for screening of glycoconjugates in a hydrated biofilm matrix this method has been successfully applied for analysis of saline anaerobic granular sludge gagliano et al 2018 carbohydrates were found to be present as glycoconjugates with sugar residues including mannose and n acetyl galactosamine other studies described mannosyl glucosyl and n acetyl glucosamine residues in anaerobic granular sludge bourven et al 2015 interestingly these sugars are often in conjunction with sialic acids which is similar as commonly found glycoconjugates in the mucin matrix in animals hilkens et al 1992 bennett et al 2012 lectin staining studies for sialic acids have been described in biofilms before but a detailed study on their position and function has not yet been conducted mlouka et al 2016 in this study glycoconjugates within eps from seawater adapted ags were analysed using lectin staining methods a genome analysis was performed on the major species that were found in this sludge to screen for putative production pathways for sialic acids selective removal of sugar residues from whole granules have been performed to give insight into the function of sialic acids in granular sludge a discussion is added about the evolutionary benefit for producing sialic acids in a granular sludge system 2 materials methods 2 1 reactor operation and dominant microorganisms 2 1 1 reactor operation seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in a 2 7 l bubble column 5 6 cm diameter operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr the reactor was inoculated with nereda sludge from wwtp utrecht the netherlands treating municipal wastewater the temperature was controlled at 20 c the ph was controlled at 7 0 0 1 by dosing either 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl the dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled at 3 7 mg l o2 50 saturation the average sludge retention time srt was 20 2 days reactor cycles consisted of 60 min of anaerobic feeding 170 min aeration 5 min settling and 5 min effluent withdrawal the feed of 1 5 l per cycle consisted of 1200 ml of artificial seawater instant ocean final concentration 35 g l 150 ml of medium a and 150 ml of medium b medium a contained 57 2 mm sodium acetate trihydrate medium b contained 42 8 mm nh4cl 4 2 mm k2hpo4 2 1 mm kh2po4 and 10 ml l trace elements solution vishniac and santer 1957 the combination of these feed streams led to influent concentrations of 366 mg l cod 60 mg l nh4 n and 9 3 mg l po4 3 p electrical conductivity of the influent equaled 40 μs cm 1 samples were taken from the reactor every 30 min during aeration and filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf filter acetate and phosphate concentrations were measured by using a thermo fisher gallery discrete analyzer thermos fisher scientific waltham usa 2 1 2 dominant microorganisms visualization by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish the handling fixation and staining of fish samples was performed as described in bassin et al 2011 a mixture of pao462 pao651 and pao846 probes paomix were used for visualizing polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao crocetti et al 2000 a mixture of gaoq431 and gaoq989 probes gaomix were used for visualizing glycogen accumulating organisms gao crocetti et al 2002 a mixture of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii probes were used for staining all bacteria amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 images were taken with a zeiss axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with filter set 26 bp 575e625 ft645 bp 660e710 20 bp 546 12 ft560 bp 575e640 17 bp 485 20 ft 510 bp 5515e565 for cy5 cy3 and fluos respectively 2 2 sialic acid visualization and quantification 2 2 1 sialic acid lectin staining the granules were stained and mounted in coverwell chambers with a 1 mm spacer in order to avoid squeezing of the samples glycoconjugates of the granules were examined by means of fluorescence lectin bar coding thus all commercially available lectins fitc or alexa488 were applied as an individual probe to one granule after this glycoconjugate screening granules were stained specifically for proteins and subsequently with sialic acid specific lectins protein stain solution sypro red was directly put on top of the granules after 3 h incubation the sample was washed two times with tap water and stained with sialic acid specific lectin solution for 1 h a total of 77 lectins were used for screening of glycoconjugates bennke et al 2013 the binding sites of the lectins that gave the strongest signal are listed in table 1 then the sample was washed with tap water for three times for 3d imaging a tcs sp5x confocal laser scanning microscope leica germany was employed the upright microscope was equipped with a super continuum light source and controlled by the software las af 2 4 1 the confocal datasets were recorded by using 25x na 0 95 and 63x na 1 2 water immersion lenses excitation was at 490 nm and 550 nm emission signals were detected simultaneously or sequentially with two photomultipliers from 505 to 600 nm lectins and 600 700 nm sypro red image data sets were projected using imaris version 9 1 2 bitplane switzerland for deconvolution of the image dataset in fig 3 the program huygens version 18 4 svi the netherlands was used 2 2 2 sialic acid quantification quantification of sialic acids n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac in the seawater adapted ags was performed with a sialic acid quantitation kit sigma aldrich usa granules were physically crushed and homogenized without disrupting cells similar to sludge handling for fish fixation as described in bassin et al 2011 afterwards the crushed granules were washed with tris hcl buffer ph 7 5 and resuspended in demineralized water 15 mg volatile solids granules per 5 ml final volume the protocol was followed as described in the manual supplied with the quantitation kit for a whole cell assay 80 μl of homogenized cells were mixed with 20 μl sialidase buffer and 1 μl of α 2 3 6 8 9 neuraminidase and incubated overnight at 37 c afterwards 20 μl 0 01 m β nadh solution 1 μl of n acetylneuraminic acid aldolase and 1 μl of lactic dehydrogenase were added and incubated at 37 c for 1 h absorbance at 340 nm was measured prior and after addition of the last enzymes and used for calculation of the neu5ac concentration standards were prepared with neu5ac from the same quantitation kit 2 3 genome analysis of enzymes for sialic acid synthesis forty eight available metagenome sequences of candidatus accumulibacter enrichments were obtained from jgi img database listed in table 2 results these metagenomes were compared with protein sequences of enzymes from known sialic acid synthesis pathways obtained from the ncbi protein database the species from which the reference protein sequences were taken were a range of pathogenic bacteria neisseria meningitides campylobacter jejuni helicobacter cetorum photobacterium damselae extremophiles chitinivibrio alkaliphilus psychrobacter arcticus salinibacter ruber halanaerobium praevalens and the common fruit fly drosophila melanogaster blastp was performed using the on line blastp tool by jgi img alignment was performed according to the algorithm as described in altschul et al 1997 and schäffer et al 2001 lower e values indicate a lower uncertainty in the presence of certain sequences values lower than 5e 25 were set as threshold for positive results petit et al 2018 2 4 function of sialic acids in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge 2 4 1 galactose removal tests granules were taken directly from the lab scale seawater fed reactor and washed by placing them in distilled water for 2 h equal numbers of granules were distributed over 2 eppendorf tubes and mixed with 400 μl distilled water and 100 μl sialidase buffer to the first tube 5 μl neuraminidase enzyme was added to the second tube 5 μl distilled water was added both eppendorf tubes were incubated overnight at 37 c afterwards the supernatant from both tubes was discarded and replaced with 450 μl 1x pbs buffer ph 7 4 and 50 μl β galactosidase roche diagnostics gmbh mannheim germany and incubated overnight at 37 c subsequently the supernatant was collected from both tubes and their galactose content was measured with high performance anion exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed electrochemical detection hpaec pad 2 4 2 ft ir analysis the fourier transform infra red ft ir spectrum of granular sludge was recorded on a ft ir spectrometer perkin elmer shelton usa at room temperature with a wavenumber range from 750 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 the spectra of granules with and without neuraminidase treatment were normalized at 1630 cm 1 3 results 3 1 reactor operation and dominant microorganisms seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge was taken from a lab scale reactor performing complete removal of cod acetate and phosphate the reactor was inoculated with nereda sludge and it took 8 weeks to reach a stable state as observed from an identical cycle to cycle behavior in the online ph and off gas measurements the reactor was sampled for eps analysis after operating in stable conditions for three srts the performance of a typical reactor cycle is shown in fig 1 acetate was completely consumed anaerobically within the first 60 min of the cycle while phosphate was released up to 75 mg po4 3 p l 5 9 net p mol release this corresponds to 0 34 p mol c mol of anaerobic phosphate release per carbon uptake which is in range of values for freshwater lab scale ags and only slightly lower than reported for enriched cultures of ca accumulibacter phosphatis schuler and jenkins 2003 de kreuk et al 2005b welles et al 2015 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis was performed for analysing the relative amounts of polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao large numbers of pao were observed in the seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge while gao specific probes gave no fluorescent signal in the sludge fig 2 a distinct and uniform pao cells were distinguished and seen in clusters of cells fig 2b these results indicate dominance of pao over gao in the system 3 2 sialic acid visualization and quantification 3 2 1 sialic acid lectin staining in granular sludge microorganisms are organized as microcolonies embedded in the eps eps consists of proteins polysaccharides glycoproteins and other substances such as lipids and dna lin et al 2018 fluorescently labelled lectins have been widely used to stain extracellular glycoconjugates in various biofilm and sludge mlouka et al 2016 in the current research to visualize the glycoconjugates in granular sludge 77 different lectins were used for screening bennke et al 2013 from these lectins the lfa lectin gave the strongest signal a layer of glycoconjugates containing sialic acids on the surface of granular sludge was visualized fig 3 as lfa binds to sialic acids at the termini of the glycan chains of glycoproteins cohen et al 2012 this is an indication that sialic acids are present in the granular sludge associated to glycoproteins sialoglycoproteins to study the distribution of sialic acids inside a granule and investigate if they are associated to glycoproteins granules were sliced and double stained the granules were first stained by a protein specific fluorochrome and then with one of four different sialic acid specific binding lectins fig 4 all four lectins hma maa psl and wga gave a strong signal implying sialic acids are widely distributed in granular sludge sialic acid signals originate from both the bacterial cell surface and the extracellular matrix interestingly the locations where lectins for sialic acid stained were overlapping with areas where proteins were visualized this strongly suggests that the glycan chains containing sialic acids bond to proteins as glycoproteins this is also in line with the specificity of the lectins maa and psl sialic acids binding to those two lectins are positioned as the terminal sugar residue of glycan chains of glycoproteins in addition the fact that binding with both maa and psl lectins means the link between sialic acids and the penultimate sugar might be α 2 3 linkage and or α 2 6 linkage geisler and jarvis 2011 kadirvelraj et al 2011 this information of the linkage is important to choose enzymes for sialic acids quantification 3 2 2 sialic acid quantification the result of lectin staining showed that sialic acids are abundantly distributed in granular sludge and the linkage between sialic acids and the penultimate sugar could be an α 2 3 and or α 2 6 linkage thus neuraminidase which cleaves n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac the most widespread form of sialic acids was applied for sialic acid quantification this enzyme specifically cleaves neu5ac that is α 2 3 6 8 9 linked to the penultimate sugar in the glycan chain subsequent quantification yields an amount of 11 33 3 80 mg n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac per gram of volatile solids vs 1 1 although the presence of sialic acids has been indicated by lectin staining in biofilms mlouka et al 2016 information of their amount is hardly found in comparison the normal range for sialic acids in human serum is 0 9 1 4 weight percentage o kennedy 1988 3 3 genome analysis the successful cleavage of neu5ac raises the question which microorganisms in granular sludge could produce sialic acids from fish analysis pao are the dominant microorganisms in the granular sludge fig 2 therefore the potential of sialic acid neu5ac synthesis by pao was assessed by means of in silico genome analysis as shown in fig 5 in the metabolic pathway of neu5ac glcnac 6 phosphate is epimerized to mannac 6 phosphate by glcnac 6 p 2 epimerase the phosphate groups gets removed to form mannac and neu5ac is formed by using phosphoenolpyruvate pep catalysed by neu5ac synthetase the active form cmp neu5ac is catalysed by cmp neu5ac synthetase this form is finally added to acceptor substrates by sialyl transferase these key enzymes for neu5ac production were analysed with blastp on metagenomes of ca accumulibacter which is the dominant pao in the system since ca accumulibacter has not yet been isolated in a pure culture 48 available metagenomes were used in the analysis which increases accuracy by covering a broad range of clades very low e values 1e 100 were found for glcnac 6 p 2 epimerase and neu5ac synthetase from enzymes from all tested reference species table 2 part of the analysed ca accumulibacter metagenomes contained genes that were annotated for neu5ac synthetase from c alkaliphilus d melanogaster s ruber cmp neu5ac synthetase from c jejuni and h cetorum were also annotated in some ca accumulibacter metagenomes cmp neu5ac synthetase from both c jejuni and h cetorum gave higher e values than glcnac 6 p 2 epimerase and neu5ac synthetase but were still in good range of 1e 40 1e 50 sialyl transferase from halanaerobium praevalens gave two very low e values of 1e 100 and three e values that are around 1e 20 the sialyl transferase from p damselae gave e values at around 1e 40 1e 50 overall the enzymes from the neu5ac production pathway show low e values 1e 40 during in silico genome analysis on ca accumulibacter these results indicate that there is high probability that ca accumulibacter possesses genes that can be transcribed into enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of neu5ac 3 4 function of sialic acids in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge 3 4 1 galactose removal tests sialic acids are commonly found in chains of sugars as the terminal residue rather than directly bound to proteins schauer et al 1984 in line with the specificity of mfa lfa and psl lectins for linkage between sialic acid and galactose fig 4 the shielding effect of sialic acids to underlying galactose residues was analysed whole granules were treated first with neuraminidase and subsequently with β galactosidase to selectively cleave off sialic acids and galactose residues respectively after this procedure a galactose peak was measured by hpaec pad analysis corresponding to a total of 0 37 mg l galactose appendix a granules that were treated with only β galactosidase and still have sialic acids in the outer layer of their eps did not result in a galactose peak in the chromatogram there was a slight shift in retention time between pure galactose reference samples 7 5 min and the observed peaks in our samples 7 8 min enzyme treated samples that were spiked with galactose also showed an increased peak height at 7 8 min along with the specificity of used β galactosidase this indicates that the measured peaks indeed correspond to galactose these results imply that sialic acids in the outer layer of granular sludge are bound to galactose and can play a role in protecting galactose from enzymatic hydrolysis cleavage of sialic acids from the granules was verified by ft ir analysis fig 6 after neuraminidase treatment the sharp peak at 1730 cm 1 which is assigned to cooh groups changed to a shoulder peak also the intensity of the peak at 1000 1200 cm 1 c o c bond in carbohydrates was decreased the change of the spectrum is due to the removal of sialic acids which have cooh groups and are linked with the penultimate sugar by c o c bond bonnin et al 1999 bramhachari et al 2007 lin et al 2010 due to the fact that neuraminidase only removed part of the sialic acids the remaining part is still present as a shoulder peak at 1730 cm 1 moreover the removal of sialic acids resulted in the extension of protein side chain increase of the peak intensity at 1560 cm 1 and the exposure of the penultimate sugar ch2 from c6 sugar with the peak intensity increase at 1450 cm 1 and 1370 cm 1 which is in agreement with the masking function of sialic acids to the molecules and glycoproteins andré et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 sialoglycoproteins found in the extracellular polymeric substances in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge sialic acids are unique nine carbon sugars they play significant roles in many biological processes of animals and humans both in the state of healthy cells and tissue e g recognition ion transport differentiation and in many important diseases e g cancer autoimmune diseases traving and schauer 1998 the presence of sialic acids in biofilms has been reported however information concerning their function and binding site in biofilms is hardly found this paper provides the first evidence for the presence of sialoglycoproteins in aerobic granular sludge lectin staining of sialic acids and protein staining have significant overlapping in the locations of their respective fluorescent signal fig 2 binding with specific lectins maa hma psl and wga provides indications that sialic acids locate at the termini of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins the penultimate sugar might be galactose or n acetyl galactosamine the presence of glycoproteins in biofilms has occasionally been described such as in marine biofilms ortega morales et al 2007 and full scale anaerobic granular sludge bourven et al 2015 interestingly presence of glycoconjugates has also been found in saline lab scale anaerobic granular sludge gagliano et al 2018 the major sugar monomers reported were mannose and n acetyl galactosamine galnac which is commonly found in conjunction with sialic acids in mammalian glycans and glycolipids bennett et al 2012 dalziel et al 2014 most bacteria are not described to produce sialic acids angata and varki 2002 when present sialic acids are found mostly in capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides instead of in glycoproteins unlike the situation in animal glycoconjugates the sialic acids in these bacterial polysaccharides mostly exist as internal residues rather than terminal residues angata and varki 2002 however in the current research sialic acids are present as sialoglycoproteins similar to animals therefore the wide distribution of sialoglycoproteins over the granular structure implies not only the importance of glycoproteins but also a specific function of sialic acids 4 2 function of sialic acids functionality of sialic acids has frequently been discussed in line of pathogenic bacteria severi et al 2007 sialylation of the cell surface can modify the interaction with the host and increase resistance against normal human serum bouchet et al 2003 vimr et al 2004 in the current research sialic acids have now also been found in non pathogenic bacteria which would imply a wider range of functions sialic acids show remarkable structural diversity with the family currently comprising over 50 naturally occurring members the diversity of sialic acids is reflected by its involvement in a variety of biological functions many stemming from its unique physical and chemical properties such as charge and size the carboxylate group of sialic acid can give a net negative charge allowing for binding of calcium cations which is known to be contributing to the stability of aerobic granular sludge schauer 1985 lin et al 2013 in addition sialic acids are nine carbon sugars so they have a much bigger size than fine carbon sugars e g xylose and six carbon sugars e g glucose varki and schauer 2009 staying on the terminal position in carbohydrate chains sialic acids can mask penultimate galactose residue and shield it from recognition by β galactosidases traving and schauer 1998 it has been found that after the loss of sialic acids galactose molecules and cells can be bound or can even be taken up and degraded by naturally occurring proteases daley et al 2008 varki and schauer 2009 this phenomenon has been most extensively studied with serum glycoproteins and blood cells karacali 2017 in the current research it is observed that removal of sialic acids from the outer layer of granules results in the hydrolysis of galactose by β galactosidase while galactose was not cleaved off without removing sialic acids this not only shows that sialic acids are linked to galactose but most importantly indicates that sialic acids play an important role in maintaining the stability of the sugar chain in the eps of granules by masking penultimate galactose residues once sialic acids are removed the sugar chain is prone to degradation resulting to the instability of the sialoglycoproteins and the eps matrix in the end in comparison in mammalian tissue sialic acids are involved in the stability turnover und function of glycoproteins hanisch et al 2013 therefore the function of sialic acids in granules might resemble that in mammalian tissue 4 3 evolutionary importance of sialic acids in granular sludge resemblance between bacterial and mammalian sialic acid structures and function can also give great insight into the evolutionary benefits presence of sialic acids is usually found in pathogenic bacteria where it is proposed to make the cell walls of the pathogens resemble more the glycocalyx of its host this would make these cells less detectable for the immune system of the host schauer 1985 severi et al 2007 kajiwara et al 2010 granular sludge generally does not contain a significant fraction of pathogens winkler et al 2013 an important similarity between these types of bacterial communities is the necessity of biofilm formation for their survival granular sludge is cultivated in an environment that simulates aggregation while pathogenic bacteria depend on adhesion to their host environment for successful infection the presence of sialic acids could therefore be a result of requirement for stable adhesion and recognition not only for pathogens but also for bacterial aggregates in general production pathways of sialic acids in bacteria have been frequently studied angata and varki 2002 lewis et al 2009 a link with the granular sludge microbiome has never been made in literature the genome analysis that was performed in this study gives a positive indication for a putative production of sialic acids by ca accumulibacter in aerobic granular sludge a general evolutionary benefit for sialic acid production for adhering bacteria is proposed similarly to both ca accumulibacter in aerobic granular sludge and pathogenic bacteria the presence of sialic acids would be expected for other types of adhering bacteria as well sialic acids could be more widely present than was previously described in literature in the current research the presence of sialic acids is only studied in saline aerobic granular sludge it is interesting to examine a broad range of biofilm sample under different conditions e g flocculent sludge granular sludge biofilm on carriers under saline and non saline conditions to explore if sialic acids present in different environmental samples and what function do they involve in to this end it is possible to understand comprehensively the biological roles of sialic acids in prokaryotes 4 4 challenge of sialic acids identification and quantification in environmental samples the sialic acid family comprises more than 50 natural derivatives of neuraminic acid unsubstituted neuraminic acid does not occur in nature the amino group of neuraminic acid is substituted either by an acetyl or glycolyl residue and the hydroxyl groups may be methylated or esterfied with sulfate phosphate acetyl or lactyl groups sometimes several of these substituents are present in one sialic acid molecule sialic acids are the only natural sugars to show this great variety schauer et al 1984 in addition a number of other nonulosonic acids are described in proteobacteria among which the 5 7 diamino 3 5 7 9 tetradeoxy d glycero d galacto nonulosonic acid legionaminic acid leg and the 5 7 diamino 3 5 7 9 tetradeoxy l glycero l manno nonulosonic acid pseudaminic acid pse which show structural biosynthetic and functional similarities to sialic acids goon et al 2003 mcnally et al 2007 therefore besides natural derivatives of sialic acids the existence of bacterial sialic acids e g leg and pse contributes to the complexity of sialic acid family identification in environmental samples enzymatic sialic acid quantification method is limited by the recognition of sialidase if due to the existence of substituents in bacterial sialic acids the sialidase could not recognize the structure the result of enzymatic quantification will underestimate the amount of sialic acid in granular sludge or other biofilm systems therefore more specific analytical methods e g mass spectroscopy which could identify different sialic acid species need to be adjusted towards bacterial sialic acids shah et al 2013 5 conclusions sialic acids are discovered and widely distributed in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge both on the bacterial cell surface and the extracellular matrix sialoglycoproteins with sialic acids as the terminal sugar residue of glycoproteins are components of the extracellular matrix ca accumulibacter in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge likely contains genes that encode for enzymes that are responsible for sialic acid metabolism sialic acids that are located in the outer layer of the extracellular matrix function as a shield protecting the underlying sugar chain from
