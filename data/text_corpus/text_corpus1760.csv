nigra l is commonly known as elderberry and it is a fruit spread across europe north america asia and north africa 1 presenting about 20 species of sambucus genus and caprifoliaceae family 2 4 the fruit has dark purple colour due to its high content in polyphenols anthocyanins proanthocyanidins flavonols and phenolic acids and its growth is seasonal ripening at the end of summer 5 7 elderberry is characterized for its high commercial value as a profitable product for pharmaceutical medicine and biotechnology sectors 6 the north region of portugal presents great edaphoclimatic conditions allowing the elderberry shrub to grow and produce berries with excellent characteristics 8 portugal produces about 1500 2000 tons of fresh berries per year 9 within 400 500 ha elderberry industry generates wastewater with 25 40 of solid residues from total berry weight 8 during the industrial process and after taking out the branches and stems the elderberry is washed this part of the process generates wastewater that despite the great properties of elderberries has hazardous character caused by the presence of some compounds as cyanogenic glycosides namely sambunigrin and prunasin and m hydroxysubstituted glycosides like zeirin and holocalin which hydrolyse generating cyanide that is toxic and life threatening causing nausea throw up and diarrhoea 5 10 in consequence and due to the presence of these biorecalcitrant compounds elderberry wastewater is classified as a complex agro industrial wastewater characterized by a strong colour 11 12 therefore an inappropriate disposal can originate environmental problems 11 13 being necessary its depuration before its release 8 or reuse in this sense portuguese guidelines regulate wastewater discharge into the environment with biochemical oxygen demand bod5 below 40 mg l 1 and a chemical oxygen demand cod below 150 mg l 1 according to the decree law n 236 98 14 moreover for reusing purposes it is necessary to follow decree law n 119 2019 bod5 below 25 mg l 1 15 in summary these industrial wastewaters are a clear example of complex wastewater containing recalcitrant compounds for which conventional treatments have revealed to be insufficient 8 12 in particular elderberry wastewater could be considered as an interesting case study for the application of a preliminary treatment based on advanced oxidation processes aops as its organic content is not so high 160 210 mg doc l 1 see table 1 to this point it is important to highlight that aops usually need long treatment times and high consumption of chemicals to improve biodegradability in a close direct relation with the organic load the application of aops based on the generation of hydroxyl radicals as strong oxidants have been previously shown to be effective against specific wastewaters for reducing the organic load until legal values to allow its direct discharge into the environment 11 in addition the combination of aops with a subsequent biological treatment has been widely demonstrated to be able to considerably reduce operating costs 16 19 these oxidative species can be generated by different processes such as photo fenton 20 21 electrochemical treatments 22 24 and ozonation 25 26 already proven to be highly efficient in the remediation of a wide variety of complex wastewaters several authors have reported the efficiency of photo fenton treatment in wastewaters containing contaminants such as pharmaceuticals 27 28 dyes 29 30 pesticides 31 32 and phenols 33 34 in the inactivation of microorganisms 35 36 and in the remediation of agro industrial wastewaters 37 39 electrooxidative processes have been also studied for the treatment of industrial wastewater since they are able to generate large amounts of different oxidants according to the ions dissolved in the target water 40 these oxidants are mainly hclo e 0 1 49 v clo e 0 0 89 v 41 so4 so4 2 e 0 2 5 3 1 v 42 and oh e 0 2 8 v which combined effect can remove recalcitrant organic compounds effectively additionally electrooxidative systems are reasonably easy to handle and to automate and can be operated at room temperature and pressure 24 specifically boron doped diamond bdd anodes are used due to its physical chemical properties being able to generate oh that remain physisorbed on the electrode surface reaction 1 its combination with a carbon based cathode has been studied during the last few years as a promising improvement of the electrochemical process since the cathode is able to generate h2o2 e 0 0 69 v reaction 2 only by adding iron it results in the fenton reaction knowing this process as electro fenton ef the simultaneous generation of oxidative species hclo clo so4 so4 2 and oh on the anode and the oh from the ef confers a highly oxidative power to the system during the ef process fe3 previously oxidised is regenerated on the cathode surface reaction 3 23 but in a very slow ratio to enhance this ratio a light source could be applied turning it into the photoelectro fenton pef process r1 bdd h2o bdd oh h e r2 o2 g 2h 2 e h2o2 r3 fe3 e fe2 previous works checked the effectiveness of this process in the degradation of specific compounds in complex water matrices 43 46 but most of them working with low volumes 41 45 47 actually martínez huitle and pannizza 2018 highlighted the importance of scaling up research carried out at lab scale to pilot plants and even to treatment stations 48 it must be also taken into account that the combination of electrooxidative processes with solar light promotes the photolysis of electrogenerated chlorine species into chlorine radicals cl with higher oxidation potential than its precursors e 0 2 4 v in turn cl reacts with o producing oh 49 which results in an increase of the oxidizing power of the process 50 on the other hand ozonation processes have extensively proven their efficiency all over the years in disinfection oxidizing organic compounds and reducing colour and taste 51 indeed ozone is prone to oxidize electron rich compounds that exhibit aromatic alcohols and a double bond between two carbons 52 ozonation is ph dependant at acidic ph ozone reacts directly but the presence of radical scavengers prevents the o3 decomposition at alkaline ph ph 8 indirect reactions are favoured in which hydroxyl radicals are formed and are more likely to react quicker but the reactions are less selective 53 reaction 4 comprises the overall reactions 54 r4 3o3 oh h 2 oh 4o2 it is important to remark that high concentrations of salts and carbonates in the target matrix can behave as radical scavengers for o3 and oh reducing the treatment efficiency 55 another pathway to generate oh is through the addition of h2o2 despite o3 is able to react with h2o2 k 10 2 m 1s 1 reaction 5 the reaction with its anion ho2 known as peroxone process reactions 6 and 7 is much faster k 106 m 1s 1 this process is also ph dependent being faster at higher ph e g at ph 6 k 8 72 m 1 s 1 and at ph 8 k 872 m 1 s 1 54 56 r5 2 o3 h2o2 2 oh 3 o2 r6 h2o2 ho2 h r7 ho2 o3 ho2 o3 ozonation has been implemented in a huge variety of water and wastewater treatments 26 containing pharmaceuticals 57 58 microcontaminants 59 60 cork boiling wastewater 61 62 as well as pre treatment step 52 63 to the best of our knowledge there is lack of investigation concerning the treatment of elderberry wastewater as this specific wastewater problem has been only addressed by applying fenton 11 and ozonation 12 processes but in both cases at lab scale with 300 and 500 ml of working volumes respectively the present investigation compares the pre treatment of a real elderberry wastewater by solar photo fenton solar photo electrooxidation and ozonation processes at pilot plant scale for the first time the main objective is the definition and evaluation of a complete experimental procedure to assess and select the most suitable process in a technology readiness level of 5 6 to enhance complex wastewater biodegradability for the subsequent application of a lower cost biological treatment to this aim different operating conditions were evaluated to lessen associated costs and so giving added value to a sustainable reduction of industry water footprint 2 materials and methods 2 1 elderberry wastewater characterization elderberry wastewater comes from the first step of elderberries washing with the objective of performing the present study as close as possible to actual conditions elderberry wastewater was simulated by placing 1 g of lyophilized fruit in contact with tap water for 48 h following industrial procedure wastewater characterization results are shown in table 1 2 2 analytical determinations cod was monitored by using cod cell test spectroquant of merck and dissolved organic carbon doc was determined with a shimadzu toc vcsn analyser ions content was monitored by ionic chromatography model 850 metrohm switzerland all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon filter from asimio prior to these analyses turbidity was measured in a hach 2100 n turbidimeter and conductivity with a conductimeter crison glp31 ph was adjusted with sodium hydroxide naoh or sulfuric acid h2so4 from j t baker being monitored with a crison 25 ph meter iron and h2o2 were determined following iso 6332 λ 510 nm and din 38409 h15 λ 410 nm from standard methods respectively using a unicam uv vis uv2 spectrophotometer surcis bm advanced respirometer was used for toxicity and biodegradability analysis both are based on the oxygen uptake response shown by activated sludge coming from an urban wastewater treatment plant after its direct contact with the elderberry wastewater for toxicity analysis 1 l of activated sludge was fed with sodium acetate j t baker 0 5 g per gram of volatile solids as highly biodegradable substrate when oxygen uptake rate our reached its maximum value and became stable 30 ml of wastewater was added the decrease in the maximum our value shows inhibition of the activated sludge biodegradability measurements were based in a comparison between obtained biodegradable chemical oxygen demand codb and total cod of the sample for this analysis 2 3 ml of 8 6 mm n allylthiourea sigma aldrich 98 purity solution per gram of volatile solids was added to 900 ml of activated sludge in order to inhibit nitrification processes and also to avoid aside consumption of oxygen after 30 min 100 ml of elderberry wastewater was put in contact with activated sludge and the equipment monitored the evolution of dissolved oxygen and our along the assay giving at the end the codb value according to what it is reported in the respirometer protocol when the codb cod ratio is higher than 0 2 the sample is considered biodegradable 2 3 experimental set up and procedure all experiments were carried out at the plataforma solar de almería psa located in the south east of spain 37 84 n and 2 34 w from mid of may until mid of august solar experiments were performed in sunny days temperature 25 35 c and ph were controlled during all experiments and solar radiation was monitored as described in section 2 4 2 3 1 solar photo fenton process solar photo fenton experiments were carried out in two different reactors at laboratory and pilot plant scale first in an atlas suntest xls benchtop xenon tester system fig 1 a equipped with a xenon arc lamp nxe 2201 2500 w and uv glass filter suprax that inhibits wavelengths below 290 nm irradiation was fixed in 34 w m 2 and temperature maintained at 30 35 c working volume was 2 l under continuous agitation wastewater ph was adjusted to 3 with concentrated h2so4 and feso4 7h2o from panreac was added in the desirable concentrations of 20 or 50 mg l 1 of fe2 solution was homogenised during 15 min and time zero was established when h2o2 was added 100 mg l 1 or 500 mg l 1 and solar light simulator turned on h2o2 was continuously added along the test trying to maintain a constant concentration between 50 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 depending on the experiment residual h2o2 in samples was rapidly removed with sodium bisulphite for performing doc cod analysis and ionic chromatography but with catalase for toxicity and biodegradability measurements in both procedures in a dosage that reacted stoichiometrically with residual h2o2 concentration solar photo fenton tests at pilot plant scale were carried out in a compound parabolic collector cpc photo reactor fig 1b with 65 l of total volume and 23 l of irradiated volume cpc photoreactor is composed of 10 borosilicate glass tubes 150 cm length and 4 5 cm of inner diameter placed on an aluminium frame tilted at 37 psa 37 n 2 4 w in which the flow rate was placed at 2000 l h 1 pan world 0 75 kw experiments carried out in this plant followed the same procedure as described in the solar light simulator but the experiment started when cpc reactor was uncovered along with the addition of h2o2 100 mg l 1 and additions to maintained 50 mg l 1 2 3 2 electrooxidation pilot plant electrooxidation experiments were performed using a pilot plant fig 2 deeply described elsewhere 22 and operated with one cell working volume was 30 l with a current density of 150 ma cm 2 being the maximum applicable for this water in order to keep the voltage below 25 v as recommended by the manufacturer the air flow was set at 10 l h 1 and the water flow at 300 l h 1 when using the electrooxidative plant coupled to the cpc fig 1b the working volume was 75 l and the cpc flow rate was placed at 1500 l h 1 the remain operating parameters were maintained in the same values experimental procedure was initially adjusting ph to 3 addition of 20 mg l 1 of fe2 and let it homogenising during 15 min it is important to highlight that in this case h2o2 was electrogenerated on site and so no external addition of h2o2 was normally required time zero was considered when the power supply was turned on different electrochemical tests were developed anodic oxidation ao by using an electrochemical cell without the carbon cathode ph was adjusted to 3 without addition of iron or ao combined with solar radiation solar assisted ao when using the carbon ptfe cathode and iron addition electro fenton ef experiments were conducted in ef two different approaches were done one was performed with iron and only with electrogenerated h2o2 and the other with an initial additional concentration of 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 which was maintained at 10 mg l 1 by frequent analyses and additions of h2o2 along the experiment the intention was to check if the low content of h2o2 at the beginning of the process with only electrogenerated h2o2 could be limiting the oxidation process electrocell with carbon ptfe cathode was also combined with the cpc photo reactor which is known as solar photoelectro fenton spef process time zero was considered when connecting the power supply and uncovering the cpc photo reactor 2 3 3 ozonation system ozonation pilot plant fig 3 was operated in batch mode anseros pap pilot plant anseros klaus nonnenmacher gmbh germany the system consists of an ozone generator anseros com ad02 and destroyer thermic and catalytic two non dispersive o3 analysers in gas phase bmt 964 a flow meter for inlet air regulation and an oxygen generator anseros sep100 experiments were carried out with 13 l of total volume and 1 5 g o3 l 1 20 production at 60 l h 1 of air flow two different phs were tested natural ph and 11 ph 11 was evaluated with and without the addition of an initial concentration of 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 in the experiment with h2o2 time zero was considered when h2o2 addition occurred and the o3 generator was turned on residual o3 in samples was eliminated by bubbling nitrogen o3 consumption g l 1 was measured according to equation 1 reported by miralles cuevas et al 2014 64 1 o 3 c o n s n o 3 c o n s n 1 q a c o 3 i n c o 3 o n t n t n 1 v t o 3cons is

experimental results are given and compared by using accumulated uv energy per unit of treated volume q uv kj l 1 parameter which is calculated by the following equation equation 2 65 2 q u v n q u v

l 3 results and discussion 3 1 elderberry wastewater treatment by solar photo fenton process initially solar photo fenton experiments were performed at laboratory scale in a solar light simulator with the main objective of adjusting as much as possible operating conditions before scaling up the treatment two different concentrations of iron and h2o2 were tested along 240 min of total radiation exposure one with 20 mg l 1 of fe2 and initial h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l 1 trying to maintain a concentration of 50 mg l 1 of h2o2 during the whole experiment and a second one with 50 mg l 1 of fe2 and initial h2o2 concentration of 500 mg l 1 maintaining h2o2 at 200 mg l 1 throughout the experiment in fig 4 it can be clearly observed that the increase in the concentrations of iron and initial h2o2 led to a higher doc removal more than 95 whilst with the lowest dosage only 37 was attained entailing a h2o2 consumption of 950 mg l 1 and 397 mg l 1 respectively it means that h2o2 consumption was proportional to doc removal and therefore it would be possible to attain a very important mineralization with these experiments it was demonstrated the high efficiency of solar photo fenton process for the remediation of this specific complex wastewater so a scaling up step must be considered in consequence solar photo fenton experiments were carried out in the cpc photo reactor at the optimal iron concentration of 20 mg l 1 of fe2 for this type of collectors with 4 5 cm of inner tubes diameter 66 though better efficiency was observed at 50 mg l 1 of fe2 in the solar light simulator experiments it is important to highlight that optimal iron concentration depends basically on optical pathlength and so on photoreactor design therefore it must be stressed that experiments at laboratory scale were performed to demonstrate the viability of the process but not to decide the main basic photo fenton operation parameters in the cpc regarding h2o2 concentration small additions of 100 mg l 1 were made in order to slow down the initial reaction rate allowing measuring biodegradability along the initial steps of the solar photo fenton process fig 4 this experiment led to 90 of mineralization after 120 min a significant increase in biodegradability was observed just after 30 min of treatment codb cod 0 26 only 10 of mineralization with only 78 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 consumption and a q uv of 1 7 kj l 1 in addition higher initial dosage of h2o2 500 mg l 1 was also tested in the cpc data not shown observing stronger oxidant properties and so attaining almost 25 of mineralization after only 10 min of solar photo fenton process therefore it can be clearly stated that higher reagents dosages reached stronger oxidant properties which allowed faster and efficient doc removal but the identification or even the detection of the specific moment in which the combination with a biological system could be feasible lowering the treatment costs must be carefully studied these results highlight the importance of reaching a correct fe2 h2o2 ratio otherwise the excessive reagents dose and treatment time will go directly to an important mineralization and so operating costs will unnecessarily increase confirming this hypothesis and the improvement when combining with solar energy amaral silva and collaborators 2016 treated an elderberry wastewater by fenton process with the focus to apply a biological system afterwards under the best operating conditions at lab scale 300 ml of total volume much higher concentrations of fe2 and h2o2 were used 1100 mg l 1 and 5500 mg l 1 respectively removing 78 of cod and improving biodegradability to 0 3 initial biodegradability 0 05 after 4 h of treatment 11 3 2 elderberry wastewater treatment by electrooxidation electrooxidation experiments were divided into two types those in which both anode and cathode were used ef and spef and those in which only oxidation in the anode was tested without on site production of h2o2 ao and solar assisted ao as mentioned in section 2 3 2 different working volumes must be considered depending on the combination or not with the cpc photo reactor when combining with solar radiation solar assisted ao and spef the working volume was 75 l being 30 l in the other cases ef and ao this point is extremely important because the cathode area 0 010 m2 is constant and independent of the working volume and so the same amount of h2o2 would be generated by the cathode in both cases at the defined operating conditions of ph 3 150 ma cm 2 air flow of 10 l h 1 and a water flow of 300 l h 1 using a clean water with similar salinity the electrogeneration of h2o2 reached 5 9 mg min 1 in 15 min therefore electrogenerated h2o2 concentration will be dependent of the volume of wastewater to be treated in consequence it must be taken into account that spef process 75 l would be limited by the lower concentration of h2o2 in comparison to the ef process 30 l it is also important to highlight that the measurement of ions detected a clear presence of sulphate 500 700 mg l 1 coming from wastewater composition but mainly due to the ph correction with h2so4 and chloride 150 170 mg l 1 which is a key factor to be considered in electrooxidation systems they are precursors of different oxidation species apart from oh such as so4 hclo clo and cl fig 5 shows a direct comparison between the results obtained in all the electrooxidation experiments carried out at pilot plant scale the processes that had better doc removals 20 though still very low were ef process 20 mg l 1 of fe2 and only electrogenerated h2o2 and spef 20 mg l 1 of fe2 nevertheless it is important to highlight that biodegradability was improved in all experiments with spef 20 mg l 1 of fe2 biodegradability codb cod 0 30 was attained just after 20 min of treatment followed by ef with the addition of 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 and 20 mg l 1 of fe2 reaching the same biodegradability in 30 min in contrast with ef 20 mg l 1 of fe2 but using only electrogenerated h2o2 wastewater became biodegradable after 120 min codb cod 0 21 showing the limitation in the reaction caused by the low concentration of h2o2 at the beginning of the treatment in both ao experiments in the dark and solar assisted biodegradability was reached within 60 min codb cod 0 22 and 0 24 respectively regarding the electric consumption corresponding to the point in which biodegradability was improved enough it showed the following trend lowest to the highest consumption spef 0 109 kw h m 3 solar assisted ao 0 272 kw h m 3 ef with extra addition of 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 0 356 kw h m 3 dark ao 0 692 kw h m 3 ef 1 68 kw h m 3 solar assisted ao had a lower electric consumption in comparison with ef by adding 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 however the experiment took 30 min more solar assisted ao needed more time and accumulated uv energy to increase biodegradability than spef 2 8 kj l 1 compared to 1 1 kj l 1 it is expected that under the same operation conditions higher treatment times imply higher electric consumption in fact solar assisted ao seems to be a good alternative despite being necessary 60 min to attain high biodegradability because it is free of added chemicals the carbon ptfe cathode would not be required and part of the energy requirement would come from solar energy even ao in dark is able to consume less energy than the ef process yet in terms of mass in spef the amount of doc removal was much higher than ef even with lower h2o2 concentration as the total volume was higher thus the combination with solar radiation may be crucial to overcome the drawback imposed by the higher volume of wastewater to be treated in general the use of solar radiation allowing fenton reaction to continue did not drastically enhance doc removal but biodegradability was attained quicker with spef potentially reducing the global treatment costs 3 3 elderberry wastewater treatment by ozonation ozonation experiments see fig 6 were able to degrade 10 of doc after 120 min having a better efficiency when applied at ph 11 and initial addition of 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 20 of doc removal after 240 min of treatment though the production of oh would be expected to increase due to the addition of h2o2 the quick reaction of o3 with ho2 reactions 6 and 7 would also provoke an extra consumption of o3 56 additionally ozonation disrupted all the chromophores groups since in all experiments the final wastewater was colourless at higher ph the colour removal was faster biodegradability assays were carried out as soon as at least 5 of mineralization was attained taking into account previous positive biodegradability results obtained in solar photo fenton and spef processes after reaching between 6 and 10 of doc reduction no biodegradability improvement was shown with ozonation at natural ph whereas at ph 11 and at ph 11 with 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 biodegradability was reached in 120 min codb cod 0 39 and 6 of mineralization and 240 min codb cod 0 28 and 20 of mineralization respectively it was clear that the addition of h2o2 did not gave any enhancement to the oxidation system as the double of time was necessary to attain enough biocompatibility to face a subsequent biological treatment after 180 min codb cod was only 0 14 it is important to highlight that after 120 min of ozonation at ph 11 with h2o2 only 2 of mineralization was attained so biodegradability was not measured these results are in line with those reported by martins et al 2012 at laboratory scale who investigated ozonation treatment with 1 l of elderberry wastewater working with several o3 flows 17 5 g o3 n 1 m 3 40 g o3 n 1 m 3 and 57 8 g o3 n 1 m 3 in all cases tested doc content decreased however after 120 min of ozonation biodegradability results decreased at natural ph 6 6 and at ph 5 it was only possible to increase biodegradability when working at alkaline ph ph 10 12 regarding o3 consumption the increase in the ph led to higher consumption values 164 mg l 1 at natural ph 192 mg l 1 at ph 11 and 371 mg l 1 at ph 11 with 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 in agreement with the former statement about the quick reaction of o3 with ho2 reactions 6 and 7 in the presence of h2o2 3 4 preliminary economic analysis prior to make the economic analysis the experimental data in each oxidation treatment was evaluated and the experiments in which biodegradability was improved sooner were selected fig 7 shows biodegradability results under the best operating conditions table 2 shows a brief economic assessment based on the operation costs according to the experimental results obtained in this work taking into consideration reagents and electric consumption obtained from each oxidation process studied the investments costs related to infrastructure construction and equipment acquisition has not been tackled in this study as scaling up and optimization considerations must be taken into account for specific cases costs were estimated based on the treatment of 40 m3 of elderberry wastewater per day according to the production of elderberry industries located in the varosa region north of portugal in 2018 and 2019 harvest and considering a working period of 91 days per year 3640 m3 year 1 and a 15 years equipment lifetime reagents costs assumed were 0 45 l 1 for h2o2 solution 33 w v 0 72 kg 1 for feso4 7h2o 0 10 l 1 for h2so4 98 w v and 0 12 kg 1 for naoh 67 68 electricity costs have been considered as 0 08 kw h 1 69 regarding ozonation system according to the manufacturer electric consumption was 7 5 kw h kg 1 for o3 generation and 18 kw h kg 1 for oxygen concentration o3 generation percentage was fixed in 20 equivalent to a flow of 1 5 g o3 h 1 enough to degrade organic matter 70 consequently the obtained electric consumption for this process was 5 88 kw h m 3 in solar photo fenton process the major contributors to the electric consumption are the centrifugal and dosing pumps that allow wastewater to be recirculated into the system and h2o2 to be added respectively in the electrooxidation processes the electric consumptions were registered on site electrical power and voltage during the treatments regarding reagents in all cases it was considered ph adjustment prior and after the wastewater treatment acidic or basic ph for photo fenton and ozonation respectively and h2o2 dose it is important to highlight that all calculations considered costs until the wastewater turned biodegradable overall ozonation process stands out as the most expensive in terms of electrical costs 0 47 m 3 while the rest of tested oxidation treatments show similar operation costs solar photo fenton process had the highest reagents consumption but similar costs with spef and solar assisted ao when compared in terms of electricity however the electrical costs obtained for the solar assisted ao are majorly due to the extra reaction time necessary to reach biodegradability 60 min whereas the spef took only 20 min in ozonation process 120 min were needed to turn the wastewater biodegradable and additionally electric power is required to produce o3 therefore ozonation presented the highest electric consumption 4 conclusions this research addresses the treatment of a non biodegradable industrial wastewater with the singularity of having a low organic charge but with high biorecalcitrant character different feasible and efficient technological alternatives are shown and compared by means of a preliminary economical assessment to find out the lower cost process in terms of operation solar photo fenton ao solar assisted ao ef and spef processes were successfully tested to improve actual elderberry wastewater biodegradability showing a range of operation costs between 0 11 and 0 22 m 3 overall ozonation presents lower efficiency for reaching biodegradability standing out as the most expensive one 0 51 m 3 solar mediated processes were beneficial to attain biodegradability in shorter treatment times spef process was the fastest to attain biodegradability 20 min and it showed the lower associated operation costs 0 11 m 3 nonetheless it must not be discarded the fact that solar assisted ao did not require any h2o2 or fe2 addition and only showed 0 12 m 3 of operation costs depending on the specific characteristics of the industrial site the implementation of one of those studied alternatives would require additional and more detailed cost calculations as well as a life cycle assessment before taking the final

nigra l is commonly known as elderberry and it is a fruit spread across europe north america asia and north africa 1 presenting about 20 species of sambucus genus and caprifoliaceae family 2 4 the fruit has dark purple colour due to its high content in polyphenols anthocyanins proanthocyanidins flavonols and phenolic acids and its growth is seasonal ripening at the end of summer 5 7 elderberry is characterized for its high commercial value as a profitable product for pharmaceutical medicine and biotechnology sectors 6 the north region of portugal presents great edaphoclimatic conditions allowing the elderberry shrub to grow and produce berries with excellent characteristics 8 portugal produces about 1500 2000 tons of fresh berries per year 9 within 400 500 ha elderberry industry generates wastewater with 25 40 of solid residues from total berry weight 8 during the industrial process and after taking out the branches and stems the elderberry is washed this part of the process generates wastewater that despite the great properties of elderberries has hazardous character caused by the presence of some compounds as cyanogenic glycosides namely sambunigrin and prunasin and m hydroxysubstituted glycosides like zeirin and holocalin which hydrolyse generating cyanide that is toxic and life threatening causing nausea throw up and diarrhoea 5 10 in consequence and due to the presence of these biorecalcitrant compounds elderberry wastewater is classified as a complex agro industrial wastewater characterized by a strong colour 11 12 therefore an inappropriate disposal can originate environmental problems 11 13 being necessary its depuration before its release 8 or reuse in this sense portuguese guidelines regulate wastewater discharge into the environment with biochemical oxygen demand bod5 below 40 mg l 1 and a chemical oxygen demand cod below 150 mg l 1 according to the decree law n 236 98 14 moreover for reusing purposes it is necessary to follow decree law n 119 2019 bod5 below 25 mg l 1 15 in summary these industrial wastewaters are a clear example of complex wastewater containing recalcitrant compounds for which conventional treatments have revealed to be insufficient 8 12 in particular elderberry wastewater could be considered as an interesting case study for the application of a preliminary treatment based on advanced oxidation processes aops as its organic content is not so high 160 210 mg doc l 1 see table 1 to this point it is important to highlight that aops usually need long treatment times and high consumption of chemicals to improve biodegradability in a close direct relation with the organic load the application of aops based on the generation of hydroxyl radicals as strong oxidants have been previously shown to be effective against specific wastewaters for reducing the organic load until legal values to allow its direct discharge into the environment 11 in addition the combination of aops with a subsequent biological treatment has been widely demonstrated to be able to considerably reduce operating costs 16 19 these oxidative species can be generated by different processes such as photo fenton 20 21 electrochemical treatments 22 24 and ozonation 25 26 already proven to be highly efficient in the remediation of a wide variety of complex wastewaters several authors have reported the efficiency of photo fenton treatment in wastewaters containing contaminants such as pharmaceuticals 27 28 dyes 29 30 pesticides 31 32 and phenols 33 34 in the inactivation of microorganisms 35 36 and in the remediation of agro industrial wastewaters 37 39 electrooxidative processes have been also studied for the treatment of industrial wastewater since they are able to generate large amounts of different oxidants according to the ions dissolved in the target water 40 these oxidants are mainly hclo e 0 1 49 v clo e 0 0 89 v 41 so4 so4 2 e 0 2 5 3 1 v 42 and oh e 0 2 8 v which combined effect can remove recalcitrant organic compounds effectively additionally electrooxidative systems are reasonably easy to handle and to automate and can be operated at room temperature and pressure 24 specifically boron doped diamond bdd anodes are used due to its physical chemical properties being able to generate oh that remain physisorbed on the electrode surface reaction 1 its combination with a carbon based cathode has been studied during the last few years as a promising improvement of the electrochemical process since the cathode is able to generate h2o2 e 0 0 69 v reaction 2 only by adding iron it results in the fenton reaction knowing this process as electro fenton ef the simultaneous generation of oxidative species hclo clo so4 so4 2 and oh on the anode and the oh from the ef confers a highly oxidative power to the system during the ef process fe3 previously oxidised is regenerated on the cathode surface reaction 3 23 but in a very slow ratio to enhance this ratio a light source could be applied turning it into the photoelectro fenton pef process r1 bdd h2o bdd oh h e r2 o2 g 2h 2 e h2o2 r3 fe3 e fe2 previous works checked the effectiveness of this process in the degradation of specific compounds in complex water matrices 43 46 but most of them working with low volumes 41 45 47 actually martínez huitle and pannizza 2018 highlighted the importance of scaling up research carried out at lab scale to pilot plants and even to treatment stations 48 it must be also taken into account that the combination of electrooxidative processes with solar light promotes the photolysis of electrogenerated chlorine species into chlorine radicals cl with higher oxidation potential than its precursors e 0 2 4 v in turn cl reacts with o producing oh 49 which results in an increase of the oxidizing power of the process 50 on the other hand ozonation processes have extensively proven their efficiency all over the years in disinfection oxidizing organic compounds and reducing colour and taste 51 indeed ozone is prone to oxidize electron rich compounds that exhibit aromatic alcohols and a double bond between two carbons 52 ozonation is ph dependant at acidic ph ozone reacts directly but the presence of radical scavengers prevents the o3 decomposition at alkaline ph ph 8 indirect reactions are favoured in which hydroxyl radicals are formed and are more likely to react quicker but the reactions are less selective 53 reaction 4 comprises the overall reactions 54 r4 3o3 oh h 2 oh 4o2 it is important to remark that high concentrations of salts and carbonates in the target matrix can behave as radical scavengers for o3 and oh reducing the treatment efficiency 55 another pathway to generate oh is through the addition of h2o2 despite o3 is able to react with h2o2 k 10 2 m 1s 1 reaction 5 the reaction with its anion ho2 known as peroxone process reactions 6 and 7 is much faster k 106 m 1s 1 this process is also ph dependent being faster at higher ph e g at ph 6 k 8 72 m 1 s 1 and at ph 8 k 872 m 1 s 1 54 56 r5 2 o3 h2o2 2 oh 3 o2 r6 h2o2 ho2 h r7 ho2 o3 ho2 o3 ozonation has been implemented in a huge variety of water and wastewater treatments 26 containing pharmaceuticals 57 58 microcontaminants 59 60 cork boiling wastewater 61 62 as well as pre treatment step 52 63 to the best of our knowledge there is lack of investigation concerning the treatment of elderberry wastewater as this specific wastewater problem has been only addressed by applying fenton 11 and ozonation 12 processes but in both cases at lab scale with 300 and 500 ml of working volumes respectively the present investigation compares the pre treatment of a real elderberry wastewater by solar photo fenton solar photo electrooxidation and ozonation processes at pilot plant scale for the first time the main objective is the definition and evaluation of a complete experimental procedure to assess and select the most suitable process in a technology readiness level of 5 6 to enhance complex wastewater biodegradability for the subsequent application of a lower cost biological treatment to this aim different operating conditions were evaluated to lessen associated costs and so giving added value to a sustainable reduction of industry water footprint 2 materials and methods 2 1 elderberry wastewater characterization elderberry wastewater comes from the first step of elderberries washing with the objective of performing the present study as close as possible to actual conditions elderberry wastewater was simulated by placing 1 g of lyophilized fruit in contact with tap water for 48 h following industrial procedure wastewater characterization results are shown in table 1 2 2 analytical determinations cod was monitored by using cod cell test spectroquant of merck and dissolved organic carbon doc was determined with a shimadzu toc vcsn analyser ions content was monitored by ionic chromatography model 850 metrohm switzerland all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon filter from asimio prior to these analyses turbidity was measured in a hach 2100 n turbidimeter and conductivity with a conductimeter crison glp31 ph was adjusted with sodium hydroxide naoh or sulfuric acid h2so4 from j t baker being monitored with a crison 25 ph meter iron and h2o2 were determined following iso 6332 λ 510 nm and din 38409 h15 λ 410 nm from standard methods respectively using a unicam uv vis uv2 spectrophotometer surcis bm advanced respirometer was used for toxicity and biodegradability analysis both are based on the oxygen uptake response shown by activated sludge coming from an urban wastewater treatment plant after its direct contact with the elderberry wastewater for toxicity analysis 1 l of activated sludge was fed with sodium acetate j t baker 0 5 g per gram of volatile solids as highly biodegradable substrate when oxygen uptake rate our reached its maximum value and became stable 30 ml of wastewater was added the decrease in the maximum our value shows inhibition of the activated sludge biodegradability measurements were based in a comparison between obtained biodegradable chemical oxygen demand codb and total cod of the sample for this analysis 2 3 ml of 8 6 mm n allylthiourea sigma aldrich 98 purity solution per gram of volatile solids was added to 900 ml of activated sludge in order to inhibit nitrification processes and also to avoid aside consumption of oxygen after 30 min 100 ml of elderberry wastewater was put in contact with activated sludge and the equipment monitored the evolution of dissolved oxygen and our along the assay giving at the end the codb value according to what it is reported in the respirometer protocol when the codb cod ratio is higher than 0 2 the sample is considered biodegradable 2 3 experimental set up and procedure all experiments were carried out at the plataforma solar de almería psa located in the south east of spain 37 84 n and 2 34 w from mid of may until mid of august solar experiments were performed in sunny days temperature 25 35 c and ph were controlled during all experiments and solar radiation was monitored as described in section 2 4 2 3 1 solar photo fenton process solar photo fenton experiments were carried out in two different reactors at laboratory and pilot plant scale first in an atlas suntest xls benchtop xenon tester system fig 1 a equipped with a xenon arc lamp nxe 2201 2500 w and uv glass filter suprax that inhibits wavelengths below 290 nm irradiation was fixed in 34 w m 2 and temperature maintained at 30 35 c working volume was 2 l under continuous agitation wastewater ph was adjusted to 3 with concentrated h2so4 and feso4 7h2o from panreac was added in the desirable concentrations of 20 or 50 mg l 1 of fe2 solution was homogenised during 15 min and time zero was established when h2o2 was added 100 mg l 1 or 500 mg l 1 and solar light simulator turned on h2o2 was continuously added along the test trying to maintain a constant concentration between 50 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 depending on the experiment residual h2o2 in samples was rapidly removed with sodium bisulphite for performing doc cod analysis and ionic chromatography but with catalase for toxicity and biodegradability measurements in both procedures in a dosage that reacted stoichiometrically with residual h2o2 concentration solar photo fenton tests at pilot plant scale were carried out in a compound parabolic collector cpc photo reactor fig 1b with 65 l of total volume and 23 l of irradiated volume cpc photoreactor is composed of 10 borosilicate glass tubes 150 cm length and 4 5 cm of inner diameter placed on an aluminium frame tilted at 37 psa 37 n 2 4 w in which the flow rate was placed at 2000 l h 1 pan world 0 75 kw experiments carried out in this plant followed the same procedure as described in the solar light simulator but the experiment started when cpc reactor was uncovered along with the addition of h2o2 100 mg l 1 and additions to maintained 50 mg l 1 2 3 2 electrooxidation pilot plant electrooxidation experiments were performed using a pilot plant fig 2 deeply described elsewhere 22 and operated with one cell working volume was 30 l with a current density of 150 ma cm 2 being the maximum applicable for this water in order to keep the voltage below 25 v as recommended by the manufacturer the air flow was set at 10 l h 1 and the water flow at 300 l h 1 when using the electrooxidative plant coupled to the cpc fig 1b the working volume was 75 l and the cpc flow rate was placed at 1500 l h 1 the remain operating parameters were maintained in the same values experimental procedure was initially adjusting ph to 3 addition of 20 mg l 1 of fe2 and let it homogenising during 15 min it is important to highlight that in this case h2o2 was electrogenerated on site and so no external addition of h2o2 was normally required time zero was considered when the power supply was turned on different electrochemical tests were developed anodic oxidation ao by using an electrochemical cell without the carbon cathode ph was adjusted to 3 without addition of iron or ao combined with solar radiation solar assisted ao when using the carbon ptfe cathode and iron addition electro fenton ef experiments were conducted in ef two different approaches were done one was performed with iron and only with electrogenerated h2o2 and the other with an initial additional concentration of 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 which was maintained at 10 mg l 1 by frequent analyses and additions of h2o2 along the experiment the intention was to check if the low content of h2o2 at the beginning of the process with only electrogenerated h2o2 could be limiting the oxidation process electrocell with carbon ptfe cathode was also combined with the cpc photo reactor which is known as solar photoelectro fenton spef process time zero was considered when connecting the power supply and uncovering the cpc photo reactor 2 3 3 ozonation system ozonation pilot plant fig 3 was operated in batch mode anseros pap pilot plant anseros klaus nonnenmacher gmbh germany the system consists of an ozone generator anseros com ad02 and destroyer thermic and catalytic two non dispersive o3 analysers in gas phase bmt 964 a flow meter for inlet air regulation and an oxygen generator anseros sep100 experiments were carried out with 13 l of total volume and 1 5 g o3 l 1 20 production at 60 l h 1 of air flow two different phs were tested natural ph and 11 ph 11 was evaluated with and without the addition of an initial concentration of 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 in the experiment with h2o2 time zero was considered when h2o2 addition occurred and the o3 generator was turned on residual o3 in samples was eliminated by

experimental results are given and compared by using accumulated uv energy per unit of treated volume q uv kj l 1 parameter which is calculated by the following equation equation 2 65 2 q u v n q u v

l 3 results and discussion 3 1 elderberry wastewater treatment by solar photo fenton process initially solar photo fenton experiments were performed at laboratory scale in a solar light simulator with the main objective of adjusting as much as possible operating conditions before scaling up the treatment two different concentrations of iron and h2o2 were tested along 240 min of total radiation exposure one with 20 mg l 1 of fe2 and initial h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l 1 trying to maintain a concentration of 50 mg l 1 of h2o2 during the whole experiment and a second one with 50 mg l 1 of fe2 and initial h2o2 concentration of 500 mg l 1 maintaining h2o2 at 200 mg l 1 throughout the experiment in fig 4 it can be clearly observed that the increase in the concentrations of iron and initial h2o2 led to a higher doc removal more than 95 whilst with the lowest dosage only 37 was attained entailing a h2o2 consumption of 950 mg l 1 and 397 mg l 1 respectively it means that h2o2 consumption was proportional to doc removal and therefore it would be possible to attain a very important mineralization with these experiments it was demonstrated the high efficiency of solar photo fenton process for the remediation of this specific complex wastewater so a scaling up step must be considered in consequence solar photo fenton experiments were carried out in the cpc photo reactor at the optimal iron concentration of 20 mg l 1 of fe2 for this type of collectors with 4 5 cm of inner tubes diameter 66 though better efficiency was observed at 50 mg l 1 of fe2 in the solar light simulator experiments it is important to highlight that optimal iron concentration depends basically on optical pathlength and so on photoreactor design therefore it must be stressed that experiments at laboratory scale were performed to demonstrate the viability of the process but not to decide the main basic photo fenton operation parameters in the cpc regarding h2o2 concentration small additions of 100 mg l 1 were made in order to slow down the initial reaction rate allowing measuring biodegradability along the initial steps of the solar photo fenton process fig 4 this experiment led to 90 of mineralization after 120 min a significant increase in biodegradability was observed just after 30 min of treatment codb cod 0 26 only 10 of mineralization with only 78 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 consumption and a q uv of 1 7 kj l 1 in addition higher initial dosage of h2o2 500 mg l 1 was also tested in the cpc data not shown observing stronger oxidant properties and so attaining almost 25 of mineralization after only 10 min of solar photo fenton process therefore it can be clearly stated that higher reagents dosages reached stronger oxidant properties which allowed faster and efficient doc removal but the identification or even the detection of the specific moment in which the combination with a biological system could be feasible lowering the treatment costs must be carefully studied these results highlight the importance of reaching a correct fe2 h2o2 ratio otherwise the excessive reagents dose and treatment time will go directly to an important mineralization and so operating costs will unnecessarily increase confirming this hypothesis and the improvement when combining with solar energy amaral silva and collaborators 2016 treated an elderberry wastewater by fenton process with the focus to apply a biological system afterwards under the best operating conditions at lab scale 300 ml of total volume much higher concentrations of fe2 and h2o2 were used 1100 mg l 1 and 5500 mg l 1 respectively removing 78 of cod and improving biodegradability to 0 3 initial biodegradability 0 05 after 4 h of treatment 11 3 2 elderberry wastewater treatment by electrooxidation electrooxidation experiments were divided into two types those in which both anode and cathode were used ef and spef and those in which only oxidation in the anode was tested without on site production of h2o2 ao and solar assisted ao as mentioned in section 2 3 2 different working volumes must be considered depending on the combination or not with the cpc photo reactor when combining with solar radiation solar assisted ao and spef the working volume was 75 l being 30 l in the other cases ef and ao this point is extremely important because the cathode area 0 010 m2 is constant and independent of the working volume and so the same amount of h2o2 would be generated by the cathode in both cases at the defined operating conditions of ph 3 150 ma cm 2 air flow of 10 l h 1 and a water flow of 300 l h 1 using a clean water with similar salinity the electrogeneration of h2o2 reached 5 9 mg min 1 in 15 min therefore electrogenerated h2o2 concentration will be dependent of the volume of wastewater to be treated in consequence it must be taken into account that spef process 75 l would be limited by the lower concentration of h2o2 in comparison to the ef process 30 l it is also important to highlight that the measurement of ions detected a clear presence of sulphate 500 700 mg l 1 coming from wastewater composition but mainly due to the ph correction with h2so4 and chloride 150 170 mg l 1 which is a key factor to be considered in electrooxidation systems they are precursors of different oxidation species apart from oh such as so4 hclo clo and cl fig 5 shows a direct comparison between the results obtained in all the electrooxidation experiments carried out at pilot plant scale the processes that had better doc removals 20 though still very low were ef process 20 mg l 1 of fe2 and only electrogenerated h2o2 and spef 20 mg l 1 of fe2 nevertheless it is important to highlight that biodegradability was improved in all experiments with spef 20 mg l 1 of fe2 biodegradability codb cod 0 30 was attained just after 20 min of treatment followed by ef with the addition of 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 and 20 mg l 1 of fe2 reaching the same biodegradability in 30 min in contrast with ef 20 mg l 1 of fe2 but using only electrogenerated h2o2 wastewater became biodegradable after 120 min codb cod 0 21 showing the limitation in the reaction caused by the low concentration of h2o2 at the beginning of the treatment in both ao experiments in the dark and solar assisted biodegradability was reached within 60 min codb cod 0 22 and 0 24 respectively regarding the electric consumption corresponding to the point in which biodegradability was improved enough it showed the following trend lowest to the highest consumption spef 0 109 kw h m 3 solar assisted ao 0 272 kw h m 3 ef with extra addition of 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 0 356 kw h m 3 dark ao 0 692 kw h m 3 ef 1 68 kw h m 3 solar assisted ao had a lower electric consumption in comparison with ef by adding 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 however the experiment took 30 min more solar assisted ao needed more time and accumulated uv energy to increase biodegradability than spef 2 8 kj l 1 compared to 1 1 kj l 1 it is expected that under the same operation conditions higher treatment times imply higher electric consumption in fact solar assisted ao seems to be a good alternative despite being necessary 60 min to attain high biodegradability because it is free of added chemicals the carbon ptfe cathode would not be required and part of the energy requirement would come from solar energy even ao in dark is able to consume less energy than the ef process yet in terms of mass in spef the amount of doc removal was much higher than ef even with lower h2o2 concentration as the total volume was higher thus the combination with solar radiation may be crucial to overcome the drawback imposed by the higher volume of wastewater to be treated in general the use of solar radiation allowing fenton reaction to continue did not drastically enhance doc removal but biodegradability was attained quicker with spef potentially reducing the global treatment costs 3 3 elderberry wastewater treatment by ozonation ozonation experiments see fig 6 were able to degrade 10 of doc after 120 min having a better efficiency when applied at ph 11 and initial addition of 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 20 of doc removal after 240 min of treatment though the production of oh would be expected to increase due to the addition of h2o2 the quick reaction of o3 with ho2 reactions 6 and 7 would also provoke an extra consumption of o3 56 additionally ozonation disrupted all the chromophores groups since in all experiments the final wastewater was colourless at higher ph the colour removal was faster biodegradability assays were carried out as soon as at least 5 of mineralization was attained taking into account previous positive biodegradability results obtained in solar photo fenton and spef processes after reaching between 6 and 10 of doc reduction no biodegradability improvement was shown with ozonation at natural ph whereas at ph 11 and at ph 11 with 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 biodegradability was reached in 120 min codb cod 0 39 and 6 of mineralization and 240 min codb cod 0 28 and 20 of mineralization respectively it was clear that the addition of h2o2 did not gave any enhancement to the oxidation system as the double of time was necessary to attain enough biocompatibility to face a subsequent biological treatment after 180 min codb cod was only 0 14 it is important to highlight that after 120 min of ozonation at ph 11 with h2o2 only 2 of mineralization was attained so biodegradability was not measured these results are in line with those reported by martins et al 2012 at laboratory scale who investigated ozonation treatment with 1 l of elderberry wastewater working with several o3 flows 17 5 g o3 n 1 m 3 40 g o3 n 1 m 3 and 57 8 g o3 n 1 m 3 in all cases tested doc content decreased however after 120 min of ozonation biodegradability results decreased at natural ph 6 6 and at ph 5 it was only possible to increase biodegradability when working at alkaline ph ph 10 12 regarding o3 consumption the increase in the ph led to higher consumption values 164 mg l 1 at natural ph 192 mg l 1 at ph 11 and 371 mg l 1 at ph 11 with 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 in agreement with the former statement about the quick reaction of o3 with ho2 reactions 6 and 7 in the presence of h2o2 3 4 preliminary economic analysis prior to make the economic analysis the experimental data in each oxidation treatment was evaluated and the experiments in which biodegradability was improved sooner were selected fig 7 shows biodegradability results under the best operating conditions table 2 shows a brief economic assessment based on the operation costs according to the experimental results obtained in this work taking into consideration reagents and electric consumption obtained from each oxidation process studied the investments costs related to infrastructure construction and equipment acquisition has not been tackled in this study as scaling up and optimization considerations must be taken into account for specific cases costs were estimated based on the treatment of 40 m3 of elderberry wastewater per day according to the production of elderberry industries located in the varosa region north of portugal in 2018 and 2019 harvest and considering a working period of 91 days per year 3640 m3 year 1 and a 15 years equipment lifetime reagents costs assumed were 0 45 l 1 for h2o2 solution 33 w v 0 72 kg 1 for feso4 7h2o 0 10 l 1 for h2so4 98 w v and 0 12 kg 1 for naoh 67 68 electricity costs have been considered as 0 08 kw h 1 69 regarding ozonation system according to the manufacturer electric consumption was 7 5 kw h kg 1 for o3 generation and 18 kw h kg 1 for oxygen concentration o3 generation percentage was fixed in 20 equivalent to a flow of 1 5 g o3 h 1 enough to degrade organic matter 70 consequently the obtained electric consumption for this process was 5 88 kw h m 3 in solar photo fenton process the major contributors to the electric consumption are the centrifugal and dosing pumps that allow wastewater to be recirculated into the system and h2o2 to be added respectively in the electrooxidation processes the electric consumptions were registered on site electrical power and voltage during the treatments regarding reagents in all cases it was considered ph adjustment prior and after the wastewater treatment acidic or basic ph for photo fenton and ozonation respectively and h2o2 dose it is important to highlight that all calculations considered costs until the wastewater turned biodegradable overall ozonation process stands out as the most expensive in terms of electrical costs 0 47 m 3 while the rest of tested oxidation treatments show similar operation costs solar photo fenton process had the highest reagents consumption but similar costs with spef and solar assisted ao when compared in terms of electricity however the electrical costs obtained for the solar assisted ao are majorly due to the extra reaction time necessary to reach biodegradability 60 min whereas the spef took only 20 min in ozonation process 120 min were needed to turn the wastewater biodegradable and additionally electric power is required to produce o3 therefore ozonation presented the highest electric consumption 4 conclusions this research addresses the treatment of a non biodegradable industrial wastewater with the singularity of having a low organic charge but with high biorecalcitrant character different feasible and efficient technological alternatives are shown and compared by means of a preliminary economical assessment to find out the lower cost process in terms of operation solar photo fenton ao solar assisted ao ef and spef processes were successfully tested to improve actual elderberry wastewater biodegradability showing a range of operation costs between 0 11 and 0 22 m 3 overall ozonation presents lower efficiency for reaching biodegradability standing out as the most expensive one 0 51 m 3 solar mediated processes were beneficial to attain biodegradability in shorter treatment times spef process was the fastest to attain biodegradability 20 min and it showed the lower associated operation costs 0 11 m 3 nonetheless it must not be discarded the fact that solar assisted ao did not require any h2o2 or fe2 addition and only showed 0 12 m 3 of operation costs depending on the specific characteristics of the industrial site the implementation of one of those studied alternatives would require additional and more detailed cost calculations as well as a life cycle assessment before taking the final

8801,there is limited research on the application of digital technologies at mine sites for treating and managing polluted mine water this review will identify underlying models theories and frameworks applied to the mines and used to smartly treat and manage mine water the aim is to provide informed details about these technologies in order to move the mine water management sector to the industrial internet of things iiot the internet of things iot wireless sensor networks wsn artificial intelligence swarming drones and automation are the most widely used smart technologies in current industries especially the mining industry in recent years automation has seen substantial growth in the mines for example self driving trucks in addition a lot of work that usually was done by humans can be performed better and safer by machines and drones wsn are used for automated measurement systems especially for collecting flow data and physico chemical parameters for managing and treating mine water all of these are operated through the main smart technology which is the iot it is expected that these technologies will positively affect the mining industry in the long run making it possible for the mines to reach their expected full scale production more easily in this study latest digital technologies to optimise mine water management and state of the art mines are reviewed and described in addition the advantages of using these digital technologies are investigated graphical abstract image 1 keywords industrial internet of things industry 4 0 internet of mine water wireless sensor networks mine water mining 1 introduction and background industry is moving from the third industrial revolution industry 3 0 to the fourth industrial revolution industry 4 0 and this implementation of disruptive technologies will vastly influence the mining sector especially mine water management nanda 2 describes the importance of integrating industry 4 0 technologies in mines to improve production and increase profits in order to survive in the competitive market smart mining is imperative this will see technologies such as big data internet of things iot machine to machine m2m data analytics sensor networks drones robotics increase efficiency in critical mining activities such as mine water management drilling surveying processing and transportation 2 3 the aging technology in some mines needs to be improved which means that the mining departments need to be modernised to prevent premature mine closures job losses and persisting mine water contamination by potentially harmful metals on the mine site 4 9 hopwood and deloitte touche tohmatsu limited 10 emphasised this issue accurately with each passing year water has become a more critical issue for the mining sector and because of the many changes that the mining industry encounters mining companies must enhance their approach to water management integrating these digital technologies will reduce the barriers that impede fully optimised production in the mines through optimised water management these latest digital technologies include wireless sensor networks wsn e g 11 13 fast speed networks such as the fifth generation of wireless network communication the 5g network e g 14 16 robots 17 or cloud computing e g 18 19 only a few mines are currently utilising these digital technologies and their experience showed that they are profiting substantially from these innovations these mines include the hull rust united states minnesota garzweiler germany north rhine westphalia escondida chile antofagasta region bingham canyon united states utah berkeley pit mines united states montana 20 rio tinto pilbara iron ore perth australia mine of the future 2 bhp billiton s next generation mining project 3 the donghuai mine in china s guangxi province 21 or newtrax technologies canada who also implemented artificial intelligence systems 22 all of them have in common that they use state of the art technologies and software ensuring that they maximise their profit without having to cut off their employees 23 24 in reviewing the most innovative mines using ground breaking technologies and software this article will prove that the industrial internet of things iiot 25 31 for mine sites sometimes called mine internet of things miot is the future for optimising mine water management industry 4 0 in simple terms refers to the iiot 25 26 while the iot refers to a system of physical things and technologies which consists of software electronics sensors and connectivity to ensure that the performance is enhanced by sending information or data to other connected devices and vice versa 32 35 however iot is not as well received in industry yet as compared to the consumer world one of the reasons is that the iot in the industry comes with a number of disadvantages such as the types and levels of security and a potential production disruption due to maintenance failures of the technologies 25 26 overcoming these barriers results in the iiot these technology systems can be applied in many sectors such as mining water energy and even the building industry it comes with several advantages such as saving costs increased production and flexibility in the workplace 32 the relationship of sensor network with iiot is critically important i e the iiot system yields good results when a wsn is applied as opposed to cabled systems 12 36 with wsn applications and companies can strategically place a large number of sensors in the area of interest to gather large quantities of information e g 37 which is not possible with cabled sensors therefore by using wsn the costs of installation and maintenance are dramatically reduced an additional advantage of industry 4 0 applications in the mine water sector is its contribution to integrated mine water management plans imwmp as outlined by chahbandour 38 an imwmp also requires that all mine departments cooperate mine water management is incorporated into the overall mine plan on site and off site risks relating to mine water are understood and internal and external commitments of the mine are supported at all times 38 this article describes several disruptive technologies that can contribute to optimising future mine water treatment and will bring water management into the technological age of industry 4 0 examples from the mining industry where some of these technologies are already in use will be presented and examples from other industries where some of these technologies are already standard will be described in the discussion and conclusions these technologies will be used to outline future mine water management strategies based on these interruptive technologies 2 problem statement and definitions many mining companies are reluctant to fully adopt industry 4 0 or are waiting to implement the technology however efforts are being made at several mining companies that already use automation options 39 40 this is a first step to qualify mines into the fourth industrial revolution yet more efforts might be needed 41 the sluggish advancement of this technology sees the mines slowing down in production compared to those that implement state of the art technologies and others affecting nearby community water sources which can be considered a severe concern in some areas in south africa one of the largest iron ore mines prides itself as the most technologically advanced mine and is already well advanced in the production of industry 4 0 42 43 this mine is dominated by robotics systems similarly to many other mines worldwide e g 39 40 therefore it might be safe to mention that approximately 95 of the world s mines are still moving from the second industrial revolution to the third usage of electricity for mass production can be classified as the second industrial revolution as mentioned by yin et al 44 while industry 3 0 can be defined as automated production using electronics it systems robotics as well as programmable logic controllers 44 45 the main limitation blocking most of the mines to smoothly move to industry 4 0 is basically the type of network they use highly recommended for this transition is the 5g network fig 1 because of its fast speed 46 47 and it will help fuel the rise of iot technology and provide the infrastructure needed to carry out big data processing 14 48 this network will add vital contributions to the industry such as transferring or moving big data with greater speed 48 increase the responsiveness of connected devices such as wnss and other smart devices as its now with verizon 5g tests in chicago u s a 11 14 16 49 50 3 methodological approaches 3 1 dynamic mine water management a dynamic system approach for treating mine water is slowly becoming a norm with modelling software such as goldsim matlab simulink geochemists workbench and phreeqc being favoured over the normal spreadsheet based approach dynamic modelling is highly useful when the aim is to predict the mine water quality and quantity over time which helps to predict the future of mine water management nowadays it is recommended to use dynamic and probabilistic methods when designing mine water management systems which will require a dynamic system modelling package e g goldsim matlab simulink stella vensim that can integrate all possible factors that might affect mine water management 51 52 applying these water software technologies results in a good mine water balance development for the whole mine site 53 with the wide range of dynamic software goldsim is the most used in generating mine water balance models mainly because of its flexibility though dynamic models are not new and have been around for a long time they are not utilised in mine water management to a degree that would be possible dynamic water balance calculations include all the mine site departments therefore this approach provides a highly qualitative tool which can be used to track the system s performance dynamic system modelling is helpful because it includes all possible factors contributing to the mine water quality and quantity shift to this approach will be vital for operating future mines and such consideration will also become important in the wider industrial sector as kunz and moran 54 have shown 3 2 data silos currently many industries including the mining industry work through data silos a data silo can be considered as a group of raw data that can only be administered or controlled by one department and is isolated from the rest of the organisation or other departments 55 often to keep secrets or exclude others from getting overall insights 56 figuratively speaking data silos are the electronic safes of modern times and are therefore preventing efficient development on site for example a mine site consists of various departments e g the mine processing plant treatment plant tailings facilities which are not always communicating with each other in terms of data sharing resulting in a data silo style of data management data silos come with many disadvantages such as difficulties in analysing the data i e data may sometimes be stored in formats that are inconsistent with one another resulting in time consuming standardisation of data and compilation into appropriate formats before it can be used 55 57 varying levels of security and data duplication is also caused by data silos 55 57 58 therefore this data handling practice needs to be broken down and a free flow of data and communication across the mine site departments implemented instead with the emerging digital technologies some of the mines are moving into more comprehensive solutions for data management i e all the mine site departments will now transfer the data into a single data retrieving and management system e g 59 this is known as either data warehouse or data lake which is a big data storage facility for the company on which multiple functions can be performed on such as real time data management on premises data management data analytics and also goes as far as using the data for machine learning fig 2 56 60 simplified a data warehouse stores processes and analyses data in an organised structure while a data lake holds raw or unstructured data of various types and processes and analyses this data at the time of usage 56 one of the first integrated mine management systems having been invented was al vis from the german company wismut gmbh in 2003 2004 61 pers comm m haase this resulted in an easier data management on their mine sites and helped to improve the effectiveness of the water and site management processes 3 3 sensor network based mines a commonly used approach being followed by mines nowadays is data collection through a variety of sensors mines are developing sensor network based online monitoring systems consisting of data monitoring sensor nodes base stations and monitoring centres 62 63 wireless sensor networks are strategically placed on the mine site to collect relevant data and it is imperative that these sensors need to be suitable for the rough mining environment requiring ruggedized sensors 3 in the mine water management division these sensors collect flow data and physico chemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity temperature dissolved oxygen turbidity biological oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand or redox potential fig 3 this information is then transferred to the data lake via the available network on the mine site 11 49 50 62 63 compared to the existing network infrastructure a 5g network will be more efficient for transferring these data from the sensors to the data warehouse or data lake 11 14 64 4 models or theories effective treatment of mine water has often proven to be an illusion with a number of mines especially abandoned ones contributing severely to water pollution the current models used in treating mine water are not ideal as they treat mine water based on the compositions and volumes of water entering the plant fig 4 left this simply means that the plant needs to react instantly when the volumes or chemistry of mine water changes in most cases there is no interaction between the precipitation water inflow into the mine technological changes within the mine water analyses of the plant and the outflow of the treated water 1 52 65 68 application of digital technologies will allow for this interaction to happen and therefore proving the need for the mines to move to iiot in consequence wsn collecting and transferring this data to the server will lead to improved water balance and chemical modelling due to the frequent and reliable data that will be recorded based on the literature and information review about the mentioned topic the following summary can be given all the reference lists of the included papers information gathering from consultants electronic database and grey literature searches reveal that mines are widely using the traditional or old style of mine water treatment and management e g 1 52 65 66 however some research attempts to move into the fourth industrial revolution in the mining sector e g 39 40 by introducing these digital technologies e g iot 19 32 40 wsn 11 49 50 62 63 or the 5g network 14 16 at the mine sites would ensure that all parameters that need to be known for an optimised mine water process will be collected and used to predict the water chemistry and treat mine water effectively this for example is currently being practiced in ghanaian mines pers comm ricky bonner miwatek however instead of using wsn they are using cabled sensors therefore this forces them to implement these digital technologies on a smaller scale 12 36 50 69 70 5 related work 5 1 introduction the most recent technologies in mining show a convincing industry shift towards sustainability 4 41 these digital technologies make it possible for the mines to reach optimised production and tackle problems such as acid mine drainage much faster yet there is little progress of implementing these technologies for mine water management though other departments in mines and certain industries are experiencing good technology advancement such as implementation of artificial intelligence e g 26 39 40 71 73 swarming drones e g 71 74 77 rfid and nfc 78 82 as well as wsn e g 11 12 36 37 49 50 83 84 5 2 artificial intelligence artificial intelligence ai presently drives the decision making in a lot of industries 85 86 they utilise smart data and machine learning to enhance the efficiency in operations 73 87 safety at the mine sites 88 89 and workflow in production 73 87 90 using digital technology in mine sites for data collection and feeding the ai systems with this data will ensure that ai supported software learns automatically from features in the data in addition this will ensure that data is collected and processed faster and smarter than the previously used data collection and processing methods as the mining industry changes and grows daily ai and machine learning influences the future choices of today s mines for example ai is used in economic geology to optimise the mineral exploration process 73 it is also used in machine autonomous vehicles e g in narrow mine tunnels where self driving trucks require ai technology for easy navigation e g 40 ai technology also helps to ensure the safety of the miners and improves the safety of mining workplaces and the environment in general e g it can be used to predict slope failure in open pit mines 89 lilić et al 88 also describes using ai methods to identify hazardous places in surface mining environments introducing this technology in mine water management should be in the form of computational modelling the knowledge driven algorithms based on computer programs that utilises expert systems and fuzzy concepts to make decisions e g 85 86 91 92 the main tool used in machine learning to predict mine water quality are artificial neural networks ann which are computational models consisting of a lot of processing elements which receives input data and immediately produces a single output for instance maier et al 93 used ann to model and eventually predict the residual aluminium concentrations in southern australian surface waters 5 3 swarming drones and drones swarming drones are a fleet of drones that operate together and can make decisions based on information gathered by one many or all the drones contributing to the swarm 94 they originate from military research seeking to reduce the loss of soldiers and equipment in warfare 95 several mines belonging to one of the biggest mining companies now use swarming drones to gather large quantities of data swarming drones are a technique that makes it possible to evaluate collective problem solving without having any centralised control 71 aerial photography surveillance site mapping and infrastructure inspection are some of the areas where swarming drones are already incorporated 74 76 this data collection method is now highly preferred as compared to collecting data by using helicopters because these swarming drones are cheaper to use faster can collect data in large quantities and meanwhile are highly reliable 75 some areas at a mine site might even not be accessible with self driving trucks and therefore mining companies use drones in such areas to gather data another key point with drones is that they have cameras and they can take images and videos while collecting data this camera feature enables specialised software to create 3d models of the mine sites their infrastructure and open pits 74 76 therefore drones and swarming drones substantially contribute to time saving and costs cutting as opposed to creating 3d models using ground based lasers or surveyors some of the drones are even operating with embedded sensors and these are utilised for mine water management e g at century mine in northern queensland australia where sensor embedded drones were used to identify pyrite oxidation in subsurface rocks 75 at the hannukainen mining development site northern finland rautio et al 96 used unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and thermal infrared tir to investigate groundwater surface water interactions that might be relevant for the final mine design the same technique was used to support the mine development of the sakatti mine site also in northern finland pers comm veli pekka salonen 5 4 wireless sensor networks wsn deployment of wsn for data collection is also becoming fashionable in mining environments in most cases the mines use water quality sensors to manage mine water 37 84 this can be considered an automated data collection and control system i e data is collected processed stored and transmitted to the monitoring server for analyses fig 3 data is communicated through the available network on the mine site therefore this data allows for a better business decision making and avoids instant reaction when mine water quality changes 1 11 12 36 37 50 83 84 tuna et al 97 describes a theoretical approach where continuous water monitoring was modelled with matlab using autonomous buoys and mini boats on the kirklareli baraji dam turkey collecting data which was transmitted via a wireless network their proposed autonomous mini boat measured temperature electrical conductivity and nitrate concentrations a real system was designed installed and tested by sun et al 98 in a lake near lamar university beaumont texas u s a they monitored water temperature dissolved oxygen and ph values in real time using storm 3 data loggers and they used a wireless network to transmit the data from the loggers to the server based on their studies they conclude that choosing the locations for the network are imperative for a well functioning system these problems with choosing a good location were also eminent when a mine water monitoring station temperature electrical conductivity pressure at the nikolaus bader schacht in tyrol austria was installed by the second authors research group though the provider s maps show a good cell phone connection trees and a narrow valley made finding an appropriate location for the antenna tedious 5 5 rfid and nfc radio frequency identification and near field communication radio frequency identification rfid is a technology that identifies and tracks items by using radiated and reflected radio frequency power usually an ordinary rfid system comprises of a reader and a tag 78 80 82 an rfid reader is made up of at least one antenna a radio frequency transmitter and a radio frequency receiver 99 while an rfid tag is an electronic tag consisting of an antenna and a microchip 80 82 both the tag and reader communicate with each other via backscattering which simply means the reflection of waves back to their original place 80 100 101 and they utilise ultra high frequencies uhf from 860 mhz to 960 mhz 102 rfid tags consist of a small microchip which can store not more than two kb of data 103 104 information from these tags can be read from a wide range of distances e g toll roads use an electronic toll collection process and the reading distance there is more than 3 m toll roads or cloth stores use rfid technology incorporating car or cloth embedded tags while the reading system is near or above the road or the store s exit location data is exchanged between the reader and electronic tag attached to the car or cloth through uhf radio waves 78 80 102 105 mining work clothing are also incorporated with rfid tags to track employee locations and ensure that they are safe 2 rfid systems have been successfully applied in a wide range of areas such as healthcare transportation logistics agriculture manufacturing and many other services 79 82 106 107 there are a wide range of uses for the rfid technology but mainly it is used for tracking and identification purposes it can also be used to store important information for products or in biometric electronic passports 108 in agriculture rfid tags have already been used for tagging vine rootstocks to identify various hybrids for scientific investigations 107 and the second author developed an rfid tag for the tracking of a tracer injection probe a future technology which is presently being developed by the first two authors is the application in mine water sampling currently sample bottles are labelled at the sampling location and this is then recorded in the field book however sometimes sample bottles get wet during the process and it is difficult to write on them in addition the process is time consuming and during transport the marking or a sticker may smear or scratch with water sample bottles equipped with rfid technology the extraction of mine water can be faster and smoother a microchip incorporated in the plastic bottle can store relevant information such as sampling location time and date or it can just be a simple tag in the analytical lab this information can later be downloaded from a server or data lake in other means this is a 3 way technology development which involves electronic identification tags etag web application eapplication and storage location estorage unlike the current method which only uses etags for tracking and identification in addition this will close a gap between the sampler laboratory and end user of the results by embedding an etag in the sample containers and communicating the sampling times sampling parameters and results between the parties involved in the process 6 the internet of mine water iomw usage of disruptive technologies in mines will result in smart mines and relating to mine water management into the technological age 109 when the internet of mine water iomw 45 becomes implemented on a broader scale fig 5 the term internet of mine water iomw is derived from the term the internet of things iot which very likely was first mentioned in 2000 by the rfid community 33 the iot now is referred to all things that are somehow tangible and theoretically could be reached by an internet address yet the iomw can be more than just referring to things it can also include data and the results of data processing coming from common statistical procedures or the procedures involved to analyse big data those non touchable objects are commonly referred to as digital objects and they can be referenced by persistent identifiers such as digital object identifiers doi or uniform resource names urn this iomw can easily incorporate smart technologies to improve the current processes and ultimately would result in intelligent mine water management iminewa parameters that can be measured and processed by these emerging technologies include online monitoring of flow and physico chemical parameters results of sampling campaigns rfid controlled sample management results of chemical analyses of the mine water and data processing e g statistics or stochastics of various scales because of the large volumes of data that might be collected big data analysis used in the process can include expert systems fuzzy based decision mechanisms e g 67 or neural networks 87 90 therefore this eventually evolves to developed techniques in big data processing e g 48 as the amount of data to control a large mine water management scheme will continuously expand as has been shown in the previous sections of this paper in this concept all water pathways into through and out of the mine must be monitored and used to feed the iomw with relevant data to avoid unauthorised access a digital rights management approach is imperative which includes managing different access levels of the various users because of the problems related to wireless sensors in a real situation environment not all sensors might become wireless in the first place yet the current technology development might be able to provide innovative sensor technology which is able to overcome those problems and other problems encountered in water related sensor technology e g 37 methods that can be included are data processing statistical methods and simulation e g goldsim into an expert system based decision process 68 recent discussions in public and scientific journals revealed that the internet of things is also connected with severe security issues 26 27 110 111 to overcome those issues all devices and servers need a thorough digital rights management some of those procedures have already been developed in laboratory information management systems lims or scientific data management system sdms can be part of the iomw 112 and can generally be based on astm e1578 113 http limswiki org quality management must also be an integrative part of the iomw users shall be able to track the source of the data and standards need to be developed to store process and retrieve the data obtained in the iomw it is also essential to distinguish between raw data and processed data with the help of meta data the source of the data and potential data manipulations can be traceable and the guidelines outlined in iso 9000 2005 can then be employed 114 to ensure proper use of data a database management system dbms can also be installed which needs to be scalable so that other sites can profit from the iomw a solution to the before mentioned issues might be the implementation of the open platform communications unified architecture opc ua protocol developed for the industrial automatization under a gpl 2 0 licence it allows besides communication between equipment and infrastructure on a cross platform basis also security functionality for authentication authorization integrity and confidentiality of the data and the communication and has already been used in around 600 water plants and wastewater plants 115 116 another issue that might be resolved is the management of fuzzy data and how to include fuzzy data in the decision process not in all cases a mathematical or physical relationship between a parameter and the control mechanisms might exist in those cases fuzzy decision mechanisms need to be studied and included in the control software or model as well some of the fuzzy data can be estimations of flow low high medium colours greenish reddish for non sensor based observations in addition it might be necessary to conduct fuzzy algorithm processing with properly measured data especially when it comes to special analyses 117 or quality evaluation with indicator methods as proposed by liu et al 118 finally the data processing within the framework of big data needs to be considered and employed to identify patterns in the dataset that might be useful for the optimization of the mine water treatment and finally a potential winning plant where the metals in the mine water could be extracted on a commercial basis above all the iomw can help in separating the water streams in a mine so that the amount of polluted water that needs treatment can be minimised techniques to separate different water streams in surface or underground mines are known but usually not used because practical reasons and costs might interfere with the management of various water streams 7 discussion the mining industry is currently confronted with many challenges such as low commodity prices increasing cost of electricity and production or pressures from ngos to provide fast and useful monitoring data these are driving the mining sector to industry 4 0 as it brings the industrial transformation the implementation of these digital technologies drives an increase in skills demand i e more jobs are and will still be created 119 as much as these technologies will not change basic mining principles using electricity and mechanics the mine workers will communicate with their equipment through the iot 32 120 121 and some might call themselves it experts in the future this paper wants to emphasise that upgrading mines to industry 4 0 will positively affect organisations as their employees will be forced to learn new skills 122 this will create jobs many of the employees will be needing higher qualifications and requesting a better education some of these adjustments can already be seen in mines in ghana 6 pers comm ricky bonner miwatek chile usa finland pers comm veli pekka salonen or australia the mine water treatment branches in the mines must start embracing the advantages that come with industry 4 0 these technologies will allow smooth reactions to changing water quality or quantity conditions in the mine and it enables the mine to not only know that the pump has stopped but to also know why meaning that the pump its control systems and motor will have to be connected to a network that will allow the operator to know everything 121 123 125 in an ideal situation the system will even predict when the pump is going to stop the new skills that will be brought by this interruptive improvement includes configuring wireless devices setting up networks or knowledge on internet protocols therefore this technological advancement will benefit the mining sector as a whole 126 in this context industry 4 0 is defined as iiot 25 27 with the influence of cloud computing or cloud based systems 18 19 it will increase the safety and security on the mine site will enable the mines to reach full production 26 and optimise mine water management with a data lake in the picture communication between all the compartments in the mine that deal with water becomes faster easier and more reliable 48 55 127 the falling productivity in some areas of the mining sector is highly notable partly due to lower commodity prices and lower grade ore deposits and this can be prevented with the adaptation of industry 4 0 a combination of technologies production communication and information that already can be seen in some of the mines e g 5 6 is what the rest of the mines should be investing in i e investing in the future of their mines it is important to have real time data in modern mine water management to ensure that good and valuable business decision making becomes normality 120 in a world where water management becomes increasingly important 8 conclusions this study presented an overview of smart technologies being applied in mines their advantages and how to overcome barriers making it difficult for free flow of water related data on the mine site it also introduced multiple approaches to embrace the use of the industry 4 0 technologies at production level having an automated measurement systems or real time data monitoring e g wsn data warehouse or data lake and improving machine learning full scale production in the mines can be achieved by optimising the water management on site and costs can be reduced drastically these latest digital partly interruptive technologies are slowly being introduced in the mining environment however so far polluted mine water is not the primary issue for the introduction of these technologies they are introduced as part of iiot and miot therefore focusing on optimising the mining process and security issues proper integration of the before described smart technologies will allow great improvements in dealing with structural and environmental issues management of mine water as well as safety and security issues on the mine site continued advancement in iiot technologies and implementing them in the mine water management will reduce the cost of adaptation and making the transition more attractive for future operations outdated ways of mining which were used for decades if not centuries without any change are now proving to be costly with sharp decline in productivity therefore intelligent ways of mining need to be explored and this can be possible through continuous data collection more automation machine to machine communication and increased data analysis underlying geology in mines is critically important to better manage mine water therefore the use of sensor technology 3d modelling and advanced robotics to detect harmful metals in underlying rocks could be helpful in this regard smart mining needs to explicitly explore interconnected communication of data in real time in all spheres of production more future research is needed in big data analytics across mining processes in mine water processes dynamic modelling approach are critical and can yield improved mine water balance if prioritised as soon as possible

8801,there is limited research on the application of digital technologies at mine sites for treating and managing polluted mine water this review will identify underlying models theories and frameworks applied to the mines and used to smartly treat and manage mine water the aim is to provide informed details about these technologies in order to move the mine water management sector to the industrial internet of things iiot the internet of things iot wireless sensor networks wsn artificial intelligence swarming drones and automation are the most widely used smart technologies in current industries especially the mining industry in recent years automation has seen substantial growth in the mines for example self driving trucks in addition a lot of work that usually was done by humans can be performed better and safer by machines and drones wsn are used for automated measurement systems especially for collecting flow data and physico chemical parameters for managing and treating mine water all of these are operated through the main smart technology which is the iot it is expected that these technologies will positively affect the mining industry in the long run making it possible for the mines to reach their expected full scale production more easily in this study latest digital technologies to optimise mine water management and state of the art mines are reviewed and described in addition the advantages of using these digital technologies are investigated graphical abstract image 1 keywords industrial internet of things industry 4 0 internet of mine water wireless

potentially harmful metals on the mine site 4 9 hopwood and deloitte touche tohmatsu limited 10 emphasised this issue accurately with each passing year water has become a more critical issue for the mining sector and because of the many changes that the mining industry encounters mining companies must enhance their approach to water management integrating these digital technologies will reduce the barriers that impede fully optimised production in the mines through optimised water management these latest digital technologies include wireless sensor networks wsn e g 11 13 fast speed networks such as the fifth generation of wireless network communication the 5g network e g 14 16 robots 17 or cloud computing e g 18 19 only a few mines are currently utilising these digital technologies and their experience showed that they are profiting substantially from these innovations these mines include the hull rust united states minnesota garzweiler germany north rhine westphalia escondida chile antofagasta region bingham canyon united states utah berkeley pit mines united states montana 20 rio tinto pilbara iron ore perth australia mine of the future 2 bhp billiton s next generation mining project 3 the donghuai mine in china s guangxi province 21 or newtrax technologies canada who also implemented artificial intelligence systems 22 all of them have in common that they use state of the art technologies and software ensuring that they maximise their profit without having to cut off their employees 23 24 in reviewing the most innovative mines using ground breaking technologies and software this article will prove that the industrial internet of things iiot 25 31 for mine sites sometimes called mine internet of things miot is the future for optimising mine water management industry 4 0 in simple terms refers to the iiot 25 26 while the iot refers to a system of physical things and technologies which consists of software electronics sensors and connectivity to ensure that the performance is enhanced by sending information or data to other connected devices and vice versa 32 35 however iot is not as well received in industry yet as compared to the consumer world one of the reasons is that the iot in the industry comes with a number of disadvantages such as the types and levels of security and a potential production disruption due to maintenance failures of the technologies 25 26 overcoming these barriers results in the iiot these technology systems can be applied in many sectors such as mining water energy and even the building industry it comes with several advantages such as saving costs increased production and flexibility in the workplace 32 the relationship of sensor network with iiot is critically important i e the iiot system yields good results when a wsn is applied as opposed to cabled systems 12 36 with wsn applications and companies can strategically place a large number of sensors in the area of interest to gather large quantities of information e g 37 which is not possible with cabled sensors therefore by using wsn the costs of installation and maintenance are dramatically reduced an additional advantage of industry 4 0 applications in the mine water sector is its contribution to integrated mine water management plans imwmp as outlined by chahbandour 38 an imwmp also requires that all mine departments cooperate mine water management is incorporated into the overall mine plan on site and off site risks relating to mine water are understood and internal and external commitments of the mine are supported at all times 38 this article describes several disruptive technologies that can contribute to optimising future mine water treatment and will bring water management into the technological age of industry 4 0 examples from the mining industry where some of these technologies are already in use will be presented and examples from other industries where some of these technologies are already standard will be described in the discussion and conclusions these technologies will be used to outline future mine water management strategies based on these interruptive technologies 2 problem statement and definitions many mining companies are reluctant to fully adopt industry 4 0 or are waiting to implement the technology however efforts are being made at several mining companies that already use automation options 39 40 this is a first step to qualify mines into the fourth industrial revolution yet more efforts might be needed 41 the sluggish advancement of this technology sees the mines slowing down in production compared to those that implement state of the art technologies and others affecting nearby community water sources which can be considered a severe concern in some areas in south africa one of the largest iron ore mines prides itself as the most technologically advanced mine and is already well advanced in the production of industry 4 0 42 43 this mine is dominated by robotics systems similarly to many other mines worldwide e g 39 40 therefore it might be safe to mention that approximately 95 of the world s mines are still moving from the second industrial revolution to the third usage of electricity for mass production can be classified as the second industrial revolution as mentioned by yin et al 44 while industry 3 0 can be defined as automated production using electronics it systems robotics as well as programmable logic controllers 44 45 the main limitation blocking most of the mines to smoothly move to industry 4 0 is basically the type of network they use highly recommended for this transition is the 5g network fig 1 because of its fast speed 46 47 and it will help fuel the rise of iot technology and provide the infrastructure needed to carry out big data processing 14 48 this network will add vital contributions to the industry such as transferring or moving big data with greater speed 48 increase the responsiveness of connected devices such as wnss and other smart devices as its now with verizon 5g tests in chicago u s a 11 14 16 49 50 3 methodological approaches 3 1 dynamic mine water management a dynamic system approach for treating mine water is slowly becoming a norm with modelling software such as goldsim matlab simulink geochemists workbench and phreeqc being favoured over the normal spreadsheet based approach dynamic modelling is highly useful when the aim is to predict the mine water quality and quantity over time which helps to predict the future of mine water management nowadays it is recommended to use dynamic and probabilistic methods when designing mine water management systems which will require a dynamic system modelling package e g goldsim matlab simulink stella vensim that can integrate all possible factors that might affect mine water management 51 52 applying these water software technologies results in a good mine water balance development for the whole mine site 53 with the wide range of dynamic software goldsim is the most used in generating mine water balance models mainly because of its flexibility though dynamic models are not new and have been around for a long time they are not utilised in mine water management to a degree that would be possible dynamic water balance calculations include all the mine site departments therefore this approach provides a highly qualitative tool which can be used to track the system s performance dynamic system modelling is helpful because it includes all possible factors contributing to the mine water quality and quantity shift to this approach will be vital for operating future mines and such consideration will also become important in the wider industrial sector as kunz and moran 54 have shown 3 2 data silos currently many industries including the mining industry work through data silos a data silo can be considered as a group of raw data that can only be administered or controlled by one department and is isolated from the rest of the organisation or other departments 55 often to keep secrets or exclude others from getting overall insights 56 figuratively speaking data silos are the electronic safes of modern times and are therefore preventing efficient development on site for example a mine site consists of various departments e g the mine processing plant treatment plant tailings facilities which are not always communicating with each other in terms of data sharing resulting in a data silo style of data management data silos come with many disadvantages such as difficulties in analysing the data i e data may sometimes be stored in formats that are inconsistent with one another resulting in time consuming standardisation of data and compilation into appropriate formats before it can be used 55 57 varying levels of security and data duplication is also caused by data silos 55 57 58 therefore this data handling practice needs to be broken down and a free flow of data and communication across the mine site departments implemented instead with the emerging digital technologies some of the mines are moving into more comprehensive solutions for data management i e all the mine site departments will now transfer the data into a single data retrieving and management system e g 59 this is known as either data warehouse or data lake which is a big data storage facility for the company on which multiple functions can be performed on such as real time data management on premises data management data analytics and also goes as far as using the data for machine learning fig 2 56 60 simplified a data warehouse stores processes and analyses data in an organised structure while a data lake holds raw or unstructured data of various types and processes and analyses this data at the time of usage 56 one of the first integrated mine management systems having been invented was al vis from the german company wismut gmbh in 2003 2004 61 pers comm m haase this resulted in an easier data management on their mine sites and helped to improve the effectiveness of the water and site management processes 3 3 sensor network based mines a commonly used approach being followed by mines nowadays is data collection through a variety of sensors mines are developing sensor network based online monitoring systems consisting of data monitoring sensor nodes base stations and monitoring centres 62 63 wireless sensor networks are strategically placed on the mine site to collect relevant data and it is imperative that these sensors need to be suitable for the rough mining environment requiring ruggedized sensors 3 in the mine water management division these sensors collect flow data and physico chemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity temperature dissolved oxygen turbidity biological oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand or redox potential fig 3 this information is then transferred to the data lake via the available network on the mine site 11 49 50 62 63 compared to the existing network infrastructure a 5g network will be more efficient for transferring these data from the sensors to the data warehouse or data lake 11 14 64 4 models or theories effective treatment of mine water has often proven to be an illusion with a number of mines especially abandoned ones contributing severely to water pollution the current models used in treating mine water are not ideal as they treat mine water based on the compositions and volumes of water entering the plant fig 4 left this simply means that the plant needs to react instantly when the volumes or chemistry of mine water changes in most cases there is no interaction between the precipitation water inflow into the mine technological changes within the mine water analyses of the plant and the outflow of the treated water 1 52 65 68 application of digital technologies will allow for this interaction to happen and therefore proving the need for the mines to move to iiot in consequence wsn collecting and transferring this data to the server will lead to improved water balance and chemical modelling due to the frequent and reliable data that will be recorded based on the literature and information review about the mentioned topic the following summary can be given all the reference lists of the included papers information gathering from consultants electronic database and grey literature searches reveal that mines are widely using the traditional or old style of mine water treatment and management e g 1 52 65 66 however some research attempts to move into the fourth industrial revolution in the mining sector e g 39 40 by introducing these digital technologies e g iot 19 32 40 wsn 11 49 50 62 63 or the 5g network 14 16 at the mine sites would ensure that all parameters that need to be known for an optimised mine water process will be collected and used to predict the water chemistry and treat mine water effectively this for example is currently being practiced in ghanaian mines pers comm ricky bonner miwatek however instead of using wsn they are using cabled sensors therefore this forces them to implement these digital technologies on a smaller scale 12 36 50 69 70 5 related work 5 1 introduction the most recent technologies in mining show a convincing industry shift towards sustainability 4 41 these digital technologies make it possible for the mines to reach optimised production and tackle problems such as acid mine drainage much faster yet there is little progress of implementing these technologies for mine water management though other departments in mines and certain industries are experiencing good technology advancement such as implementation of artificial intelligence e g 26 39 40 71 73 swarming drones e g 71 74 77 rfid and nfc 78 82 as well as wsn e g 11 12 36 37 49 50 83 84 5 2 artificial intelligence artificial intelligence ai presently drives the decision making in a lot of industries 85 86 they utilise smart data and machine learning to enhance the efficiency in operations 73 87 safety at the mine sites 88 89 and workflow in production 73 87 90 using digital technology in mine sites for data collection and feeding the ai systems with this data will ensure that ai supported software learns automatically from features in the data in addition this will ensure that data is collected and processed faster and smarter than the previously used data collection and processing methods as the mining industry changes and grows daily ai and machine learning influences the future choices of today s mines for example ai is used in economic geology to optimise the mineral exploration process 73 it is also used in machine autonomous vehicles e g in narrow mine tunnels where self driving trucks require ai technology for easy navigation e g 40 ai technology also helps to ensure the safety of the miners and improves the safety of mining workplaces and the environment in general e g it can be used to predict slope failure in open pit mines 89 lilić et al 88 also describes using ai methods to identify hazardous places in surface mining environments introducing this technology in mine water management should be in the form of computational modelling the knowledge driven algorithms based on computer programs that utilises expert systems and fuzzy concepts to make decisions e g 85 86 91 92 the main tool used in machine learning to predict mine water quality are artificial neural networks ann which are computational models consisting of a lot of processing elements which receives input data and immediately produces a single output for instance maier et al 93 used ann to model and eventually predict the residual aluminium concentrations in southern australian surface waters 5 3 swarming drones and drones swarming drones are a fleet of drones that operate together and can make decisions based on information gathered by one many or all the drones contributing to the swarm 94 they originate from military research seeking to reduce the loss of soldiers and equipment in warfare 95 several mines belonging to one of the biggest mining companies now use swarming drones to gather large quantities of data swarming drones are a technique that makes it possible to evaluate collective problem solving without having any centralised control 71 aerial photography surveillance site mapping and infrastructure inspection are some of the areas where swarming drones are already incorporated 74 76 this data collection method is now highly preferred as compared to collecting data by using helicopters because these swarming drones are cheaper to use faster can collect data in large quantities and meanwhile are highly reliable 75 some areas at a mine site might even not be accessible with self driving trucks and therefore mining companies use drones in such areas to gather data another key point with drones is that they have cameras and they can take images and videos while collecting data this camera feature enables specialised software to create 3d models of the mine sites their infrastructure and open pits 74 76 therefore drones and swarming drones substantially contribute to time saving and costs cutting as opposed to creating 3d models using ground based lasers or surveyors some of the drones are even operating with embedded sensors and these are utilised for mine water management e g at century mine in northern queensland australia where sensor embedded drones were used to identify pyrite oxidation in subsurface rocks 75 at the hannukainen mining development site northern finland rautio et al 96 used unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and thermal infrared tir to investigate groundwater surface water interactions that might be relevant for the final mine design the same technique was used to support the mine development of the sakatti mine site also in northern finland pers comm veli pekka salonen 5 4 wireless sensor networks wsn deployment of wsn for data collection is also becoming fashionable in mining environments in most cases the mines use water quality sensors to manage mine water 37 84 this can be considered an automated data collection and control system i e data is collected processed stored and transmitted to the monitoring server for analyses fig 3 data is communicated through the available network on the mine site therefore this data allows for a better business decision making and avoids instant reaction when mine water quality changes 1 11 12 36 37 50 83 84 tuna et al 97 describes a theoretical approach where continuous water monitoring was modelled with matlab using autonomous buoys and mini boats on the kirklareli baraji dam turkey collecting data which was transmitted via a wireless network their proposed autonomous mini boat measured temperature electrical conductivity and nitrate concentrations a real system was designed installed and tested by sun et al 98 in a lake near lamar university beaumont texas u s a they monitored water temperature dissolved oxygen and ph values in real time using storm 3 data loggers and they used a wireless network to transmit the data from the loggers to the server based on their studies they conclude that choosing the locations for the network are imperative for a well functioning system these problems with choosing a good location were also eminent when a mine water monitoring station temperature electrical conductivity pressure at the nikolaus bader schacht in tyrol austria was installed by the second authors research group though the provider s maps show a good cell phone connection trees and a narrow valley made finding an appropriate location for the antenna tedious 5 5 rfid and nfc radio frequency identification and near field communication radio frequency identification rfid is a technology that identifies and tracks items by using radiated and reflected radio frequency power usually an ordinary rfid system comprises of a reader and a tag 78 80 82 an rfid reader is made up of at least one antenna a radio frequency transmitter and a radio frequency receiver 99 while an rfid tag is an electronic tag consisting of an antenna and a microchip 80 82 both the tag and reader communicate with each other via backscattering which simply means the reflection of waves back to their original place 80 100 101 and they utilise ultra high frequencies uhf from 860 mhz to 960 mhz 102 rfid tags consist of a small microchip which can store not more than two kb of data 103 104 information from these tags can be read from a wide range of distances e g toll roads use an electronic toll collection process and the reading distance there is more than 3 m toll roads or cloth stores use rfid technology incorporating car or cloth embedded tags while the reading system is near or above the road or the store s exit location data is exchanged between the reader and electronic tag attached to the car or cloth through uhf radio waves 78 80 102 105 mining work clothing are also incorporated with rfid tags to track employee locations and ensure that they are safe 2 rfid systems have been successfully applied in a wide range of areas such as healthcare transportation logistics agriculture manufacturing and many other services 79 82 106 107 there are a wide range of uses for the rfid technology but mainly it is used for tracking and identification purposes it can also be used to store important information for products or in biometric electronic passports 108 in agriculture rfid tags have already been used for tagging vine rootstocks to identify various hybrids for scientific investigations 107 and the second author developed an rfid tag for the tracking of a tracer injection probe a future technology which is presently being developed by the first two authors is the application in mine water sampling currently sample bottles are labelled at the sampling location and this is then recorded in the field book however sometimes sample bottles get wet during the process and it is difficult to write on them in addition the process is time consuming and during transport the marking or a sticker may smear or scratch with water sample bottles equipped with rfid technology the extraction of mine water can be faster and smoother a microchip incorporated in the plastic bottle can store relevant information such as sampling location time and date or it can just be a simple tag in the analytical lab this information can later be downloaded from a server or data lake in other means this is a 3 way technology development which involves electronic identification tags etag web application eapplication and storage location estorage unlike the current method which only uses etags for tracking and identification in addition this will close a gap between the sampler laboratory and end user of the results by embedding an etag in the sample containers and communicating the sampling times sampling parameters and results between the parties involved in the process 6 the internet of mine water iomw usage of disruptive technologies in mines will result in smart mines and relating to mine water management into the technological age 109 when the internet of mine water iomw 45 becomes implemented on a broader scale fig 5 the term internet of mine water iomw is derived from the term the internet of things iot which very likely was first mentioned in 2000 by the rfid community 33 the iot now is referred to all things that are somehow tangible and theoretically could be reached by an internet address yet the iomw can be more than just referring to things it can also include data and the results of data processing coming from common statistical procedures or the procedures involved to analyse big data those non touchable objects are commonly referred to as digital objects and they can be referenced by persistent identifiers such as digital object identifiers doi or uniform resource names urn this iomw can easily incorporate smart technologies to improve the current processes and ultimately would result in intelligent mine water management iminewa parameters that can be measured and processed by these emerging technologies include online monitoring of flow and physico chemical parameters results of sampling campaigns rfid controlled sample management results of chemical analyses of the mine water and data processing e g statistics or stochastics of various scales because of the large volumes of data that might be collected big data analysis used in the process can include expert systems fuzzy based decision mechanisms e g 67 or neural networks 87 90 therefore this eventually evolves to developed techniques in big data processing e g 48 as the amount of data to control a large mine water management scheme will continuously expand as has been shown in the previous sections of this paper in this concept all water pathways into through and out of the mine must be monitored and used to feed the iomw with relevant data to avoid unauthorised access a digital rights management approach is imperative which includes managing different access levels of the various users because of the problems related to wireless sensors in a real situation environment not all sensors might become wireless in the first place yet the current technology development might be able to provide innovative sensor technology which is able to overcome those problems and other problems encountered in water related sensor technology e g 37 methods that can be included are data processing statistical methods and simulation e g goldsim into an expert system based decision process 68 recent discussions in public and scientific journals revealed that the internet of things is also connected with severe security issues 26 27 110 111 to overcome those issues all devices and servers need a thorough digital rights management some of those procedures have already been developed in laboratory information management systems lims or scientific data management system sdms can be part of the iomw 112 and can generally be based on astm e1578 113 http limswiki org quality management must also be an integrative part of the iomw users shall be able to track the source of the data and standards need to be developed to store process and retrieve the data obtained in the iomw it is also essential to distinguish between raw data and processed data with the help of meta data the source of the data and potential data manipulations can be traceable and the guidelines outlined in iso 9000 2005 can then be employed 114 to ensure proper use of data a database management system dbms can also be installed which needs to be scalable so that other sites can profit from the iomw a solution to the before mentioned issues might be the implementation of the open platform communications unified architecture opc ua protocol developed for the industrial automatization under a gpl 2 0 licence it allows besides communication between equipment and infrastructure on a cross platform basis also security functionality for authentication authorization integrity and confidentiality of the data and the communication and has already been used in around 600 water plants and wastewater plants 115 116 another issue that might be resolved is the management of fuzzy data and how to include fuzzy data in the decision process not in all cases a mathematical or physical relationship between a parameter and the control mechanisms might exist in those cases fuzzy decision mechanisms need to be studied and included in the control software or model as well some of the fuzzy data can be estimations of flow low high medium colours greenish reddish for non sensor based observations in addition it might be necessary to conduct fuzzy algorithm processing with properly measured data especially when it comes to special analyses 117 or quality evaluation with indicator methods as proposed by liu et al 118 finally the data processing within the framework of big data needs to be considered and employed to identify patterns in the dataset that might be useful for the optimization of the mine water treatment and finally a potential winning plant where the metals in the mine water could be extracted on a commercial basis above all the iomw can help in separating the water streams in a mine so that the amount of polluted water that needs treatment can be minimised techniques to separate different water streams in surface or underground mines are known but usually not used because practical reasons and costs might interfere with the management of various water streams 7 discussion the mining industry is currently confronted with many challenges such as low commodity prices increasing cost of electricity and production or pressures from ngos to provide fast and useful monitoring data these are driving the mining sector to industry 4 0 as it brings the industrial transformation the implementation of these digital technologies drives an increase in skills demand i e more jobs are and will still be created 119 as much as these technologies will not change basic mining principles using electricity and mechanics the mine workers will communicate with their equipment through the iot 32 120 121 and some might call themselves it experts in the future this paper wants to emphasise that upgrading mines to industry 4 0 will positively affect organisations as their employees will be forced to learn new skills 122 this will create jobs many of the employees will be needing higher qualifications and requesting a better education some of these adjustments can already be seen in mines in ghana 6 pers comm ricky bonner miwatek chile usa finland pers comm veli pekka salonen or australia the mine water treatment branches in the mines must start embracing the advantages that come with industry 4 0 these technologies will allow smooth reactions to changing water quality or quantity conditions in the mine and it enables the mine to not only know that the pump has stopped but to also know why meaning that the pump its control systems and motor will have to be connected to a network that will allow the operator to know everything 121 123 125 in an ideal situation the system will even predict when the pump is going to stop the new skills that will be brought by this interruptive improvement includes configuring wireless devices setting up networks or knowledge on internet protocols therefore this technological advancement will benefit the mining sector as a whole 126 in this context industry 4 0 is defined as iiot 25 27 with the influence of cloud computing or cloud based systems 18 19 it will increase the safety and security on the mine site will enable the mines to reach full production 26 and optimise mine water management with a data lake in the picture communication between all the compartments in the mine that deal with water becomes faster easier and more reliable 48 55 127 the falling productivity in some areas of the mining sector is highly notable partly due to lower commodity prices and lower grade ore deposits and this can be prevented with the adaptation of industry 4 0 a combination of technologies production communication and information that already can be seen in some of the mines e g 5 6 is what the rest of the mines should be investing in i e investing in the future of their mines it is important to have real time data in modern mine water management to ensure that good and valuable business decision making becomes normality 120 in a world where water management becomes increasingly important 8 conclusions this study presented an overview of smart technologies being applied in mines their advantages and how to overcome barriers making it difficult for free flow of water related data on the mine site it also introduced multiple approaches to embrace the use of the industry 4 0 technologies at production level having an automated measurement systems or real time data monitoring e g wsn data warehouse or data lake and improving machine learning full scale production in the mines can be achieved by optimising the water management on site and costs can be reduced drastically these latest digital partly interruptive technologies are slowly being introduced in the mining environment however so far polluted mine water is not the primary issue for the introduction of these technologies they are introduced as part of iiot and miot therefore focusing on optimising the mining process and security issues proper integration of the before described smart technologies will allow great improvements in dealing with structural and environmental issues management of mine water as well as safety and security issues on the mine site continued advancement in iiot technologies and implementing them in the mine water management will reduce the cost of adaptation and making the transition more attractive for future operations outdated ways of mining which were used for decades if not centuries without any change are now proving to be costly with sharp decline in productivity therefore intelligent ways of mining need to be explored and this can be possible through continuous data collection more automation machine to machine communication and increased data analysis underlying geology in mines is critically important to better manage mine water therefore the use of sensor technology 3d modelling and advanced robotics to detect harmful metals in underlying rocks could be helpful in this regard smart mining needs to explicitly explore interconnected communication of data in real time in all spheres of production more future research is needed in big data analytics across mining processes in mine water processes dynamic modelling approach are critical and can yield improved mine water balance if prioritised as soon as possible

brines in water treatment the use of membrane technologies in water treatment results in the generation of residual streams a major application of membrane technologies is desalination of brackish and saline feed water by reverse osmosis ro to provide fresh water for production cleaning or cooling processes in industry the generated residual water streams contain the dissolved compounds of the feed stream but in a higher concentration because part of the volume of the feed stream is recovered as fresh water these concentrated residual water streams are called brines and typically have high concentrations of dissolved salts but also contain other dissolved substances 1 2 treatment of brines in the study of pramanik et al 1 various strategies to manage brines are discussed such as deep well injection evaporation ponds and discharge to receiving water bodies however deep well injection and discharge to receiving water bodies could lead to local environmental damage 2 while the use of evaporation ponds requires large surface areas and suitable conditions to allow for evaporation brines could be used more efficiently by means of reclamation of the water the application of zero liquid discharge zld aims at full water recovery from residual waters and becomes interesting in situations with an excess of waste heat and shortages of fresh water sources since the recovery of water from residual waters by thermal technologies is energy intensive and costly 3 a drawback of the application of zld is the generation of solid residual streams because the solids consist of a mixture of substances they are often not suitable for reuse and therefore sent to a landfill 3 by means of separating the substances opportunities for resource recovery emerge 1 3 generation of solids in a zld water treatment plant in a full scale petrochemical industrial water treatment plant the zld strategy is applied to maximise the recovery of water for reuse purposes fig 1 presents the layout of the zld water treatment plant after the removal of most organic substances and suspended solids reusable water is produced by ro the generated concentrate ro brine is finally evaporated resulting in the generation of a solid residual stream consisting of mixed solids these mixed solids consists of sodium chloride nacl crystals with a distinct brown colour fig 7 making the salt not suitable for reuse the colour of the mixed solids is caused by the presence of natural organic matter nom which originate from the activated sludge process the nom in the ro brine is of dissolved nature because it is not rejected by the submerged ultrafiltration prior to the multi stage ro the generated nacl crystals can potentially be reused by separation of the nom and nacl this can both be achieved in the dissolved phase in the ro brine or the solid phase the mixed solids 1 4 natural organic matter in water nom typically refers to a collection of various organic substances and can be divided into various groups 4 by the characterisation of nom by liquid chromatography in combination with organic carbon detection lc ocd method the following groups are generally distinguished biopolymers humic acids and low molecular weight lmw organics 5 the characterisation and classification of nom in water by methods such as lc ocd is key for the selection of technologies for the treatment of the respective water according to the study of huber et al 6 on the nom categorisation by lc ocd of waters with various origins biopolymers are non ionic organic molecules with a molecular weight mw higher than 10 000 da humic acids cover a wide variety of organic molecules which typically have a negative charge an mw ranging 350 1000 da and contain aromatic groups that absorb ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 254 uv254a 4 6 finally lmw organics have an mw lower than 350 da do not absorb uv254 and can be split into two groups uncharged lmw neutrals and anionic lmw acids as a function of

matter in dyes are in the order of grams per litre and the organic matter often consists of a singular compounds which are well defined 9 11 the results of previous studies cannot directly be translated to the separation of nom and nacl in ro brine furthermore the actual rejection of nom depends strongly on the composition of nom the membrane characteristics and the feed solution chemistry schäfer et al 12 showed that the fractions of nom with an mw larger than the mwco molecular weight cut off of the nf membrane are rejected by size exclusion the rejection of lmw organics by nf is more challenging 13 because the mw of lmw organics is close to the mwco of nf membranes the rejection mechanism of lmw organics relies more on electrostatic repulsion and depends on the solution chemistry which determines the charge of the lmw organics 12 besides the use of polymeric nf pnf membranes a new trend in the application of nf is the use of ceramic nf cnf membranes which can be chemically cleaned cnf membranes can be coated with selective layers allowing passage of salt ions and rejection of organics 14 in fact cnf membranes proved to be able to reject nom from pre sieved sewage without any other pre treatment 15 1 5 2 separation by electrodialysis ed is typically used to concentrate and partially desalinate brines but can also be used as a separation technology 16 separation of nom and salt ions can be achieved by ed by means of transport of salt ions and rejection of nom through the ion exchange membranes iexm ed has been used to improve the quality of printing dyes by decreasing the salt concentration 17 however because the concentration of organic matter in the printing dyes was around 200 g l 1 and again singular well characterised organic compounds represented the organic matter also the results from this study cannot directly be translated to the separation of nom and nacl in the ro brine previous research by lee et al 18 showed that synthetic humic acids could be well rejected by the iexm in ed these results were confirmed by kim et al 19 who showed that the rejection of humic acids fraction of nom originating from a river was high while a small fraction of the lmw organics was transported from the diluate to the concentrate in addition zhang et al 20 used ed to separate synthetic lmw organics from salt ions and showed that separation was challenging and depended on the mw and charge of lmw organics because lmw acids are negatively charged and have a relatively low mw they can be transported through the iexm the transport of lmw organics therefore depends strongly on the mw the characteristics of the iexm and the solution chemistry sata et al 21 showed that it is possible to selectively transport anions by using specific anion exchange membranes zhang et al 22 compared standard iexm with selective iexm to separate lwm organics and salt ions and found that the selective iexm had a higher selectivity for transport the salt ions than the standard iexm 1 5 3 separation by ion exchange iex is a widely applied technology to remove nom especially to avoid the formation of disinfection by products after chlorination during the production of drinking water 23 nom rejection by iex relies on the exchange of organic anions with anions attached to the resin which have a lower affinity for the resin than the organic anions 24 no studies that focused on the separation of nom and nacl in ro brine were found 1 6 solid phase separation separation of nom and nacl can also be achieved in the solid phase for example by washing the solid nacl by using a technique called salex which is an acronym for the extraction of impurities from salt this process is used to remove impurities from solid salt by means of washing the salt with a saturated salt solution eluent the impurities dissolve into the eluent and are subsequently washed away while the salt remains in solid phase 25 according to our best knowledge there are no studies available on the separation of nom and salt by this technique 1 7 research objective to our best knowledge there are no studies present that assessed the performance of nf ed and iex to separate nom and nacl in ro brine this study therefore focusses on the separation of nom and nacl by nf ed and iex by assessing both the recovery of nacl and the rejection of nom by the respective technologies we experimentally tested two polymeric nf membranes and one ceramic nf membrane a standard and a monovalent selective ed membrane stack and iex resin in chloride form to separate nom and nacl in the ro brine additionally we experimentally assessed the performance of salex to separate nom and nacl in the mixed solids generated in the zld water treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 ro brine and mixed solids the ro brine experiments were conducted with the actual obtained mixed solids generated by the evaporators in the zld water treatment plant the ro brine was prepared by dissolving the evaporator mixed solids in demi water the experiments with mixed solids were conducted with the actual mixed solids from the zld water treatment plant generated by the crystallisers fig 2 presents a schematic representation of the variously used experimental nf ed iex and salex set ups 2 2 analytical materials to characterise the ro brine and the mixed solids icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and hplc high performance liquid chromatography were used to detect ions such as sodium and chloride in addition the characterisation of nom was performed by lc ocd which makes it possible to distinguish and quantify the presence of various categories of nom the ec electrical conductivity and ph were measured in all experiments using calibrated tetracon 925 ec sensors and ids sentix 940 ph sensors respectively the automatically logged ec data was stored on a wtw multi 3630 ids multi meter uv254a was measured by a thermo scientific evolution 60s uv visible spectrophotometer and 50 mm quartz cuvettes while total organic carbon toc was measured by a shimadzu toc l analyser 2 3 nanofiltration 2 3 1 experimental nanofiltration set up the cnf experiments were performed with four tubular tio2 inopor nano membranes in series with a total membrane area of 1 m2 and an mwco of 450 da according to the specifications of the supplier the pnf experiments were performed with a spiral wound dow nf270 2540 pnf270 and a dow nf90 2540 pnf90 polyamide thin film composite filmtec membrane both having a membrane area of 2 6 m2 the pnf270 membrane is considered to be a loose nf membrane having an mwco of 400 da while pnf90 membrane is considered to be a tight nf membrane having an mwco of 200 da according to the specifications of the supplier the cnf and pnf membranes were placed in stainless steel membrane housings which were connected to a divergence osmo inspector serving as a control system to set the flow rates and pressures 2 3 2 methods to achieve a high nacl recovery a water recovery of 70 was maintained for all nf experiments a dutchi motors recirculation pump was used for the cnf experiments to maintain an additional cross flow rate of 360 l h 1 the feed flow rate for the cnf experiments was 30 l h 1 and the permeate flow rate was 21 l h 1 corresponding to a flux of 19 l m 2 h 1 for the pnf experiments it was not possible to use an additional recirculation pump in the same set up therefore 50 l of ro brine was pre concentrated by 62 5 by discharging the permeate and recirculating the concentrate to the feed tank subsequently the concentrated ro brine was used as feed for the pnf membranes at a feed flow rate of 250 l h 1 and a permeate flow rate of 50 l h 1 corresponding to a flux of 21 l m 2 h 1 the water recovery of the pre concentration 62 5 of 50 l and the water recovery during the experiment 20 of 18 75 l simulated a total 70 water recovery for the pnf experiments during the nf experiments the permeate and concentrate were recombined in the feed tank manual samples were taken from the feed permeate and concentrate during steady state operation after a stabilisation period of 4 h at steady state the permeate water flux and pressures were stable for at least 1 h the temperature flow rate and pressure of the feed permeate and concentrate were logged by the osmo inspector the ec of the feed was continuously measured in the feed tank while the ec of the permeate and concentrate were continuously measured prior to recombination of these streams in the feed tank 2 4 electrodialysis 2 4 1 experimental electrodialysis set up the ed experiments were conducted using a ten cell pair standard ed stack ed stm consisting of ten pc sa standard anion exchange nine pc sk standard cation exchange and two pc sc cation exchange end membranes in addition a ten cell pair monovalent selective ed stack ed mvm consisting of ten pc mva monovalent selective anion exchange nine pc mvk monovalent selective cation exchange and two pc sc membranes was used both ed stacks were placed in a pc cell ed cell with a pt ir coated titanium anode and a v4a steel cathode having electrode surfaces of 8 8 cm2 the electrodes and membranes were separated by polyethylene silicone spacers which also improved the mixing in the diluate and concentrate channels the spacers had a thickness of 0 5 mm and a void fraction of 59 the electric current was supplied by a delta elektronika direct current supply with an electric potential range of 0 30 v and an electric current range of 0 0 30 a diluate and concentrate solutions were stored in glass bottles and recirculated through the ed cell by a calibrated peristaltic watson marlow 520s pump with 313 pump heads at a flow rate of 5 l h 1 corresponding to a cross sectional velocity of 0 7 cm s 1 ro brine was used as initial diluate while a 6 8 g l 1 nacl solution was used as an initial concentrate to measure the transport of nom and nacl a second watson marlow 520s pump was used to recirculate the electrode rinse solution which was also stored in a glass bottle at a flow rate of 10 l h 1 a 1 m nano3 solution was used as electrode rinse solution all used solutions had an initial volume of 1 l 2 4 2 methods to achieve a high nacl recovery the diluate ec was reduced to 1 ms cm 1 prior to the ed experiments a relationship between the limiting current density lcd and the diluate ec was determined the applied current density during ed should always be below the lcd to avoid the dissociation of water 26 for the determination of this relationship diluted ro brine solutions of 1x 0 8x 0 6x 0 4x 0 2x and 0 1x were prepared while the concentrate consisted of a 6 8 g l 1 nacl solution by stepwise increasing the electric current with 0 05 a per minute and logging the electric potential the lcd for each ro brine dilution was determined according to the empirical method of cowan and brown 27 during the ed experiments an initial current density of 47 a m 2 was applied until the lcd was exceeded the current density was subsequently adjusted according to by the linear r2 0 95 relationship between between the lcd and the diluate ec current density 10 4 ec before and after each ed experiment the samples were taken from the diluate concentrate and electrode rinse solutions and the volumes were measured the ec of the diluate and concentrate was continuously measured in the respective bottles the electric current and electric potential were manually logged throughout the experiments 2 5 ion exchange 2 5 1 experimental ion exchange set up the iex experiments were conducted in a column set up filled with 20 cm lewatit vp oc 1071 strong base anion exchange resin having a bed volume bv of 51 ml the resin consisted of crosslinked polyacrylamide with a quaternary amine function group and an average bead size of 1 4 1 6 mm according to the specifications of the supplier for the iex experiments the resin was in chloride form allowing for exchange of nom with chloride a calibrated peristaltic watson marlow 120s pump was used to pump the ro brine through the iex resin 2 5 2 methods ro brine was fed top down over the iex resin for 600 bv corresponding to a volume of 31 l the flow rate through the resin was 30 bv h 1 to provide a contact time of 2 min as recommended by the supplier the ec of the ro brine was again continuously measured in the feed tank while the ec of the effluent was continuously measured in the effluent prior to discharge the effluent samples were automatically taken to determine the rejection of nom every 60 bv in 7 5 ml glass vials using a biorad 2110 fraction collector and an additional watson marlow 120s pump 2 6 experimental salex set up and methods salex experiments were conducted in column set up with a bv of 51 ml the column was filled with mixed solids and washed with a saturated nacl solution 400 g l 1 to avoid dissolution of the mixed solids in the eluent the mixed solids were washed in a bottom up configuration with one two and three bed volumes of eluent at a bed expansion of 0 25 and 50 after elution the treated solids were dried and weighed to determine the nacl recovery the nom content in the solids was determined by dissolving 5 g l 1 of treated solids in demi water and measuring the toc concentration also the toc concentration of the salex brine was determined to close the mass balance and determine the nom rejection by salex 2 7 performance indicators for the dissolved phase separation technologies nf ed and iex the recovery of

gram of treated solids and the mixed solids respectively in mg g 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of ro brine and mixed solids the tds concentration of the ro brine was 6 9 g l 1 and was for 98 represented by nacl according to the measurements by icp ms the concentration of nom expressed as toc in the ro brine was 35 mg l 1 corresponding to a nom concentration of 5 mg per gram of nacl fig 3 presents the results of the characterisation of nom by lc ocd and shows that 73 of the nom in the ro brine was present as humic acids and 23 was present as lwm neutrals making up the majority of the nom the residual fraction 4 of the nom was present as hydrophobic nom biopolymers and lmw acids the lmw organics were dominated by lmw neutrals based on the ph of the ro brine 8 1 the low fraction of biopolymers is a result of treatment of the activated sludge effluent in the zld water treatment plant by ultrafiltration prior to ro the mixed solids consisted for 97 of nacl and had a nom concentration as toc of 1 3 mg per gram of nacl the nom in the mixed solids also consisted mainly of humic acids 56 and lmw neutrals 32 the differences in concentration of nom per gram of nacl between the ro brine and the mixed solids indicates that evaporation and crystallisation processes in the zld water treatment plant affected the amount of nom per gram of nacl 3 2 separation by nanofiltration 3 2 1 recovery of nacl by nanofiltration fig 4 a presents the rejection of tds from the ro brine by the various nf membranes the pnf90 membrane rejected 89 of the tds while the rejection of tds by the pnf270 and cnf membranes was negligible 1 the difference in tds rejection by the two pnf membranes was a result of the different mwcos of these membranes besides the difference in tds rejection the applied pressure to maintain a flux of 21 l m 2 h 1 was different for the pnf membranes the applied pressure for pnf270 membrane was 10 bar while the applied pressure for pnf90 membrane was 17 bar the higher applied pressure was both a result of the osmotic pressure difference that needed to be overcome and the higher membrane resistance for the more tight pnf90 membrane in terms of tds rejection the cnf membrane performed similarly to the pnf270 membrane while a pressure of only 4 bar was applied to maintain a stable flux indicating that the cnf membrane had a higher water permeability than the pnf270 membrane since a 70 water recovery was applied for all nf experiments the recovery of nacl by pnf270 and cnf was 69 and 68 respectively fig 4b 3 2 2 rejection of nom by nanofiltration the pnf90 membrane rejected uv254a by 83 and toc by 77 respectively fig 5 a b the fraction of nom permeating through the pnf90 membrane consisted probably of lmw organics which made up 25 of the nom and have an mw close to the mwco of the pnf90 membrane the rejection of nom by the pnf270 membrane was only 51 as uv254a and 18 as toc while the cnf membrane had a nom rejection of 47 as uv254a and 19 as toc the rejection of uv254a by the pnf270 and cnf membranes was more than twice as high as the rejection of toc because uv254a is typically absorbed by humic acids 6 the pnf270 and cnf membranes preferentially rejected humic acids from the ro brine which can be explained by the higher mw of humic acids than of lmw organics these findings are in line with the findings of lin et al 11 who found that relatively large mw 990 da organic compounds in dyes are well rejected by nf membranes the results indicate that a fraction of the humic acids still permeated through the pnf270 and cnf membranes as only 18 19 of the toc was rejected and the humic acids made up 73 of the nom in the ro brine 3 3 separation by electrodialysis 3 3 1 recovery of nacl by electrodialysis the rejection of tds by both ed stacks was limited to 11 fig 4a because the ec of the diluate was decreased from 9 to 1 ms cm 1 the water recovery for ed stm and ed mvm was 96 and 98 respectively the loss of recovered water from the diluate was caused by both osmosis and electro osmosis electro osmosis is the transport of water in the hydration shells of transported ions in this case nacl and osmosis is the transport of water from the diluate to the concentrate as a result of an osmotic pressure gradient between the diluate and concentrate 28 because the ion concentration in the diluate decreased and the ion concentration in the concentrate increased throughout the experiments an ion concentration and thus an osmotic pressure gradient established resulting in osmotic water transport from the diluate to the concentrate by taking the water recovery into account the nacl recovery by ed stm and ed mvm was 86 and 87 fig 4b respectively 3 3 2 rejection of nom by electrodialysis fig 5a b shows that ed stm rejected uv254a and toc by 91 and 43 respectively ed mvm rejected uv254a by 98 and toc by 65 the high uv254a rejection suggests that almost no humic acids were transported from the diluate to the concentrate by both ed stacks however the toc rejection of ed stm indicates that more than half of the nom from the ro brine was transported from the diluate to the concentrate this fraction represented nom that does not absorb uv254 and either migrated under the influence of the electric current or diffused from the diluate to the concentrate lmw organics can be transported through iexm due to their low mw 20 while a part of the humic acids probably had an mw that was also low enough to permeate through the iexms the monovalent selective membranes proved to be more selective to nom transport because the rejection of nom as both uv254 and toc were higher than for the standard membranes this can be caused by improved size exclusion or electrostatic repulsion of the iexms in the ed mvm stack compared to the iexms used in the ed stm stack 22 the results show that besides separation of organic matter and salts in dyes 17 ed is also able to separate organic matter as nom from nacl in ro brine at much lower organic matter concentrations compared to dye treatment for both ed stacks the toc mass balance of triplicate experiments did not fit 19 error after visual inspection of the membranes decolouration of the anion exchange membranes was observed for both ed stacks while no noticeable differences were observed on the cation exchange membranes the decolouration of the anion exchange membranes can be related to adsorption of nom indicating that part of the rejection mechanism can be attributed to adsorption of nom on the anion exchange membranes it is expected that the adsorption is reversible as lee et al 18 showed that only 0 1 of the humic acids was irreversibly attached to the anion exchange membranes used in their experiments 3 4 separation by ion exchange 3 4 1 recovery of nacl by ion exchange the rejection of tds from the ro brine by iex was negligible 1 the rejection of nacl is presented in fig 4a for a fresh resin 60 bv and after the treatment of 300 and 600 bvs because the anion exchange resin was already in chloride form no removal of chloride took place the water recovery of iex was 100 because the feed flow was equal to the effluent flow in combination with a negligible tds rejection the nacl recovery of iex was 99 throughout the treatment of 600 bvs of ro brine fig 4b 3 4 2 rejection of nom by ion exchange after the treatment of 60 bvs of ro brine the rejection of nom by iex as uv254a and toc was 84 and 76 fig 4a and b respectively after treatment of 300 bvs of ro brine the rejection of nom decreased to 76 and 72 as uv254a and toc respectively this decrease was caused by saturation of the resin with nom resulting in a lower capacity to exchange nom for chloride finally after 600 bv the rejection of nom as uv254a decreased further to 65 and to 53 as toc indicating that the resin was getting more saturated with nom similar to the rejection of nom by nf and ed the rejection of uv254a by iex was consistently higher than the rejection of toc which is in line with the findings of comstock et al 29 however the differences between the rejection of uv254a and toc by iex were less obvious than for nf and ed the high rejection of nom as toc can be explained by the negative charge of both humic acids and lmw acids the residual fraction of nom that was not removed could be represented by lmw neutrals which are uncharged and made up 23 of the nom in the ro brine uncharged nom is not likely to be removed by iex because removal of nom solely relies on the actual ion exchange mechanism rather than adsorption for the removal of nom 24 during the iex experiments the colour of the resin changed from white to dark brown black which was caused by the adsorption of humic acids the change in colour does not mean that the resin cannot be reused after regeneration but the regeneration of iex resin saturated with humic acids can be challenging 23 3 5 separation of nacl and nom by salex 3 5 1 recovery of nacl by salex the recovery of nacl by salex using one bv of eluent ranged 91 99 for the various bed expansions as presented in fig 6 a for the use of two bvs of eluent the nacl yield ranged 75 96 and for the use of three bvs the nacl yield ranged 52 95 no clear relation between the nacl recovery and bed expansion was found for the various bvs used 3 5 2 rejection of nom by salex the rejection of nom from the mixed solids by salex deviated over the amount of used bvs eluent as can be seen in fig 6b by using one bv of eluent 58 75 of the nom was rejected when more than one bv of eluent was used the rejection of nom increased since for two bvs and three bvs 75 80 and 88 92 of the nom was rejected respectively by using more bvs of eluent more time was available for the nom to dissolve into the eluent and the nom concentration gradient between the mixed solids and the eluent was higher the use of various bed expansions did not result in clear differences in nom rejection for using the same amount of eluent this is because the nom was not present as particulate or suspended solids which could be washed out by expanding the mixed solids the nom was present on the outside of the nacl crystals and dissolved in the eluent and was washed away in the salex brine resulting in white nacl crystals as presented in fig 7 4 conclusions based on the experiments with the various dissolved and solid phase technologies to separate nom and nacl several conclusions can be drawn the pnf90 the tight pnf membrane proved to be unsuitable for the separation of nom and nacl in ro brine because this membrane did not allow permeation of nacl on the other hand the pnf270 loose pnf and cnf membrane allowed nacl to permeate but only had a limited nom rejection for ed the use of a membrane stack with mvm resulted in a higher rejection of nom compared to the use of a membrane stack with stm while both membrane stacks had an equal nacl recovery furthermore full recovery of nacl was achieved by treating the ro brine by iex while the rejection of nom decreased of the amount of volume treated ro brine all dissolved phase technologies preferentially rejected the humic acids part of nom in the ro brine based on the consistently higher rejection of uv254a than the rejection of toc finally salex showed to be able to recover nacl and reject nom by means of washing the mixed solids with a saturated nacl solution as eluent the results showed that it is possible to separate nom and nacl both in ro brine and mixed solids allowing for the generation of reusable solid nacl by means of opening opportunities for reuse of nacl the drawback of having to landfill the generated solid streams in zld applications can be avoided besides the obtained results can potentially be translated to

brines in water treatment the use of membrane technologies in water treatment results in the generation of residual streams a major application of membrane technologies is desalination of brackish and saline feed water by reverse osmosis ro to provide fresh water for production cleaning or cooling processes in industry the generated residual water streams contain the dissolved compounds of the feed stream but in a higher concentration because part of the volume of the feed stream is recovered as fresh water these concentrated residual water streams are called brines and typically have high concentrations of dissolved salts but also contain other dissolved substances 1 2 treatment of brines in the study of pramanik et al 1 various strategies to manage brines are discussed such as deep well injection evaporation ponds and discharge to receiving water bodies however deep well injection and discharge to receiving water bodies could lead to local environmental damage 2 while the use of evaporation ponds requires large surface areas and suitable conditions to allow for evaporation brines could be used more efficiently by means of reclamation of the water the application of zero liquid discharge zld aims at full water recovery from residual waters and becomes interesting in situations with an excess of waste heat and shortages of fresh water sources since the recovery of water from residual waters by thermal technologies is energy intensive and costly 3 a drawback of the application of zld is the generation of solid residual streams because the solids consist of a mixture of substances they are often not suitable for reuse and therefore sent to a landfill 3 by means of separating the substances opportunities for resource recovery emerge 1 3 generation of solids in a zld water treatment plant in a full scale petrochemical industrial water treatment plant the zld strategy is applied to maximise the recovery of water for reuse purposes fig 1 presents the layout of the zld water treatment plant after the removal of most organic substances and suspended solids reusable water is produced by ro the generated concentrate ro brine is finally evaporated resulting in the generation of a solid residual stream consisting of mixed solids these mixed solids consists of sodium chloride nacl crystals with a distinct brown colour fig 7 making the salt not suitable for reuse the colour of the mixed solids is caused by the presence of natural organic matter nom which originate from the activated sludge process the nom in the ro brine is of dissolved nature because it is not rejected by the submerged ultrafiltration prior to the multi stage ro the generated nacl crystals can potentially be reused by separation of the nom and nacl this can both be achieved in the dissolved phase in the ro brine or the solid phase the mixed solids 1 4 natural organic matter in water nom typically refers to a collection of various organic substances and can be divided into various groups 4 by the characterisation of nom by liquid chromatography in combination with organic carbon detection lc ocd method the following groups are generally distinguished biopolymers humic acids and low molecular weight lmw organics 5 the characterisation and classification of nom in water by methods such as lc ocd is key for the selection of technologies for the treatment of the respective water according to the study of huber et al 6 on the nom categorisation by lc ocd of waters with various origins biopolymers are non ionic organic molecules with a molecular weight mw higher than 10 000 da humic acids cover a wide variety of organic molecules which typically have a negative charge an mw ranging 350 1000 da and contain aromatic groups that absorb ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 254 uv254a 4 6 finally lmw organics have an mw lower than 350 da do not absorb uv254 and can be split into two groups uncharged lmw neutrals and anionic lmw acids as a function of the solution ph 5 1 5 dissolved phase separation to separate nom and nacl in the ro brine nanofiltration nf electrodialysis ed and ion exchange iex were considered to be suitable technologies 1 5 1 separation by nanofiltration nf membranes allow permeation of monovalent ions and have shown to effectively reject nom for the production of drinking water and the treatment of sewage effluent for water reclamation purposes 7 8 besides nf has been widely studied and applied to separate organic matter as dye and salt in the textile industry 9 10 however because the concentrations of organic matter in dyes are in the order of grams per litre and the organic matter often consists of a singular compounds which are well defined 9 11 the results of previous studies cannot directly be translated to the separation of nom and nacl in ro brine furthermore the actual rejection of nom depends strongly on the composition of nom the membrane characteristics and the feed solution chemistry schäfer et al 12 showed that the fractions of nom with an mw larger than the mwco molecular weight cut off of the nf membrane are rejected by size exclusion the rejection of lmw organics by nf is more challenging 13 because the mw of lmw organics is close to the mwco of nf membranes the rejection mechanism of lmw organics relies more on electrostatic repulsion and depends on the solution chemistry which determines the charge of the lmw organics 12 besides the use of polymeric nf pnf membranes a new trend in the application of nf is the use of ceramic nf cnf membranes which can be chemically cleaned cnf membranes can be coated with selective layers allowing passage of salt ions and rejection of organics 14 in fact cnf membranes proved to be able to reject nom from pre sieved sewage without any other pre treatment 15 1 5 2 separation by electrodialysis ed is typically used to concentrate and partially desalinate brines but can also be used as a separation technology 16 separation of nom and salt ions can be achieved by ed by means of transport of salt ions and rejection of nom through the ion exchange membranes iexm ed has been used to improve the quality of printing dyes by decreasing the salt concentration 17 however because the concentration of organic matter in the printing dyes was around 200 g l 1 and again singular well characterised organic compounds represented the organic matter also the results from this study cannot directly be translated to the separation of nom and nacl in the ro brine previous research by lee et al 18 showed that synthetic humic acids could be well rejected by the iexm in ed these results were confirmed by kim et al 19 who showed that the rejection of humic acids fraction of nom originating from a river was high while a small fraction of the lmw organics was transported from the diluate to the concentrate in addition zhang et al 20 used ed to separate synthetic lmw organics from salt ions and showed that separation was challenging and depended on the mw and charge of lmw organics because lmw acids are negatively charged and have a relatively low mw they can be transported through the iexm the transport of lmw organics therefore depends strongly on the mw the characteristics of the iexm and the solution chemistry sata et al 21 showed that it is possible to selectively transport anions by using specific anion exchange membranes zhang et al 22 compared standard iexm with selective iexm to separate lwm organics and salt ions and found that the selective iexm had a higher selectivity for transport the salt ions than the standard iexm 1 5 3 separation by ion exchange iex is a widely applied technology to remove nom especially to avoid the formation of disinfection by products after chlorination during the production of drinking water 23 nom rejection by iex relies on the exchange of organic anions with anions attached to the resin which have a lower affinity for the resin than the organic anions 24 no studies that focused on the separation of nom and nacl in ro brine were found 1 6 solid phase separation separation of nom and nacl can also be achieved in the solid phase for example by washing the solid nacl by using a technique called salex which is an acronym for the extraction of impurities from salt this process is used to remove impurities from solid salt by means of washing the salt with a saturated salt solution eluent the impurities dissolve into the eluent and are subsequently washed away while the salt remains in solid phase 25 according to our best knowledge there are no studies available on the separation of nom and salt by this technique 1 7 research objective to our best knowledge there are no studies present that assessed the performance of nf ed and iex to separate nom and nacl in ro brine this study therefore focusses on the separation of nom and nacl by nf ed and iex by assessing both the recovery of nacl and the rejection of nom by the respective technologies we experimentally tested two polymeric nf membranes and one ceramic nf membrane a standard and a monovalent selective ed membrane stack and iex resin in chloride form to separate nom and nacl in the ro brine additionally we experimentally assessed the performance of salex to separate nom and nacl in the mixed solids generated in the zld water treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 ro brine and mixed solids the ro brine experiments were conducted with the actual obtained mixed solids generated by the evaporators in the zld water treatment plant the ro brine was prepared by dissolving the evaporator mixed solids in demi water the experiments with mixed solids were conducted with the actual mixed solids from the zld water treatment plant generated by the crystallisers fig 2 presents a schematic representation of the variously used experimental nf ed iex and salex set ups 2 2 analytical materials to characterise the ro brine and the mixed solids icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and hplc high performance liquid chromatography were used to detect ions such as sodium and chloride in addition the characterisation of nom was performed by lc ocd which makes it possible to distinguish and quantify the presence of various categories of nom the ec electrical conductivity and ph were measured in all experiments using calibrated tetracon 925 ec sensors and ids sentix 940 ph sensors respectively the automatically logged ec data was stored on a wtw multi 3630 ids multi meter uv254a was measured by a thermo scientific evolution 60s uv visible spectrophotometer and 50 mm quartz cuvettes while total organic carbon toc was measured by a shimadzu toc l analyser 2 3 nanofiltration 2 3 1 experimental nanofiltration set up the cnf experiments were performed with four tubular tio2 inopor nano membranes in series with a total membrane area of 1 m2 and an mwco of 450 da according to the specifications of the supplier the pnf experiments were performed with a spiral wound dow nf270 2540 pnf270 and a dow nf90 2540 pnf90 polyamide thin film composite filmtec membrane both having a membrane area of 2 6 m2 the pnf270 membrane is considered to be a loose nf membrane having an mwco of 400 da while pnf90 membrane is considered to be a tight nf membrane having an mwco of 200 da according to the specifications of the supplier the cnf and pnf membranes were placed in stainless steel membrane housings which were connected to a divergence osmo inspector serving as a control system to set the flow rates and pressures 2 3 2 methods to achieve a high nacl recovery a water recovery of 70 was maintained for all nf experiments a dutchi motors recirculation pump was used for the cnf experiments to maintain an additional cross flow rate of 360 l h 1 the feed flow rate for the cnf experiments was 30 l h 1 and the permeate flow rate was 21 l h 1 corresponding to a flux of 19 l m 2 h 1 for the pnf experiments it was not possible to use an additional recirculation pump in the same set up therefore 50 l of ro brine was pre concentrated by 62 5 by discharging the permeate and recirculating the concentrate to the feed tank subsequently the concentrated ro brine was used as feed for the pnf membranes at a feed flow rate of 250 l h 1 and a permeate flow rate of 50 l h 1 corresponding to a flux of 21 l m 2 h 1 the water recovery of the pre concentration 62 5 of 50 l and the water recovery during the experiment 20 of 18 75 l simulated a total 70 water recovery for the pnf experiments during the nf experiments the permeate and concentrate were recombined in the feed tank manual samples were taken from the feed permeate and concentrate during steady state operation after a stabilisation period of 4 h at steady state the permeate water flux and pressures were stable for at least 1 h the temperature flow rate and pressure of the feed permeate and concentrate were logged by the osmo inspector the ec of the feed was continuously measured in the feed tank while the ec of the permeate and concentrate were continuously measured prior to recombination of these streams in the feed tank 2 4 electrodialysis 2 4 1 experimental electrodialysis set up the ed experiments were conducted using a ten cell pair standard ed stack ed stm consisting of ten pc sa standard anion exchange nine pc sk standard cation exchange and two pc sc cation exchange end membranes in addition a ten cell pair monovalent selective ed stack ed mvm consisting of ten pc mva monovalent selective anion exchange nine pc mvk monovalent selective cation exchange and two pc sc membranes was used both ed stacks were placed in a pc cell ed cell with a pt ir coated titanium anode and a v4a steel cathode having electrode surfaces of 8 8 cm2 the electrodes and membranes were separated by polyethylene silicone spacers which also improved the mixing in the diluate and concentrate channels the spacers had a thickness of 0 5 mm and a void fraction of 59 the electric current was supplied by a delta elektronika direct current supply with an electric potential range of 0 30 v and an electric current range of 0 0 30 a diluate and concentrate solutions were stored in glass bottles and recirculated through the ed cell by a calibrated peristaltic watson marlow 520s pump with 313 pump heads at a flow rate of 5 l h 1 corresponding to a cross sectional velocity of 0 7 cm s 1 ro brine was used as initial diluate while a 6 8 g l 1 nacl solution was used as an initial concentrate to measure the transport of nom and nacl a second watson marlow 520s pump was used to recirculate the electrode rinse solution which was also stored in a glass bottle at a flow rate of 10 l h 1 a 1 m nano3 solution was used as electrode rinse solution all used solutions had an initial volume of 1 l 2 4 2 methods to achieve a high nacl recovery the diluate ec was reduced to 1 ms cm 1 prior to the ed experiments a relationship between the limiting current density lcd and the diluate ec was determined the applied current density during ed should always be below the lcd to avoid the dissociation of water 26 for the determination of this relationship diluted ro brine solutions of 1x 0 8x 0 6x 0 4x 0 2x and 0 1x were prepared while the concentrate consisted of a 6 8 g l 1 nacl solution by stepwise increasing the electric current with 0 05 a per minute and logging the electric potential the lcd for each ro brine dilution was determined according to the empirical method of cowan and brown 27 during the ed experiments an initial current density of 47 a m 2 was applied until the lcd was exceeded the current density was subsequently adjusted according to by the linear r2 0 95 relationship between between the lcd and the diluate ec current density 10 4 ec before and after each ed experiment the samples were taken from the diluate concentrate and electrode rinse solutions and the volumes were measured the ec of the diluate and concentrate was continuously measured in the respective bottles the electric current and electric potential were manually logged throughout the experiments 2 5 ion exchange 2 5 1 experimental ion exchange set up the iex experiments were conducted in a column set up filled with 20 cm lewatit vp oc 1071 strong base anion exchange resin having a bed volume bv of 51 ml the resin consisted of crosslinked polyacrylamide with a quaternary amine function group and an average bead size of 1 4 1 6 mm according to the specifications of the supplier for the iex experiments the resin was in chloride form allowing for exchange of nom with chloride a calibrated peristaltic watson marlow 120s pump was used to pump the ro brine through the iex resin 2 5 2 methods ro brine was fed top down over the iex resin for 600 bv corresponding to a volume of 31 l the flow rate through the resin was 30 bv h 1 to provide a contact time of 2 min as recommended by the supplier the ec of the ro brine was again continuously measured in the feed tank while the ec of the effluent was continuously measured in the effluent prior to discharge the effluent samples were automatically taken to determine the rejection of nom every 60 bv in 7 5 ml glass vials using a biorad 2110 fraction collector and an additional watson marlow 120s pump 2 6 experimental salex set up and methods salex experiments were conducted in column set up with a bv of 51 ml the column was filled with mixed solids and washed with a saturated nacl solution 400 g l 1 to avoid dissolution of the mixed solids in the eluent the mixed solids were washed in a bottom up configuration with one two and three bed volumes of eluent at a bed expansion of 0 25 and 50 after elution the treated solids were dried and weighed to determine the nacl recovery the nom content in the solids was determined by dissolving 5 g l 1 of treated solids in demi water and measuring the toc concentration also the toc concentration of the salex brine was determined to close the mass balance and determine the nom rejection by salex 2 7 performance indicators for the dissolved phase separation technologies nf ed and iex the recovery of nacl eq 1 was determined by using the water recovery and the rejection of tds 1 y n a c l i y h 2 o i 1 r t d s i where ynacl i recovery of sodium chloride unitless yh2o i water recovery unitless and rtds i rejection of tds by nanofiltration electrodialysis and ion exchange the nacl recovery eq 2 and the rejection of nom eq 3 by salex were determined by using the nacl masses and the measured toc

gram of treated solids and the mixed solids respectively in mg g 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of ro brine and mixed solids the tds concentration of the ro brine was 6 9 g l 1 and was for 98 represented by nacl according to the measurements by icp ms the concentration of nom expressed as toc in the ro brine was 35 mg l 1 corresponding to a nom concentration of 5 mg per gram of nacl fig 3 presents the results of the characterisation of nom by lc ocd and shows that 73 of the nom in the ro brine was present as humic acids and 23 was present as lwm neutrals making up the majority of the nom the residual fraction 4 of the nom was present as hydrophobic nom biopolymers and lmw acids the lmw organics were dominated by lmw neutrals based on the ph of the ro brine 8 1 the low fraction of biopolymers is a result of treatment of the activated sludge effluent in the zld water treatment plant by ultrafiltration prior to ro the mixed solids consisted for 97 of nacl and had a nom concentration as toc of 1 3 mg per gram of nacl the nom in the mixed solids also consisted mainly of humic acids 56 and lmw neutrals 32 the differences in concentration of nom per gram of nacl between the ro brine and the mixed solids indicates that evaporation and crystallisation processes in the zld water treatment plant affected the amount of nom per gram of nacl 3 2 separation by nanofiltration 3 2 1 recovery of nacl by nanofiltration fig 4 a presents the rejection of tds from the ro brine by the various nf membranes the pnf90 membrane rejected 89 of the tds while the rejection of tds by the pnf270 and cnf membranes was negligible 1 the difference in tds rejection by the two pnf membranes was a result of the different mwcos of these membranes besides the difference in tds rejection the applied pressure to maintain a flux of 21 l m 2 h 1 was different for the pnf membranes the applied pressure for pnf270 membrane was 10 bar while the applied pressure for pnf90 membrane was 17 bar the higher applied pressure was both a result of the osmotic pressure difference that needed to be overcome and the higher membrane resistance for the more tight pnf90 membrane in terms of tds rejection the cnf membrane performed similarly to the pnf270 membrane while a pressure of only 4 bar was applied to maintain a stable flux indicating that the cnf membrane had a higher water permeability than the pnf270 membrane since a 70 water recovery was applied for all nf experiments the recovery of nacl by pnf270 and cnf was 69 and 68 respectively fig 4b 3 2 2 rejection of nom by nanofiltration the pnf90 membrane rejected uv254a by 83 and toc by 77 respectively fig 5 a b the fraction of nom permeating through the pnf90 membrane consisted probably of lmw organics which made up 25 of the nom and have an mw close to the mwco of the pnf90 membrane the rejection of nom by the pnf270 membrane was only 51 as uv254a and 18 as toc while the cnf membrane had a nom rejection of 47 as uv254a and 19 as toc the rejection of uv254a by the pnf270 and cnf membranes was more than twice as high as the rejection of toc because uv254a is typically absorbed by humic acids 6 the pnf270 and cnf membranes preferentially rejected humic acids from the ro brine which can be explained by the higher mw of humic acids than of lmw organics these findings are in line with the findings of lin et al 11 who found that relatively large mw 990 da organic compounds in dyes are well rejected by nf membranes the results indicate that a fraction of the humic acids still permeated through the pnf270 and cnf membranes as only 18 19 of the toc was rejected and the humic acids made up 73 of the nom in the ro brine 3 3 separation by electrodialysis 3 3 1 recovery of nacl by electrodialysis the rejection of tds by both ed stacks was limited to 11 fig 4a because the ec of the diluate was decreased from 9 to 1 ms cm 1 the water recovery for ed stm and ed mvm was 96 and 98 respectively the loss of recovered water from the diluate was caused by both osmosis and electro osmosis electro osmosis is the transport of water in the hydration shells of transported ions in this case nacl and osmosis is the transport of water from the diluate to the concentrate as a result of an osmotic pressure gradient between the diluate and concentrate 28 because the ion concentration in the diluate decreased and the ion concentration in the concentrate increased throughout the experiments an ion concentration and thus an osmotic pressure gradient established resulting in osmotic water transport from the diluate to the concentrate by taking the water recovery into account the nacl recovery by ed stm and ed mvm was 86 and 87 fig 4b respectively 3 3 2 rejection of nom by electrodialysis fig 5a b shows that ed stm rejected uv254a and toc by 91 and 43 respectively ed mvm rejected uv254a by 98 and toc by 65 the high uv254a rejection suggests that almost no humic acids were transported from the diluate to the concentrate by both ed stacks however the toc rejection of ed stm indicates that more than half of the nom from the ro brine was transported from the diluate to the concentrate this fraction represented nom that does not absorb uv254 and either migrated under the influence of the electric current or diffused from the diluate to the concentrate lmw organics can be transported through iexm due to their low mw 20 while a part of the humic acids probably had an mw that was also low enough to permeate through the iexms the monovalent selective membranes proved to be more selective to nom transport because the rejection of nom as both uv254 and toc were higher than for the standard membranes this can be caused by improved size exclusion or electrostatic repulsion of the iexms in the ed mvm stack compared to the iexms used in the ed stm stack 22 the results show that besides separation of organic matter and salts in dyes 17 ed is also able to separate organic matter as nom from nacl in ro brine at much lower organic matter concentrations compared to dye treatment for both ed stacks the toc mass balance of triplicate experiments did not fit 19 error after visual inspection of the membranes decolouration of the anion exchange membranes was observed for both ed stacks while no noticeable differences were observed on the cation exchange membranes the decolouration of the anion exchange membranes can be related to adsorption of nom indicating that part of the rejection mechanism can be attributed to adsorption of nom on the anion exchange membranes it is expected that the adsorption is reversible as lee et al 18 showed that only 0 1 of the humic acids was irreversibly attached to the anion exchange membranes used in their experiments 3 4 separation by ion exchange 3 4 1 recovery of nacl by ion exchange the rejection of tds from the ro brine by iex was negligible 1 the rejection of nacl is presented in fig 4a for a fresh resin 60 bv and after the treatment of 300 and 600 bvs because the anion exchange resin was already in chloride form no removal of chloride took place the water recovery of iex was 100 because the feed flow was equal to the effluent flow in combination with a negligible tds rejection the nacl recovery of iex was 99 throughout the treatment of 600 bvs of ro brine fig 4b 3 4 2 rejection of nom by ion exchange after the treatment of 60 bvs of ro brine the rejection of nom by iex as uv254a and toc was 84 and 76 fig 4a and b respectively after treatment of 300 bvs of ro brine the rejection of nom decreased to 76 and 72 as uv254a and toc respectively this decrease was caused by saturation of the resin with nom resulting in a lower capacity to exchange nom for chloride finally after 600 bv the rejection of nom as uv254a decreased further to 65 and to 53 as toc indicating that the resin was getting more saturated with nom similar to the rejection of nom by nf and ed the rejection of uv254a by iex was consistently higher than the rejection of toc which is in line with the findings of comstock et al 29 however the differences between the rejection of uv254a and toc by iex were less obvious than for nf and ed the high rejection of nom as toc can be explained by the negative charge of both humic acids and lmw acids the residual fraction of nom that was not removed could be represented by lmw neutrals which are uncharged and made up 23 of the nom in the ro brine uncharged nom is not likely to be removed by iex because removal of nom solely relies on the actual ion exchange mechanism rather than adsorption for the removal of nom 24 during the iex experiments the colour of the resin changed from white to dark brown black which was caused by the adsorption of humic acids the change in colour does not mean that the resin cannot be reused after regeneration but the regeneration of iex resin saturated with humic acids can be challenging 23 3 5 separation of nacl and nom by salex 3 5 1 recovery of nacl by salex the recovery of nacl by salex using one bv of eluent ranged 91 99 for the various bed expansions as presented in fig 6 a for the use of two bvs of eluent the nacl yield ranged 75 96 and for the use of three bvs the nacl yield ranged 52 95 no clear relation between the nacl recovery and bed expansion was found for the various bvs used 3 5 2 rejection of nom by salex the rejection of nom from the mixed solids by salex deviated over the amount of used bvs eluent as can be seen in fig 6b by using one bv of eluent 58 75 of the nom was rejected when more than one bv of eluent was used the rejection of nom increased since for two bvs and three bvs 75 80 and 88 92 of the nom was rejected respectively by using more bvs of eluent more time was available for the nom to dissolve into the eluent and the nom concentration gradient between the mixed solids and the eluent was higher the use of various bed expansions did not result in clear differences in nom rejection for using the same amount of eluent this is because the nom was not present as particulate or suspended solids which could be washed out by expanding the mixed solids the nom was present on the outside of the nacl crystals and dissolved in the eluent and was washed away in the salex brine resulting in white nacl crystals as presented in fig 7 4 conclusions based on the experiments with the various dissolved and solid phase technologies to separate nom and nacl several conclusions can be drawn the pnf90 the tight pnf membrane proved to be unsuitable for the separation of nom and nacl in ro brine because this membrane did not allow permeation of nacl on the other hand the pnf270 loose pnf and cnf membrane allowed nacl to permeate but only had a limited nom rejection for ed the use of a membrane stack with mvm resulted in a higher rejection of nom compared to the use of a membrane stack with stm while both membrane stacks had an equal nacl recovery furthermore full recovery of nacl was achieved by treating the ro brine by iex while the rejection of nom decreased of the amount of volume treated ro brine all dissolved phase technologies preferentially rejected the humic acids part of nom in the ro brine based on the consistently higher rejection of uv254a than the rejection of toc finally salex showed to be able to recover nacl and reject nom by means of washing the mixed solids with a saturated nacl solution as eluent the results showed that it is possible to separate nom and nacl both in ro brine and mixed solids allowing for the generation of reusable solid nacl by means of opening opportunities for reuse of nacl the drawback of having to landfill the generated solid streams in zld applications can be avoided besides the obtained results can potentially be translated to the separation of organic matter and salts in textile and printing industry when concentrations of organic matter in the order of mg l 1 are present declaration of competing interestcoi the authors

8803,process stability and limitations of loading capacity of anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs and continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs for the treatment of was and a lipid rich flotation sludge from the dairy industry were investigated in pilot scale the digesters were operated with increasing shares of lipids up to 85 at low sludge retention times srt down to 10 days high shares of lipids are favorable for treating wastewater sludges from industrial wwtps on site instead of their disposal but often lead to long chain fatty acid lcfa accumulations and digester failures in this study high cod removals were obtained in all digesters resulting in methane yields over 250 l kg codin methane production and cod removal followed substrate first order kinetics high lipid shares of codlipid 80 did not inhibit cod degradation process stability was determined based on the ratio of specific methanogenic activity and mean acetate conversion in the digesters process stability depended mainly on srt and lipid shares in the substrate as both parameters affected the degradable lipid content in the anaerobic sludge shorter srts and higher shares of lipids in particular reduced process stability as observed by inhibitions of acetoclastic methanogenesis the olr was not a decisive factor when treating cod shares of lipids higher than 80 srt should exceed 15 d cod shares of lipids below 80 were also successfully treated at srt of 10 d residual degradable lipid content of anaerobic sludge negatively influenced process stability starting from 50 mg lipid g ts the performance of an anmbr in terms of cod degradation and process stability corresponds to a cstr with equal srt but can be operated with higher olrs at equal hrt compared to a cstr the anmbr offers a higher process stability by extending the srt keywords anaerobic digestion co digestion anmbr flotation sludge lipids dairy industry methanogenic activity 1 introduction highly loaded wastewater from the dairy industry cod 1 000 mg l can preferably be treated by activated sludge processes in combination with flotation and anaerobic pre treatment such as expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactors for reduction of energy costs 5 concerning sludge management the highly energetic flotation sludge and the waste activated sludge was of the aerobic post treatment are generally disposed of as co substrates to municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp or biogas plants anaerobic treatment of these energy rich substrates in digesters on site combined with a combined heat and power unit chp would offer major benefits such as the reduction of disposed sludge volumes an increase of methane generation up to 50 and an increase of overall energy efficiency in case of integration of waste heat usage of chp units in industrial production however operation of anaerobic co digestion with major shares of flotation sludge over 80 cod which consists notably of lipids is challenging successful examples of lipid fed digestions have been reported using various lipid rich substrates 8 9 15 as well as inhibitions related to lipids 15 18 29 inhibition is mostly related to accumulation of long chain fatty acids lcfa which are an intermediate product of anaerobic lipid degradation angelidaki and ahring 2 reported threshold concentrations for oleate as 0 2 g l and stearate as 0 5 g l new

activity srt is not commonly used as a design parameter for digesters fed with lipid rich substrates studies on flotation sludge of the dairy industry and co fermentation with was operated at different srt are absent in the literature anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs are used to decouple hydraulic and sludge retention time compared to conventional fill and draw cstrs this offers the opportunity to extend degradation by increasing srt or keeping an applicable sludge load at similar srt but reduced reactor volumes at this writing only a few studies have been published that apply anmbr for mesophilic anaerobic digestion of particulate substrates 7 17 20 assessment of research data shows inconsistent results concerning achieved methane yields in comparison to conventional cstrs while pileggi parker 20 and dagnew et al 7 observed small increases of vs removal and higher methane yields compared to a cstr at equal srt romero flores et al 22 cobbledick et al 6 and lutze et al 14 achieved similar methane yields when feeding sewage sludges xiao et al 27 observed higher olr and higher degradation rates in anmbrs fed with lipid rich kitchen slurry and related this result to a positive effect on enzymatic hydrolysis activity this study deals with the feasibility of anaerobic co digestion of was and flotation sludge from the dairy industry with cod shares of lipids up to 85 the influence of srt and shares of flotation sludge on methane yield process stability and inhibition on acetoclastic methanogenic activity are determined conventional cstrs and an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr were operated with hrt and srt below common design recommendations under mesophilic conditions to investigate limitations of the loading capacity of anaerobic digesters rather than maximizing methane yields as the introduction of additional solids can reduce the inhibition the question arises if the joint digestion of flotation sludge with high shares of lipids and was with considerable amounts of non degradable solids results in significantly lower inhibiting effects and successful operation with higher sludge loads finally design criteria and potentials of anmbr for overcoming lipid related limitations are elaborated 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate sludge characteristics was from a wwtp with 40 000 pe and flotation sludge originated from ice cream production

this reactor but without decoupling of hrt and srt cstr operations with srt 20 d were conducted in a separate digester with a volume of 1 0 m³ anmbr and cstr were fed with prepared mixtures of was and flotation sludge from a common buffer tank 2 3 experimental procedures the cstrs and the anmbr were inoculated with digested sludge from a full scale digester of a municipal wwtp mesophilic conditions

gas sensor gmbh germany and gas volumes type mgc 1 pmma dr ing ritter apparatebau gmbh co kg germany were also analysed continuously calculation of the initial substrate to inoculum ratio and evaluation of kinetic constants were carried out according to angelidaki et al 3 hydrolysis was assumed to be the rate limiting step in degradation of flotation sludge whereas disintegration was considered to be rate limiting for was digestion specific methanogenic activities sma in g cod kg vs d of acetoclastic methanogens were measured with the mentioned laboratory equipment for bmp tests 300 ml inoculum samples were placed in 1 000 ml bottles flushed with pure nitrogen and fed with 1 g l of acetic acid glacial 100 anhydrous for analysis cas no 64 19 7 merck ag germany after preparation all bottles were closed immediately and heated to a temperature of 37 c sma tests were conducted in triplicates at least and completed after 24 h for evaluation of sma the maximum slope of the curve accumulative methane production versus time during an interval of 1 h was used 2 5 definition of process stability process stability is determined by an approach using a safety factor according to siegrist et al 23 the safety factor sf is defined as follows 1 sf maximum acetate conversion average acetate conversion μ max 1 srt k d with μmax maximum growth rate of acetoclastic methanogens d 1 kd decay rate of acetoclastic methanogens d 1 contrary to siegrist et al 23 maximum acetate conversion was not determined as a result of intermittent feeding in continuously operated reactors but using specific methanogenic activities from batch tests instead the determination of sf was carried out comprising sma and mean mass flow of degraded cod to methane ch4 cod kg cod d of the last two sludge retention times for this purpose only shares of cod that are degraded via acetate must be taken into account according to adm1 around 65 70 of degradable cod of lipids is degraded via acetate 4 this is implemented in the determination of sf by a factor n as follows 2 sf sma m vs reactor n ch 4 cod kg cod 1 000 g cod with mvs mass of volatile solids in the reactor kg vs n average cod conversion of lipids via acetate 0 65 0 7 values greater than 1 0 imply that hydrolysis disintegration remains the rate limiting step and provides some reliability against substrate overloads or accumulation of inhibiting intermediates such as lcfa assuming identical microbiological population without significant inhibition the safety factor does not change with increasing olr but depends on srt growth reducing effects and inhibiting influences on methanogenic activity lead to a reduction of the measured sma and thus to a reduction of sf the higher the value of sf the more resistant the reactor against substrate overloads or fluctuating feed conditions is thus the anaerobic process is more stable as well further potential maximum lcfa concentration were estimated by calculating the residual degradable lipids in the anaerobic sludge in order to evaluate effects on process stability as follows 3 c res deg li c li fs q fs q total η max fs 1 k hyd fs srt 1 k hyd fs

potential batch tests in lab scale results of bmp tests are summarized in table 2 based on bmp tests organic matter of the flotation sludge was almost completely degradable 0 9 g cod ch4 g codin corresponding to high methane yields of 320 l kg codin digestion of organic matter of was only achieved methane yields around 154 l kg codin degradation rates of organic matter of the flotation sludge are much faster compared to the degradation of was which leads to a higher kinetic constant kdis for substrate first order kinetics 3 2 operational performance of continuous digestion tests in pilot scale table 3 summarizes operational performances in steady state in terms of effluent quality methane yields and applied sludge loading rates of continuous digestion tests in pilot scale increasing shares of flotation sludge were successfully degraded in all reactors at srt down to 10 days in cstrs highest methane yields up to 280 l kg codin were achieved at cod shares of lipids over 80 and srt 20 d at similar cod shares of lipids slightly lower methane yields were obtained with applied srt 10 d compared to 20 d see table 3 and fig 2 b the anmbr operated at hrt 10 and srt 15 d achieved methane yields higher than 280 l kg codin at cod shares of lipids around 85 during the entire operational period methane yields in relation to degraded cod always ranged between 320 and 350 l kg coddeg in all reactors resulting in a cod based gap of mass balance less than 10 this indicates that lipids were available for anaerobic degradation and did not accumulate on the liquid surface in the digester 24 as expected total solids and volatile solids concentration are higher in the anmbr than in the cstrs while their ratio is similar the organic acid concentrations in the reactor remained below 1 000 mg l in all operational settings the ph value remained between 7 2 and 7 7 in all settings 4 discussion 4 1 influence of substrate mixture and srt on methane generation from the data of bmp batch assays expected methane yields can be calculated for continuously fed digesters operated as cstrs following substrate first order kinetics with hydrolysis disintegration as rate determining step as follows 4 y ch 4 srt k dis srt 1 k dis srt y m a x if the substrate degradation of the individual substrates does not significantly influence each other in the substrate mixture the methane yield of the substrate mixture could theoretically be determined from the sum of the degradation kinetics of the individual substrates under consideration of cod related shares of each substrate in the mixture the methane yield can be calculated using their kinetic constants from batch assays as follows 5 y ch 4 substrate mixture cod fs cod total k hyd fs srt 1 k hyd fs y ch 4 max fs cod was cod total k dis was srt 1 k dis was srt y ch 4 max was l ch 4 kg cod in measured values of the continuously fed pilot plants operated at srt 15 d and varying substrate mixture are compared with calculated values from batch assays in fig 2a measured values of the continuously fed pilot plants operated with cod related shares of flotation sludge 0 8 and srt between 10 and 20 days are compared with calculated values from batch assays in fig 2b measured methane yields of continuously fed pilot plants table 3 meet theoretical methane yields fig 2a b that were calculated with equation 5 and based on kinetic constants from batch assays methane generation from co digestion of was and flotation sludge consequently follows a substrate first order kinetic according to batstone et al 4 in continuously fed digesters even at the highest shares of flotation sludge based on cod no decrease in methane yields was observed based on cod removal significant inhibition of anaerobic degradation could therefore not be detected furthermore present results show that easily degradable organic matter flotation sludge did not limit degradation of slowly degradable organic matter waste activated sludge as would be the case with diauxy the anmbr achieved similar methane yields compared to the cstr operated at srt 15 d fig 2a small differences were mainly based on minor deviation in cod share of lipids in the substrate mixture this is not in agreement with the findings of xiao et al 27 who observed a positive effect on enzymatic hydrolysis activity in anmbrs fed with lipid rich kitchen slurry results are however in agreement with lutze et al 14 who also observed a substrate first order kinetic in both systems fed with was resulting in similar methane yields at equal srt 4 2 influence of substrate mixture and srt on process stability the concentration of volatile organic acids is an accepted criterion for stable operation of digesters as values up to 500 mg hac l are used for process control 11 in sludge treatment low concentrations of organic acids indicate that acetoclastic methanogenesis does not determine degradation rate and events of substrate overloading are unlikely present results show that vfa concentrations were mostly below 500 mg l but increased with shorter srt at even cod shares of the flotation sludge lipids see fig 2b and table 3 vfa concentrations also increased at higher cod shares of the flotation sludge lipids at even srt see fig 2a and table 3 results obtained from sma tests show that safety factor sf according to siegrist et al 23 see formula 1 2 remained above 1 0 fig 3 process stability against substrate overload or accumulation of inhibiting intermediates such as lcfa was sufficient sf values greater than 1 0 also correspond to low organic acid concentrations below 1 000 mg l two factors predominantly affected sf srt and cod share of lipids in influent substrate lower srts reduced safety against substrate overload in anaerobic digesters fed with cod shares of flotation sludge 0 8 cod shares of lipids 0 8 in the substrate see table 2 the safety factor dropped from sf 2 5 to sf 1 5 when srt was reduced from srt 20 d to srt 10 d this is in agreement with the definition of sf as sf depends on srt the maximum growth rate of acetoclastic methanogens and their decay rate see formula 1 calculated safety factors from dereli et al 8 and szabo corbacho et al 24 show a similar behaviour when srt is reduced from 30 to 20 days ziels et al 28 also observed a dependence of methanogenic activity on sludge retention time in digesters fed with fog safety against substrate overloads also decreased in reactors fed with increasing cod shares of lipid rich flotation sludge fig 3 in cstrs operated with srt 10 d an increasing share of flotation sludge and corresponding lipids decreased sf from sf 3 at codfs codtotal 0 4 to sf 1 5 at codfs codtotal 0 8 similar results were detected for digesters operated with srt 15 d and srt 20 d this is not in agreement with the definition of sf as sf was assumed to be independent of substrate composition and degradation behaviour in operation this reduced safety has to be taken into account by lowering variations of inflow characteristics especially cod loads as substrate overloads might occur otherwise when the original definition of sf is considered a decrease of sf with increasing cod related shares of flotation sludge indicates a reduction of growth rate of acetoclastic bacteria according to siegrist et al 23 growth rate μmax and decay rate kd can be read when plotting 1 sf versus 1 srt see fig 4 in this study maximum growth rate could not be determined because optimum conditions were not provided in the digesters instead apparent growth rate μapp may be determined from the data that includes possible inhibition or other effects with low shares of flotation sludge in the feed mixture the apparent growth rate ranged around 0 49 d 1 obtained values are similar to reported maximum growth rates under optimum conditions elsewhere e g refs 4 23 minor inhibitions can therefore be assumed when feeding low shares of lipids however in digesters fed with cod shares of lipids higher than 80 the apparent growth rate dropped noticeably to values below 0 16 d 1 reduced apparent growth rates illustrate inhibiting influences on methanogens as ammonium concentrations 1 000 mg l and concentrations of h2s 1 in the biogas as most common inhibitors of digestion processes were far below critical values 13 lipids and their hydrolysis products lcfa most likely inhibited the growth rate measured safety factors sf may be compared with calculated safety factors sf0 from non or at least low inhibiting operation phases using formula 1 with a growth rate of 0 49 d 1 and a decay rate of 0 1 d 1 as found in reactors at codfs codtotal 0 5 see fig 5 a dependence on degradable lipid content of the anaerobic sludge is obvious up to degradable lipid concentration in the anaerobic sludge around 50 mg vs gts ratio sf sf0 remained almost constant with an increased content of degradable lipids to approx 150 mg vs gts the safety against substrate overload was decreased by 60 80 which corresponds to an inhibition on acetoclastic methanogens of 20 40 szabo corbacho et al 24 observed similar values with inhibitions around 26 46 at lcfa concentrations of 120 150 mg lipid g tss in the anaerobic sludge when treating whole milk as synthetic dairy wastewater in anaerobic digesters hwu et al 12 reported higher losses of methanogenic activity of 50 at oleate concentration of 32 mg g tss comparable stability losses within this study were reached at degradable lipid contents of the anaerobic sludge above 200 mg vs g ts although anaerobic digestion performed well at degradable lipid concentration in the anaerobic sludge up to 150 mg vs gts with respect to organic acid concentrations and cod removal table 3 process stability against substrate overloads was already reduced at much lower concentrations consequently operational fluctuations in feed will become a major concern as substrate accumulation may occur sf can represent microbiological causes for emerging process instabilities even before effects on general parameters such as increasing concentration of organic acids lowering of ph or reduced methane yield are observed this is related to the general characteristics of the anaerobic sludge digestion process as a multiple step process with a slow step first hydrolysis disintegration and a second slow step last methanogenesis 4 11 in case of inhibition on methanogens for example based on substrate overloading sma would be reduced first which will also be expressed by lower safety factors 4 3 design considerations when vfa 500 mg hac l is considered as a limit for stable operation cstrs could be operated with a maximum olrcod deg 8 3 kg cod m³ d corresponding to olrfs 2 7 kg vs m³ d at srt 15 d similar maximum tolerable olr of olrcod deg 7 7 kg cod m³ d corresponding to olrfs 2 5 kg vs m³ d were achieved in cstr operated with srt 11 d using an anmbr with hrt 10 d and srt 15 d organic loading rates of 11 2 kg coddeg m³ d or 3 8 kg vsfs m³ d did not lead to process instabilities these loading rates exceed recommendations of dwa m 368 2014 10 or mata alvarez et al 15 and are in the range of dereli et al 8 szabo corbacho et al 24 successfully operated anmbrs with olr of 4 7 kg cod m³ d using milk wastewater as substrate a uniform maximum olr limit as a design criterion for both systems cstr and anmbr cannot be specified as given in table 3 and fig 2a the cstr operated with srt 10 d was not stable at olr around 10 kg coddeg m³ d when following the criterion of vfa 500 mg l while the anmbr proved to be reliable at olr above 10 kg coddeg m³ d although not critical increases of vfa were observed at olrs above 6 0 kg coddeg m³ d in all reactors this olr is also well above common recommendations in this study specific lipid loading rates up to 0 18 kg lipid kg vs d left vfa concentrations nearly unaffected table 3 literature data suggests 0 04 0 13 kg lipid kg vs d at vs ts 0 9 8 24 higher values seem to be achieved in this study as the reactors were operated with lower vs ts ratios around 0 7 which is related to inorganic contents of the was dereli et al 8 and szabo corbacho et al 24 used substrates with less non degradable or inorganic matter the results of this study and other publications i e 24 28 show that the residual lipid content of the anaerobic sludge exerts a major influence on process stability the sludge retention time and the lipid share in the substrate mainly affect the lipid content of the anaerobic sludge and should be included in a generally valid design criterion in this study a minimum sludge retention time of 15 days is required in case of cod shares of lipids of codli codtotal 0 8 for keeping degradable lipid concentration in the anaerobic sludge below 150 mg vs g ts organic acid concentration below 500 mg l and inhibition on methanogens below 50 cod shares of lipids less than 80 require a minimum sludge retention time above 10 days meeting previous mentioned requirements in both cases inflow variations should be limited for preventing accumulation of lcfa or vfa as safety factors of the anaerobic process are already reduced for keeping minimum inhibition and maximum process stability either cod shares of lipids must be limited to 50 in digesters operated with srt below 15 d or sludge retention times must be well above 20 d in digesters fed with cod shares of lipids higher than 80 as a general design criterion the maximum degradable lipid content in the anaerobic sludge might be promising as it considers all relevant parameters of lipid rich digestion and may be calculated from the data of substrate characteristics table 1 and degradation kinetics table 2 degradable lipid content determines potential maximum lcfa concentrations in anaerobic sludge as residual degradable lipid matter might potentially be converted to lcfa in the reactor as a limit value a content around 50 100 mg lipid g ts seems reasonable 4 4 comparison of anmbr and cstr results of this study allow the following conclusions regarding the comparison of process performance of cstr and anmbr srtanmbr srtcstr at comparable srt methane yield and process stability based on the safety factor and the concentration of organic acids in anmbrs largely correspond to results of cstrs however these values are achieved in anmbrs at organic loading rates which are increased by the decoupling factor srt hrt the required digester volume of anmbrs for achieving a similar degree of degradation while maintaining a defined process stability is reduced by the decoupling ratio additional investigations on the transient state the first srt after the change of olr at a comparable level between cstr and anmbr also show that in these transitions the anmbr remains significantly more stable with lower concentrations of organic acids see fig 6 hrtanmbr hrtcstr comparing cstr and anmbr at equal hrt process stability and methane yield can increase significantly because srt determines degree of degradation and process stability benefits of anmbr must be balanced with the economic drawbacks of adding membranes as a separation unit especially higher capex and opex as given in lutze et al 14 5 conclusions co digestion of was and flotation sludge from the dairy industry with cod shares of lipids higher than 80 in the mixture was successfully operated in an anmbr and cstrs at srts between 10 and 20 days biogas production and cod removal followed substrate first order kinetics ratio of specific acetoclastic methanogenic activity and mean acetate conversion in the digester is very well suited to detecting emerging process instabilities consequently regular monitoring of sma during the operation of high solid digestions with industrial readily degradable substrates is recommended process stability depended mainly on srt and lipid share in the substrate as both affect degradable lipid concentration in the anaerobic sludge the digestion process remained stable up to 150 mg lipid g ts although inhibition on acetoclastic methanogens started at 50 mg lipid g ts in case of the co digestion of lipid rich flotation sludge and was with cod shares of lipids higher than 0 8 g codli g cod in the mixture a minimum srt of 15 days was required cod shares of lipids below 0 8 g codli g cod were also successfully treated at srt of 10 d as an addition to common design criteria based on olr maximum degradable lipid content in the anaerobic sludge is promising as it considers relevant parameters of lipid rich sludge digestion and may be calculated from the data of substrate characteristics and degradation kinetics performance of anmbr in terms of cod degradation and process stability corresponds to cstr with similar srt but can be operated with higher olrs at similar hrt compared to a cstr anmbr offers a higher process stability by extending srt acknowledgements the german federal ministry of

8803,process stability and limitations of loading capacity of anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs and continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs for the treatment of was and a lipid rich flotation sludge from the dairy industry were investigated in pilot scale the digesters were operated with increasing shares of lipids up to 85 at low sludge retention times srt down to 10 days high shares of lipids are favorable for treating wastewater sludges from industrial wwtps on site instead of their disposal but often lead to long chain fatty acid lcfa accumulations and digester failures in this study high cod removals were obtained in all digesters resulting in methane yields over 250 l kg codin methane production and cod removal followed substrate first order kinetics high lipid shares of codlipid 80 did not inhibit cod degradation process stability was determined based on the ratio of specific methanogenic activity and mean acetate conversion in the digesters process stability depended mainly on srt and lipid shares in the substrate as both parameters affected the degradable lipid content in the anaerobic sludge shorter srts and higher shares of lipids in particular reduced process stability as observed by inhibitions of acetoclastic methanogenesis the olr was not a decisive factor when treating cod shares of lipids higher than 80 srt should exceed 15 d cod shares of lipids below 80 were also successfully treated at srt of 10 d residual degradable lipid content of anaerobic sludge negatively influenced process stability starting from 50 mg lipid g ts the performance of an anmbr in terms of cod degradation and process stability corresponds to a cstr with equal srt but can be operated with higher olrs at equal hrt compared to a cstr the anmbr offers a higher process stability by extending the srt keywords anaerobic digestion co digestion anmbr flotation sludge lipids dairy industry methanogenic activity 1 introduction highly loaded wastewater from the dairy industry cod 1 000 mg l can preferably be treated by activated sludge processes in combination with flotation and anaerobic pre treatment such as expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactors for reduction of energy costs 5 concerning sludge management the highly energetic flotation sludge and the waste activated sludge was of the aerobic post treatment are generally disposed of as co substrates to municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp or biogas plants anaerobic treatment of these energy rich substrates in digesters on site combined with a combined heat and power unit chp would offer major benefits such as the reduction of disposed sludge volumes an increase of methane generation up to 50 and an increase of overall energy efficiency in case of integration of waste heat usage of chp units in industrial production however operation of anaerobic co digestion with major shares of flotation sludge over 80 cod which consists notably of lipids is challenging successful examples of lipid fed digestions have been reported using various lipid rich substrates 8 9 15 as well as inhibitions related to lipids 15 18 29 inhibition is mostly related to accumulation of long chain fatty acids lcfa which are an intermediate product of anaerobic lipid degradation angelidaki and ahring 2 reported threshold concentrations for oleate as 0 2 g l and stearate as 0 5 g l new publications assume that lcfa might build up layers on the biomass that might reduce mass transfer of substrates 8 12 19 28 inhibition on methanogens is consequently based on total solids related specific lcfa concentration 12 19 28 or surface related lcfa concentration 12 for anaerobic sludge from a treatment plant treating milk fats hwu et al 12 reported a 50 loss of methanogenic activity at oleate concentration of the sludge of 32 mg g ts adding lipid rich synthetic dairy wastewater to an anmbr szabo corbacho et al 24 reported a loss of methanogenic activity up to 50 at lcfa concentrations above 100 mg g ts although methane yields remained stable ziels et al 28 provided a threshold value for lcfa concentration of the sludge of 100 mg lcfa g ts precipitation induced by divalent cations can reduce the toxic effects of lcfa at the expense of reduced biodegradability 1 19 additions of bentonite reduce the toxic effects of lcfa by providing additional surface for adsorption in the reactor 18 maximum substrate specific volumetric loading rates olrs of fog and various lipid rich substrates have been published as design criterion for co digestion in cstrs mata

activity srt is not commonly used as a design parameter for digesters fed with lipid rich substrates studies on flotation sludge of the dairy industry and co fermentation with was operated at different srt are absent in the literature anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs are used to decouple hydraulic and sludge retention time compared to conventional fill and draw cstrs this offers the opportunity to extend degradation by increasing srt or keeping an applicable sludge load at similar srt but reduced reactor volumes at this writing only a few studies have been published that apply anmbr for mesophilic anaerobic digestion of particulate substrates 7 17 20 assessment of research data shows inconsistent results concerning achieved methane yields in comparison to conventional cstrs while pileggi parker 20 and dagnew et al 7 observed small increases of vs removal and higher methane yields compared to a cstr at equal srt romero flores et al 22 cobbledick et al 6 and lutze et al 14 achieved similar methane yields when feeding sewage sludges xiao et al 27 observed higher olr and higher degradation rates in anmbrs fed with lipid rich kitchen slurry and related this result to a positive effect on enzymatic hydrolysis activity this study deals with the feasibility of anaerobic co digestion of was and flotation sludge from the dairy industry with cod shares of lipids up to 85 the influence of srt and shares of flotation sludge on methane yield process stability and inhibition on acetoclastic methanogenic activity are determined conventional cstrs and an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr were operated with hrt and srt below common design recommendations under mesophilic conditions to investigate limitations of the loading capacity of anaerobic digesters rather than maximizing methane yields as the introduction of additional solids can reduce the inhibition the question arises if the joint digestion of flotation sludge with high shares of lipids and was with considerable amounts of non degradable solids results in significantly lower inhibiting effects and successful operation with higher sludge loads finally design criteria and potentials of anmbr for overcoming lipid related limitations are elaborated 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate sludge characteristics was from a wwtp with 40 000 pe and flotation sludge originated from ice cream production

a hollow shaft amembrane 3 36 m2 speed of rotation ranged from 250 rpm to 350 rpm the membrane unit allows decoupling of srt and hrt cstr operations with srt 10 d and srt 15 d were also conducted in this reactor but without decoupling of hrt and srt cstr operations with srt 20 d were conducted in a separate digester with a volume of 1 0 m³ anmbr and cstr were fed with prepared mixtures of was and flotation sludge from a common buffer tank 2 3 experimental procedures the cstrs and the anmbr were inoculated with digested sludge from a full scale digester of a municipal wwtp mesophilic conditions with temperatures around 37 1 c were maintained for comparison of both reactor types cstrs were operated at srt 10 d 15 d and 20 d while anmbr was operated at hrt 10 d and srt 15 d both reactors were

taken from the pilot plants and degassed for 24 36 h at temperatures around 20 c prior to incubation test bottles were flushed with nitrogen all bench scale tests were conducted at a temperature of 37

gas sensor gmbh germany and gas volumes type mgc 1 pmma dr ing ritter apparatebau gmbh co kg germany were also analysed continuously calculation of the initial substrate to inoculum ratio and evaluation of kinetic constants were carried out according to angelidaki et al 3 hydrolysis was assumed to be the rate limiting step in degradation of flotation sludge whereas disintegration was considered to be rate limiting for was digestion specific methanogenic activities sma in g cod kg vs d of acetoclastic methanogens were measured with the mentioned laboratory equipment for bmp tests 300 ml inoculum samples were placed in 1 000 ml bottles flushed with pure nitrogen and fed with 1 g l of acetic acid glacial 100 anhydrous for analysis cas no 64 19 7 merck ag germany after preparation all bottles were closed immediately and heated to a temperature of 37 c sma tests were conducted in triplicates at least and completed after 24 h for evaluation of sma the maximum slope of the curve accumulative methane production versus time during an interval of 1 h was used 2 5 definition of process stability process stability is determined by an approach using a safety factor according to siegrist et al 23 the safety factor sf is defined as follows 1 sf maximum acetate conversion average acetate conversion μ max 1 srt k d with μmax maximum growth rate of acetoclastic methanogens d 1 kd decay rate of acetoclastic methanogens d 1 contrary to siegrist et al 23 maximum acetate conversion was not determined as a result of intermittent feeding in continuously operated reactors but using specific methanogenic activities from batch tests instead the determination of sf was carried out comprising sma and mean mass flow of degraded cod to methane ch4 cod kg cod d of the last two sludge retention times for this purpose only shares of cod that are degraded via acetate must be taken into account according to adm1 around 65 70 of degradable cod of lipids is degraded via acetate 4 this is implemented in the determination of sf by a factor n as follows 2 sf sma m vs reactor n ch 4 cod kg cod 1 000 g cod with mvs mass of volatile solids in the reactor kg vs n average cod conversion of lipids via acetate 0 65 0 7 values greater than 1 0 imply that hydrolysis disintegration remains the rate limiting step and provides some reliability against substrate overloads or accumulation of inhibiting intermediates such as lcfa assuming identical microbiological population without significant inhibition the safety factor does not change with increasing olr but depends on srt growth reducing effects and inhibiting influences on methanogenic activity lead to a reduction of the measured sma and thus to a reduction of sf the higher the value of sf the more resistant the reactor against substrate overloads or fluctuating feed conditions is thus the anaerobic process is more stable as well further potential maximum lcfa concentration were estimated by calculating the residual degradable lipids in the anaerobic sludge in order to evaluate effects on process stability as follows 3 c res deg li c li fs q fs q total η max fs 1 k hyd fs srt 1 k hyd fs

shares of flotation sludge were successfully degraded in all reactors at srt down to 10 days in cstrs highest methane yields up to 280 l kg codin were achieved at cod shares of lipids over 80 and srt 20 d at similar cod shares of lipids slightly lower methane yields were obtained with applied srt 10 d compared to 20 d see table 3 and fig 2 b the anmbr operated at hrt 10 and srt 15 d achieved methane yields higher than 280 l kg codin at cod shares of lipids around 85 during the entire operational period methane yields in relation to degraded cod always ranged between 320 and 350 l kg coddeg in all reactors resulting in a cod based gap of mass balance less than 10 this indicates that lipids were available for anaerobic degradation and did not accumulate on the liquid surface in the digester 24 as expected total solids and volatile solids concentration are higher in the anmbr than in the cstrs while their ratio is similar the organic acid concentrations in the reactor remained below 1 000 mg l in all operational settings the ph value remained between 7 2 and 7 7 in all settings 4 discussion 4 1 influence of substrate mixture and srt on methane generation from the data of bmp batch assays expected methane yields can be calculated for continuously fed digesters operated as cstrs following substrate first order kinetics with hydrolysis disintegration as rate determining step as follows 4 y ch 4 srt k dis srt 1 k dis srt y m a x if the substrate degradation of the individual substrates does not significantly influence each other in the substrate mixture the methane yield of the substrate mixture could theoretically be determined from the sum of the degradation kinetics of the individual substrates under consideration of cod related shares of each substrate in the mixture the methane yield can be calculated using their kinetic constants from batch assays as follows 5 y ch 4 substrate mixture cod fs cod total k hyd fs srt 1 k hyd fs y ch 4 max fs cod was cod total k dis was srt 1 k dis was srt y ch 4 max was l ch 4 kg cod in measured values of the continuously fed pilot plants operated at srt 15 d and varying substrate mixture are compared with calculated values from batch assays in fig 2a measured values of the continuously fed pilot plants operated with cod related shares of flotation sludge 0 8 and srt between 10 and 20 days are compared with calculated values from batch assays in fig 2b measured methane yields of continuously fed pilot plants table 3 meet theoretical methane yields fig 2a b that were calculated with equation 5 and based on kinetic constants from batch assays methane generation from co digestion of was and flotation sludge consequently follows a substrate first order kinetic according to batstone et al 4 in continuously fed digesters even at the highest shares of flotation sludge based on cod no decrease in methane yields was observed based on cod removal significant inhibition of anaerobic degradation could therefore not be detected furthermore present results show that easily degradable organic matter flotation sludge did not limit degradation of slowly degradable organic matter waste activated sludge as would be the case with diauxy the anmbr achieved similar methane yields compared to the cstr operated at srt 15 d fig 2a small differences were mainly based on minor deviation in cod share of lipids in the substrate mixture this is not in agreement with the findings of xiao et al 27 who observed a positive effect on enzymatic hydrolysis activity in anmbrs fed with lipid rich kitchen slurry results are however in agreement with lutze et al 14 who also observed a substrate first order kinetic in both systems fed with was resulting in similar methane yields at equal srt 4 2 influence of substrate mixture and srt on process stability the concentration of volatile organic acids is an accepted criterion for stable operation of digesters as values up to 500 mg hac l are used for process control 11 in sludge treatment low concentrations of organic acids indicate that acetoclastic methanogenesis does not determine degradation rate and events of substrate overloading are unlikely present results show that vfa concentrations were mostly below 500 mg l but increased with shorter srt at even cod shares of the flotation sludge lipids see fig 2b and table 3 vfa concentrations also increased at higher cod shares of the flotation sludge lipids at even srt see fig 2a and table 3 results obtained from sma tests show that safety factor sf according to siegrist et al 23 see formula 1 2 remained above 1 0 fig 3 process stability against substrate overload or accumulation of inhibiting intermediates such as lcfa was sufficient sf values greater than 1 0 also correspond to low organic acid concentrations below 1 000 mg l two factors predominantly affected sf srt and cod share of lipids in influent substrate lower srts reduced safety against substrate overload in anaerobic digesters fed with cod shares of flotation sludge 0 8 cod shares of lipids 0 8 in the substrate see table 2 the safety factor dropped from sf 2 5 to sf 1 5 when srt was reduced from srt 20 d to srt 10 d this is in agreement with the definition of sf as sf depends on srt the maximum growth rate of acetoclastic methanogens and their decay rate see formula 1 calculated safety factors from dereli et al 8 and szabo corbacho et al 24 show a similar behaviour when srt is reduced from 30 to 20 days ziels et al 28 also observed a dependence of methanogenic activity on sludge retention time in digesters fed with fog safety against substrate overloads also decreased in reactors fed with increasing cod shares of lipid rich flotation sludge fig 3 in cstrs operated with srt 10 d an increasing share of flotation sludge and corresponding lipids decreased sf from sf 3 at codfs codtotal 0 4 to sf 1 5 at codfs codtotal 0 8 similar results were detected for digesters operated with srt 15 d and srt 20 d this is not in agreement with the definition of sf as sf was assumed to be independent of substrate composition and degradation behaviour in operation this reduced safety has to be taken into account by lowering variations of inflow characteristics especially cod loads as substrate overloads might occur otherwise when the original definition of sf is considered a decrease of sf with increasing cod related shares of flotation sludge indicates a reduction of growth rate of acetoclastic bacteria according to siegrist et al 23 growth rate μmax and decay rate kd can be read when plotting 1 sf versus 1 srt see fig 4 in this study maximum growth rate could not be determined because optimum conditions were not provided in the digesters instead apparent growth rate μapp may be determined from the data that includes possible inhibition or other effects with low shares of flotation sludge in the feed mixture the apparent growth rate ranged around 0 49 d 1 obtained values are similar to reported maximum growth rates under optimum conditions elsewhere e g refs 4 23 minor inhibitions can therefore be assumed when feeding low shares of lipids however in digesters fed with cod shares of lipids higher than 80 the apparent growth rate dropped noticeably to values below 0 16 d 1 reduced apparent growth rates illustrate inhibiting influences on methanogens as ammonium concentrations 1 000 mg l and concentrations of h2s 1 in the biogas as most common inhibitors of digestion processes were far below critical values 13 lipids and their hydrolysis products lcfa most likely inhibited the growth rate measured safety factors sf may be compared with calculated safety factors sf0 from non or at least low inhibiting operation phases using formula 1 with a growth rate of 0 49 d 1 and a decay rate of 0 1 d 1 as found in reactors at codfs codtotal 0 5 see fig 5 a dependence on degradable lipid content of the anaerobic sludge is obvious up to degradable lipid concentration in the anaerobic sludge around 50 mg vs gts ratio sf sf0 remained almost constant with an increased content of degradable lipids to approx 150 mg vs gts the safety against substrate overload was decreased by 60 80 which corresponds to an inhibition on acetoclastic methanogens of 20 40 szabo corbacho et al 24 observed similar values with inhibitions around 26 46 at lcfa concentrations of 120 150 mg lipid g tss in the anaerobic sludge when treating whole milk as synthetic dairy wastewater in anaerobic digesters hwu et al 12 reported higher losses of methanogenic activity of 50 at oleate concentration of 32 mg g tss comparable stability losses within this study were reached at degradable lipid contents of the anaerobic sludge above 200 mg vs g ts although anaerobic digestion performed well at degradable lipid concentration in the anaerobic sludge up to 150 mg vs gts with respect to organic acid concentrations and cod removal table 3 process stability against substrate overloads was already reduced at much lower concentrations consequently operational fluctuations in feed will become a major concern as substrate accumulation may occur sf can represent microbiological causes for emerging process instabilities even before effects on general parameters such as increasing concentration of organic acids lowering of ph or reduced methane yield are observed this is related to the general characteristics of the anaerobic sludge digestion process as a multiple step process with a slow step first hydrolysis disintegration and a second slow step last methanogenesis 4 11 in case of inhibition on methanogens for example based on substrate overloading sma would be reduced first which will also be expressed by lower safety factors 4 3 design considerations when vfa 500 mg hac l is considered as a limit for stable operation cstrs could be operated with a maximum olrcod deg 8 3 kg cod m³ d corresponding to olrfs 2 7 kg vs m³ d at srt 15 d similar maximum tolerable olr of olrcod deg 7 7 kg cod m³ d corresponding to olrfs 2 5 kg vs m³ d were achieved in cstr operated with srt 11 d using an anmbr with hrt 10 d and srt 15 d organic loading rates of 11 2 kg coddeg m³ d or 3 8 kg vsfs m³ d did not lead to process instabilities these loading rates exceed recommendations of dwa m 368 2014 10 or mata alvarez et al 15 and are in the range of dereli et al 8 szabo corbacho et al 24 successfully operated anmbrs with olr of 4 7 kg cod m³ d using milk wastewater as substrate a uniform maximum olr limit as a design criterion for both systems cstr and anmbr cannot be specified as given in table 3 and fig 2a the cstr operated with srt 10 d was not stable at olr around 10 kg coddeg m³ d when following the criterion of vfa 500 mg l while the anmbr proved to be reliable at olr above 10 kg coddeg m³ d although not critical increases of vfa were observed at olrs above 6 0 kg coddeg m³ d in all reactors this olr is also well above common recommendations in this study specific lipid loading rates up to 0 18 kg lipid kg vs d left vfa concentrations nearly unaffected table 3 literature data suggests 0 04 0 13 kg lipid kg vs d at vs ts 0 9 8 24 higher values seem to be achieved in this study as the reactors were operated with lower vs ts ratios around 0 7 which is related to inorganic contents of the was dereli et al 8 and szabo corbacho et al 24 used substrates with less non degradable or inorganic matter the results of this study and other publications i e 24 28 show that the residual lipid content of the anaerobic sludge exerts a major influence on process stability the sludge retention time and the lipid share in the substrate mainly affect the lipid content of the anaerobic sludge and should be included in a generally valid design criterion in this study a minimum sludge retention time of 15 days is required in case of cod shares of lipids of codli codtotal 0 8 for keeping degradable lipid concentration in the anaerobic sludge below 150 mg vs g ts organic acid concentration below 500 mg l and inhibition on methanogens below 50 cod shares of lipids less than 80 require a minimum sludge retention time above 10 days meeting previous mentioned requirements in both cases inflow variations should be limited for preventing accumulation of lcfa or vfa as safety factors of the anaerobic process are already reduced for keeping minimum inhibition and maximum process stability either cod shares of lipids must be limited to 50 in digesters operated with srt below 15 d or sludge retention times must be well above 20 d in digesters fed with cod shares of lipids higher than 80 as a general design criterion the maximum degradable lipid content in the anaerobic sludge might be promising as it considers all relevant parameters of lipid rich digestion and may be calculated from the data of substrate characteristics table 1 and degradation kinetics table 2 degradable lipid content determines potential maximum lcfa concentrations in anaerobic sludge as residual degradable lipid matter might potentially be converted to lcfa in the reactor as a limit value a content around 50 100 mg lipid g ts seems reasonable 4 4 comparison of anmbr and cstr results of this study allow the following conclusions regarding the comparison of process performance of cstr and anmbr srtanmbr srtcstr at comparable srt methane yield and process stability based on the safety factor and the concentration of organic acids in anmbrs largely correspond to results of cstrs however these values are achieved in anmbrs at organic loading rates which are increased by the decoupling factor srt hrt the required digester volume of anmbrs for achieving a similar degree of degradation while maintaining a defined process stability is reduced by the decoupling ratio additional investigations on the transient state the first srt after the change of olr at a comparable level between cstr and anmbr also show that in these transitions the anmbr remains significantly more stable with lower concentrations of organic acids see fig 6 hrtanmbr hrtcstr comparing cstr and anmbr at equal hrt process stability and methane yield can increase significantly because srt determines degree of degradation and process stability benefits of anmbr must be balanced with the economic drawbacks of adding membranes as a separation unit especially higher capex and opex as given in lutze et al 14 5 conclusions co digestion of was and flotation sludge from the dairy industry with cod shares of lipids higher than 80 in the mixture was successfully operated in an anmbr and cstrs at srts between 10 and 20 days biogas production and cod removal followed substrate first order kinetics ratio of specific acetoclastic methanogenic activity and mean acetate conversion in the digester is very well suited to detecting emerging process instabilities consequently regular monitoring of sma during the operation of high solid digestions with industrial readily degradable substrates is recommended process stability depended mainly on srt and lipid share in the substrate as both affect degradable lipid concentration in the anaerobic sludge the digestion process remained stable up to 150 mg lipid g ts although inhibition on acetoclastic methanogens started at 50 mg lipid g ts in case of the co digestion of lipid rich flotation sludge and was with cod shares of lipids higher than 0 8 g codli g cod in the mixture a minimum srt of 15 days was required cod shares of lipids below 0 8 g codli g cod were also successfully treated at srt of 10 d as an addition to common design criteria based on olr maximum degradable lipid content in the anaerobic sludge is promising as it considers relevant parameters of lipid rich sludge digestion and may be calculated from the data of substrate characteristics and degradation kinetics performance of anmbr in terms of cod degradation and process stability corresponds to cstr with similar srt but can be operated with higher olrs at similar hrt compared to a cstr anmbr offers a higher process stability by extending srt acknowledgements the german federal ministry of

consumption in the refinery industry environmental protection conservation of water resources reclamation of effluent can be an important and strategic step that have been considered as one of the most acceptable and efficient methods 8 some uses of reclaimed water are industrial use as makeup water in cooling towers agricultural use to groundwater recharge and even indirect potable uses 9 certainly reuse must be safely implemented to avoid endangering public health and the environment 10 cooling towers are one of the most water consuming units in the industry which by evaporation and spraying waste a large amount of water that should be supplied and replaced 11 12 among industrial processes cooling towers consume about 60 70 of the total water consumed by that industry 13 the reuse of treated effluents for cooling purposes can reduce freshwater harvesting as well as reduce environmental pollution nowadays the use of integrated systems for the recovery of industrial effluent with a focus on membrane processes has attracted many researchers 14 17 the application of membrane technologies is more economical than other physical treatment methods 18 19 the most important uses of membrane processes are the removal of microorganisms the reduction of suspended solids and colloids and the removal of turbidity in recent years the use of uf as a low pressure membrane has been widely used to remove suspended and colloidal impurities 20 21 the reasons for using the ultrafiltration method are well known such as not using chemicals removal of fine and microbial particles efficiency at low pressures and consequently reducing energy consumption low investment and operation cost increasing water purification rate reducing clogging and sedimentation easy maintenance 22 norouzbahari et al used uf ro hybrid membrane separation process for treatment of crude oil desalter unit 23 also salahi et al used a hybrid membrane for oily wastewater treatment the ro produced an effluent with quality compatible with that required for use in boilers 24 altman et al 2012 used ro for the treatment of a recirculating stream of a cooling tower achieving a 16 reduction in water replacement and 49 in effluent purge 25 in membrane distillation of industrial cooling tower blow down water by koeman stein et al 2016 polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene showed good performance regarding distillate quality and fouling behavior concentrating blow down water by a factor 4 5 while maintaining a flux of around 2 l m2h was possible with a water recovery of 78 available for reuse higher concentration factors lead to severe decrease in flux which was caused by scaling 26 chien et al 2012 evaluated the use of treated municipal effluent for lost water supply in cooling towers 27 and santos et al 2015 used industrial treated effluent for replenishment of losses in the cooling tower of a refinery in brazil 28 other methods of removing impurities from water and effluent are ion exchange resins that can be used in combination with other methods including membrane processes to reclaim industrial effluents dissolved solids hardness and silica are very important as limiting factors on the cooling tower performance the use of an ion exchange system ix can be useful for the treatment of refinery effluents with the aim of achieving an appropriate standard the application of ix resins is practically simple economical and efficient method to ions reduction from effluent 29 30 it was claimed that installation costs maintenance and operation of ix systems are lower than other technologies as membrane filtration or granular activated carbon filtration process 31 32 anionic and cationic resins are widely used to water softening and effluent reclamation 33 in the ix resin exchangeable ions do not chemically change 34 35 in view of the above it can be concluded that the use of integrated treatment methods considering the technical and economic issues can be used as an effective treatment method for the recovery of industrial effluents therefore due to the importance of conservation of water resources proper management of water consumption in industries with high water consumption and in the direction of reclamation and reuse of treated effluent the present study aimed to provide makeup water for use in cooling towers by integrated treatment methods uf ix mox at kermanshah oil refinery 2 materials and methods 2 1 explanation of the pilot plants and operational approach the purpose of this interventional experimental study was reclamation and reuse of kermanshah oil refinery effluent by integrated processes uf ix to provide makeup water for cooling towers fig 1 before entering effluent to the pilot a sand filter and activated carbon filter were used as a pretreatment to reduce large particles to evaluate the efficiency of integrated processes in removal and reduction of parameters such as cod tds turbidity silica oil and grease and hpc sampling was performed from four points including inlet flow uf permeate ix outlet and disinfected effluent the pilot was operated in inlet flow of 0 4 m3 h and three trans membrane pressure tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar 2 2 uf unit ultrafiltration was used to further reduce of residual tss turbidity cod and microbial load in the effluent the ultrafiltration unit was designed as a single module based on ultrafiltration permeate with recovery rate of 95 and filtration rate of 0 2 m3 using wave 1 1 water application value engine software version 1 64 based on the software output the cip time was considered 90 days in flux rate of 46 lmh using sodium hypochlorite 12 polysulfone polymer membranes in hollow fiber configuration were inserted into a u pvc housing because of the high resistance in the wide range of ph and temperature the flow was entered to the modules through the side port located at the lower cap uf module specifications were filtration rate of 0 2 m3 h velocity of 1 7 m s membrane area more than 14 m2 temperature tolerance up to 75 c and tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar the membrane characteristics used in this process are described in table 1 2 3 mixed bed ix based on the quality and quantity of the effluent from the ultrafiltration process a mixed bed resin system was designed using wave software mixed bed ix containing strong base anion resin sba with functional groups nh3oh with ratio 2 4 2 l of sac resin and 4 l of sba resin in top layer and strong acid cation resin sac with functional groups so3h in down layer have been used after uf module for the mitigation of total hardness th and silica the run time of the mixed resin was estimated to be 12 h for the regeneration of the resins 50 g l of hcl and 45 g l of naoh were used with a dilution of 2 and 4 respectively for 35 min at 25 c the main physicochemical specifications of each media are detailed in table 2 2 4 mox disinfection for avoiding biological agent s regrowth inside the cooling towers finished reclaimed effluent was disinfected using on site generated solution named mox this electrochemically generated chlorine based solution containing additional mixed oxidant components with potent biocidal properties using sodium chloride nacl electrolysis sodium hypochlorite was produced as a disinfectant on site in order to disinfect 1 m3 of effluent 8 ml of sodium hypochlorite was used this amount of disinfectant was to reach 0 7 mg l after 30 min of contact time heterotrophic plate count hpc was used as a method of measuring colony formation in the culture medium of heterotrophic bacteria 0 1 ml of diluted sample was added to the medium containing nutrient agar on the plate the sample inoculated on the surface of the culture medium was spread evenly with a sterile glass rod all colonies were formed on the surface of the culture medium and prevent the colonies from penetrating into the agar after incubation at appropriate temperature 48 h at 35 c bacterial colonies were counted on agar surface the following formula was used to count the number of bacteria according to cfu 100 ml cfu ml no of colonies dilution factor volume of culture plate 3 result and discussion 3 1 overall performance the oil refinery effluent is a mixture of various organic and inorganic pollutants therefore to provide makeup water in the cooling towers there is a need for a series of processes that can as far as possible reduce the impurities in this study uf was used to reduce turbidity cod oil and microbial load of the effluent ix resin also used to reduce the anions cations total hardness ec and silica secondary effluent with physico chemical properties of table 3 was pumped to the serial pilot the trend of variations in the concentration of impurities in each module from the pilot studied has been shown in figs 2 6 3 2 cod removal cod concentration fluctuations in 33 operating runs and tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar are shown in fig 2 according to table 3 the cod concentration in the feed stream was 81 6 mg l which after passing through the uf membrane at tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar was 35 54 45 and 44 54 mg l respectively the uf permeate has been used as feed water for the ix process the average of cod outlet of ix process at the specified pressures was 31 09 38 81 and 35 63 mg l respectively sherhan et al 2016 reported the removal efficiency of cod 41 by using uf 17 in general the cod concentration obtained in this study was in accordance with the makeup water quality standard in the research of raghu et al 2007 the ix process had no effect on cod reduction 35 the cod removal using uf in this study was 47 that was closer to the results of sherhan et al 2016 41 cod removal and salahi 2010 65 in the research of jadhao et al 2012 the cod removal was reported using uf more than 99 this significant difference can be related to the polyamide membrane 17 36 in el abbassi et al study cod removal was increased by 60 with the ph reduction to 2 37 salahi et al reported 83 in cod removal using asymmetric polyethersulfan uf membrane the further cod removal in the salahi study compared to this study is likely related to the difference in membrane type 38 addition of other pretreatment technology before uf such as activated carbon cartridge filter and dosing non oxidized biocides are proposed alternatives that could help to increase the life span of uf and ro elements 39 3 3 tds removal according to fig 3 and table 3 the average initial concentration of tds was 1132 mg l the final concentration of tds exited from hybrid processes uf ix at different tmp was 209 218 235 mg l ix resins have a significant role in reducing tds in this study the efficiency of the ultrafiltration process was 27 in tds removal which was in agreement with the results of salahi et al 30 40 overall in this study the ultrafiltration process unlike other membrane processes such as reverse osmosis has a minor role in tds removal this has also been reported in similar studies 17 42 in the present study the removal efficiency of tds using ultrafiltration and ion exchange processes was 27 and 80 respectively there is a direct relationship between the two parameters of tds and electrical conductivity ec since the electrical conductivity of the feed effluent in the present study was 1826 μs cm and in the range of 1000 10000 μs cm the conversion coefficient was calculated as 0 8 ec 0 8 tds therefore as the total solids content decreased the electrical conductivity decreased as well 3 4 turbidity removal one of the advantages of using membrane filters such as uf is the removal of high suspended solids and subsequent removal of turbidity it was significantly reduced in the final effluent in accordance to the makeup water quality standard as shown in fig 4 the initial concentration of turbidity permeate was 8 6 ntu which on average reduced to 0 44 0 46 and 0 59 ntu by using advanced treatment processes at predetermined pressures in the present study the turbidity decline in uf and ix processes was 83 and 67 respectively while in the sherhan s study 95 was reported 17 salahi et al revealed that 99 3 of turbidity could be removed using polyethersulfan membrane 40 3 5 sio2 removal silica is the important parameter for industrial waters such as cooling towers and boiling utilities the concentration of sio2 in makeup water should be less than 150 mg l based on fig 5 the initial concentration of sio2 in the feed was 169 48 mg l which decreased to 42 3 54 and 70 mg l at tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar respectively the mixed bed resin had a significant efficiency in the removal of sio2 so that the efficiency of the uf and ix processes in the removal of sio2 was 19 and 60 respectively the results of sik ali et al 2004 showed that the use of strong base anion resin is very effective for the sio2 removal 41 3 6 oil and grease removal according to fig 6 in the process of uf the average concentration of oil decreased from 1 93 mg l to 0 24 0 38 and 0 68 mg l at pressures 1 2 and 3 bar respectively this values for ix process at the specified pressures were 0 19 0 24 and 0 28 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of oil using the uf process in the same studies were 52 27 and 99 7 17 37 42 the efficiency of the combined processes in the present study in oil g removal was 63 3 7 hpc removal and regrowth control hpc at concentrations above 500 cfu ml in addition to changing the water quality causes corrosion and sedimentation in the installations and ultimately increases operating costs the hpc in the pilot feed was more than 500 cfu 100 ml and 99 of colonies were trapped by uf the residual number was inactivated by mox solution to prevent regrowth of biofilm in the cooling towers residual chlorine was provided 0 7 mg l after 30 min in the storage tank it was claimed that mox solution is stronger than chlorine in the bajsza and dekonenko study mox within the range of 25 and 250 mg l exhibited a higher efficacy in oocyst inactivation than hypochlorite 43 4 conclusion the cooling towers via consumption of more than 50 of the refinery water are categorized in high consumption water units hence reclamation and reuse of effluents as a sustainable and reliable resource was considered for this important purpose the integrated uf ix mox pilot plant was operated during 33 runs and 3 tmp the overall efficiency of the processes in reducing cod tds turbidity sio2 oil hpc was 57 80 94 67 88 99 respectively at optimum pressure of 1 bar mixed bed ix was reduced the tds below the standard limit for makeup water needed in cooling towers based on the repeated measures analysis the efficiency of hybrid processes in removal of effluent impurities to provide makeup water in the cooling towers was statistically significant p value 0 05 mox was very effective in hpc inactivation in 0 7 mg l disinfectant residual the results of this research can be suitable approach for the recovery of industrial effluent in

membrane has been widely used to remove suspended and colloidal impurities 20 21 the reasons for using the ultrafiltration method are well known such as not using chemicals removal of fine and microbial particles efficiency at low pressures and consequently reducing energy consumption low investment and operation cost increasing water purification rate reducing clogging and sedimentation easy maintenance 22 norouzbahari et al used uf ro hybrid membrane separation process for treatment of crude oil desalter unit 23 also salahi et al used a hybrid membrane for oily wastewater treatment the ro produced an effluent with quality compatible with that required for use in boilers 24 altman et al 2012 used ro for the treatment of a recirculating stream of a cooling tower achieving a 16 reduction in water replacement and 49 in effluent purge 25 in membrane distillation of industrial cooling tower blow down water by koeman stein et al 2016 polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene showed good performance regarding distillate quality and fouling behavior concentrating blow down water by a factor 4 5 while maintaining a flux of around 2 l m2h was possible with a water recovery of 78 available for reuse higher concentration factors lead to severe decrease in flux which was caused by scaling 26 chien et al 2012 evaluated the use of treated municipal effluent for lost water supply in cooling towers 27 and santos et al 2015 used industrial treated effluent for replenishment of losses in the cooling tower of a refinery in brazil 28 other methods of removing impurities from water and effluent are ion exchange resins that can be used in combination with other methods including membrane processes to reclaim industrial effluents dissolved solids hardness and silica are very important as limiting factors on the cooling tower performance the use of an ion exchange system ix can be useful for the treatment of refinery effluents with the aim of achieving an appropriate standard the application of ix resins is practically simple economical and efficient method to ions reduction from effluent 29 30 it was claimed that installation costs maintenance and operation of ix systems are lower than other technologies as membrane filtration or granular activated carbon filtration process 31 32 anionic and cationic resins are widely used to water softening and effluent reclamation 33 in the ix resin exchangeable ions do not chemically change 34 35 in view of the above it can be concluded that the use of integrated treatment methods considering the technical and economic issues can be used as an effective treatment method for the recovery of industrial effluents therefore due to the importance of conservation of water resources proper management of water consumption in industries with high water consumption and in the direction of reclamation and reuse of treated effluent the present study aimed to provide makeup water for use in cooling towers by integrated treatment methods uf ix mox at kermanshah oil refinery 2 materials and methods 2 1 explanation of the pilot plants and operational approach the purpose of this interventional experimental study was reclamation and reuse of kermanshah oil refinery effluent by integrated processes uf ix to provide makeup water for cooling towers fig 1 before entering effluent to the pilot a sand filter and activated carbon filter were used as a pretreatment to reduce large particles to evaluate the efficiency of integrated processes in removal and reduction of parameters such as cod tds turbidity silica oil and grease and hpc sampling was performed from four points including inlet flow uf permeate ix outlet and disinfected effluent the pilot was operated in inlet flow of 0 4 m3 h and three trans membrane pressure tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar 2 2 uf unit ultrafiltration was used to further reduce of residual tss turbidity cod and microbial load in the effluent the ultrafiltration unit was designed as a single module based on ultrafiltration permeate with recovery rate of 95 and filtration rate of 0 2 m3 using wave 1 1 water application value engine software version 1 64 based on the software output the cip time was considered 90 days in flux rate of 46 lmh using sodium hypochlorite 12 polysulfone polymer membranes in hollow fiber configuration were inserted into a u pvc housing because of the high resistance in the wide range of ph and temperature the flow was entered to the modules through the side port located at the lower cap uf module specifications were filtration rate of 0 2 m3 h velocity of 1 7 m s membrane area more than 14 m2 temperature tolerance up to 75 c and tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar the membrane characteristics used in this process are described in table 1 2 3 mixed bed ix based on the quality and quantity of the effluent from the ultrafiltration process a mixed bed resin system was designed using wave software mixed bed ix containing strong base anion resin sba with functional groups nh3oh with ratio 2 4 2 l of sac resin and 4 l of sba resin in top layer and strong acid cation resin sac with functional groups so3h in down layer have been used after uf module for the mitigation of total hardness th and silica the run time of the mixed resin was estimated to be 12 h for the regeneration of the resins 50 g l of hcl and 45 g l of naoh were used with a dilution of 2 and 4 respectively for 35 min at 25 c the main physicochemical specifications of each media are detailed in table 2 2 4 mox disinfection for avoiding biological agent s regrowth inside the cooling towers finished reclaimed effluent was disinfected using on site generated solution named mox this electrochemically generated chlorine based solution containing additional mixed oxidant components with potent biocidal properties using sodium chloride nacl electrolysis sodium hypochlorite was produced as a disinfectant on site in order to disinfect 1 m3 of effluent 8 ml of sodium hypochlorite was used this amount of disinfectant was to reach 0 7 mg l after 30 min of contact time heterotrophic plate count hpc was used as a method of measuring colony formation in the culture medium of heterotrophic bacteria 0 1 ml of diluted sample was added to the medium containing nutrient agar on the plate the sample inoculated on the surface of the culture medium was spread evenly with a sterile glass rod all colonies were formed on the surface of the culture medium and prevent the colonies from penetrating into the agar after incubation at appropriate temperature 48 h at 35 c bacterial colonies were counted on agar surface the following formula was used to count the number of bacteria according to cfu 100 ml cfu ml no of colonies dilution factor volume of culture plate 3 result and discussion 3 1 overall performance the oil refinery effluent is a mixture of various organic and inorganic pollutants therefore to provide makeup water in the cooling towers there is a need for a series of processes that can as far as possible reduce the impurities in this study uf was used to reduce turbidity cod oil and microbial load of the effluent ix resin also used to reduce the anions cations total hardness ec and silica secondary effluent with physico chemical properties of table 3 was pumped to the serial pilot the trend of variations in the concentration of impurities in each module from the pilot studied has been shown in figs 2 6 3 2 cod removal cod concentration fluctuations in 33 operating runs and tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar are shown in fig 2 according to table 3 the cod concentration in the feed stream was 81 6 mg l which after passing through the uf membrane at tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar was 35 54 45 and 44 54 mg l respectively the uf permeate has been used as feed water for the ix process the average of cod outlet of ix process at the specified pressures was 31 09 38 81 and 35 63 mg l respectively sherhan et al 2016 reported the removal efficiency of cod 41 by using uf 17 in general the cod concentration obtained in this study was in accordance with the makeup water quality standard in the research of raghu et al 2007 the ix process had no effect on cod reduction 35 the cod removal using uf in this study was 47 that was closer to the results of sherhan et al 2016 41 cod removal and salahi 2010 65 in the research of jadhao et al 2012 the cod removal was reported using uf more than 99 this significant difference can be related to the polyamide membrane 17 36 in el abbassi et al study cod removal was increased by 60 with the ph reduction to 2 37 salahi et al reported 83 in cod removal using asymmetric polyethersulfan uf membrane the further cod removal in the salahi study compared to this study is likely related to the difference in membrane type 38 addition of other pretreatment technology before uf such as activated carbon cartridge filter and dosing non oxidized biocides are proposed alternatives that could help to increase the life span of uf and ro elements 39 3 3 tds removal according to fig 3 and table 3 the average initial concentration of tds was 1132 mg l the final concentration of tds exited from hybrid processes uf ix at different tmp was 209 218 235 mg l ix resins have a significant role in reducing tds in this study the efficiency of the ultrafiltration process was 27 in tds removal which was in agreement with the results of salahi et al 30 40 overall in this study the ultrafiltration process unlike other membrane processes such as reverse osmosis has a minor role in tds removal this has also been reported in similar studies 17 42 in the present study the removal efficiency of tds using ultrafiltration and ion exchange processes was 27 and 80 respectively there is a direct relationship between the two parameters of tds and electrical conductivity ec since the electrical conductivity of the feed effluent in the present study was 1826 μs cm and in the range of 1000 10000 μs cm the conversion coefficient was calculated as 0 8 ec 0 8 tds therefore as the total solids content decreased the electrical conductivity decreased as well 3 4 turbidity removal one of the advantages of using membrane filters such as uf is the removal of high suspended solids and subsequent removal of turbidity it was significantly reduced in the final effluent in accordance to the makeup water quality standard as shown in fig 4 the initial concentration of turbidity permeate was 8 6 ntu which on average reduced to 0 44 0 46 and 0 59 ntu by using advanced treatment processes at predetermined pressures in the present study the turbidity decline in uf and ix processes was 83 and 67 respectively while in the sherhan s study 95 was reported 17 salahi et al revealed that 99 3 of turbidity could be removed using polyethersulfan membrane 40 3 5 sio2 removal silica is the important parameter for industrial waters such as cooling towers and boiling utilities the concentration of sio2 in makeup water should be less than 150 mg l based on fig 5 the initial concentration of sio2 in the feed was 169 48 mg l which decreased to 42 3 54 and 70 mg l at tmp of 1 2 and 3 bar respectively the mixed bed resin had a significant efficiency in the removal of sio2 so that the efficiency of the uf and ix processes in the removal of sio2 was 19 and 60 respectively the results of sik ali et al 2004 showed that the use of strong base anion resin is very effective for the sio2 removal 41 3 6 oil and grease removal according to fig 6 in the process of uf the average concentration of oil decreased from 1 93 mg l to 0 24 0 38 and 0 68 mg l at pressures 1 2 and 3 bar respectively this values for ix process at the specified pressures were 0 19 0 24 and 0 28 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of oil using the uf process in the same studies were 52 27 and 99 7 17 37 42 the efficiency of the combined processes in the present study in oil g removal was 63 3 7 hpc removal and regrowth control hpc at concentrations above 500 cfu ml in addition to changing the water quality causes corrosion and sedimentation in the installations and ultimately increases operating costs the hpc in the pilot feed was more than 500 cfu 100 ml and 99 of colonies were trapped by uf the residual number was inactivated by mox solution to prevent regrowth of biofilm in the cooling towers residual chlorine was provided 0 7 mg l after 30 min in the storage tank it was claimed that mox solution is stronger than chlorine in the bajsza and dekonenko study mox within the range of 25 and 250 mg l exhibited a higher efficacy in oocyst inactivation than hypochlorite 43 4 conclusion the cooling towers via consumption of more than 50 of the refinery water are categorized in high consumption water units hence reclamation and reuse of effluents as a sustainable and reliable resource was considered for this important purpose the integrated uf ix mox pilot plant was operated during 33 runs and 3 tmp the overall efficiency of the processes in reducing cod tds turbidity sio2 oil hpc was 57 80 94 67 88 99 respectively at optimum pressure of 1 bar mixed bed ix was reduced the tds below the standard limit for makeup water needed in cooling towers based on the repeated measures analysis the efficiency of hybrid processes in removal of effluent impurities to provide makeup water in the cooling towers was statistically significant p value 0 05 mox was very effective in hpc inactivation in 0 7 mg l disinfectant residual the results of this research can be suitable approach for the recovery of industrial effluent in
