21100,the vertical water entry processes of a hollow cylinder with three different velocities are investigated both numerically and experimentally three different closure patterns and flow characteristics of the air entraining cavities induced by water entry processes are discovered and discussed our results show that three different closure patterns appear with the increase of entry velocity the deep closure the surface closure on the through hole jet and on the geometry wall three high speed regions also appear during the water entry process and their characteristics are different with various closure patterns besides with the increase of water entry velocity the velocity variation will vary from increase to decrease but their water depths all increase linearly due to the short time and small variations of velocities keywords water entry hollow cylinder cavity evolution closure pattern splash convergence 1 introduction when an object enters into the water some complex flow phenomena including the air entraining cavity splash the ejected jets and cavity closure pattern etc are generated and affect the underwater motion of the object extensive investigations on these events have been conducted since the initial works worthington 1883 due to their practical applications babbs 2019 truscott et al 2009 the closure pattern of the air entraining cavity and the splash formation have been widely studied in the early investigations the water entry of the solid spheres and the critical parameters including the atmospheric pressure p 0 entry velocity v 0 and sphere diameter d have been deeply studied for determining the cavity formation two cavity closure patterns gilbarg and anderson 1948 deep closure and surface closure splash seal are observed and accepted on the low speed water entry at b 0 103 bond number b 0 ρgd 2 γ where γ is the surface tension and g is gravitational acceleration they are classified roughly by the froude number fr v 0 gd 1 2 birkhoff and caywood 1949 lee et al 1997 the deep closure occurs at 201 2 fr 701 2 and the surface closure appears at fr 1501 2 in deep closure the cavity is closed and separated into two parts by an underwater point however the cavity is closed at a subsurface point around the water surface firstly in surface closure furthermore two extra patterns aristoff and bush 2009 the quasi static seal and the shallow seal versus froude number 10 1 2 fr 105 2 are added at 10 2 b 0 1 due to the intensive surface tension s influence in the quasi static seal the cavity collapses when the contact line approaches the apex of the sphere and the air entrainment is minimal after the entry velocity increases the shallow seal appears and the collapse happens near the free surface where the depth of the closure point is far less than that in deep closure furthermore the surface conditions of spheres hydrophobic or hydrophilic korkmaz and güzel 2017 speirs et al 2019 also decide whether the air entraining cavity will be formed successfully the similar two closure patterns deep and surface closure are also found during the water entry of a cylinder with different entry velocities by guo et al 2012 however the above rules of spheres are not fit for the cylinder projectiles fully the impact face of cylinder bodies is more complicated during the vertical water entry than that of spheres therefore the nose shapes of the cylinder have important effects on the cavity formation chen et al 2019 song et al 2020 truscott et al 2009 yan et al 2019 on the other hand the cavity shape can also be altered by the geometry wall of the projectile which has been mentioned by truscott et al 2014 the above closure pattern can also be extended to the water entry of the disk enriquez et al 2012 glasheen and mcmahon 1996 and the projectile with a disk cavitator jiang et al 2018 furthermore the cavity evolution is affected by some special conditions such as the water entry of tandem yun et al 2020 and parallel lu et al 2019 song et al 2018 objects a cylinder with attack angle xia et al 2020 a segmented cylinder with spring connected wu et al 2020 and a high speed projectile with container constraint effects guo et al 2020 the water entry of a hollow structure is widely applied in some engineering fields such as seaplane landing diclemente et al 2015 feng et al 2020 sea recovery of aerospace structures seddon and moatamedi 2006 and the water slamming of the high speed craft with a bottom artificial air cavity cucinotta et al 2017 gokcay et al 2004 matveev and morabito 2020 in this paper we aim to investigate the closure patterns of water entry cavities of a hollow projectile which are not very clear so far the hollow projectile is a new ammunition and has the shape of a concentric thin walled circular tube it has a strong penetration ability and lower flow drag zhao et al 2019 and can be used in the field of water entry the initial hydrodynamic investigation on the similar hollow structure underwater has been conducted by savchenko 2012 and the drag characteristics of disk cavitation with different apertures using a water tunnel have been studied experimentally furthermore the cavitating flows behind the disk cavitator with concentric holes of various diameters were investigated numerically by erfanian and anbarsooz 2018 it shows that the drag coefficient reduces with the increase of dimensionless hole diameter d hole d and when d hole d 0 6 the drag coefficient at all the cavitation numbers can be decreased about 30 percent compared with the normal disk cavitator which presents the potential applications in future underwater defence the water entry cavity evolution of a hollow projectile has been investigated recently by hou et al 2019a the research shows that a through hole jet with a top bubble is induced by the impact the cavity pinches off along the circumference of the through hole jet in the deep closure pattern furthermore the experimental investigation on the hollow cylinder has also been conducted at different entry velocities hou et al 2019b and the transition period from the deep closure to surface closure is found with the increasing entry velocity but the influences of the entry speeds on the splash convergence over the water surface and the transition mechanism have not yet been well investigated moreover the details of the fundamental flow characteristics with different closure patterns have not been dug into therefore this paper continues to use the numerical and experimental method to investigate the vertical water entry of the hollow cylinder at different entry speeds focusing on the closure pattern transition and fundamental hydrodynamic flow characteristics with different closure patterns the following content is organized as follows section 2 describes the experimental and numerical method including the model dimension and entry conditions the validations of mesh independency and the numerical method are also contained section 3 includes the results and discussions which consists of 3 subsections in section 3 1 three closure patterns are classified by the flow characteristics with different entry speeds and the transition mechanism is analyzed based on the pressure variation in section 3 2 section 3 3 discusses the velocity and pressure field characteristics and the cylinder dynamic parameters with different closure patterns respectively finally the main findings are summarized in section 4 2 investigation methods 2 1 experimental method the experiments are carried out in a water tank with the size of 1 0 m 0 7 m 1 0m and the water depth of 0 8m the hollow cylinder falls freely from a platform with an electromagnet to the water the entry process is captured by a high speed phantom camera with a frame rate of 2000fps and an image resolution of 1280 800 pixels the exposure time is set as 20μs under two 2600w spotlights to make the images clear all of the measured results of the displacements and velocities are the average values of six repeated experiments the entry velocity v 0 of the hollow cylinder is less than 4 m s and the maximum measurement error is estimated to be less than 5 the experimental system employed is the same as used in hou et al 2019a the detailed setup description and measuring method can also be found there 2 2 numerical method both large eddy simulation les and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans have been carried out for simulating the water entry process of hollow cylinder however the les takes much long time compared with rans and both numerical results can reveal the flow evolution during the entry process therefore rans is employed to describe the vertical water entry process based on the volume of fluid vof multiphase flow model and the two equation realizable k ε turbulence model is used to close the viscous equations hou et al 2019a the governing equations are discretized by the finite volume method and the simple scheme is used to solve the pressure velocity coupling algorithms the second order upwind scheme is applied for discretizing the convection terms and the central differenced for the diffusion term of the momentum equations the presto scheme is adopted for the pressure interpolation the explicit geo reconstruct scheme is employed to solve the transport equation for the volume fractions 2 3 computational model the hollow cylinder used is also the same as described in hou et al 2019a and is shown in fig 1 it is made of steel astm1045 and its geometric parameters are shown in table 1 the characteristic length is d c d 2 d 2 1 2 16 1 mm in this work the froude number is within fr v 0 g d c 1 2 6 10 bond number b 0 ρgd c 2 γ 1 and weber number we ρv 0 2 d c γ 1300 3500 where v 0 is the entry velocity of the cylinder ρ 998 2 kg m 3 refers to the water density and γ denotes the surface tension an axisymmetric two dimension domain is created for the simulation to improve computational efficiency as shown in fig 2 the symmetric half domain size is 7 5d 45d and the above water area is 7 5d 15d the hollow cylinder falls into the free water surface with various velocities the center of entry location and the impact moment are defined as the origin of the depth x 0 and time t 0 respectively the positive direction of the x coordinate is the same as gravity the stationary wall is chosen for both the right side and the bottom side the top boundary is set as pressure inlet the operating pressure p 0 is taken to be the standard atmospheric pressure 101325pa after several numerical tests it is ensured that the bottom boundary is deep enough not to affect the results the structured body fitted mesh is created for the axisymmetric domain and is shown in fig 3 a the area within the hollow cylinder is refined to improve the numerical accuracy and the mesh around the head is shown in fig 3 b the dynamic layer method is applied to update the mesh following the motion of the hollow cylinder 2 4 validations of mesh independency and numerical method this work uses commercial software ansys fluent to carried out the simulation five mesh levels of the computational domain with correspondingly coarser 0 34 million coarse 0 45 million medium 0 6 million fine 1 million and finer 1 35 million grid are examined for the mesh independency study the corresponding mesh sizes over the cylinder surface are shown in table 2 from the predicted depths x versus time in fig 4 the trend errors are mainly found in the late moving stages and eliminated gradually with the increasing grid density considering both the accuracy of results and the time cost the fine case with 1 million grids is good enough in the simulation besides the height of the first prism mesh around the cylinder is set as 4 10 5 m for the fine case its average values of the non dimensional distance y around the cylinder wall satisfy y 3 as shown in fig 5 in the fine case the courant number co δt u δx is used to control the convergence rate and stability where δt is time step u 4 m s is field velocity and δx 4 10 5 is the minimum grid size in this simulation the time step is set as 5 10 6s and the corresponding maximum co is 0 5 besides the iteration operates 20 times to make the solution converge at each time step to validate the above numerical method three typical numerical simulations are carried out to compare with corresponding experiments fig 6 the vertical entry velocities are chosen as v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s respectively as shown in fig 6 for all three cases our numerical results agree well with corresponding experimental measuring results firstly the depth x left ordinate variations for all three cases have the same tendencies which are proportional with time and the largest error between numerical and experimental is about 2 38 from the case of the smallest velocity v 0 2 49 m s fig 6a however the modifications of velocities v after entry right ordinate are more complicated which are related to the cavity closure modes detailed discussions can be seen in section 3 1 and the maximum error of 4 occurs in the same case v 0 2 49 m s fig 6a the velocity is almost proportional and increases versus entry time with the increase of entry velocity v 0 3 27 m s fig 6b it increases sharply at the first impact then it grows proportionally and slowly due to the high drag when the entry velocity is larger and becomes 3 87 m s fig 6c it keeps decreasing proportionally after the impact 3 results and discussions 3 1 three different cavity closure patterns for the cavity evolution of a water entry hollow cylinder four distinct stages the impact stage the open cavity stage the closure stage and the free sailing stage with cavity attached are found during the whole process hou et al 2019a the entry velocity v 0 is the key parameter that affects the characteristics of the closure pattern as we know there are usually two kinds of cavity closures deep closure and surface closure for water entry phenomena however for the water entry of a hollow cylinder based on our experimental and numerical investigations the surface closure can also be divided into two kinds one is the closure along with the through hole jet and the other is on the cylinder wall therefore there are three closure patterns actually one is the deep closure and the other two are the surface closures to explore their different evolutional mechanisms both the experimental and numerical studies are performed with various entry velocities 3 1 1 deep closure pattern for the water entry of a hollow projectile deep closure occurs at a small entry velocity in our case v 0 2 84 m s the description detail of cavity evolution can be found in hou et al 2019a here we take v 0 2 49 m s fr 6 3 as the example for discussion as shown in fig 7 between t 55 65 ms the deep closure occurs and induces the pinches off of the cavity during the initial impact stage from impact with water to submergence fully t 25 ms the hollow cylinder hits the free water surface and the flow is split up into two areas inside and outside of the cylinder area which increases the velocity slowly and its displacement increases proportionally fig 6 a inside the hollow cylinder a through hole jet forms and outside of the cylinder the cavity appears the through hole jet keeps ascending and a bubble forms at its tip the explanation can also be found in hou et al 2019a the jet tip turns into some droplets during the raising process at the same time the cavity keeps engulfing air and expanding in this process the kinetic energy is converted to the potential energy of the water which induces the external cavity expansion and the internal flow extrusion t 25 ms fig 7 when the cavity expands to the maximum it begins to shrink inwards t 35 ms fig 7 due to the pressure difference between the two sides of the cavity interface the deep closure of the cavity along the jet circumference separates it into two parts the open part is connected with the jet and the closed part is attached to the cylinder the open part of the cavity keeps moving upward with the jet till it moves out of the water surface on the other hand the closed part moves downward with the cylinder and some small air bubbles keep shedding from the cylinder bottom to form the two phase wake flow in this process the potential energy of the water is converted to the kinetic energy of the flow which induces the cavity shrinkage t 65 ms fig 7 and the annular ejection t 105 ms fig 7 3 1 2 surface closure on the through hole jet with the increase of the entry velocity the convergence of the cavity becomes faster two closure mechanisms deep and surface closure may appear in our study when the entry velocity increases to v 0 2 96 m s the closure pattern modifies from deep to surface and the cavity closes on the through hole jet with further increase of the velocity to v 0 3 87 m s the cavity closes fast enough on the cylinder surface even before the cylinder submerges into the water the modification of cavity closure mechanisms is discussed in section 3 2 a typical case for the surface closure on the through hole jet with v 0 3 27 m s fr 8 2 is shown in fig 8 both experimentally and numerically the flow structures are almost the same as that in fig 7 before the cylinder dives into the water t 5 15 ms the cylinder kinetic energy is converted to the water potential energy however at t 15 30 ms the splash obtains more kinetic energy and converges inwards more distinctly than that in fig 7 during the convergence process both the experimental and numerical results show that the splash curtain just touches the cylinder bottom at t 20 ms fig 8a b furthermore the splash apex rolls inwards and passes through the bottom at t 25 ms fig 8b and impacts with the through hole jet surface to achieve the cavity closure at about t 30 ms due to the surface closure the cavity is sealed entirely and is elongated with the move of the cylinder at the same time the internal shrinkage of the cavity is still in effect referring to the principle of cavity independent expansion logvinovich 1973 both effects make the cavity shape vary with time t 30 35 ms fig 8a b at about t 45 60 ms the pinch off process deep closure appears at the rear of the cavity and the cavity is split into two parts one part moves upward while the other is attached to the cylinder and moves downward unlike what happens in the deep closure pattern fig 7 the cavity fluctuates at the tail first and leads to some turbulent bubbles around the jet t 60 ms fig 8 which moves upward with the jet after the pinch off in the sailing stage the hollow cylinder moves downwards stably at t 70 ms with the attached cavity wrapped up fully and small air bubbles keep shedding away from the rear part of the cavity to form the wake flow in this case the surface closure on the through hole jet occurs earlier than the pinch off of the cavity underwater therefore the air entraining process is stopped earlier however the pinch off happens at the rear part of the cavity and provides the cavity with enough air to wrap up the cylinder fully at last besides the higher entry velocity makes the cylinder velocity increase slower ranging from about 3 3 m s to 3 6 m s and its displacement also increases proportionally fig 6 b to further study the transition characteristics the numerical results with nearby entry velocities v 0 2 96 m s and 3 10 m s are present in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 with the entry velocity decreases the surface closure is slowed down for v 0 3 27 m s the closure time is t 30 ms fig 8b and with v 0 3 10 m s and 2 96 m s the time become t 40 ms fig 9b and 45 ms respectively besides the distance l c between the first closure location point at the through hole jet and the cylinder bottom becomes larger with the decreased velocity for v 0 3 27 m s the shrink splash just passes and touches the cylinder bottom t 20 ms fig 8b and the distance l c 19 mm is the smallest when the surface closure happens t 30 ms fig 8 but l c 55 mm is the largest for v 0 2 96 m s at t 45 ms and the splash can t touch the cylinder bottom t 25 ms fig 9a after the surface closure the deep closure also appears for all the above three cases it appears more noticeably as shown in fig 9 a t 65 ms and fig 9 b t 60 ms when the water potential energy is converted to kinetic energy the main differences among them are the cavity volume of the upward part its volume becomes smaller as the entry velocity is larger 3 1 3 surface closure on the geometry wall after further increasing the entry velocity the cavity convergence becomes faster and may be sealed around the cylinder wall even before the cylinder submerges into the water to present this pattern clearly fig 10 shows a typical case at v 0 3 87 m s and fr 9 7 compared with the above patterns shown in figs 7 and 8 the splashed moving water curtain touches the cylinder wall first seal at t 10 ms fig 10 at this time almost half of the cylinder is still over the water surface and the cavity tip stays stable almost horizontal motion while the cylinder persists in moving down lastly the cylinder submerges into the water and the cavity tip impacts with the through hole jet second seal at t 25 30 ms fig 10a b the flow is divided into two new parts with opposite moving direction one moves downwards along with the cylinder wall the other ejects upwards with the through hole jet and induces some splashes over the water surface at t 25 ms after separated the tail of the underwater cavity will lose its stability under the action of kelvin helmholtz instability at t 35 ms fig 10 and some small bubbles keep shedding away during the sailing stage the cylinder is wrapped up fully by the cavity and the final cavity shape is similar for all of the surface closure patterns this pattern makes the cylinder velocity decrease visibly fig 6 c after the water entry while it has few effects on the variation trend of its displacement based on the experimental results the variations of the above cavity shapes at three velocities v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s are illustrated in fig 11 the results show that the splash at x 0 mm induced by the impact ejects upwards earlier and moves more actively when the entry velocity v 0 is 3 27 m s at t 5 and 15 ms fig 11a the air entraining cavity at v 0 2 49 m s has the least cavity radius with t 15 ms fig 11a b after the surface closure at t 25 35 ms the cavity moves downwards attached to the hollow cylinder with the least splash over the water surface for at v 0 3 87 m s fig 11c d 3 2 the mechanisms of different closure patterns the pressure distribution and variation can be used to explain the transition of cavity closure patterns to further illustrate the potential mechanism of different patterns the distributions and variations of the field pressure around the cylinder for three different patterns v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s at x 1 mm over the free surface x 0 is the free surface downward is positive are shown in fig 12 the time variations are from 3 ms to 15 ms which include the shift from the initial impact to the open cavity stage accompanied by jet development four flow regions including the through hole r 12 65 mm external cavity splash and surrounded air region are defined based on the cavity evolution process in figs 7 fig 8 and fig 10 and are labeled along the positive r axis in fig 12 it is clear that the highest pressure distribution is within the hollow cylinder r 12 65 mm and at the central axis because the liquid at the center is squeezed by fluid near the inner wall due to the impact of the cylinder on water and it leads to the formation of an upward through hole jet the increase of entry speed can also increase the maximum pressure level and the highest levels 101 68 kpa and 101 56 kpa both appear at v 0 3 87 m s in fig 12a b but its effects fade quickly and the pressure level becomes almost the same at t 10 and 15 ms fig 12c d however if the entry velocity is small enough like v 0 2 49 m s the highest pressure inside the cylinder is near the inner wall at the initial impact t 3 ms fig 12a and it will propagate to the center quickly t 5 ms fig 12b at last for all three cases the highest pressure inside the cylinder decreases to almost the same level atmosphere pressure and keeps stable along the radial axis outside of the cylinder r 15 mm the highest pressure area is the pressure wave caused by the impact of the cylinder on the water surface and propagates away with time the pressure becomes higher as the velocity is larger fig 12a b the lowest pressure appears inside of the cavity near the outer wall and the pressure becomes smaller as the velocity is larger fig 12a b therefore the induced pressure inside the cavity with v 0 3 87 m s has the smallest values however the pressure differences among these three cases are not large at the early stage t 10 ms because the cavity is still open and connects with the outside atmosphere but at t 10 ms the cavity tip of the case v 0 3 87 m s touches the cylinder wall which separates the cavity from the outer air therefore with the motion of the cylinder the air pressure within the cavity decreases sharply from 101 28 kpa to 99 6 kpa as described above we know that the higher the entry velocity is the lower the pressure becomes inside the cavity then the pressure difference δp between the cavity and atmosphere becomes larger which leads to the inward convergence of cavity tip quicker than those with smaller velocities fig 13 therefore with the velocity increases from 2 49 to 3 27 and 3 87 m s the cavity closure time comes earlier and earlier and three patterns deep closure surface closure on the jet and the cylinder wall occur respectively 3 3 the dynamic characteristics of the cylinder with three closure patterns to further study the dynamic characteristics of the hollow cylinder under the condition of three different closure patterns v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s the variations of the velocity and pressure contours around the cylinder during the water entry process are investigated fig 14 shows the case of deep closure pattern with v 0 2 49 m s at t 5 90 ms the velocity contours are shown in the left half of each image while the pressure contours are shown in the right half during the water entry the high pressure region is in front of the cylinder which is induced by the impact t 5 ms fig 14a which leads to the first sharp variation of the velocity and acceleration fig 17a c then the cavity is formed due to the splash and engulfing of air the first high speed region i appears at the tail of the cavity as shown in fig 14 b which means that the cavity is still engulfing air and it will last till t 40 ms fig 14c with the cavity shrinking the air in the cavity is pushed outside and the second high speed region ii is found over the water surface in fig 14c d it moves upwards and persists after the deep closure as shown in fig 14e j the deep closure induces another high speed region iii that appears inside the cavity around the pinch off position these indicate that the cavity contraction in the closure stage can accelerate the air upwards like a jet meanwhile a high pressure region is formed behind the cylinder at t 69 ms due to the extrusion and collision between the through hole jet and the converging flow in fig 14f which leads to the second sharp variation of the acceleration fig 17c then the high pressure wave propagates upwards and downwards respectively at t 71 ms fig 14g which leads to the fluctuation of the acceleration and drag force fig 17c d although the environmental underwater pressure increases with the increasing cylinder depth a low pressure region is still found at t 85 ms fig 14j around the inner wall inside the small cavity fig 7b correspondingly the velocity and pressure field during the water entry process at v 0 3 27 m s are presented in fig 15 in the impact and open cavity stage the high speed region i around the water surface forms in fig 15 b induced by the air entraining process following the cylinder since the convergence and seal of the splash appear faster the cavity is still engulfing air during the closure and the second ii high speed region coexists with the region i which is different from the first case as shown in fig 14b e furthermore the second high speed region ii acts weakly and disappears soon in fig 15 f the third high speed region iii induced by the cavity shrink underwater has low activity and is short in life fig 15g there is no distinct high speed air region appearing over the free surface which is different from the deep closure case and it indicates that the air ejection is weak in the surface closure for the pressure variation around the cylinder there is a high pressure region fig 15a in front of the cylinder and the low pressure region fig 15d inside the cavity at t 35 ms their formation patterns are the same as it in the deep closure case fig 14a d it seems that the surface closure induces smaller pressure fluctuation compared with the deep closure case the pressure in the cavity of the cylinder has the lowest pressure at first then it increases with the cylinder depth but it does not vibrate however the pressure of the inner cylinder wall keeps oscillating due to the bubbles shedding constantly at t 45 70 ms fig 15g i the low pressure region around the inside head in fig 15 g still exists due to the internal cavity as shown in the head at t 45 ms fig 8b finally it fades gradually in fig 15 j with the collapse of the internal cavity as shown in fig 8 b a high pressure region behind the cylinder is formed at t 85 ms fig 15j because of the wake flow convergence of the attached external cavity fig 16 presents the variations of the velocity and pressure field around the cylinder at v 0 3 87 m s the first high speed region i due to the entraining air appears around the impact point moreover it is strong following the cylinder wall and spreads over the whole external cavity as shown in fig 16a d however the second ii and third iii high speed regions induced by the cavity seal are both relatively weak and disappear soon as shown in fig 16 d and fig 16 g respectively compared with the other cavity closure cases mentioned above the earlier cavity seal leads to less air leakage and a higher air utilization rate to form the attached cavity for the pressure variations around the cylinder the widest high pressure region is observed in front of the cylinder head than the above two cases fig 14a and fig 15a due to the highest entry velocity t 5 ms fig 16a after the external cavity is sealed by the geometry at t 10 ms in fig 16b a low pressure region in the cavity is formed around the cylinder relative to the surrounding flow meanwhile the convergent splash leads to a small high pressure region distinctly at the seal locations in fig 16 c because of the horizontal impact of the splash on the outer wall at t 20 ms fig 10b during the process of the secondary seal at t 20 ms fig 10b the through hole jet and the convergent flow squeeze each other inducing a high pressure region behind the cylinder as shown in fig 16 e after the full cavity closure the internal bubbles shedding randomly t 35 75 ms fig 10b which induce the pressure fluctuation fig 16h k fig 17 shows the variations of depth and dynamic parameters of the hollow cylinder at different entry velocities the drag coefficient is defined as 3 1 c d f 0 5ρv 2 a where c d denotes the drag coefficient x is the depth v indicates the velocity a refers to acceleration and the drag force f is defined as 3 2 mg f ma where a ld c is the characteristic area of the model and l 1 is the unit length for the 2d simulation as shown in fig 17 a the variations of velocities are different for the above three cases v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s for small entry velocities v 0 2 49 and 3 27 m s they keep increasing during the entry processes and their corresponding accelerations are also positive fig 17c which indicates that the gravity force is larger than the hydrodynamic drag in these two cases with the entry velocity increases to 3 87 m s its variation becomes to decrease all the time fig 17c which indicates that the drag level is increased and larger than the cylinder gravity fig 17d although the variations of velocity are different for the above three cases however their depth x increases approximately linearly due to the short movement time and small cumulative effects of velocity variation fig 17a b as shown in fig 17 c d the acceleration and drag coefficients have the same trend with the same velocity during the whole water entry process and it can be verified by equations 3 1 3 2 in the free fall stage before the impact on the water surface the velocity acceleration and drag coefficient all have the same trend an obvious sharp modification appears firstly at the transient moment of water entry due to the tremendous impact force which is supported by the high pressure region in front of the cylinder head fig 14 a fig 15 a and fig 16a since then the changing trends of different cases have their own unique characteristics the second sharp fluctuation of the acceleration a and the drag c d appears shown in fig 17c d the reason is that the occurrence of a high pressure area fig 14f behind the hollow cylinder which is induced by the cavity closure the same phenomena can be observed around the closure time in the other cases besides the fluctuation of acceleration a and the drag c d appears earlier t 45 ms compared with the deep closure t 60 ms because the surface closure induces the variation of the surrounding field pressure earlier than the deep closure as shown in figs 14 16 4 conclusions in this paper the vertical water entry of a hollow cylinder with three different entry velocities is studied both experimentally and numerically our numerical results agree well with corresponding experimental results three different closure patterns of the air entraining cavity and formation mechanism are disclosed and analyzed which include the cavity evolution the velocity and pressure field variations and the splash convergence etc the main findings of this work are summarized as follows 1 for the vertical water entry of a hollow cylinder with small velocity the air entraining cavity is usually sealed in the form of the deep closure pattern with the increase of velocity the closure pattern evolves orderly into the surface closure on the through hole jet second then the geometry wall third this can be explained that the pressure inside the cavity decreases with the increase of the entry velocity therefore for a high entry velocity it leads to the fast shrink of the cavity due to the large pressure difference between the cavity and water and the closure cavity appears quickly 2 three high speed regions appear in sequence during the water entry process the region i appears at the beginning of cavity formation due to the engulfing the region ii is formed due to the cavity shrinkage and the inside air extruded outside and region iii is induced by the cavity closure three regions have different characteristics due to different closure patterns the high pressure area is always in front of the cylinder and the bubble shedding causes the pressure fluctuation 3 a hollow cylinder with small water entry velocities v 0 2 49 and 3 27 m s their velocities keep increasing almost linearly which means that their gravity is larger than the drag force with the increase of velocity v 0 3 87 m s the velocity becomes to decrease however their depths all increase linearly due to the short time and small variations of velocities the impact on the water surface and the cavity closure cause the sharp variations of drag and acceleration of the cylinder credit authorship contribution statement yu hou investigation software writing original draft writing review editing experiment writing original draft preparation

21100,the vertical water entry processes of a hollow cylinder with three different velocities are investigated both numerically and experimentally three different closure patterns and flow characteristics of the air entraining cavities induced by water entry processes are discovered and discussed our results show that three different closure patterns appear with the increase of entry velocity the deep closure the surface closure on the through hole jet and on the geometry wall three high speed regions also appear during the water entry process and their characteristics are different with various closure patterns besides with the increase of water entry velocity the velocity variation will vary from increase to decrease but their water depths all increase linearly due to the short time and small variations of velocities keywords water entry hollow cylinder cavity evolution closure pattern splash convergence 1 introduction when an object enters into the water some complex flow phenomena including the air entraining cavity splash the ejected jets and cavity closure pattern etc are generated and affect the underwater motion of the object extensive investigations on these events have been conducted since the initial works worthington 1883 due to their practical applications babbs 2019 truscott et al 2009 the closure pattern of the air entraining cavity and the splash formation have been widely studied in the early investigations the water entry of the solid spheres and the critical parameters including the atmospheric pressure p 0 entry velocity v 0 and sphere diameter d have been deeply studied for determining the cavity formation two cavity closure patterns gilbarg and anderson 1948 deep closure and surface closure splash seal are observed and accepted on the low speed water entry at b 0 103 bond number b 0 ρgd 2 γ where γ is the surface tension and g is gravitational acceleration they are classified roughly by the froude number fr v 0 gd 1 2 birkhoff and caywood 1949 lee et al 1997 the deep closure occurs at 201 2 fr 701 2 and the surface closure appears at fr 1501 2 in deep closure the cavity is closed and separated into two parts by an underwater point however the cavity is closed at a subsurface point around the water surface firstly in surface closure furthermore two extra patterns aristoff and bush 2009 the quasi static seal and the shallow seal versus froude number 10 1 2 fr 105 2 are added at 10 2 b 0 1 due to the intensive surface tension s influence in the quasi static seal the cavity collapses when the contact line approaches the apex of the sphere and the air entrainment is minimal after the entry velocity increases the shallow seal appears and the collapse happens near the free surface where the depth of the closure point is far less than that in deep closure furthermore the surface conditions of spheres hydrophobic or hydrophilic korkmaz and güzel 2017 speirs et al 2019 also decide whether the air entraining cavity will be formed successfully the similar two closure patterns deep and surface closure are also found during the water entry of a cylinder with different entry velocities by guo et al 2012 however the above rules of spheres are not fit for the cylinder projectiles fully the impact face of cylinder bodies is more complicated during the vertical water entry than that of spheres therefore the nose shapes of the cylinder have important effects on the cavity formation chen et al 2019 song et al 2020 truscott et al 2009 yan et al 2019 on the other hand the cavity shape can also be altered by the geometry wall of the projectile which has been mentioned by truscott et al 2014 the above closure pattern can also be extended to the water entry of the disk enriquez et al 2012 glasheen and mcmahon 1996 and the projectile with a disk cavitator jiang et al 2018 furthermore the cavity evolution is affected by some special conditions such as the water entry of tandem yun et al 2020 and parallel lu et al 2019 song et al 2018 objects a cylinder with attack angle xia et al 2020 a segmented cylinder with spring connected wu et al 2020 and a high speed projectile with container constraint effects guo et al 2020 the water entry of a hollow structure is widely applied in some engineering fields such as seaplane landing diclemente et al 2015 feng et al 2020 sea recovery of aerospace structures seddon and moatamedi 2006 and the water slamming of the high speed craft with a bottom artificial air cavity cucinotta et al 2017 gokcay et al 2004 matveev and morabito 2020 in this paper we aim to investigate the closure patterns of water entry cavities of a hollow projectile which are not very clear so far the hollow projectile is a new ammunition and has the shape of a concentric thin walled circular tube it has a strong penetration ability and lower flow drag zhao et al 2019 and can be used in the field of water entry the initial hydrodynamic investigation on the similar hollow structure underwater has been conducted by savchenko 2012 and the drag characteristics of disk cavitation with different apertures using a water tunnel have been studied experimentally furthermore the cavitating flows behind the disk cavitator with concentric holes of various diameters were investigated numerically by erfanian and anbarsooz 2018 it shows that the drag coefficient reduces with the increase of dimensionless hole diameter d hole d and when d hole d 0 6 the drag coefficient at all the cavitation numbers can be decreased about 30 percent compared with the normal disk cavitator which presents the potential applications in future underwater defence the water entry cavity evolution of a hollow projectile has been investigated recently by hou et al 2019a the research shows that a through hole jet with a top bubble is induced by the impact the cavity pinches off along the circumference of the through hole jet in the deep closure pattern furthermore the experimental investigation on the hollow cylinder has also been conducted at different entry velocities hou et al 2019b and the transition period from the deep closure to surface closure is found with the increasing entry velocity but the influences of the entry speeds on the splash convergence over the water surface and the transition mechanism have not yet been well investigated moreover the details of the fundamental flow characteristics with different closure patterns have not been dug into therefore this paper continues to use the numerical and experimental method to investigate the vertical water entry of the hollow cylinder at different entry speeds focusing on the closure pattern transition and fundamental hydrodynamic flow characteristics with different closure patterns the following content is organized as follows section 2 describes the experimental and numerical method including the model dimension and entry conditions the validations of mesh independency and the numerical method are also contained section 3 includes the results and discussions which consists of 3 subsections in section 3 1 three closure patterns are classified by the flow characteristics with different entry speeds and the transition mechanism is analyzed based on the pressure variation in section 3 2 section 3 3 discusses the velocity and pressure field characteristics and the cylinder dynamic parameters with different closure patterns respectively finally the main findings are summarized in section 4 2 investigation methods 2 1 experimental method the experiments are carried out in a water tank with the size of 1 0 m 0 7 m 1 0m and the water depth of 0 8m the hollow cylinder falls freely from a platform with an electromagnet to the water the entry process is captured by a high speed phantom camera with a frame rate of 2000fps and an image resolution of 1280 800 pixels the exposure time is set as 20μs under two 2600w spotlights to make the images clear all of the measured results of the displacements and velocities are the average values of six repeated experiments the entry velocity v 0 of the hollow cylinder is less than 4 m s and the maximum measurement error is estimated to be less than 5 the experimental system employed is the same as used in hou et al 2019a the detailed setup description and measuring method can also be found there 2 2 numerical method both large eddy simulation les and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans have been carried out for simulating the water entry process of hollow cylinder however the les takes much long time compared with rans and both numerical results can reveal the flow evolution during the entry process therefore rans is employed to describe the vertical water entry process based on the volume of fluid vof multiphase flow model and the two equation realizable k ε turbulence model is used to close the viscous equations hou et al 2019a the governing equations are discretized by the finite volume method and the simple scheme is used to solve the pressure velocity coupling algorithms the second order upwind scheme is applied for discretizing the convection terms and the central differenced for the diffusion term of the momentum equations the presto scheme is adopted for the pressure interpolation the explicit geo reconstruct scheme is employed to solve the transport equation for the volume fractions 2 3 computational model the hollow cylinder used is also the same as described in hou et al 2019a and is shown in fig 1 it is made of steel astm1045 and its geometric parameters are shown in table 1 the characteristic length is d c d 2 d 2 1 2 16 1 mm in this work the froude number is within fr v 0 g d c 1 2 6 10 bond number b 0 ρgd c 2 γ 1 and weber number we ρv 0 2 d c γ 1300 3500 where v 0 is the entry velocity of the cylinder ρ 998 2 kg m 3 refers to the water density and γ denotes the surface tension an axisymmetric two dimension domain is created for the simulation to improve computational efficiency as shown in fig 2 the symmetric half domain size is 7 5d 45d and the above water area is 7 5d 15d the hollow cylinder falls into the free water surface with various velocities the center of entry location and the impact moment are defined as the origin of the depth x 0 and time t 0 respectively the positive direction of the x coordinate is the same as gravity the stationary wall is chosen for both the right side and the bottom side the top boundary is set as pressure inlet the operating pressure p 0 is taken to be the standard atmospheric pressure 101325pa after several numerical tests it is ensured that the bottom boundary is deep enough not to affect the results the structured body fitted mesh is created for the axisymmetric domain and is shown in fig 3 a the area within the hollow cylinder is refined to improve the numerical accuracy and the mesh around the head is shown in fig 3 b the dynamic layer method is applied to update the mesh following the motion of the hollow cylinder 2 4 validations of mesh independency and numerical method this work uses commercial software ansys fluent to carried out the simulation five mesh levels of the computational domain with correspondingly coarser 0 34 million coarse 0 45 million medium 0 6 million fine 1 million and finer 1 35 million grid are examined for the mesh independency study the corresponding mesh sizes over the cylinder surface are shown in table 2 from the predicted depths x versus time in fig 4 the trend errors are mainly found in the late moving stages and eliminated gradually with the increasing grid density considering both the accuracy of results and the time cost the fine case with 1 million grids is good enough in the simulation besides the height of the first prism mesh around the cylinder is set as 4 10 5 m for the fine case its average values of the non dimensional distance y around the cylinder wall satisfy y 3 as shown in fig 5 in the fine case the courant number co δt u δx is used to control the convergence rate and stability where δt is time step u 4 m s is field velocity and δx 4 10 5 is the minimum grid size in this simulation the time step is set as 5 10 6s and the corresponding maximum co is 0 5 besides the iteration operates 20 times to make the solution converge at each time step to validate the above numerical method three typical numerical simulations are carried out to compare with corresponding experiments fig 6 the vertical entry velocities are chosen as v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s respectively as shown in fig 6 for all three cases our numerical results agree well with corresponding experimental measuring results firstly the depth x left ordinate variations for all three cases have the same tendencies which are proportional with time and the largest error between numerical and experimental is about 2 38 from the case of the smallest velocity v 0 2 49 m s fig 6a however the modifications of velocities v after entry right ordinate are more complicated which are related to the cavity closure modes detailed discussions can be seen in section 3 1 and the maximum error of 4 occurs in the same case v 0 2 49 m s fig 6a the velocity is almost proportional and increases versus entry time with the increase of entry velocity v 0 3 27 m s fig 6b it increases sharply at the first impact then it grows proportionally and slowly due to the high drag when the entry velocity is larger and becomes 3 87 m s fig 6c it keeps decreasing proportionally after the impact 3 results and discussions 3 1 three different cavity closure patterns for the cavity evolution of a water entry hollow cylinder four distinct stages the impact stage the open cavity stage the closure stage and the free sailing stage with cavity attached are found during the whole process hou et al 2019a the entry velocity v 0 is the key parameter that affects the characteristics of the closure pattern as we know there are usually two kinds of cavity closures deep closure and surface closure for water entry phenomena however for the water entry of a hollow cylinder based on our experimental and numerical investigations the surface closure can also be divided into two kinds one is the closure along with the through hole jet and the other is on the cylinder wall therefore there are three closure patterns actually one is the deep closure and the other two are the surface closures to explore their different evolutional mechanisms both the experimental and numerical studies are performed with various entry velocities 3 1 1 deep closure pattern for the water entry of a hollow projectile deep closure occurs at a small entry velocity in our case v 0 2 84 m s the description detail of cavity evolution can be found in hou et al 2019a here we take v 0 2 49 m s fr 6 3 as the example for discussion as shown in fig 7 between t 55 65 ms the deep closure occurs and induces the pinches off of the cavity during the initial impact stage from impact with water to submergence fully t 25 ms the hollow cylinder hits the free water surface and the flow is split up into two areas inside and outside of the cylinder area which increases the velocity slowly and its displacement increases proportionally fig 6 a inside the hollow cylinder a through hole jet forms and outside of the cylinder the cavity appears the through hole jet keeps ascending and a bubble forms at its tip the explanation can also be found in hou et al 2019a the jet tip turns into some droplets during the raising process at the same time the cavity keeps engulfing air and expanding in this process the kinetic energy is converted to the potential energy of the water which induces the external cavity expansion and the internal flow extrusion t 25 ms fig 7 when the cavity expands to the maximum it begins to shrink inwards t 35 ms fig 7 due to the pressure difference between the two sides of the cavity interface the deep closure of the cavity along the jet circumference separates it into two parts the open part is connected with the jet and the closed part is attached to the cylinder the open part of the cavity keeps moving upward with the jet till it moves out of the water surface on the other hand the closed part moves downward with the cylinder and some small air bubbles keep shedding from the cylinder bottom to form the two phase wake flow in this process the potential energy of the water is converted to the kinetic energy of the flow which induces the cavity shrinkage t 65 ms fig 7 and the annular ejection t 105 ms fig 7 3 1 2 surface closure on the through hole jet with the increase of the entry velocity the convergence of the cavity becomes faster two closure mechanisms deep and surface closure may appear in our study when the entry velocity increases to v 0 2 96 m s the closure pattern modifies from deep to surface and the cavity closes on the through hole jet with further increase of the velocity to v 0 3 87 m s the cavity closes fast enough on the cylinder surface even before the cylinder submerges into the water the modification of cavity closure mechanisms is discussed in section 3 2 a typical case for the surface closure on the through hole jet with v 0 3 27 m s fr 8 2 is shown in fig 8 both experimentally and numerically the flow structures are almost the same as that in fig 7 before the cylinder dives into the water t 5 15 ms the cylinder kinetic energy is converted to the water potential energy however at t 15 30 ms the splash obtains more kinetic energy and converges inwards more distinctly than that in fig 7 during the convergence process both the experimental and numerical results show that the splash curtain just touches the cylinder bottom at t 20 ms fig 8a b furthermore the splash apex rolls inwards and passes through the bottom at t 25 ms fig 8b and impacts with the through hole jet surface to achieve the cavity closure at about t 30 ms due to the surface closure the cavity is sealed entirely and is elongated with the move of the cylinder at the same time the internal shrinkage of the cavity is still in effect referring to the principle of cavity independent expansion logvinovich 1973 both effects make the cavity shape vary with time t 30 35 ms fig 8a b at about t 45 60 ms the pinch off process deep closure appears at the rear of the cavity and the cavity is split into two parts one part moves upward while the other is attached to the cylinder and moves downward unlike what happens in the deep closure pattern fig 7 the cavity fluctuates at the tail first and leads to some turbulent bubbles around the jet t 60 ms fig 8 which moves upward with the jet after the pinch off in the sailing stage the hollow cylinder moves downwards stably at t 70 ms with the attached cavity wrapped up fully and small air bubbles keep shedding away from the rear part of the cavity to form the wake flow in this case the surface closure on the through hole jet occurs earlier than the pinch off of the cavity underwater therefore the air entraining process is stopped earlier however the pinch off happens at the rear part of the cavity and provides the cavity with enough air to wrap up the cylinder fully at last besides the higher entry velocity makes the cylinder velocity increase slower ranging from about 3 3 m s to 3 6 m s and its displacement also increases proportionally fig 6 b to further study the transition characteristics the numerical results with nearby entry velocities v 0 2 96 m s and 3 10 m s are present in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 with the entry velocity decreases the surface closure is slowed down for v 0 3 27 m s the closure time is t 30 ms fig 8b and with v 0 3 10 m s and 2 96 m s the time become t 40 ms fig 9b and 45 ms respectively besides the distance l c between the first closure location point at the through hole jet and the cylinder bottom becomes larger with the decreased velocity for v 0 3 27 m s the shrink splash just passes and touches the cylinder bottom t 20 ms fig 8b and the distance l c 19 mm is the smallest when the surface closure happens t 30 ms fig 8 but l c 55 mm is the largest for v 0 2 96 m s at t 45 ms and the splash can t touch the cylinder bottom t 25 ms fig 9a after the surface closure the deep closure also appears for all the above three cases it appears more noticeably as shown in fig 9 a t 65 ms and fig 9 b t 60 ms when the water potential energy is converted to kinetic energy the main differences among them are the cavity volume of the upward part its volume becomes smaller as the entry velocity is larger 3 1 3 surface closure on the geometry wall after further increasing the entry velocity the cavity convergence becomes faster and may be sealed around the cylinder wall even before the cylinder submerges into the water to present this pattern clearly fig 10 shows a typical case at v 0 3 87 m s and fr 9 7 compared with the above patterns shown in figs 7 and 8 the splashed moving water curtain touches the cylinder wall first seal at t 10 ms fig 10 at this time almost half of the cylinder is still over the water surface and the cavity tip stays stable almost horizontal motion while the cylinder persists in moving down lastly the cylinder submerges into the water and the cavity tip impacts with the through hole jet second seal at t 25 30 ms fig 10a b the flow is divided into two new parts with opposite moving direction one moves downwards along with the cylinder wall the other ejects upwards with the through hole jet and induces some splashes over the water surface at t 25 ms after separated the tail of the underwater cavity will lose its stability under the action of kelvin helmholtz instability at t 35 ms fig 10 and some small bubbles keep shedding away during the sailing stage the cylinder is wrapped up fully by the cavity and the final cavity shape is similar for all of the surface closure patterns this pattern makes the cylinder velocity decrease visibly fig 6 c after the water entry while it has few effects on the variation trend of its displacement based on the experimental results the variations of the above cavity shapes at three velocities v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s are illustrated in fig 11 the results show that the splash at x 0 mm induced by the impact ejects upwards earlier and moves more actively when the entry velocity v 0 is 3 27 m s at t 5 and 15 ms fig 11a the air entraining cavity at v 0 2 49 m s has the least cavity radius with t 15 ms fig 11a b after the surface closure at t 25 35 ms the cavity moves downwards attached to the hollow cylinder with the least splash over the water surface for at v 0 3 87 m s fig 11c d 3 2 the mechanisms of different closure patterns the pressure distribution and variation can be used to explain the transition of cavity closure patterns to further illustrate the potential mechanism of different patterns the distributions and variations of the field pressure around the cylinder for three different patterns v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s at x 1 mm over the free surface x 0 is the free surface downward is positive are shown in fig 12 the time variations are from 3 ms to 15 ms which include the shift from the initial impact to the open cavity stage accompanied by jet development four flow regions including the through hole r 12 65 mm external cavity splash and surrounded air region are defined based on the cavity evolution process in figs 7 fig 8 and fig 10 and are labeled along the positive r axis in fig 12 it is clear that the highest pressure distribution is within the hollow cylinder r 12 65 mm and at the central axis because the liquid at the center is squeezed by fluid near the inner wall due to the impact of the cylinder on water and it leads to the formation of an upward through hole jet the increase of entry speed can also increase the maximum pressure level and the highest levels 101 68 kpa and 101 56 kpa both appear at v 0 3 87 m s in fig 12a b but its effects fade quickly and the pressure level becomes almost the same at t 10 and 15 ms fig 12c d however if the entry velocity is small enough like v 0 2 49 m s the highest pressure inside the cylinder is near the inner wall at the initial impact t 3 ms fig 12a and it will propagate to the center quickly t 5 ms fig 12b at last for all three cases the highest pressure inside the cylinder decreases to almost the same level atmosphere pressure and keeps stable along the radial axis outside of the cylinder r 15 mm the highest pressure area is the pressure wave caused by the impact of the cylinder on the water surface and propagates away with time the pressure becomes higher as the velocity is larger fig 12a b the lowest pressure appears inside of the cavity near the outer wall and the pressure becomes smaller as the velocity is larger fig 12a b therefore the induced pressure inside the cavity with v 0 3 87 m s has the smallest values however the pressure differences among these three cases are not large at the early stage t 10 ms because the cavity is still open and connects with the outside atmosphere but at t 10 ms the cavity tip of the case v 0 3 87 m s touches the cylinder wall which separates the cavity from the outer air therefore with the motion of the cylinder the air pressure within the cavity decreases sharply from 101 28 kpa to 99 6 kpa as described above we know that the higher the entry velocity is the lower the pressure becomes inside the cavity then the pressure difference δp between the cavity and atmosphere becomes larger which leads to the inward convergence of cavity tip quicker than those with smaller velocities fig 13 therefore with the velocity increases from 2 49 to 3 27 and 3 87 m s the cavity closure time comes earlier and earlier and three patterns deep closure surface closure on the jet and the cylinder wall occur respectively 3 3 the dynamic characteristics of the cylinder with three closure patterns to further study the dynamic characteristics of the hollow cylinder under the condition of three different closure patterns v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s the variations of the velocity and pressure contours around the cylinder during the water entry process are investigated fig 14 shows the case of deep closure pattern with v 0 2 49 m s at t 5 90 ms the velocity contours are shown in the left half of each image while the pressure contours are shown in the right half during the water entry the high pressure region is in front of the cylinder which is induced by the impact t 5 ms fig 14a which leads to the first sharp variation of the velocity and acceleration fig 17a c then the cavity is formed due to the splash and engulfing of air the first high speed region i appears at the tail of the cavity as shown in fig 14 b which means that the cavity is still engulfing air and it will last till t 40 ms fig 14c with the cavity shrinking the air in the cavity is pushed outside and the second high speed region ii is found over the water surface in fig 14c d it moves upwards and persists after the deep closure as shown in fig 14e j the deep closure induces another high speed region iii that appears inside the cavity around the pinch off position these indicate that the cavity contraction in the closure stage can accelerate the air upwards like a jet meanwhile a high pressure region is formed behind the cylinder at t 69 ms due to the extrusion and collision between the through hole jet and the converging flow in fig 14f which leads to the second sharp variation of the acceleration fig 17c then the high pressure wave propagates upwards and downwards respectively at t 71 ms fig 14g which leads to the fluctuation of the acceleration and drag force fig 17c d although the environmental underwater pressure increases with the increasing cylinder depth a low pressure region is still found at t 85 ms fig 14j around the inner wall inside the small cavity fig 7b correspondingly the velocity and pressure field during the water entry process at v 0 3 27 m s are presented in fig 15 in the impact and open cavity stage the high speed region i around the water surface forms in fig 15 b induced by the air entraining process following the cylinder since the convergence and seal of the splash appear faster the cavity is still engulfing air during the closure and the second ii high speed region coexists with the region i which is different from the first case as shown in fig 14b e furthermore the second high speed region ii acts weakly and disappears soon in fig 15 f the third high speed region iii induced by the cavity shrink underwater has low activity and is short in life fig 15g there is no distinct high speed air region appearing over the free surface which is different from the deep closure case and it indicates that the air ejection is weak in the surface closure for the pressure variation around the cylinder there is a high pressure region fig 15a in front of the cylinder and the low pressure region fig 15d inside the cavity at t 35 ms their formation patterns are the same as it in the deep closure case fig 14a d it seems that the surface closure induces smaller pressure fluctuation compared with the deep closure case the pressure in the cavity of the cylinder has the lowest pressure at first then it increases with the cylinder depth but it does not vibrate however the pressure of the inner cylinder wall keeps oscillating due to the bubbles shedding constantly at t 45 70 ms fig 15g i the low pressure region around the inside head in fig 15 g still exists due to the internal cavity as shown in the head at t 45 ms fig 8b finally it fades gradually in fig 15 j with the collapse of the internal cavity as shown in fig 8 b a high pressure region behind the cylinder is formed at t 85 ms fig 15j because of the wake flow convergence of the attached external cavity fig 16 presents the variations of the velocity and pressure field around the cylinder at v 0 3 87 m s the first high speed region i due to the entraining air appears around the impact point moreover it is strong following the cylinder wall and spreads over the whole external cavity as shown in fig 16a d however the second ii and third iii high speed regions induced by the cavity seal are both relatively weak and disappear soon as shown in fig 16 d and fig 16 g respectively compared with the other cavity closure cases mentioned above the earlier cavity seal leads to less air leakage and a higher air utilization rate to form the attached cavity for the pressure variations around the cylinder the widest high pressure region is observed in front of the cylinder head than the above two cases fig 14a and fig 15a due to the highest entry velocity t 5 ms fig 16a after the external cavity is sealed by the geometry at t 10 ms in fig 16b a low pressure region in the cavity is formed around the cylinder relative to the surrounding flow meanwhile the convergent splash leads to a small high pressure region distinctly at the seal locations in fig 16 c because of the horizontal impact of the splash on the outer wall at t 20 ms fig 10b during the process of the secondary seal at t 20 ms fig 10b the through hole jet and the convergent flow squeeze each other inducing a high pressure region behind the cylinder as shown in fig 16 e after the full cavity closure the internal bubbles shedding randomly t 35 75 ms fig 10b which induce the pressure fluctuation fig 16h k fig 17 shows the variations of depth and dynamic parameters of the hollow cylinder at different entry velocities the drag coefficient is defined as 3 1 c d f 0 5ρv 2 a where c d denotes the drag coefficient x is the depth v indicates the velocity a refers to acceleration and the drag force f is defined as 3 2 mg f ma where a ld c is the characteristic area of the model and l 1 is the unit length for the 2d simulation as shown in fig 17 a the variations of velocities are different for the above three cases v 0 2 49 3 27 and 3 87 m s for small entry velocities v 0 2 49 and 3 27 m s they keep increasing during the entry processes and their corresponding accelerations are also positive fig 17c which indicates that the gravity force is larger than the hydrodynamic drag in these two cases with the entry velocity increases to 3 87 m s its variation becomes to decrease all the time fig 17c which indicates that the drag level is increased and larger than the cylinder gravity fig 17d although the variations of velocity are different for the above three cases however their depth x increases approximately linearly due to the short movement time and small cumulative effects of velocity variation fig 17a b as shown in fig 17 c d the acceleration and drag coefficients have the same trend with the same velocity during the whole water entry process and it can be verified by equations 3 1 3 2 in the free fall stage before the impact on the water surface the velocity acceleration and drag coefficient all have the same trend an obvious sharp modification appears firstly at the transient moment of water entry due to the tremendous impact force which is supported by the high pressure region in front of the cylinder head fig 14 a fig 15 a and fig 16a since then the changing trends of different cases have their own unique characteristics the second sharp fluctuation of the acceleration a and the drag c d appears shown in fig 17c d the reason is that the occurrence of a high pressure area fig 14f behind the hollow cylinder which is induced by the cavity closure the same phenomena can be observed around the closure time in the other cases besides the fluctuation of acceleration a and the drag c d appears earlier t 45 ms compared with the deep closure t 60 ms because the surface closure induces the variation of the surrounding field pressure earlier than the deep closure as shown in figs 14 16 4 conclusions in this paper the vertical water entry of a hollow cylinder with three different entry velocities is studied both experimentally and numerically our numerical results agree well with corresponding experimental results three different closure patterns of the air entraining cavity and formation mechanism are disclosed and analyzed which include the cavity evolution the velocity and pressure field variations and the splash convergence etc the main findings of this work are summarized as follows 1 for the vertical water entry of a hollow cylinder with small velocity the air entraining cavity is usually sealed in the form of the deep closure pattern with the increase of velocity the closure pattern evolves orderly into the surface closure on the through hole jet second then the geometry wall third this can be explained that the pressure inside the cavity decreases with the increase of the entry velocity therefore for a high entry velocity it leads to the fast shrink of the cavity due to the large pressure difference between the cavity and water and the closure cavity appears quickly 2 three high speed regions appear in sequence during the water entry process the region i appears at the beginning of cavity formation due to the engulfing the region ii is formed due to the cavity shrinkage and the inside air extruded outside and region iii is induced by the cavity closure three regions have different characteristics due to different closure patterns the high pressure area is always in front of the cylinder and the bubble shedding causes the pressure fluctuation 3 a hollow cylinder with small water entry velocities v

21101,global navigation satellite system acoustic gnss a underwater positioning technique has drawn increasing attention in the fields of marine scientific research and engineering application the conventional positioning strategy of gnss a is to fix the positions of sea surface transducer in other words the positions of the transducer determined by gnss positioning at different epochs are regarded as accurate and unbiased and then estimate the underwater transponder s coordinate with acoustic ranging data however there inevitably exists bias in the estimation of transducer s positions and the precision varies at different epochs ignoring precision differences of the transducer s positions will lead to a worse estimation of the transponder s coordinate in this contribution we propose a total adjustment ta method where the positions of both sea surface transducer and seafloor transponder are treated as unknown parameters and the transducer s positions determined by gnss positioning at different epochs are introduced as virtual observations in order to reduce the computation load caused by large increase of estimation parameters an equivalent transformation is applied to observation equations to remove estimation parameters for the transducer s positions at different epochs to evaluate the performance of the proposed total adjustment method a series of simulation tests and a sea trail experiment were carried out testing results show that as compared with the traditional method the positioning accuracy with the proposed method can be improved by about 10 33 in

introduction in the past decades global navigation satellite system acoustic gnss a underwater positioning technology has attracted extensive interest spiess 1985a 1985b spiess et al 1998 and widely applied in marine crustal deformation seafloor seismic risk evaluation off shore exploration and ocean engineering bürgmann and chadwell 2014 desanto et al 2016 kido et al 2015 maksymowicz et al 2017 petersen et al 2019 watanabe et al 2015 yokota et al 2015 the whole of gnss a underwater positioning is composed of two parts one is to determine the transducer s position which can be derived according to the relative relationship between gnss antenna and transducer as the gnss antenna is positioned by applying gnss observations the other is to determine the transponder s position with acoustic ranging observation between transducer and transponder fujita et al 2006 gagnon et al 2005 ikuta et al 2008 spiess et al 1998 as for the data processing strategy of the latter part it is generally assumed that the position of transducer determined by gnss positioning is accurate and unbiased and only the transponder s position is estimated with least square adjustment or other estimation methods chen and wang 2011 kido et al 2008 osada et al 2003 sakic et al 2018 2020 yamada et al 2002 however the assumption is not completely consistent with the reality specifically there inevitably exists bias in the estimation of the transducer s positions and the precision varies at different epochs ignoring precision differences of the transducer s positions at different epochs will lead to a worse estimation of the transponder s coordinate kido et al 2004 this paper aims to provide a precise total adjustment ta method for gnss a underwater positioning different from previous works the positions of both transducer and transponder are treated as unknown parameters in acoustic ranging equation at the same time the transducer s positions determined by gnss positioning at different epochs are regarded as virtual observations which are also added into adjustment equation system in order to reduce the computing burden due to large increase of unknown parameters an equivalent transformation is conducted to observation equations to remove estimation parameters for the transducer s positions at different epochs this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the conventional gnss a underwater positioning model is presented in section 3 the proposed total adjustment method is discussed in detail including mathematical model parameter estimation strategy and superiority analysis in section 4 a series of simulation tests and a sea trail experiment were carried out to assess the performance of the proposed total adjustment method finally conclusions are summarized in the last section 2 conventional gnss a underwater positioning model gnss a underwater positioning technology is usually carried out by a surveying vessel sailing around a seafloor transponder shown as fig 1 the surveying vessel is equipped with a gnss receiver and an attitude sensor on the deck and a transducer at the bottom of surveying vessel it should be noted that there may be a backup gnss receiver installed the surveying vessel on the sea can be positioned by gnss precise positioning technology the relationship between gnss antenna and transducer in the vessel coordinate system vcs can be calibrated accurately before voyage the attitudes namely heading pitch and roll are measured by an attitude sensor the corrected position of transducer is determined through attitude compensation according to the relative relationship of gnss antenna and transducer while the surveying vessel sails around the seafloor transponder the transducer installed at the bottom of the surveying vessel transmits acoustic signals at a certain frequency and records the acoustic time of arrival toa when receiving seafloor transponder s feedback signal gagnon and chadwell 2007 kido et al 2006 kussat et al 2005 the observed travel time is converted to the acoustic range according to the ray tracing method with a sound velocity structure obtained by sound velocity profilers svps expendable conductivity temperature depth xctd profilers or expendable bathythermograph xbt chadwell and sweeney 2010 yokota et al 2018 the transponder s position can be obtained by ranging intersection denoting the seafloor transponder s position vector as x p x p y p z p t and the transducer s position vector at time t i i 1 2 n as x i d x i y i z i t where i represents the observation sampling epoch the ranging measurement reads as 1 ρ i f x p x i d δ ρ v i δ ρ t i ε i where f x p x i d x p x i d stands for the geometric distance between transducer and

design matrix with a size of n 3 ε s is the error vector with a length of n which is composed by measurement noise and other ranging errors such as the sound velocity error and the time delay error the unknown parameters can be estimated by applying the least square method 4 φ ˆ p g t p 1 g 1 g t p 1 s where p 1 is the weight matrix of acoustic ranging observations which can be regarded as an identity matrix or determined by refined underwater acoustic positioning stochastic model wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 however there inevitably exists bias in the estimation of transducer s position determined by gnss positioning and the precision varies at different epochs in the conventional method the transducer s positions at different epochs are fixed and the variable uncertainty of the transducer s positions is ignored it will weaken the performance of underwater positioning adjustment system and lead to a worse estimation of the transponder s position 3 total adjustment 3 1 mathematical model of total adjustment considering that the precision of transducer determined by gnss positioning varies at different epochs it is more suitable that the positions of both the sea surface transducer and seafloor transponder are treated as unknown parameters at the same time the transducer s positions determined by gnss positioning at different epochs are introduced as virtual observations such a total adjustment method is expected to obtain a better estimation of the transponder s position since the positions of both transducer and transponder are unknown parameters eq 1 should be linearized as 5 ρ i f x p 0 x i d 0 g i φ p h i φ i d δ ρ v i δ ρ t i ε i where x i d 0 x i d 0 y i d 0 z i d 0 t is the approximate coordinate vector of the transducer at the i t h epoch x

transponder s position φ d φ 1 d t φ 2 d t φ n d t t is the estimation parameter vector with a length of 3 n for the transducer s positions at all epochs ε s represents the ranging error vector with a length of n obviously the number of unknown parameters in the equations has increased as compared with eq 3 the position of the transducer determined by gnss positioning can be introduced as virtual

block diagonal matrix used to weight the observation including acoustic ranging observations and virtual observations with a size of 4 n 4 n p b l k d i a g p 1 p 2 for the specific transponder with the increase of the acoustic incident angle the acoustic ray bending error becomes more significant thus the ranging accuracy is worse the matrix p 1 is determined by the stochastic model based on acoustic incident angle zhao et al 2018 as for the matrix p 2 it is determined according to the gnss positioning accuracy 3 2 parameter estimation of total adjustment the number of unknown parameters is largely increased in the mathematical model of total adjustment as compared with the conventional method it will bring a huge amount of computation burden however only position of the seafloor transponder is of our interest and the estimations for the transducer s positions at different epochs are nuisance parameters xu 2011 in this paper an equivalent transformation is applied to observation equations to remove estimation parameters for the transducers positions the linearized observation equation system of the total adjustment defined by eq 9 can be presented as 10 l a b φ p φ d ε l p the normal equation system based on least square principle can be formed by 11 m 11 m 12 m 21 m 22 φ p φ d w 1 w 2 where m 11 a t pa m 12 a t pb m 21 b t pa m 22 b t pb w 1 a t pl w 2 b t pl an equivalent transformation is applied by multiplying the matrix c to eq 11 12 c m 11 m 12 m 21 m 22 φ p φ d c w 1 w 2 where 13 c i 3 0 i 3 z 14 z m 12 m 22 1 eq 12 can be rewritten as 15 m 11 m 12 m

of m 22 the bottom part of eq 15 can be expressed as 18 a t p e 4 n b m 22 1 b t p a φ p a t p e 4 n b m 22 1 b t p l assuming 19 j b m 22 1 b t p the matrix e 4 n j is idempotent and e 4 n j t p is symmetric zhang 2004 which means 20 e 4 n j 2 e 4 n j 21 e 4 n j t p p e 4 n j by applying eq 19 21 eq 18 can be rewritten as 22 a t e 4 n j t p e 4 n j a φ p a t e 4 n j t pl denoting 23 f e 4 n j a the transponder s position can be estimated as 24 φ ˆ p f t pf 1 f t pl the unknown parameter vector φ d has been eliminated in eq 18 and thus the computation load caused by large increase of estimation parameters has been reduced the most time consuming and storage occupation in the least square estimation is the matrix inversion manipulation especially for large matrix we assume that there are m seafloor transponders and n ranging measurements for each transponder for the direct estimation of all unknowns the computational complexity of the inversion manipulation by using the lower upper lu decomposition is o 3 m 3 n 3 for the normal matrix with the size of 3 m 3 n 3 m 3 n cormen et al 2009 as for the equivalent transformation method the size of normal matrix is reduced to 3 3 during the processing of equivalent transformation the size of matrix to be inverted is no more than 3 n 3 n therefore the computational complexity of the matrix inversion manipulation is no more than o 3 n 3 in other words the computation burden can be reduced with the proposed method 3 3 the superiority of total adjustment the following is the theoretical analysis about the superiority of the proposed total adjustment as compared with the conventional method as for the conventional method according to the cofactor propagation law huang 1992 combining with eq 4 the cofactor matrix for parameter vector φ ˆ p l s is given as 25 q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p l s n g 1 where n g g t p 1 g the superscript l s stands for the least square method as for the total adjustment method combining with eq 9 the error equation system of the total adjustment reads 26 v k φ ˆ t a s y φ ˆ t a r 0 where v is the residual error φ ˆ t a φ ˆ p t a φ ˆ d y 0 e k g h and the superscript t a stands for the total adjustment method then the total adjustment model was applied according to the following estimation criterion 27 ω v t pv 2 λ t y φ ˆ t a r m i n where λ is the lagrange coefficient matrix when taking the partial derivative of the above equation with respect to parameters the following equality is true 28 n 2 φ ˆ t a y t λ u 2 where n 2 k t pk u 2 k t ps the bottom part of eq 26 is multiplied by the matrix y n 2 1 and combining eq 28 the lagrange coefficient matrix can be calculated by 29 λ y n 2 1 y t 1 r y n 2 1 u 2 the parameter vector for transponder s position can be presented by 30 φ ˆ

parameter vector φ ˆ p t a is presented by 32 q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p t a n a 1 n b 1 n g 1 n b 1 based on the positive definite property of matrix n b 1 combining with eqs 25 and 32 the following inequalities hold 33 q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p t a q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p l s 34 t r q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p t a t r q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p l s t r refers to the trace operator it means that the trace of cofactor matrix for parameter vector of the proposed total adjustment is smaller than that of the conventional method therefore it is expected that as compared with conventional method the total adjustment method can perform better in terms of the precision of the estimation for seafloor transponder s position 4 results and analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed total adjustment method a series of simulation tests and a field experiment were carried out in this section 4 1 simulated tests a series of simulated positioning tests with a single seafloor transponder at different depths were carried out the transponder was located at the seafloor with the coordinate of 0 m 0 m d e p t h the water depth was assumed at 100m 500m 1000m and 3000m the surveying vessel was simulated to sail around the seafloor transponder with the speed of 5kn h approximately 2 569 m s and the surveying track was assumed to be a circle as the radius was equal to the water depth the surface wave height was modeled as a cosine wave of 2 m in order to keep consistent with the actual marine environment the sketch map of surveying track is shown as fig 2 based on the known positions of acoustic transducer and seafloor transponder as well as the svp data the travel time of acoustic signal can be computed with the inverse ray tracing method sakic et al 2018 in our simulation the stratified constant gradient ray tracking method was applied zhao and liu 2008 in addition the canonical svp after munk 1974 as shown in fig 3 was adopted and the surface sound velocity was set to 1548 m s in terms of measurement errors the sound velocity errors were simulated according to the empirical formula xu et al 2005 the hardware signal time delay in the magnitude of 10 5 s was added to the travelling time of acoustic signals sakic et al 2020 and the precision of ranging errors was set to 0 4 of the distances between surface transducer and seafloor transponder the transducer s positions were noised with a white noise of two different level half of transducer s positions were noised by white noises with a standard deviation of 5 cm 5 cm and 10 cm in the east north and up directions respectively the other half part was noised by white noises with a standard deviation of 10 cm 10 cm and 20 cm in the three directions the sampling rate of acoustic observations was set as 5s 8s 10s and 15s with respect to the water depth of 100m 500m 1000m and 3000m correspondingly the number of ranging measurements is 48 152 244 and 488 the simulation was performed 500 times for each water depth setups the conventional method and the proposed total adjustment method were adopted to estimate the transponder s position positioning errors in the east north and up directions were shown in fig 4 generally in shallow sea with the water depth less than 500m positioning errors in three directions are smaller than 15 cm for both two methods and positioning errors are smaller than 30 cm when water depth is greater than 500m the total adjustment method presents a more stable positioning errors and has a better performance than the conventional method statistics of positioning errors with two methods are presented in fig 5 in the shallow water the average of positioning errors with the total adjustment method is slightly reduced as compared with the least square method as for the deep water the average of positioning errors is largely decreased by applying the total adjustment method especially in the east and north directions the standard deviation std values of positioning errors for both methods rise up with the increase of water depth std values in the total adjustment method is invariably smaller than those in the traditional method it means that the proposed method can perform a more stable positioning performance than the conventional method for different water depth in terms of root mean square rms values the 2 dimension 2 d rms values of positioning errors with the total adjustment method are 0 042m 0 054m 0 066m and 0 064m for the water depth of 100m 500m 100m and 3000m respectively while the traditional method performs a 2 d rms of 0 047m 0 079m 0 100m and 0 119m the 3 dimension 3 d rms values of positioning errors with the proposed method are 0 065m 0 076m 0 092m and 0 113m whereas the rms values are 0 072m 0 105m 0 135m and 0 168m with the traditional method the 3 d rms values of positioning errors with the proposed method are improved by 10 28 32 and 33 compared with the traditional method for four water depths respectively the 3 d rms values of positioning errors are improved 26 in average when adopting the proposed method to further investigate the performance of the proposed method we carried out a simulation test with a multiple line trajectory as shown in fig 6 the surveying track was composed of 5 transverse lines and 4 longitudinal lines the length of one track line is around 7400m and the spacing of the parallel lines is approximate 1500m the transponder was located at the seafloor with the coordinate of 3000m 3000m 3000m the speed of surveying ship and simulated errors are same as that in the simulation test with a circular track the number of ranging measurements in this simulation test is 1016 the simulation was also performed 500 times the conventional method and the proposed total adjustment method were adopted to estimate the transponder s position positioning errors in east north and up directions were shown in fig 7 the positioning error with the conventional method reaches up to 0 360m in the east direction and 0 370m in the north direction whereas positioning errors with the proposed method are no more than 0 250m and 0 220m respectively in the up direction the positioning error with conventional method ranges from 0 459m to 0 086m whereas positioning error with the proposed method varies between 0 320m and 0 067m the total adjustment method presents a more stable positioning result and has a better performance than the conventional method table 1 lists the average values rms values of 2 d and 3 d positioning errors the average value of 2 d positioning errors with the conventional method is 0 092m whereas that with the proposed method is 0 052m similarly as for the average value of 3 d positioning errors the proposed method can still perform better than the conventional method in terms of rms values the 3 d rms values with the proposed method is 0 204m which is smaller than that of 0 262m with the conventional method the 3 d rms value of positioning errors with the proposed method is improved by 22 compared with the traditional method it means that the proposed method can provide a better performance than the traditional method 4 2 field test to further evaluate positioning performance of the proposed total adjustment method the real sea dataset was collected in the south china sea from october 24 to november 7 2016 the surveying ship is bgp dfkt 2 bureau of geophysical prospecting dong fang kan tan 2 with the length of 65 82 m and the width of 13 8m the average depth is 81 45m in the experimental area the ship was equipped with gyrocompass starfire dgps differential global positioning system echo sounders sound velocity profiler and acoustic positioning system developed by uk sonardyne company the major instruments are shown in fig 8 three gnss antennas and the acoustic transducer were installed as presented in fig 9 two gnss antennas were installed near the bow while another gnss antenna was installed at the stern the acoustic transducer was installed at the port side of the ship 39 transponders were attached to the cable which was laid at the seafloor and was recycled after the experiment the surveying ship sailed around the seafloor transponders as shown in fig 10 interrogation signals were transmitted simultaneously from the transducer and received by multiple transponders answers from multiple transponders were fed back to the transducer and they were distinguished by using frequency division multiple access fdma technology it is noted that two surveying cruises were carried out to collect acoustic measurements in our experiment 3 d surveying tracks are shown in fig 10 the sound velocity information was measured per second by saiv a s sd204 ctd std the time length of acoustic ranging measurement is about 3 h during the whole experiment the gnss antennas positions at different epochs were determined by gnss positioning technology the ship attitudes acoustic travel times and sound velocity profiles were also obtained given that the offsets between the gnss antennas and the transducer were known the transducer s positions were determined the accuracy of acoustic travel time was approximately 30 μs and the sampling rate is 3s statistics about observations of two surveying voyage are shown in fig 11 considering that the seafloor transponders of nos 37 and 39 are lack of essential observations these two transponders are dropped out in the following evaluation of positioning performance two independent surveying cruises were carried out by bgp dfkt 2 ship and all observations were correspondingly divided into two datasets the difference of positioning results with two datasets can be obtained for each transponder obviously the difference of positioning results with two datasets is a kind of external coincidence accuracy indicator and it can be used to compare the positioning performance of the traditional method and the proposed method the average and std of positioning differences for 37 transponders are counted and presented in table 2 in general the average of positioning differences in the north direction is smaller than that in the east direction and the average of positioning differences in the up direction is worst among three directions such a situation may be resulted from that the surveying trajectory was roughly coplanar and along north direction the averaged positioning differences in the east north and up directions are reduced by 22 10 and 14 as compared with traditional method judging from std values the proposed method presents a more stable positioning performance than the conventional method the residuals for each transponder are calculated after adjustment and shown in fig 12 for the conventional method the ranging residuals of 89 transponders are lower than 0 3m as for the total adjustment method the ranging residuals of 96 transponders are lower than 0 1m in the traditional method the residuals of transponder nos 12 and 20 are worse than others however the proposed method can still perform well even for these two transponders owing to introducing additional constraint information error bars in fig 12 also indicates that a more stable positioning performance can be provided by the total adjustment method 5 conclusions the traditional gnss a underwater positioning technique is to fix the transducer s position actually there are inevitable bias in the estimation of transducer s position and the precision varies at different epochs ignoring precision differences of the transducer s positions at different epochs will lead to a worse estimation of the transponder s position to improve the underwater positioning accuracy a total adjustment of the sea surface transducer and seafloor transponder is proposed specifically the positions of both the sea surface transducer and seafloor transponder are treated as unknown parameters and the transducers positions determined by gnss positioning at different epochs are introduced as virtual observations to reduce the huge computation burden caused by large increase of estimation parameters an equivalent transformation is applied to observation equations to remove estimation parameters for transducers positions both the simulation and field tests were carried out to access the performance of the proposed method in the simulation test of circular surveying track the positioning accuracy with the proposed method are averagely improved by about 10 27 32 and 33 for the water depth of 100m 500m 1000m and 3000m as compared with the traditional method as for the simulation test with multiple line surveying track 3 d rms values is reduced from 0 262m with the conventional method to 0 204m with the proposed method in the field experiment positioning differences between transponder s positions estimated with observations from different surveying cruise are averagely reduced by about 15 for 37 seafloor transponders both the simulation and field tests show that the proposed method can perform better than the conventional method in the seafloor points positioning author contributions s z z w and z n contributed to the

introduction in the past decades global navigation satellite system acoustic gnss a underwater positioning technology has attracted extensive interest spiess 1985a 1985b spiess et al 1998 and widely applied in marine crustal deformation seafloor seismic risk evaluation off shore exploration and ocean engineering bürgmann and chadwell 2014 desanto et al 2016 kido et al 2015 maksymowicz et al 2017 petersen et al 2019 watanabe et al 2015 yokota et al 2015 the whole of gnss a underwater positioning is composed of two parts one is to determine the transducer s position which can be derived according to the relative relationship between gnss antenna and transducer as the gnss antenna is positioned by applying gnss observations the other is to determine the transponder s position with acoustic ranging observation between transducer and transponder fujita et al 2006 gagnon et al 2005 ikuta et al 2008 spiess et al 1998 as for the data processing strategy of the latter part it is generally assumed that the position of transducer determined by gnss positioning is accurate and unbiased and only the transponder s position is estimated with least square adjustment or other estimation methods chen and wang 2011 kido et al 2008 osada et al 2003 sakic et al 2018 2020 yamada et al 2002 however the assumption is not completely consistent with the reality specifically there inevitably exists bias in the estimation of the transducer s positions and the precision varies at different epochs ignoring precision differences of the transducer s positions at different epochs will lead to a worse estimation of the transponder s coordinate kido et al 2004 this paper aims to provide a precise total adjustment ta method for gnss a underwater positioning different from previous works the positions of both transducer and transponder are treated as unknown parameters in acoustic ranging equation at the same time the transducer s positions determined by gnss positioning at different epochs are regarded as virtual observations which are also added into adjustment equation system in order to reduce the computing burden due to large increase of unknown parameters an equivalent transformation is conducted to observation equations to remove estimation parameters for the transducer s positions at different epochs this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the conventional gnss a underwater positioning model is presented in section 3 the proposed total adjustment method is discussed in detail including mathematical model parameter estimation strategy and superiority analysis in section 4 a series of simulation tests and a sea trail experiment were carried out to assess the performance of the proposed total adjustment method finally conclusions are summarized in the last section 2 conventional gnss a underwater positioning model gnss a underwater positioning technology is usually carried out by a surveying vessel sailing around a seafloor transponder shown as fig 1 the surveying vessel is equipped with a gnss receiver and an attitude sensor on the deck and a transducer at the bottom of surveying vessel it should be noted that there may be a backup gnss receiver installed the surveying vessel on the sea can be positioned by gnss precise positioning technology the relationship between gnss antenna and transducer in the vessel coordinate system vcs can be calibrated accurately before voyage the attitudes namely heading pitch and roll are measured by an attitude sensor the corrected position of transducer is determined through attitude compensation according to the relative relationship of gnss antenna and transducer while the surveying vessel sails around the seafloor transponder the transducer installed at the bottom of the surveying vessel transmits acoustic signals at a certain frequency and records the acoustic time of arrival toa when receiving seafloor transponder s feedback signal gagnon and chadwell 2007 kido et al 2006 kussat et al 2005 the observed travel time is converted to the acoustic range according to the ray tracing method with a sound velocity structure obtained by sound velocity profilers svps expendable conductivity temperature depth xctd profilers or expendable bathythermograph xbt chadwell and sweeney 2010 yokota et al 2018 the transponder s position can be obtained by ranging intersection denoting the seafloor transponder s position vector as x p x p y p z p t and the transducer s position vector at time t i i 1 2 n as x i d x i y i z i t where i represents the observation sampling epoch the ranging measurement reads as 1 ρ i f x p x i d δ ρ v i δ ρ t i ε i where f x p x i d x p x i d stands for the geometric distance between transducer and

design matrix with a size of n 3 ε s is the error vector with a length of n which is composed by measurement noise and other ranging errors such as the sound velocity error and the time delay error the unknown parameters can be estimated by applying the least square method 4 φ ˆ p g t p 1 g 1 g t p 1 s where p 1 is the weight matrix of acoustic ranging observations which can be regarded as an identity matrix or determined by refined underwater acoustic positioning stochastic model wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 however there inevitably exists bias in the estimation of transducer s position determined by gnss positioning and the precision varies at different epochs in the conventional method the transducer s positions at different epochs are fixed and the variable uncertainty of the transducer s positions is ignored it will weaken the performance of underwater positioning adjustment system and lead to a worse estimation of the transponder s position 3 total adjustment 3 1 mathematical model of total adjustment considering that the precision of transducer determined by gnss positioning varies at different epochs it is more suitable that the positions of both the sea surface transducer and seafloor transponder are treated as unknown parameters at the same time the transducer s positions determined by gnss positioning at different epochs are introduced as virtual observations such a total adjustment method is expected to obtain a better estimation of the transponder s position since the positions of both transducer and transponder are unknown parameters eq 1 should be linearized as 5 ρ i f x p 0 x i d 0 g i φ p h i φ i d δ ρ v i δ ρ t i ε i where x i d 0 x i d 0 y i d 0 z i d 0 t is the approximate coordinate vector of the transducer at the i t h epoch x

transponder s position φ d φ 1 d t φ 2 d t φ n d t t is the estimation parameter vector with a length of 3 n for the transducer s positions at all epochs ε s represents the ranging error vector with a length of n obviously the number of unknown parameters in the equations has increased as compared with eq 3 the position of the transducer determined by gnss positioning can be introduced as virtual

the increase of the acoustic incident angle the acoustic ray bending error becomes more significant thus the ranging accuracy is worse the matrix p 1 is determined by the stochastic model based on acoustic incident angle zhao et al 2018 as for the matrix p 2 it is determined according to the gnss positioning accuracy 3 2 parameter estimation of total adjustment the number of unknown parameters is largely increased in the mathematical model of total adjustment as compared with the conventional method it will bring a huge amount of computation burden however only position of the seafloor transponder is of our interest and the estimations for the transducer s positions at different epochs are nuisance parameters xu 2011 in this paper an equivalent transformation is applied to observation equations to remove estimation parameters for the transducers positions the linearized observation equation system of the total adjustment defined by eq 9 can be presented as 10 l a b φ p φ d ε l p the normal equation system based on least square principle can be formed by 11 m 11 m 12 m 21 m 22 φ p φ d w 1 w 2 where m 11 a t pa m 12 a t pb m 21 b t pa m 22 b t pb w 1 a t pl w 2 b t pl an equivalent transformation is applied by multiplying the matrix c to eq 11 12 c m 11 m 12 m 21 m 22 φ p φ d c w 1 w 2 where 13 c i 3 0 i 3 z 14 z m 12 m 22 1 eq 12 can be rewritten as 15 m 11 m 12 m

the transponder s position can be estimated as 24 φ ˆ p f t pf 1 f t pl the unknown parameter vector φ d has been eliminated in eq 18 and thus the computation load caused by large increase of estimation parameters has been reduced the most time consuming and storage occupation in the least square estimation is the matrix inversion manipulation especially for large matrix we assume that there are m seafloor transponders and n ranging measurements for each transponder for the direct estimation of all unknowns the computational complexity of the inversion manipulation by using the lower upper lu decomposition is o 3 m 3 n 3 for the normal matrix with the size of 3 m 3 n 3 m 3 n cormen et al 2009 as for the equivalent transformation method the size of normal matrix is reduced to 3 3 during the processing of equivalent transformation the size of matrix to be inverted is no more than 3 n 3 n therefore the computational complexity of the matrix inversion manipulation is no more than o 3 n 3 in other words the computation burden can be reduced with the proposed method 3 3 the superiority of total adjustment the following is the theoretical analysis about the superiority of the proposed total adjustment as compared with the conventional method as for the conventional method according to the cofactor propagation law huang 1992 combining with eq 4 the cofactor matrix for parameter vector φ ˆ p l s is given as 25 q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p l s n g 1 where n g g t p 1 g the superscript l s stands for the least square method as for the total adjustment method combining with eq 9 the error equation system of the total adjustment reads 26 v k φ ˆ t a s y φ ˆ t a r 0 where v is the residual error φ ˆ t a φ ˆ p t a φ ˆ d y 0 e k g h and the superscript t a stands for the total adjustment method then the total adjustment model was applied according to the following estimation criterion 27 ω v t pv 2 λ t y φ ˆ t a r m i n where λ is the lagrange coefficient matrix when taking the partial derivative of the above equation with respect to parameters the following equality is true 28 n 2 φ ˆ t a y t λ u 2 where n 2 k t pk u 2 k t ps the bottom part of eq 26 is multiplied by the matrix y n 2 1 and combining eq 28 the lagrange coefficient matrix can be calculated by 29 λ y n 2 1 y t 1 r y n 2 1 u 2 the parameter vector for transponder s position can be presented by 30 φ ˆ

parameter vector φ ˆ p t a is presented by 32 q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p t a n a 1 n b 1 n g 1 n b 1 based on the positive definite property of matrix n b 1 combining with eqs 25 and 32 the following inequalities hold 33 q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p t a q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p l s 34 t r q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p t a t r q φ ˆ p φ ˆ p l s t r refers to the trace operator it means that the trace of cofactor matrix for parameter vector of the proposed total adjustment is smaller than that of the conventional method therefore it is expected that as compared with conventional method the total adjustment method can perform better in terms of the precision of the estimation for seafloor transponder s position 4 results and analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed total adjustment method a series of simulation tests and a field experiment were carried out in this section 4 1 simulated tests a series of simulated positioning tests with a single seafloor transponder at different depths were carried out the transponder was located at the seafloor with the coordinate of 0 m 0 m d e p t h the water depth was assumed at 100m 500m 1000m and 3000m the surveying vessel was simulated to sail around the seafloor transponder with the speed of 5kn h approximately 2 569 m s and the surveying track was assumed to be a circle as the radius was equal to the water depth the surface wave height was modeled as a cosine wave of 2 m in order to keep consistent with the actual marine environment the sketch map of surveying track is shown as fig 2 based on the known positions of acoustic transducer and seafloor transponder as well as the svp data the travel time of acoustic signal can be computed with the inverse ray tracing method sakic et al 2018 in our simulation the stratified constant gradient ray tracking method was applied zhao and liu 2008 in addition the canonical svp after munk 1974 as shown in fig 3 was adopted and the surface sound velocity was set to 1548 m s in terms of measurement errors the sound velocity errors were simulated according to the empirical formula xu et al 2005 the hardware signal time delay in the magnitude of 10 5 s was added to the travelling time of acoustic signals sakic et al 2020 and the precision of ranging errors was set to 0 4 of the distances between surface transducer and seafloor transponder the transducer s positions were noised with a white noise of two different level half of transducer s positions were noised by white noises with a standard deviation of 5 cm 5 cm and 10 cm in the east north and up directions respectively the other half part was noised by white noises with a standard deviation of 10 cm 10 cm and 20 cm in the three directions the sampling rate of acoustic observations was set as 5s 8s 10s and 15s with respect to the water depth of 100m 500m 1000m and 3000m correspondingly the number of ranging measurements is 48 152 244 and 488 the simulation was performed 500 times for each water depth setups the conventional method and the proposed total adjustment method were adopted to estimate the transponder s position positioning errors in the east north and up directions were shown in fig 4 generally in shallow sea with the water depth less than 500m positioning errors in three directions are smaller than 15 cm for both two methods and positioning errors are smaller than 30 cm when water depth is greater than 500m the total adjustment method presents a more stable positioning errors and has a better performance than the conventional method statistics of positioning errors with two methods are presented in fig 5 in the shallow water the average of positioning errors with the total adjustment method is slightly reduced as compared with the least square method as for the deep water the average of positioning errors is largely decreased by applying the total adjustment method especially in the east and north directions the standard deviation std values of positioning errors for both methods rise up with the increase of water depth std values in the total adjustment method is invariably smaller than those in the traditional method it means that the proposed method can perform a more stable positioning performance than the conventional method for different water depth in terms of root mean square rms values the 2 dimension 2 d rms values of positioning errors with the total adjustment method are 0 042m 0 054m 0 066m and 0 064m for the water depth of 100m 500m 100m and 3000m respectively while the traditional method performs a 2 d rms of 0 047m 0 079m 0 100m and 0 119m the 3 dimension 3 d rms values of positioning errors with the proposed method are 0 065m 0 076m 0 092m and 0 113m whereas the rms values are 0 072m 0 105m 0 135m and 0 168m with the traditional method the 3 d rms values of positioning errors with the proposed method are improved by 10 28 32 and 33 compared with the traditional method for four water depths respectively the 3 d rms values of positioning errors are improved 26 in average when adopting the proposed method to further investigate the performance of the proposed method we carried out a simulation test with a multiple line trajectory as shown in fig 6 the surveying track was composed of 5 transverse lines and 4 longitudinal lines the length of one track line is around 7400m and the spacing of the parallel lines is approximate 1500m the transponder was located at the seafloor with the coordinate of 3000m 3000m 3000m the speed of surveying ship and simulated errors are same as that in the simulation test with a circular track the number of ranging measurements in this simulation test is 1016 the simulation was also performed 500 times the conventional method and the proposed total adjustment method were adopted to estimate the transponder s position positioning errors in east north and up directions were shown in fig 7 the positioning error with the conventional method reaches up to 0 360m in the east direction and 0 370m in the north direction whereas positioning errors with the proposed method are no more than 0 250m and 0 220m respectively in the up direction the positioning error with conventional method ranges from 0 459m to 0 086m whereas positioning error with the proposed method varies between 0 320m and 0 067m the total adjustment method presents a more stable positioning result and has a better performance than the conventional method table 1 lists the average values rms values of 2 d and 3 d positioning errors the average value of 2 d positioning errors with the conventional method is 0 092m whereas that with the proposed method is 0 052m similarly as for the average value of 3 d positioning errors the proposed method can still perform better than the conventional method in terms of rms values the 3 d rms values with the proposed method is 0 204m which is smaller than that of 0 262m with the conventional method the 3 d rms value of positioning errors with the proposed method is improved by 22 compared with the traditional method it means that the proposed method can provide a better performance than the traditional method 4 2 field test to further evaluate positioning performance of the proposed total adjustment method the real sea dataset was collected in the south china sea from october 24 to november 7 2016 the surveying ship is bgp dfkt 2 bureau of geophysical prospecting dong fang kan tan 2 with the length of 65 82 m and the width of 13 8m the average depth is 81 45m in the experimental area the ship was equipped with gyrocompass starfire dgps differential global positioning system echo sounders sound velocity profiler and acoustic positioning system developed by uk sonardyne company the major instruments are shown in fig 8 three gnss antennas and the acoustic transducer were installed as presented in fig 9 two gnss antennas were installed near the bow while another gnss antenna was installed at the stern the acoustic transducer was installed at the port side of the ship 39 transponders were attached to the cable which was laid at the seafloor and was recycled after the experiment the surveying ship sailed around the seafloor transponders as shown in fig 10 interrogation signals were transmitted simultaneously from the transducer and received by multiple transponders answers from multiple transponders were fed back to the transducer and they were distinguished by using frequency division multiple access fdma technology it is noted that two surveying cruises were carried out to collect acoustic measurements in our experiment 3 d surveying tracks are shown in fig 10 the sound velocity information was measured per second by saiv a s sd204 ctd std the time length of acoustic ranging measurement is about 3 h during the whole experiment the gnss antennas positions at different epochs were determined by gnss positioning technology the ship attitudes acoustic travel times and sound velocity profiles were also obtained given that the offsets between the gnss antennas and the transducer were known the transducer s positions were determined the accuracy of acoustic travel time was approximately 30 μs and the sampling rate is 3s statistics about observations of two surveying voyage are shown in fig 11 considering that the seafloor transponders of nos 37 and 39 are lack of essential observations these two transponders are dropped out in the following evaluation of positioning performance two independent surveying cruises were carried out by bgp dfkt 2 ship and all observations were correspondingly divided into two datasets the difference of positioning results with two datasets can be obtained for each transponder obviously the difference of positioning results with two datasets is a kind of external coincidence accuracy indicator and it can be used to compare the positioning performance of the traditional method and the proposed method the average and std of positioning differences for 37 transponders are counted and presented in table 2 in general the average of positioning differences in the north direction is smaller than that in the east direction and the average of positioning differences in the up direction is worst among three directions such a situation may be resulted from that the surveying trajectory was roughly coplanar and along north direction the averaged positioning differences in the east north and up directions are reduced by 22 10 and 14 as compared with traditional method judging from std values the proposed method presents a more stable positioning performance than the conventional method the residuals for each transponder are calculated after adjustment and shown in fig 12 for the conventional method the ranging residuals of 89 transponders are lower than 0 3m as for the total adjustment method the ranging residuals of 96 transponders are lower than 0 1m in the traditional method the residuals of transponder nos 12 and 20 are worse than others however the proposed method can still perform well even for these two transponders owing to introducing additional constraint information error bars in fig 12 also indicates that a more stable positioning performance can be provided by the total adjustment method 5 conclusions the traditional gnss a underwater positioning technique is to fix the transducer s position actually there are inevitable bias in the estimation of transducer s position and the precision varies at different epochs ignoring precision differences of the transducer s positions at different epochs will lead to a worse estimation of the transponder s position to improve the underwater positioning accuracy a total adjustment of the sea surface transducer and seafloor transponder is proposed specifically the positions of both the sea surface transducer and seafloor transponder are treated as unknown parameters and the transducers positions determined by gnss positioning at different epochs are introduced as virtual observations to reduce the huge computation burden caused by large increase of estimation parameters an equivalent transformation is applied to observation equations to remove estimation parameters for transducers positions both the simulation and field tests were carried out to access the performance of the proposed method in the simulation test of circular surveying track the positioning accuracy with the proposed method are averagely improved by about 10 27 32 and 33 for the water depth of 100m 500m 1000m and 3000m as compared with the traditional method as for the simulation test with multiple line surveying track 3 d rms values is reduced from 0 262m with the conventional method to 0 204m with the proposed method in the field experiment positioning differences between transponder s positions estimated with observations from different surveying cruise are averagely reduced by about 15 for 37 seafloor transponders both the simulation and field tests show that the proposed method can perform better than the conventional method in the seafloor points positioning author contributions s z z w and z n contributed to the

q criterion the rear separation region and the characteristic of arch type vortex and tip vortices are first discussed in order to evaluate 3d multi scale wake flow structures and energetic flow structures the 3d orthogonal wavelet multi resolution technique and proper orthogonal decomposition pod are applied to analyze instantaneous 3d velocity fields of tomo piv a 3d w type arch vortex behind the short cylinder is found which is originated by the interaction between upwash and downwash flows the head shape of arch vortex structure is associated with the aspect ratio of the cylinder by using the 3d orthogonal wavelet multi resolution analysis the instantaneous arch vortex and streamwise vortices are extracted in the large scale structures of the wavelet level 1 it also found that the intermediate scale upwash flows play an important role in originating the head of w type arch vortex strong small scale structures appeared in the shear layer and were contained in the intermediate scale structures the pod analysis indicates that the first two modes account for 13 3 of the total turbulent fluctuating energy and the first four pod modes exhibit several large scale

particle image velocimetry 2dpiv measurement pattenden et al 2005 revealed the mean flow structures around a finite length cylinder of aspect ratio 1 and gave a topological structure by the 2dpiv measurement a large scale stump arch vortex behind the cylinder was found beside of horseshoe vortex and tip vortices until now the 2dpiv measurement is frequently used to study the 3d wake structures around a finite height cylinder recently tomographic particle image velocimetry tomo piv of six cameras 2058 2456 pixels2 was first applied to measure the 3d flow structures behind a wall mounted cylinder diameter 20 mm of aspect ratio of 2 zhu et al 2017 they first found that the arch vortex behind a short cylinder exhibits 3d m shape and the shape of arch vortex may depend on the aspect ratio of a cylinder it is a very interesting and challenging problem and becomes a target of this study on the other hand to reveal the detailed 3d flow structures behind a short wall mounted cylinder the analysis tool of 3d multi scale flow structures is essential even though zhu et al 2017 applied 3d proper orthogonal decomposition pod to tomo piv data since the one dimensional experimental turbulence data were resolved into several scales by using the statistical method as an important multi scale tool the orthogonal wavelet transform was widely applied on analyzing various turbulent flow structures meneveau 1991 yamada and ohkitani 1991 rinoshika and zhou 2005a first developed one dimensional orthogonal wavelet multiresolution technique to extract the various scale turbulent structures including large scale structures secondary spanwise structures and so on in the near wake of a circular cylinder they further studied the effect of various wake generating bodies or reynolds number on the different scale turbulent structures in the near and far wakes zhou and rinoshika 2003 rinoshika and zhou 2005b 2007 2009b by using the same technique furthermore the three component vorticity data of cylinder wakes were decomposed into several wavelet components according to their central frequencies rinoshika et al 2006 zhou et al 2006 razali et al 2010 based on this wavelet technique in the industrial applications the orthogonal wavelet multiresolution technique was used to analysis the wake structures around vehicle door mirror based on les simulations rinoshika et al 2013 and piv measurement data rinoshika and watanabe 2010 rinoshika and omori 2011 in addition the various scale flow structures of the barchan dune wakes zheng and rinoshika 2015 fujimoto and rinoshika 2015 were revealed by this wavelet technique however the application of a 3d orthogonal wavelet transform on 3d experimental turbulence data has not been performed yet which motivates the present investigation to study the 3d wake flow structures of a low aspect ratio cylinder the 3d velocity fields behind a short circular cylinder of aspect ratio 1 are first measured by high resolution tomo piv in a water tunnel the 3d vorticity the q criterion the rear separation region and arch type vortex and tip vortices are analyzed based on the measured 3d velocity distributions then 3d orthogonal wavelet multiresolution technique is used to decompose the 3d various scale flow structures at last the pod is applied to extract the 3d dominant flow structures in the energy distribution 2 experimental apparatus and tomographic piv setup this experiment was carried out in a circular open water tunnel in beijing university of aeronautics and astronautics the size of test section is 3000 mm length 600 mm width 700 m height a short circular cylinder with a height of h 70 mm and a diameter of d 70 mm aspect ratio h d 1 as indicated in fig 1 was mounted on the central axis of the bottom wall of the circulating water tunnel 1200 mm downstream of the test section entrance the centre of the cylinder bottom surface is defined as the origin of the coordinate system the x y and z axes indicate the streamwise spanwise and longitudinal directions respectively tomo piv measurement as shown in fig 2 was performed at a free stream velocity of u 0 162 m s corresponding to a reynolds number re u d ν of 10 720 the piv tracer particles of a mean diameter 10 μm were adopted the response time of the particles based on the free stream velocity was 1 6 2 8 10 5 s illumination was provided by a dual head nd yag laser 500 mj pulse 532 nm wavelength with a pulse separation time of 3 ms which yields average displacements of approximately 0 48 mm 8 pixels in the free stream region the optical lenses and the mirror were designed to generate a 100 mm thick light sheet illuminating the tracer particles behind the cylinder four high resolution 6600 4400 pixels2 12bit double exposure ccd cameras imperx sm ccdb29m2 were used to record the flow field simultaneously the viewing angle between cameras was about 470 a synchronizer was used to control the laser and cameras and the sampling frequency of tomo piv measurement was set at 0 25 hz the measurement volume was in the coordinate range 35 270 70 70 0 100 mm with a digital imaging resolution of 0 075 mm per pixel which corresponds the physical domain of 235 140 100 mm3 the instantaneous 3d vector calculation was performed through a multi pass correlation analysis with a deforming interrogation window in the final pass the interrogation volume was 32 32 32 voxel with 50 overlap resulting in a spatial resolution of 2 4 mm and a vector pitch of 2 4 mm the uncertainty in the time averaged flow fields could be evaluated by ε u σ u n s zhu et al 2017 and ε u 0 0045 here σ u is the normalized standard deviation and n s is the number of uncorrelated samples in order to evaluate the characters of boundary layer on the ground plane a laser doppler velocimeter was used to measure the distributions of time averaged streamwise velocity and turbulent intensity the measurements were performed without cylinder fig 3 plots the profiles of normalized time averaged streamwise velocity and turbulence intensity at the centre location of the cylinder in the flat plate boundary layer the boundary layer thickness δ is 24 6 mm which made for a thickness to diameter ratio of δ d 0 35 at the center location of the cylinder wang et al 2006 found that an important effect of the boundary layer thickness on the wake flow characteristics of a finite length cylinder was at δ d 1 02 wang et al 2006 it is because a significant upwash flow was induced by the base vortex and the thickness of the boundary layer makes the stronger upwash flow therefore it may be said that a weak effect of the boundary layer thickness δ d 0 35 on the wake flow of a short cylinder in this study as to the effect of turbulence intensity on the wake of a turbulent boundary layer immersed cylinder the mean stagnation point on the upstream face and reattachment point in the wake of the cube were found to be independent of the turbulence intensity jason hearst et al 2016 it may infer that the wake flow characteristics of a short cylinder are also independent of turbulence intensity the frequency characteristics on the wake flow structure of low aspect ratio cylinder has been analyzed based on the 2dpiv in our previous paper rinoshika et al 2017 3 3d orthogonal wavelet transform wavelet transform which is classified into discrete orthogonal and continuous wavelet transforms is a powerful technique for capturing local features of data in the time frequency plane the continuous wavelet transform may perform a continuous time frequency identification of data the discrete wavelet transform obtains the local features of data in time and frequency bands however the discrete wavelet coefficients of each frequency band are orthogonal independently of each other the orthogonal wavelet transform provides low time resolution in the low frequency range and enough temporal resolution in the high frequency range therefore it overcomes the limitations of conventional bandpass transform the filtering technique exhibits good frequency resolution for frequency events at a fixed time frequency resolution but it includes redundant information furthermore the orthogonal wavelet transform is reversible so that the measured data can be uniquely reconstructed from the inversely transformed wavelet coefficients the 1d and 2d orthogonal wavelet transforms have been described in previous studies rinoshika and zhou 2005a fujimoto and rinoshika 2015 and the 3d orthogonal wavelet transform is introduced as follows the following orthogonal daubechies wavelet basis with an order of 12 2 n 2 n matrix c n which has twelve coefficients c 0 c 1 c 2 c 11 1 c n c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 10 c 11 0 0 0 0 c 11 c 10 c 9 c 8 c 1 c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 c 0 c 1 c 8 c 9 c 10 c 11 0 0 0 0 c 11 c 10 c 3 c 2 c 1 c 0 0 0 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 0 0 0 0 c 0 c 1 c 9 c 8 c 7 c 6 0 0 0 0 c 11 c 10 the matrix c n performs the following two convolution operations the odd rows of matrix operate an ordinary convolution with coefficients c 0 c 1 c 2 c 10 and c 11 acting as a smoothing low pass filter while the even rows operate a different convolution with coefficients c 11 c 10 c 9 c 1 and c 0 acting as a difference high pass filter the rank of square matrix c n is n since it is a non singular matrix for a 3d velocity data v n v i j k i 1 2 n j 1 2 n k 1 2 n which is a matrix of 2 n 2 n 2 n its 3d wavelet transform is performed by transforming the array sequentially on its first index for all values of its other indices then on its second index and last on its third index i e operating the 1d wavelet transform sequentially in the horizontal vertical and longitudinal directions the following contents describe the operations as the wavelet transform of the first level the data array of the horizontal direction x direction v j k n v 1 j k v 2 j k v 2 n j k t j 1 2 n k 1 2 n is carried out by multiplying two matrices at first step v j k 1 c n v j k n s 1 j k 1 d 1 j k 1 s 2 j k 1 d 2 j k 1 s 2 n 1 j k 1 d 2 n 1 j k 1 t 2 j 1 2 n k 1 2 n here the superscript t represents a transposed matrix the resulting first transform coefficient matrix v j k 1 is composed of interlaced smooth and difference coefficients denoted by 1 s i j k and 1 d i j k by the multiplication of a permuting matrix p n the first wavelet coefficients v j k x 1 along the x direction is obtained as v j k x 1 p n v j k 1 s 1 j k 1 s 2 j k 1 s 2 n 1 j k 1 d 1 j k 1 d 2 j k 1 d 2 n 1 j k 1 t 3 j 1 2 n k 1 2 n at this step the even rows of the matrix are moved backward as the last 2 n 1 elements and the odd rows of the matrix are moved forward as the first 2 n 1 elements the second step is to divide 3d matrix v x 1 i 1 2 n j 1 2 n k 1 2 n eq 3 into two block matrices as v j k x s 1 s i 1 k 1 s i 2 k 1 s i 2 n k 1 t and v i k x d 1 d i 1 k 1 d i 2 k 1 d i 2 n k 1 t 4 i 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n by multiplying with a permuting matrix c n and p n along the y direction the above two block matrices are transferred as 5a v i k x y s 1 p n c n v i k x s 1 s s i 1 k 1 s s i 2 n 1 k 1 s d i 1 k 1 s d i 2 n 1 k 1 t 5b v i k x y d 1 p n c n v i k x d 1 d s i 1 k 1 d s i 2 n 1 k 1 d d i 1 k 1 d d i 2 n 1 k 1 t therefore the following 3d matrix v x y 1 by transformation along x and y direction is obtained v x y 1 s s 1 1 k 1 s s 1 2 n 1 k 1 d s 1 1 k 1 d s 1 2 n 1 k 1 s s 2 n 1 1 k 1 s s 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 1 d s 2 n 1 1 k 1 d s 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 1 s d 1 1 k 1 s d 1 2 n 1 k 1 d d 1 1 k 1 d d 1 2 n 1 k 1 s d 2 n 1 1 k 1 s d 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 1 d d 2 n 1 1 k 1 d d 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 1 6 s 1 s i j k d 1 s i j k s 1 d i j k d 1 d i j k i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n the following four block matrices consist of v x y 1 7a v i j x y s s 1 s s i j 1 1 s s i j 2 1 s s i j 2 n 1 t 7b v i j x y s d 1 s d i j 1 1 s d i j 2 1 s d i j 2 n 1 t 7c v i j x y d s 1 d s i j 1 1 d s i j 2 1 d s i j 2 n 1 t 7d v i j x y d d 1 d d i j 1 1 d d i j 2 1 d d i j 2 n 1 t at the third step along the z direction the four block matrices are decomposed by the wavelet basis matrix c n and the permuting matrix p n into 8a v 1 i j x y z s s p n c n v 1 i j x y z s s t 8b v 1 i j x y z s d p n c n v 1 i j x y s d t 8c v 1 i j x y z d s p n c n v 1 i j x y d s t 8d v 1 i j x y z d d p n c n v 1 i j x y d d t i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 finally as indicated in fig 4 the following eight block matrices consist of the first wavelet transform coefficients of matrix v n s 1 s s i j k s 1 d s i j k d 1 s s i j k d 1 d s i j k s 1 s d i j k s 1 d d i j k d 1 s d i j k and d 1 d d i j k i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n 1 here s 1 d s i j k d 1 s s i j k d 1 d s i j k s 1 s d i j k s 1 d d i j k d 1 s d i j k and d 1 d d i j k are the wavelet coefficients of level 1 the wavelet transform of the second level is performed to the smooth block matrices of s 1 s s i j k i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n 1 based on the wavelet basis matrix c n 1 and the permuting matrix p n 1 which are the halves of c n and p n respectively along x y and z direction in a similar way to the first level transform the wavelet transform coefficients of level 2 s 2 s s i j k s 2 d s i j k d 2 s s i j k d 2 d s i j k s 2 s d i j k s 2 d d i j k d 2 s d i j k and d 2 d d i j k i 1 2 n 2 j 1 2 n 2 k 1 2 n 2 are obtained the illustration of the 3d orthogonal wavelet transform is displayed in fig 4 the pyramidal computation is operated until the matrix of the last wavelet level only consists of 23 23 23 elements which is less than the order of wavelet base or number of c n coefficients at last the coefficients of 3d wavelet transform s is written as 9 s w w w v n t t t here w satisfies w t w i here i is a unit matrix it indicates that the 3d discrete wavelet transform is an orthogonal linear operator and invertible the inverse orthogonal wavelet transform is performed by reversing the procedure as follows 10 v n w t w t s t w being similar to 1d and 2d wavelet multi resolution techniques the matrix of orthogonal wavelet coefficient s is first resolved into the following sum of all levels 11 s d 1 n d 2 n d n 2 n where d i n having a size of 2 n 2 n 2 n is composed of a zero matrix and a coefficient matrix at wavelet level i for example d 1 n of level 1 consists of the eight block matrices 0 s 1 d s i j k d 1 s s i j k d 1 d s i j k s 1 s d i j k s 1 d d i j k d 1 s d i j k and d 1 d d i j k i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n 1 then the inverse orthogonal wavelet transform is applied to the wavelet coefficients eq 11 viz 12 v n w t w t d 1 t w w t w t d 2 t w w t w t d i t w w t w t d n 2 t w here the first term w t w t d 1 t w and the last term w t w t d n 2 t w indicate the components of wavelet level 1 the highest grouped frequency and level n 2 the lowest grouped frequency respectively it is evident that the original data can be reconstructed from the sum of all wavelet components by using the orthogonal wavelet bases such decomposition process is called as the three dimensional wavelet multi resolution technique by using this method the flow structures are decomposed into several wavelet components depended on their central frequencies which exhibits the different scale flow structures in this study 3d wavelet multi resolution technique is applied to analyze 3d instantaneous velocity field of tomo piv data in the spatial domain therefore the central frequencies of wavelet components are replaced by their characteristic scales or central scales in the standard wavelet transform the number of wavelet level is determined based on the number of measurement grid the number of data and the order of wavelet basis the central scale of each level is determined by the spatial resolution of measurement grid for considering the effect of orthogonal wavelet basis some orthogonal wavelet functions daubechies harmonic lmb and meyer were used by mouri et al 1999 they suggested that the statistics of turbulent flow were insensitive to the choice of the wavelets our previous study rinoshika et al 2012 also pointed out that the results of the wavelet multi resolution analysis are essentially independent of the choice of wavelet basis having an order higher than 10 in this study the daubechies wavelet bases with an order of 12 and 20 are chosen as the orthogonal wavelet basis 4 three dimensional wake structures of tomographic piv the 3d isosurface of u u 0 and the time averaged contour of the streamwise velocity behind the short cylinder which is averaged over 400 snapshots is shows in fig 5 the 3d rear recirculation zone is indicated by the isosurface of u u 0 a lower surface is clearly identified near the plane of y d 0 which corresponds to the one found by zhu et al 2017 it is indicated that the downwash flow from the free end surface form such concavity region the recirculation zone gradually contracts along the direction of the main flow and comes to an end at the downstream location of about x d 1 6 owing to the interaction of the vortex shedding from the cylinder sidewall and free end the 3d time averaged streamlines of rear recirculation zone behind the short cylinder is displayed in fig 6 a 3d large scale vortex is evidently observed and the centre line of the large scale vortex is bent in the form of half circle the size of vortex is the largest in the centre plane of y d 0 and shrinks close to the ground plane due to the interaction between the vortex shedding from the cylinder sidewall and ground plane the tip vortex pair originating from the edge of free end plays an important role in the wake of the finite length cylinder fig 7 displays the 3d isosurface of time averaged streamwise x vorticity of ω x d u 0 5 behind the short cylinder which is plotted as red and blue indicating positive and negative vortices respectively a streamwise vortex pair occurring from the free end surface is evidently extracted the streamwise vortex pair exhibits a dipole type and extends downstream to the ground plane owing to the effect of the downwash flow it is a well known fact that time averaged vortical structure of the low aspect ratio cylinder wake exhibits the arch type vortex pattenden et al 2005 zhu et al 2017 had experimentally confirmed the existence of the 3d arch vortex in the cylinder wake with an aspect ratio of 2 by tomo piv in this study we also use the q criterion to extract the arch vortex structure and its main features in the short cylinder wake with an aspect ratio of 1 the q criterion wang et al 2006 is calculated by 13 q ω 2 s 2 2 where ω and s represent the tensor of the angular velocity and the tensor of strain rate respectively the indicates the euclidean norm the q criterion may be used to identify the vortical structures by the excess rotation relative to the strain rate which is normalized by u d 2 in this study fig 8 shows the 3d isosurface distribution of q u d 2 7 in the time averaged flow field colored by the streamwise vorticity ω x d u the arch vortex structure clearly exhibits a w type head instead of a reversed u pattenden et al 2005 or an m shape zhu et al 2017 standing on the ground plane behind the short cylinder two concave parts near the two sides of the horizontal part are evidently observed in w type arch structure which is caused by the downward flow from the free end and tip vortex the center convex of the horizontal part on the w type arch structure is induced due to the strong upwash effect of the large flow separation behind the cylinder as indicated in fig 6 being different from m shape zhu et al 2017 the larger distance between two tip vortices results in the weaker effect of tip vortices on center part of the head even though they have strong vorticity at the two sides of the arch head which is described later based on the above results the mean vortical structures around the short cylinder having a large diameter are sketched in fig 9 which includes tip horseshoe base arch and trailing vortices and their locations although these vortices have been suggested in the literature three dimensional configurations of w type arch vortex is first observed and proposed in this tom piv measurement in particular the interaction among vertical shedding vortices of the side wall horizontal shedding vortex of the free end and tip vortices which form a w type arch vortex could not be found in the planar piv measurement of the previous experiments rinoshika et al 2017 2018 rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 the time averaged streamlines and the contour of the streamwise velocity in the x z plane of y d 0 0 2 and 0 4 are described in fig 10 they visualize the distribution of 3d velocity field in three side view planes as shown in fig 6 the flow field discussed here is not a planar flow but has a highly three dimensional feature at y d 0 and y d 0 2 the separation region is spread over most of the cylinder height the downwash flow originating from the free end surface doesn t reach the ground plane due to the effect of the upwash flow a significant upwash flow that the base vortex induced can be observed at δ d 1 02 mouri et al 1999 and the thickness of the boundary layer may make the stronger upwash flow the height and size of the large scale vortex decrease and the separation region becomes smaller from plane y d 0 to 0 4 meanwhile the height of the saddle point s as indicated in fig 10 increases the downwash flow that the interaction among the vortices causes becomes weaker moving away from the centre plane fig 11 shows the time averaged streamlines with the contour of the mean streamwise velocity in the x y plane at z d 0 2 to 1 0 it visualizes the distribution of 3d velocity field in the top view planes fig 6 a pair of large counter rotating vortices can be clearly seen in the three planes at z d 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 at the height of z d 0 4 the distance between two vortices and the separation region are larger than that of other heights the strong separation flow from the sidewalls makes the separation region become wider at z d 0 4 due to a weak effect of ground plane and free end however the vortices disappear at the positions of z d 0 8 and 1 0 the time averaged velocity vectors with the contour of the streamwise vorticity ω x d u in the y z plane at x d 0 7 1 0 1 4 1 8 2 2 and 2 7 are plotted in fig 12 they visualize the distribution of 3d velocity and vorticity fields in the rear view planes fig 6 at the location of x d 0 7 a pair of tip vortices can be clearly observed the upwash and downwash flows can be seen between two tip vortices near the top surface of the cylinder which is an important reason of forming the w type head of arch structure downstream of x d 1 0 the strong downwash is found near the free end surface and two tip vortices are deformed it is inferred that the w type head of arch vortex is destroyed at this location at the downstream locations of x d 1 4 and 1 8 two tip vortices become dispersed and move toward the ground due to the effects of the downwash flow and other vortices meanwhile their vorticity intensity decreases evidently at further downstream positions of x d 2 2 and 2 7 two tip vortices further decrease and approach the ground plane 5 3d instantaneous multi scale wake structures a 3d distribution of the instantaneous q criterion with isosurface of q u d 2 3 colored by the streamwise vorticity ω x d u is shown in fig 13 3d vortical structures of various scales are clearly observed an instantaneous w type arch vortex as indicated by 1 in fig 13 is very similar to that of the time averaged flow field of fig 8 the free end produces the top flow separation and tip vortices of the trailing edge which induces a w shape arch vortex the center convex of the horizontal part of the w type arch structure is originated by the strong upwash of the large separation flow behind the cylinder as shown in fig 6 of the time averaged flow field the two concave parts of the horizontal part are caused by the strong downward flow and tip vortices it may be said that free end separation flow and the tip vortices induce the shoulders and head of the w type arch structure the arch vortex consists of two vertical shedding vortices the side wall and one horizontal shedding vortex the free end which is connected by two tip vortices therefore the w type arch structure model fig 9 of this study is different from pattenden et al 2005 and zhu et al 2017 the difference between our study and zhu et al 2017 is the aspect ratio of cylinder for aspect ratio 1 as shown in fig 9 the distance of two tip vortices originated from the free edge end becomes large or the height of free end becomes low which induces the strong upwash flows between two tip vortices and forms a w shape arch vortex in the case of the cylinder with aspect ratio 2 zhu et al 2017 the height of free end becomes high or the two tip vortices come close to each other which reduces the upwash flow and forms an m shape arch vortex it is indicated that the head shape of arch vortex structure is associated with the aspect ratio of the cylinder it is also found that the w type arch vortex rapidly breaks down into several fragments downstream as indicated in fig 13 the several vortex structures labeled 2 3 and 4 are identified as fragments of the arch vortices it may be inferred that strong downwash from the center of the surface end produces as re increases which induces arch vortex breaking down rapidly and more evident w shape arch vortex several evident quasi streamwise vortices indicated by 5 and 6 are evidently identified in the instantaneous flow field of fig 13 which is due to the downwash and upwash flows and interacting with the other vortical structures the quasi streamwise vortices are analyzed later to obtain the 3d multi scale flow structures behind the short cylinder the 3d wavelet multi resolution method described in section 3 is applied to 3d instantaneous velocity field of tomo piv 3d velocity fields are decomposed into three wavelet components based on their central scales which represent the large intermediate and small scale structures by orthogonal wavelet multi resolution technique here the large and intermediate scale structures are respectively represented by wavelet component of levels 1 and 2 and the small scale structure consists of level 3 and level 4 according to the spatial resolution of tomo piv the central scales of the large intermediate and small scale structures are respectively a 1 38 4 mm a 1 d 0 55 a 2 19 2 mm a 2 d 0 27 and a 3 7 2 mm a 3 d 0 1 fig 14 a c exhibits the three scales of the 3d instantaneous q i u d 2 isosurface with colored by the streamwise vorticity ω x i d u which is decomposed from the original flow field of fig 13 here i represents the wavelet level in the large scale structure level 1 as shown in fig 14 a a large scale arch vortex labeled 1 is clearly observed meanwhile two large scale streamwise vortex labeled 5 and 6 with the positive and negative senses of rotation are also extracted from the instantaneous flow field of fig 13 one goes through the center of w type arch vortex and develops to the downstream which also dominates the flow structures downstream as decreasing to intermediate scale structures of level 2 in fig 14 b several fragments of w type arch vortices broken down downstream and the intermediate scale streamwise vortices and trailing vortices are extracted in the small scale structure of level 3 with the central scale of 7 2 mm as displayed in fig 14 c the relatively small scale vortices distribute and active behind the cylinder and near the flat plate a part of them is contained in large or intermediate scale flow structures the measured instantaneous streamlines and multi scale streamlines with the contours of the spanwise vorticity ω y d u in the x z plane of y d 0 are displayed in fig 15 a large vortex and several smaller vortices are observed from the instantaneous measured streamlines and its contours of the streamwise vorticity in fig 15 a the large vortex is induced by the downwash flow from the free end and upwash flow from the ground plane the large scale instantaneous streamlines of wavelet level 1 with its contours as indicated in fig 15 b evidently exhibits a large scale vortex with the central scale of 38 4 mm which corresponds to the instantaneous measured large vortex of fig 15 a fig 15 c plotted the instantaneous intermediate scale streamlines with its contours at wavelet level 2 some intermediate scale vortices which represent the fragments of w type arch vortices and trailing vortices and appear in the measured flow structures of fig 15 a are clearly observed as to small scale flow structures of wavelet level 3 as indicated in fig 15 d the relatively small scale vortices distribute in all area and exhibit strong vorticity some of them are also found in the measured flow structures of fig 15 a or are contained in the intermediate scale structures of fig 15 c the measured instantaneous streamlines and contours of the longitudinal vorticity ω z d u in the x y plane at the longitudinal positions of z d 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 are shown in fig 16 the instantaneous longitudinal vortices shedding from the two sidewalls of cylinder are evident at these three positions and the large one acts as a leg of arch vortex fig 17 displayed the large scale instantaneous streamlines and its contours of wavelet level 1 at the three x y planes the leg of arch vortex at y d 0 4 to 0 5 exhibits almost the same size in the x y planes of z d 0 2 and 0 4 however the size of large vortex at the x y plane of z d 0 6 decrease and vorticity strength increases such phenomenon may be induced by the interaction between the shedding vortex of the side wall and the tip vortex of the free end fig 18 plots the intermediate scale flow structures of wavelet level 2 it is apparent that intermediate scale vortices which are fragments of w type arch vortices tip vortices and trailing vortices dominate the flow field in the three x y planes the stronger intermediate scale vortices shedding from the two sidewalls of cylinder are found around y d 0 5 behind the cylinder which exist in the measured flow structures of fig 16 for the small scale flow structures of wavelet level 3 as indicated in fig 19 the small scale vortices are the most active and exhibit the highest vorticity in the x y plane of z d 0 2 although the instantaneous small scale vortices distribute in all measured region this is because this plane is close to the ground plane and horseshoe and base vortices are active some of these small scale vortices can be found in the measured flow structures of fig 16 and others of these small scale vortices are contained in the intermediate scale flow structures of wavelet level 2 the measured instantaneous streamlines and contours of the dimensionless streamwise vorticity ω x d u in the y z plane at the downstream locations of x d 0 7 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 are shown in fig 20 here the black dotted line displays the location of short cylinder at the downstream of x d 0 7 a pair of tip vortex with positive and negative vorticities originating by the trailing edge of the free end appear clearly near the upper corners of free end between the tip vortex pair the upwash and downwash flows are evidently observed near the height of short cylinder which is one important reason of producing instantaneous w type head of arch vortex the instantaneous horseshoe and base vortices are also identified near the ground plane at the location of x d 1 4 this tip vortex pair moves towards the ground plane because of the downwash effect a strong large scale streamwise vortex appears because of the interaction between the downwash flow and shedding vortices from the side wall which is evident observed at x d 1 4 and 2 2 even if the large scale streamwise vortex gradually decays it is also identified at the downstream of x d 3 2 the multi scale instantaneous streamlines and contours of the dimensionless streamwise vorticity ω x d u in the y z plane at x d 0 7 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 which are extracted from 3d wavelet multi resolution analysis of the measured instantaneous 3d velocity data are shown in figs 21 23 at x d 0 7 a pair of tip vortex near the upper corners of free end as shown in fig 21 appears in the large scale flow structures of wavelet level 1 at the downstream of x d 1 4 the vorticity of tip vortex pair and downwash flow increases a strong streamwise vortex develops from x d 1 4 to 2 2 and starts to decay from x d 3 2 it implies that the strong large scale downwash interacts with shedding vortices of the side wall from x d 1 4 to 2 2 and originates the large scale streamwise vortex which cannot be clearly observed from the measured data of fig 20 fig 22 shows the instantaneous intermediate scale flow structures of wavelet level 2 in the y z plane at x d 0 7 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 it is clear that each large scale streamwise vortex contains several intermediate scale vortices and intermediate scale vortices are distributed in all area at the location of x d 0 7 the intermediate scale vortices concentrate on the short cylinder surface especially a vortex pair is clearly observed around y d 0 and z d 1 the trailing edge of free end surface which results in the upwash flow it plays an important role in producing w type head of arch vortex at locations of x d 1 4 and 2 2 several strong vortices distribute in the range of 0 5 y d 0 5 and indicate intermediate scale streamwise vortices comparing with large scale structures the strengths of intermediate scale vortices increase all vortices appearing at the wavelet level 2 correspond to the measured flow structures of fig 20 implying that the intermediate scale vortices dominate the flow strictures however the intermediate scale streamwise vortices decay and move outside downstream of x d 3 2 fig 23 displays the instantaneous small scale flow structures of wavelet level3 in the y z plane at x d 0 7 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 the most small scale vortices are contained in the intermediate scale flow structures and the small scale flow structures are filled with the small scale vortices the small scale vortices increase along the downstream direction due to breaking down of the large and intermediate scale vortices because the hardware limitation comes from the speed of high resolution piv image images transfer 6600 4400 pixels2 from cameras to compute in our measurement it is difficult to analyze 3d vortex shedding process or continuous instantaneous multi scale flow structures in the time domain 6 3d pod analysis of flow structures the pod is decomposing and ranking the measured flow structures based on many snapshots from the time series of velocity vector fields and sorts them in a hierarchy of energy content in the sense of singular value decomposition into orthogonal modes the pod not only identifies the dominant features flow but also constructs low dimensional approximation that may describe the principal flow dynamics with the least number of modes berkooz et al 1993 chatterjee 2000 rowley and dawson 2017 although the pod has been widely applied to analyze the 2dpiv data he et al 2019 the fluctuating energy can t be estimated based on all the three fluctuating velocity components this may have some effect on the fluctuating energy and the pod mode structures in this paper the pod method is applied to analyze the highly 3d short cylinder turbulent wake measured by tomo piv before the application of pod the time averaged velocities are subtracted from the corresponding velocity components at each instant the pod analysis was performed on 100 snapshots of the time sequential volumetric velocity fields to obtain their common spatial modes since the eigenvalues indicate the energy contained in each pod mode the eigenvalues represent the contribution of the corresponding pod mode to the total turbulent fluctuating energy fig 24 shows the percentage of contribution to the total fluctuating energy from the all pod mode based on the pod decomposition of 3d velocity vector fields in 3d short cylinder turbulent wake it is indicated that there exists a rapid decline in energy with increasing mode number especially for the first several modes which is valid for pod modal analysis the energy distributions of the first two modes are found to be similar and significantly larger than the other modes which is the same result as observed in the case of the flow around an infinite cylinder the first two modes 7 3 and 6 occupied approximately two times the energy of mode 3 3 5 and mode 4 2 8 and more than three times the energy of the other modes 2 on the other hand the wake behind the short cylinder is highly unsteady three dimensionally so it is predictable that the first mode exhibits a lower energy compared with the infinite cylinder cases the first two modes account for 13 3 of the total turbulent fluctuating energy which is smaller than their counterpart 18 in the finite length cylinder wake of aspect ratios 2 zhu et al 2017 it implies that the energetic flow structure is weakened as decreasing the aspect ratio of circular cylinder in view of the fact that pod mode 5 and other higher modes make limited contributions to the total turbulent fluctuating energy the following discussion focuses on the first four pod modes in this study the q isosurfaces are calculated by using the three dimensional pod reconstructed velocity field with the corresponding modes to clarify the flow structures of the pod modes the dimensionless q u d 2 isosurfaces of first four pod modes are presented in fig 25 note that the colour of fig 25 does not denote the sense of vortex rotation but distinguishes between the different modes these modes are marked by the corresponding numbers it is observed that the first pair of modes modes 1 and 2 as indicated in fig 25 a is characterized by the alternating streamwise vortex fig 25 b represents the dimensionless q u d 2 isosurfaces of modes 3 and 4 indicated a pair of streamwise vortex with opposite sense of rotation it shows a relatively 3d symmetric wake topology compared to the first pair of modes the structures of mode 4 appear more complicated and less organized the slices fig 26 a d display the dimensionless streamwise vorticity ω x d u contours and velocity vectors for the first four modes at the streamwise location of x d 1 8 the first pair of pod modes modes 1 and 2 shows a symmetric arranged vortex while the second pair modes 3 and 4 shows an antisymmetric arranged vortex the first four modes clearly exhibit several large scale streamwise vortices which are intimately connected with the spanwise vortex shedding from the cylinder sidewalls these figures indicate that the positive and negative streamwise vortices move up and down alternatingly in the x direction similar to the features of the kármán vortex besides the vortex structures near the free end disappear in the first two modes and thus it suggests that the tip vortex doesn t contain large energy this phenomenon was also observed in the finite length cylinder wake of aspect ratios 2 zhu et al 2017 however pairs of symmetric tip vortices and base vortices are first observed near the free end and wall in mode 3 the result conforms to the well established observation that the wake near the cylinder free end is characterized by a pair of symmetric tip vortices and as the downwash flow alters vortex shedding from antisymmetric to symmetrical in fig 27 the four slices at a position of z d 0 40 contoured by the dimensionless longitudinal vorticity ω z d u contours with the overlapped vector fields are extracted from the first four modes it is indicated that mode 1 and mode 2 represent an evidently symmetric arranged pattern the positive and negative contours and occur alternately as shown in fig 27 a b the vorticity concentrations seem to be stretched laterally this structure represents a signature of spanwise vortex shedding however these spanwise vortices break down further downstream and no alternately arranged vortex street occurs since strong downwash flow suppresses spanwise vortex shedding near the cylinder free end however the oppositely signed vorticity concentrations of mode 3 as shown in fig 27 c are symmetrically arranged about the centerline it suggests that mode 3 corresponding to vortex shedding plays a marked role in the near wake dynamics behind a finite length cylinder note that the contribution of turbulent fluctuating energy from mode 3 is 3 5 being a half counterpart of mode 1 7 3 the structure of mode 4 fig 27 d is distinct from any of the first three modes and appears more complicated and less organized its maximum strength also is higher than that of mode 3 one possible explanation is that the downwash and upwash flows both entrain highspeed free stream fluid into the wake which acts to cancel the reversed flow near the cylinder free end and base comparing with wavelet transform the pod is to extract the dominant flow structures from the complex flow field based on the mode energy distribution however the wavelet transform is to decompose the flow structures according to frequencies or scales 7 conclusions the tomo piv measurements are performed and 3d wavelet transform and pod are used to analyze 3d velocity field of tomo piv data in order to reveal the 3d multi scale flow structures around a wall mounted short cylinder the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the 3d w type arch vortex is found behind a short cylinder of aspect ratio 1 the central head of the horizontal part is induced by the upwash flow of the large flow separation and two shoulders of the horizontal part are caused by the downward flow and tip vortices 2 the instantaneous arch vortex and streamwise vortices are extracted at the wavelet level 1 and dominate the flow structures in the near wake 3 the horizontal shape of arch vortex structure is related to the aspect ratio of cylinder 4 the intermediate scale streamwise vortices and trailing vortices are also observed at the wavelet level 2 the intermediate scale upwash vortices induce w type head of arch vortex 5 the small scale structures increase downstream since the large and intermediate scale vortices break down 6 the first two pod modes account for 13 3 of the total turbulent fluctuating energy the first four pod modes exhibit several large scale streamwise vortices and pairs of symmetric tip vortices and base vortices appear in mode 3 credit authorship contribution statement hiroka rinoshika conceptualization methodology investigation

21102,a high resolution tomographic particle image velocimetry tomo piv which consists of four high resolution double exposure ccd cameras was used to measured three dimensional 3d flow structures behind a wall mounted short cylinder of an aspect ratio 1 at reynolds number 10 720 in a water tunnel based on the measured instantaneous 3d velocity distribution 3d velocity fields the vorticity the q criterion the rear separation region and the characteristic of arch type vortex and tip vortices are first discussed in order to evaluate 3d multi scale wake flow structures and energetic flow structures the 3d orthogonal wavelet multi resolution technique and proper orthogonal decomposition pod are applied to analyze instantaneous 3d velocity fields of tomo piv a 3d w type arch vortex behind the short cylinder is found which is originated by the interaction between upwash and downwash flows the head shape of arch vortex structure is associated with the aspect ratio of the cylinder by using the 3d orthogonal wavelet multi resolution analysis the instantaneous arch vortex and streamwise vortices are extracted in the large scale structures of the wavelet level 1 it also found that the intermediate scale upwash flows play an important role in originating the head of w type arch vortex strong small scale structures appeared in the shear layer and were contained in the intermediate scale structures the pod analysis indicates that the first two modes account for 13 3 of the total turbulent fluctuating energy and the first four pod modes exhibit several large scale streamwise vortices keywords 3d wavelet transform multi scale wake flow pod tomographic piv wall mounted finite cylinder 1 introduction a wall mounted finite length circular cylinder originates strongly three dimensional 3d complex flow structures and the different aspect ratio of the cylinder i e the ratio of the height and diameter exhibits different wake structures they are different from the structures generated by an infinite length circular cylinder rinoshika and zhou 2005a rinoshika and zhou 2009a because of the effect of the cylinder free end and the connection between cylinder and ground plane sumner et al 2004 pattenden et al 2005 wang and zhou 2009 gonçalves et al 2015 many important engineering applications encountered with this geometry such as heat exchangers structural vibrations automobile offshore structures and so on a large amount of literature has been published regarding the complex flow structures generated by finite length circular cylinder in generally the vortical structures of finite length cylinder wakes consist of the kármán vortex shedding from both sides of the cylinder the horseshoe vortex and base vortex near the ground plane sumner et al 2004 tanaka and murata 1999 and a pair of streamwise counter rotating tip vortices generating from the free end kawamura et al 1984a johnston and wilson 1996 adaramola et al 2006 the structures of kármán vortex cell are decreased when the aspect ratio decreases lee 1997 the tip vortices okamoto and yagita 1973 kawamura et al 1984b roh and park 2003 and a horseshoe vortex krajnović 2011 rostamy et al 2012 play an important role in the wake structure of a low aspect ratio cylinder while alternating vortex shedding i e kármán street disappears for a lower aspect ratio arch type vortex structure lee 1997 is observed behind the cylinder because the downward flow and tip vortex from the free end surface interact with the vortices shedding from the sides before reattaching to the ground the detail reviews on the wake structures of finite height cylinder can be found in sumner sumner 2013 and porteous et al 2014 recently rinoshika et al rinoshika et al 2017 2018 rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 proposed the inclined hole and horizontal hole to control the flow behind the low aspect ratio circular cylinder and clarified the wake structures by using the two dimensional particle image velocimetry 2dpiv measurement pattenden et al 2005 revealed the mean flow structures around a finite length cylinder of aspect ratio 1 and gave a topological structure by the 2dpiv measurement a large scale stump arch vortex behind the cylinder was found beside of horseshoe vortex and tip vortices until now the 2dpiv measurement is frequently used to study the 3d wake structures around a finite height cylinder recently tomographic particle image velocimetry tomo piv of six cameras 2058 2456 pixels2 was first applied to measure the 3d flow structures behind a wall mounted cylinder diameter 20 mm of aspect ratio of 2 zhu et al 2017 they first found that the arch vortex behind a short cylinder exhibits 3d m shape and the shape of arch vortex may depend on the aspect ratio of a cylinder it is a very interesting and challenging problem and becomes a target of this study on the other hand to reveal the detailed 3d flow structures behind a short wall mounted cylinder the analysis tool of 3d multi scale flow structures is essential even though zhu et al 2017 applied 3d proper orthogonal decomposition pod to tomo piv data since the one dimensional experimental turbulence data were resolved into several scales by using the statistical method as an important multi scale tool the orthogonal wavelet transform was widely applied on analyzing various turbulent flow structures meneveau 1991 yamada and ohkitani 1991 rinoshika and zhou 2005a first developed one dimensional orthogonal wavelet multiresolution technique to extract the various scale turbulent structures including large scale structures secondary spanwise structures and so on in the near wake of a circular cylinder they further studied the effect of various wake generating bodies or reynolds number on the different scale turbulent structures in the near and far wakes zhou and rinoshika 2003 rinoshika and zhou 2005b 2007 2009b by using the same technique furthermore the three component vorticity data of cylinder wakes were decomposed into several wavelet components according to their central frequencies rinoshika et al 2006 zhou et al 2006 razali et al 2010 based on this wavelet technique in the industrial applications the orthogonal wavelet multiresolution technique was used to analysis the wake structures around vehicle door mirror based on les simulations rinoshika et al 2013 and piv measurement data rinoshika and watanabe 2010 rinoshika and omori 2011 in addition the various scale flow structures of the barchan dune wakes zheng and rinoshika 2015 fujimoto and rinoshika 2015 were revealed by this wavelet technique however the application of a 3d orthogonal wavelet transform on 3d experimental turbulence data has not been performed yet which motivates the present investigation to study the 3d wake flow structures of a low aspect ratio cylinder the 3d velocity fields behind a short circular cylinder of aspect ratio 1 are first measured by high resolution tomo piv in a water tunnel the 3d vorticity the q criterion the rear separation region and arch type vortex and tip vortices are analyzed based on the measured 3d velocity distributions then 3d orthogonal wavelet multiresolution technique is used to decompose the 3d various scale flow structures at last the pod is applied to extract the 3d dominant flow structures in the energy distribution 2 experimental apparatus and tomographic piv setup this experiment was carried out in a circular open water tunnel in beijing university of aeronautics and astronautics the size of test section is 3000 mm length 600 mm width 700 m height a short circular cylinder with a height of h 70 mm and a diameter of d 70 mm aspect ratio h d 1 as indicated in fig 1 was mounted on the central axis of the bottom wall of the circulating water tunnel 1200 mm downstream of the test section entrance the centre of the cylinder bottom surface is defined as the origin of the coordinate system the x y and z axes indicate the streamwise spanwise and longitudinal directions respectively tomo piv measurement as shown in fig 2 was performed at a free stream velocity of u 0 162 m s corresponding to a reynolds number re u d ν of 10 720 the piv tracer particles of a mean diameter 10 μm were adopted the response time of the particles based on the free stream velocity was 1 6 2 8 10 5 s illumination was provided by a dual head nd yag laser 500 mj pulse 532 nm wavelength with a pulse separation time of 3 ms which yields average displacements of approximately 0 48 mm 8 pixels in the free stream region the optical lenses and the mirror were designed to generate a 100 mm thick light sheet illuminating the tracer particles behind the cylinder four high resolution 6600 4400 pixels2 12bit double exposure ccd cameras imperx sm ccdb29m2 were used to record the flow field simultaneously the viewing angle between cameras was about 470 a synchronizer was used to control the laser and cameras and the sampling frequency of tomo piv measurement was set at 0 25 hz the measurement volume was in the coordinate range 35 270 70 70 0 100 mm with a digital imaging resolution of 0 075 mm per pixel which corresponds the physical domain of 235 140 100 mm3 the instantaneous 3d vector calculation was performed through a multi pass correlation analysis with a deforming interrogation window in the final pass the interrogation volume was 32 32 32 voxel with 50 overlap resulting in a spatial resolution of 2 4 mm and a vector pitch of 2 4 mm the uncertainty in the time averaged flow fields could be evaluated by ε u σ u n s zhu et al 2017 and ε u 0 0045 here σ u is the normalized standard deviation and n s is the number of uncorrelated samples in order to evaluate the characters of boundary layer on the ground plane a laser doppler velocimeter was used to measure the distributions of time averaged streamwise velocity and turbulent intensity the measurements were performed without cylinder fig 3 plots the profiles of normalized time averaged streamwise velocity and turbulence intensity at the centre location of the cylinder in the flat plate boundary layer the boundary layer thickness δ is 24 6 mm which made for a thickness to diameter ratio of δ d 0 35 at the center location of the cylinder wang et al 2006 found that an important effect of the boundary layer thickness on the wake flow characteristics of a finite length cylinder was at δ d 1 02 wang et al 2006 it is because a significant upwash flow was induced by the base vortex and the thickness of the boundary layer makes the stronger upwash flow therefore it may be said that a weak effect of the boundary layer thickness δ d 0 35 on the wake flow of a short cylinder in this study as to the effect of turbulence intensity on the wake of a turbulent boundary layer immersed cylinder the mean stagnation point on the upstream face and reattachment point in the wake of the cube were found to be independent of the turbulence intensity jason hearst et al 2016 it may infer that the wake flow characteristics of a short cylinder are also independent of turbulence intensity the frequency characteristics on the wake flow structure of low aspect ratio cylinder has been analyzed based on the 2dpiv in our previous paper rinoshika et al 2017 3 3d orthogonal wavelet transform wavelet transform which is classified into discrete orthogonal and continuous wavelet transforms is a powerful technique for capturing local features of data in the time frequency plane the continuous wavelet transform may perform a continuous time frequency identification of data the discrete wavelet transform obtains the local features of data in time and frequency bands however the discrete wavelet coefficients of each frequency band are orthogonal independently of each other the orthogonal wavelet transform provides low time resolution in the low frequency range and enough temporal resolution in the high frequency range therefore it overcomes the limitations of conventional bandpass transform the filtering technique exhibits good frequency resolution for frequency events at a fixed time frequency resolution but it includes redundant information furthermore the orthogonal wavelet transform is reversible so that the measured data can be uniquely reconstructed from the inversely transformed wavelet coefficients the 1d and 2d orthogonal wavelet transforms have been described in previous studies rinoshika and zhou 2005a fujimoto and rinoshika 2015 and the 3d orthogonal wavelet transform is introduced as follows the following orthogonal daubechies wavelet basis with an order of 12 2 n 2 n matrix c n which has twelve coefficients c 0 c 1 c 2 c 11 1 c n c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 10 c 11 0 0 0 0 c 11 c 10 c 9 c 8 c 1 c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 c 0 c 1 c 8 c 9 c 10 c 11 0 0 0 0 c 11 c 10 c 3 c 2 c 1 c 0 0 0 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 0 0 0 0 c 0 c 1 c 9 c 8 c 7 c 6 0 0 0 0 c 11 c 10 the matrix c n performs the following two convolution operations the odd rows of matrix operate an ordinary convolution with coefficients c 0 c 1 c 2 c 10 and c 11 acting as a smoothing low pass filter while the even rows operate a different convolution with coefficients c 11 c 10 c 9 c 1 and c 0 acting as a difference high pass filter the rank of square matrix c n is n since it is a non singular matrix for a 3d velocity data v n v i j k i 1 2 n j 1 2 n k 1 2 n which is a matrix of 2 n 2 n 2 n its 3d wavelet transform is performed by transforming the array sequentially on its first index for all values of its other indices then on its second index and last on its third index i e operating the 1d wavelet transform sequentially in the horizontal vertical and longitudinal directions the following contents describe the operations as the wavelet transform of the first level the data array of the horizontal direction x direction v j k n v 1 j k v 2 j k v 2 n j k t j 1 2 n k 1 2 n is carried out by multiplying two matrices at first step v j k 1 c n v j k n s 1 j k 1 d 1 j k 1 s 2 j k 1 d 2 j k 1 s 2 n 1 j k 1 d 2 n 1 j k 1 t 2 j 1 2 n k 1 2 n here the superscript t represents a transposed matrix the resulting first transform coefficient matrix v j k 1 is composed of interlaced smooth and difference coefficients denoted by 1 s i j k and 1 d i j k by the multiplication of a permuting matrix p n the first wavelet coefficients v j k x 1 along the x direction is obtained as v j k x 1 p n v j k 1 s 1 j k 1 s 2 j k 1 s 2 n 1 j k 1 d 1 j k 1 d 2 j k 1 d 2 n 1 j k 1 t 3 j 1 2 n k 1 2 n at this step the even rows of the matrix are moved backward as the last 2 n 1 elements and the odd rows of the matrix are moved forward as the first 2 n 1 elements the second step is to divide 3d matrix v x 1 i 1 2 n j 1 2 n k 1 2 n eq 3 into two block matrices as v j k x s 1 s i 1 k 1 s i 2 k 1 s i 2 n k 1 t and v i k x d 1 d i 1 k 1 d i 2 k 1 d i 2 n k 1 t 4 i 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n by multiplying with a permuting matrix c n and p n along the y direction the above two block matrices are transferred as 5a v i k x y s 1 p n c n v i k x s 1 s s i 1 k 1 s s i 2 n 1 k 1 s d i 1 k 1 s d i 2 n 1 k 1 t 5b v i k x y d 1 p n c n v i k x d 1 d s i 1 k 1 d s i 2 n 1 k 1 d d i 1 k 1 d d i 2 n 1 k 1 t therefore the following 3d matrix v x y 1 by transformation along x and y direction is obtained v x y 1 s s 1 1 k 1 s s 1 2 n 1 k 1 d s 1 1 k 1 d s 1 2 n 1 k 1 s s 2 n 1 1 k 1 s s 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 1 d s 2 n 1 1 k 1 d s 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 1 s d 1 1 k 1 s d 1 2 n 1 k 1 d d 1 1 k 1 d d 1 2 n 1 k 1 s d 2 n 1 1 k 1 s d 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 1 d d 2 n 1 1 k 1 d d 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 1 6 s 1 s i j k d 1 s i j k s 1 d i j k d 1 d i j k i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n the following four block matrices consist of v x y 1 7a v i j x y s s 1 s s i j 1 1 s s i j 2 1 s s i j 2 n 1 t 7b v i j x y s d 1 s d i j 1 1 s d i j 2 1 s d i j 2 n 1 t 7c v i j x y d s 1 d s i j 1 1 d s i j 2 1 d s i j 2 n 1 t 7d v i j x y d d 1 d d i j 1 1 d d i j 2 1 d d i j 2 n 1 t at the third step along the z direction the four block matrices are decomposed by the wavelet basis matrix c n and the permuting matrix p n into 8a v 1 i j x y z s s p n c n v 1 i j x y z s s t 8b v 1 i j x y z s d p n c n v 1 i j x y s d t 8c v 1 i j x y z d s p n c n v 1 i j x y d s t 8d v 1 i j x y z d d p n c n v 1 i j x y d d t i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 finally as indicated in fig 4 the following eight block matrices consist of the first wavelet transform coefficients of matrix v n s 1 s s i j k s 1 d s i j k d 1 s s i j k d 1 d s i j k s 1 s d i j k s 1 d d i j k d 1 s d i j k and d 1 d d i j k i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n 1 here s 1 d s i j k d 1 s s i j k d 1 d s i j k s 1 s d i j k s 1 d d i j k d 1 s d i j k and d 1 d d i j k are the wavelet coefficients of level 1 the wavelet transform of the second level is performed to the smooth block matrices of s 1 s s i j k i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n 1 based on the wavelet basis matrix c n 1 and the permuting matrix p n 1 which are the halves of c n and p n respectively along x y and z direction in a similar way to the first level transform the wavelet transform coefficients of level 2 s 2 s s i j k s 2 d s i j k d 2 s s i j k d 2 d s i j k s 2 s d i j k s 2 d d i j k d 2 s d i j k and d 2 d d i j k i 1 2 n 2 j 1 2 n 2 k 1 2 n 2 are obtained the illustration of the 3d orthogonal wavelet transform is displayed in fig 4 the pyramidal computation is operated until the matrix of the last wavelet level only consists of 23 23 23 elements which is less than the order of wavelet base or number of c n coefficients at last the coefficients of 3d wavelet transform s is written as 9 s w w w v n t t t here w satisfies w t w i here i is a unit matrix it indicates that the 3d discrete wavelet transform is an orthogonal linear operator and invertible the inverse orthogonal wavelet transform is performed by reversing the procedure as follows 10 v n w t w t s t w being similar to 1d and 2d wavelet multi resolution techniques the matrix of orthogonal wavelet coefficient s is first resolved into the following sum of all levels 11 s d 1 n d 2 n d n 2 n where d i n having a size of 2 n 2 n 2 n is composed of a zero matrix and a coefficient matrix at wavelet level i for example d 1 n of level 1 consists of the eight block matrices 0 s 1 d s i j k d 1 s s i j k d 1 d s i j k s 1 s d i j k s 1 d d i j k d 1 s d i j k and d 1 d d i j k i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 1 k 1 2 n 1 then the inverse orthogonal wavelet transform is applied to the wavelet coefficients eq 11 viz 12 v n w t w t d 1 t w w t w t d 2 t w w t w t d i t w w t w t d n 2 t w here the first term w t w t d 1 t w and the last term w t w t d n 2 t w indicate the components of wavelet level 1 the highest grouped frequency and level n 2 the lowest grouped frequency respectively it is evident that the original data can be reconstructed from the sum of all wavelet components by using the orthogonal wavelet bases such decomposition process is called as the three dimensional wavelet multi resolution technique by using this method the flow structures are decomposed into several wavelet components depended on their central frequencies which exhibits the different scale flow structures in this study 3d wavelet multi resolution technique is applied to analyze 3d instantaneous velocity field of tomo piv data in the spatial domain therefore the central frequencies of wavelet components are replaced by their characteristic scales or central scales in the standard wavelet transform the number of wavelet level is determined based on the number of measurement grid the number of data and the order of wavelet basis the central scale of each level is determined by the spatial resolution of measurement grid for considering the effect of orthogonal wavelet basis some orthogonal wavelet functions daubechies harmonic lmb and meyer were used by mouri et al 1999 they suggested that the statistics of turbulent flow were insensitive to the choice of the wavelets our previous study rinoshika et al 2012 also pointed out that the results of the wavelet multi resolution analysis are essentially independent of the choice of wavelet basis having an order higher than 10 in this study the daubechies wavelet bases with an order of 12 and 20 are chosen as the orthogonal wavelet basis 4 three dimensional wake structures of tomographic piv the 3d isosurface of u u 0 and the time averaged contour of the streamwise velocity behind the short cylinder which is averaged over 400 snapshots is shows in fig 5 the 3d rear recirculation zone is indicated by the isosurface of u u 0 a lower surface is clearly identified near the plane of y d 0 which corresponds to the one found by zhu et al 2017 it is indicated that the downwash flow from the free end surface form such concavity region the recirculation zone gradually contracts along the direction of the main flow and comes to an end at the downstream location of about x d 1 6 owing to the interaction of the vortex shedding from the cylinder sidewall and free end the 3d time averaged streamlines of rear recirculation zone behind the short cylinder is displayed in fig 6 a 3d large scale vortex is evidently observed and the centre line of the large scale vortex is bent in the form of half circle the size of vortex is the largest in the centre plane of y d 0 and shrinks close to the ground plane due to the interaction between the vortex shedding from the cylinder sidewall and ground plane the tip vortex pair originating from the edge of free end plays an important role in the wake of the finite length cylinder fig 7 displays the 3d isosurface of time averaged streamwise x vorticity of ω x d u 0 5 behind the short cylinder which is plotted as red and blue indicating positive and negative vortices respectively a streamwise vortex pair occurring from the free end surface is evidently extracted the streamwise vortex pair exhibits a dipole type and extends downstream to the ground plane owing to the effect of the downwash flow it is a well known fact that time averaged vortical structure of the low aspect ratio cylinder wake exhibits the arch type vortex pattenden et al 2005 zhu et al 2017 had experimentally confirmed the existence of the 3d arch vortex in the cylinder wake with an aspect ratio of 2 by tomo piv in this study we also use the q criterion to extract the arch vortex structure and its main features in the short cylinder wake with an aspect ratio of 1 the q criterion wang et al 2006 is calculated by 13 q ω 2 s 2 2 where ω and s represent the tensor of the angular velocity and the tensor of strain rate respectively the indicates the euclidean norm the q criterion may be used to identify the vortical structures by the excess rotation relative to the strain rate which is normalized by u d 2 in this study fig 8 shows the 3d isosurface distribution of q u d 2 7 in the time averaged flow field colored by the streamwise vorticity ω x d u the arch vortex structure clearly exhibits a w type head instead of a reversed u pattenden et al 2005 or an m shape zhu et al 2017 standing on the ground plane behind the short cylinder two concave parts near the two sides of the horizontal part are evidently observed in w type arch structure which is caused by the downward flow from the free end and tip vortex the center convex of the horizontal part on the w type arch structure is induced due to the strong upwash effect of the large flow separation behind the cylinder as indicated in fig 6 being different from m shape zhu et al 2017 the larger distance between two tip vortices results in the weaker effect of tip vortices on center part of the head even though they have strong vorticity at the two sides of the arch head which is described later based on the above results the mean vortical structures around the short cylinder having a large diameter are sketched in fig 9 which includes tip horseshoe base arch and trailing vortices and their locations although these vortices have been suggested in the literature three dimensional configurations of w type arch vortex is first observed and proposed in this tom piv measurement in particular the interaction among vertical shedding vortices of the side wall horizontal shedding vortex of the free end and tip vortices which form a w type arch vortex could not be found in the planar piv measurement of the previous experiments rinoshika et al 2017 2018 rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 the time averaged streamlines and the contour of the streamwise velocity in the x z plane of y d 0 0 2 and 0 4 are described in fig 10 they visualize the distribution of 3d velocity field in three side view planes as shown in fig 6 the flow field discussed here is not a planar flow but has a highly three dimensional feature at y d 0 and y d 0 2 the separation region is spread over most of the cylinder height the downwash flow originating from the free end surface doesn t reach the ground plane due to the effect of the upwash flow a significant upwash flow that the base vortex induced can be observed at δ d 1 02 mouri et al 1999 and the thickness of the boundary layer may make the stronger upwash flow the height and size of the large scale vortex decrease and the separation region becomes smaller from plane y d 0 to 0 4 meanwhile the height of the saddle point s as indicated in fig 10 increases the downwash flow that the interaction among the vortices causes becomes weaker moving away from the centre plane fig 11 shows the time averaged streamlines with the contour of the mean streamwise velocity in the x y plane at z d 0 2 to 1 0 it visualizes the distribution of 3d velocity field in the top view planes fig 6 a pair of large counter rotating vortices can be clearly seen in the three planes at z d 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 at the height of z d 0 4 the distance between two vortices and the separation region are larger than that of other heights the strong separation flow from the sidewalls makes the separation region become wider at z d 0 4 due to a weak effect of ground plane and free end however the vortices disappear at the positions of z d 0 8 and 1 0 the time averaged velocity vectors with the contour of the streamwise vorticity ω x d u in the y z plane at x d 0 7 1 0 1 4 1 8 2 2 and 2 7 are plotted in fig 12 they visualize the distribution of 3d velocity and vorticity fields in the rear view planes fig 6 at the location of x d 0 7 a pair of tip vortices can be clearly observed the upwash and downwash flows can be seen between two tip vortices near the top surface of the cylinder which is an important reason of forming the w type head of arch structure downstream of x d 1 0 the strong downwash is found near the free end surface and two tip vortices are deformed it is inferred that the w type head of arch vortex is destroyed at this location at the downstream locations of x d 1 4 and 1 8 two tip vortices become dispersed and move toward the ground due to the effects of the downwash flow and other vortices meanwhile their vorticity intensity decreases evidently at further downstream positions of x d 2 2 and 2 7 two tip vortices further decrease and approach the ground plane 5 3d instantaneous multi scale wake structures a 3d distribution of the instantaneous q criterion with isosurface of q u d 2 3 colored by the streamwise vorticity ω x d u is shown in fig 13 3d vortical structures of various scales are clearly observed an instantaneous w type arch vortex as indicated by 1 in fig 13 is very similar to that of the time averaged flow field of fig 8 the free end produces the top flow separation and tip vortices of the trailing edge which induces a w shape arch vortex the center convex of the horizontal part of the w type arch structure is originated by the strong upwash of the large separation flow behind the cylinder as shown in fig 6 of the time averaged flow field the two concave parts of the horizontal part are caused by the strong downward flow and tip vortices it may be said that free end separation flow and the tip vortices induce the shoulders and head of the w type arch structure the arch vortex consists of two vertical shedding vortices the side wall and one horizontal shedding vortex the free end which is connected by two tip vortices therefore the w type arch structure model fig 9 of this study is different from pattenden et al 2005 and zhu et al 2017 the difference between our study and zhu et al 2017 is the aspect ratio of cylinder for aspect ratio 1 as shown in fig 9 the distance of two tip vortices originated from the free edge end becomes large or the height of free end becomes low which induces the strong upwash flows between two tip vortices and forms a w shape arch vortex in the case of the cylinder with aspect ratio 2 zhu et al 2017 the height of free end becomes high or the two tip vortices come close to each other which reduces the upwash flow and forms an m shape arch vortex it is indicated that the head shape of arch vortex structure is associated with the aspect ratio of the cylinder it is also found that the w type arch vortex rapidly breaks down into several fragments downstream as indicated in fig 13 the several vortex structures labeled 2 3 and 4 are identified as fragments of the arch vortices it may be inferred that strong downwash from the center of the surface end produces as re increases which induces arch vortex breaking down rapidly and more evident w shape arch vortex several evident quasi streamwise vortices indicated by 5 and 6 are evidently identified in the instantaneous flow field of fig 13 which is due to the downwash and upwash flows and interacting with the other vortical structures the quasi streamwise vortices are analyzed later to obtain the 3d multi scale flow structures behind the short cylinder the 3d wavelet multi resolution method described in section 3 is applied to 3d instantaneous velocity field of tomo piv 3d velocity fields are decomposed into three wavelet components based on their central scales which represent the large intermediate and small scale structures by orthogonal wavelet multi resolution technique here the large and intermediate scale structures are respectively represented by wavelet component of levels 1 and 2 and the small scale structure consists of level 3 and level 4 according to the spatial resolution of tomo piv the central scales of the large intermediate and small scale structures are respectively a 1 38 4 mm a 1 d 0 55 a 2 19 2 mm a 2 d 0 27 and a 3 7 2 mm a 3 d 0 1 fig 14 a c exhibits the three scales of the 3d instantaneous q i u d 2 isosurface with colored by the streamwise vorticity ω x i d u which is decomposed from the original flow field of fig 13 here i represents the wavelet level in the large scale structure level 1 as shown in fig 14 a a large scale arch vortex labeled 1 is clearly observed meanwhile two large scale streamwise vortex labeled 5 and 6 with the positive and negative senses of rotation are also extracted from the instantaneous flow field of fig 13 one goes through the center of w type arch vortex and develops to the downstream which also dominates the flow structures downstream as decreasing to intermediate scale structures of level 2 in fig 14 b several fragments of w type arch vortices broken down downstream and the intermediate scale streamwise vortices and trailing vortices are extracted in the small scale structure of level 3 with the central scale of 7 2 mm as displayed in fig 14 c the relatively small scale vortices distribute and active behind the cylinder and near the flat plate a part of them is contained in large or intermediate scale flow structures the measured instantaneous streamlines and multi scale streamlines with the contours of the spanwise vorticity ω y d u in the x z plane of y d 0 are displayed in fig 15 a large vortex and several smaller vortices are observed from the instantaneous measured streamlines and its contours of the streamwise vorticity in fig 15 a the large vortex is induced by the downwash flow from the free end and upwash flow from the ground plane the large scale instantaneous streamlines of wavelet level 1 with its contours as indicated in fig 15 b evidently exhibits a large scale vortex with the central scale of 38 4 mm which corresponds to the instantaneous measured large vortex of fig 15 a fig 15 c plotted the instantaneous intermediate scale streamlines with its contours at wavelet level 2 some intermediate scale vortices which represent the fragments of w type arch vortices and trailing vortices and appear in the measured flow structures of fig 15 a are clearly observed as to small scale flow structures of wavelet level 3 as indicated in fig 15 d the relatively small scale vortices distribute in all area and exhibit strong vorticity some of them are also found in the measured flow structures of fig 15 a or are contained in the intermediate scale structures of fig 15 c the measured instantaneous streamlines and contours of the longitudinal vorticity ω z d u in the x y plane at the longitudinal positions of z d 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 are shown in fig 16 the instantaneous longitudinal vortices shedding from the two sidewalls of cylinder are evident at these three positions and the large one acts as a leg of arch vortex fig 17 displayed the large scale instantaneous streamlines and its contours of wavelet level 1 at the three x y planes the leg of arch vortex at y d 0 4 to 0 5 exhibits almost the same size in the x y planes of z d 0 2 and 0 4 however the size of large vortex at the x y plane of z d 0 6 decrease and vorticity strength increases such phenomenon may be induced by the interaction between the shedding vortex of the side wall and the tip vortex of the free end fig 18 plots the intermediate scale flow structures of wavelet level 2 it is apparent that intermediate scale vortices which are fragments of w type arch vortices tip vortices and trailing vortices dominate the flow field in the three x y planes the stronger intermediate scale vortices shedding from the two sidewalls of cylinder are found around y d 0 5 behind the cylinder which exist in the measured flow structures of fig 16 for the small scale flow structures of wavelet level 3 as indicated in fig 19 the small scale vortices are the most active and exhibit the highest vorticity in the x y plane of z d 0 2 although the instantaneous small scale vortices distribute in all measured region this is because this plane is close to the ground plane and horseshoe and base vortices are active some of these small scale vortices can be found in the measured flow structures of fig 16 and others of these small scale vortices are contained in the intermediate scale flow structures of wavelet level 2 the measured instantaneous streamlines and contours of the dimensionless streamwise vorticity ω x d u in the y z plane at the downstream locations of x d 0 7 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 are shown in fig 20 here the black dotted line displays the location of short cylinder at the downstream of x d 0 7 a pair of tip vortex with positive and negative vorticities originating by the trailing edge of the free end appear clearly near the upper corners of free end between the tip vortex pair the upwash and downwash flows are evidently observed near the height of short cylinder which is one important reason of producing instantaneous w type head of arch vortex the instantaneous horseshoe and base vortices are also identified near the ground plane at the location of x d 1 4 this tip vortex pair moves towards the ground plane because of the downwash effect a strong large scale streamwise vortex appears because of the interaction between the downwash flow and shedding vortices from the side wall which is evident observed at x d 1 4 and 2 2 even if the large scale streamwise vortex gradually decays it is also identified at the downstream of x d 3 2 the multi scale instantaneous streamlines and contours of the dimensionless streamwise vorticity ω x d u in the y z plane at x d 0 7 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 which are extracted from 3d wavelet multi resolution analysis of the measured instantaneous 3d velocity data are shown in figs 21 23 at x d 0 7 a pair of tip vortex near the upper corners of free end as shown in fig 21 appears in the large scale flow structures of wavelet level 1 at the downstream of x d 1 4 the vorticity of tip vortex pair and downwash flow increases a strong streamwise vortex develops from x d 1 4 to 2 2 and starts to decay from x d 3 2 it implies that the strong large scale downwash interacts with shedding vortices of the side wall from x d 1 4 to 2 2 and originates the large scale streamwise vortex which cannot be clearly observed from the measured data of fig 20 fig 22 shows the instantaneous intermediate scale flow structures of wavelet level 2 in the y z plane at x d 0 7 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 it is clear that each large scale streamwise vortex contains several intermediate scale vortices and intermediate scale vortices are distributed in all area at the location of x d 0 7 the intermediate scale vortices concentrate on the short cylinder surface especially a vortex pair is clearly observed around y d 0 and z d 1 the trailing edge of free end surface which results in the upwash flow it plays an important role in producing w type head of arch vortex at locations of x d 1 4 and 2 2 several strong vortices distribute in the range of 0 5 y d 0 5 and indicate intermediate scale streamwise vortices comparing with large scale structures the strengths of intermediate scale vortices increase all vortices appearing at the wavelet level 2 correspond to the measured flow structures of fig 20 implying that the intermediate scale vortices dominate the flow strictures however the intermediate scale streamwise vortices decay and move outside downstream of x d 3 2 fig 23 displays the instantaneous small scale flow structures of wavelet level3 in the y z plane at x d 0 7 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 the most small scale vortices are contained in the intermediate scale flow structures and the small scale flow structures are filled with the small scale vortices the small scale vortices increase along the downstream direction due to breaking down of the large and intermediate scale vortices because the hardware limitation comes from the speed of high resolution piv image images transfer 6600 4400 pixels2 from cameras to compute in our measurement it is difficult to analyze 3d vortex shedding process or continuous instantaneous multi scale flow structures in the time domain 6 3d pod analysis of flow structures the pod is decomposing and ranking the measured flow structures based on many snapshots from the time series of velocity vector fields and sorts them in a hierarchy of energy content in the sense of singular value decomposition into orthogonal modes the pod not only identifies the dominant features flow but also constructs low dimensional approximation that may describe the principal flow dynamics with the least number of modes berkooz et al 1993 chatterjee 2000 rowley and dawson 2017 although the pod has been widely applied to analyze the 2dpiv data he et al 2019 the fluctuating energy can t be estimated based on all the three fluctuating velocity components this may have some effect on the fluctuating energy and the pod mode structures in this paper the pod method is applied to analyze the highly 3d short cylinder turbulent wake measured by tomo piv before the application of pod the time averaged velocities are subtracted from the corresponding velocity components at each instant the pod analysis was performed on 100 snapshots of the time sequential volumetric velocity fields to obtain their common spatial modes since the eigenvalues indicate the energy contained in each pod mode the eigenvalues represent the contribution of the corresponding pod mode to the total turbulent fluctuating energy fig 24 shows the percentage of contribution to the total fluctuating energy from the all pod mode based on the pod decomposition of 3d velocity vector fields in 3d short cylinder turbulent wake it is indicated that there exists a rapid decline in energy with increasing mode number especially for the first several modes which is valid for pod modal analysis the energy distributions of the first two modes are found to be similar and significantly larger than the other modes which is the same result as observed in the case of the flow around an infinite cylinder the first two modes 7 3 and 6 occupied approximately two times the energy of mode 3 3 5 and mode 4 2 8 and more than three times the energy of the other modes 2 on the other hand the wake behind the short cylinder is highly unsteady three dimensionally so it is predictable that the first mode exhibits a lower energy compared with the infinite cylinder cases the first two modes account for 13 3 of the total turbulent fluctuating energy which is smaller than their counterpart 18 in the finite length cylinder wake of aspect ratios 2 zhu et al 2017 it implies that the energetic flow structure is weakened as decreasing the aspect ratio of circular cylinder in view of the fact that pod mode 5 and other higher modes make limited contributions to the total turbulent fluctuating energy the following discussion focuses on the first four pod modes in this study the q isosurfaces are calculated by using the three dimensional pod reconstructed velocity field with the corresponding modes to clarify the flow structures of the pod modes the dimensionless q u d 2 isosurfaces of first four pod modes are presented in fig 25 note that the colour of fig 25 does not denote the sense of vortex rotation but distinguishes between the different modes these modes are marked by the corresponding numbers it is observed that the first pair of modes modes 1 and 2 as indicated in fig 25 a is characterized by the alternating streamwise vortex fig 25 b represents the dimensionless q u d 2 isosurfaces of modes 3 and 4 indicated a pair of streamwise vortex with opposite sense of rotation it shows a relatively 3d symmetric wake topology compared to the first pair of modes the structures of mode 4 appear more complicated and less organized the slices fig 26 a d display the dimensionless streamwise vorticity ω x d u contours and velocity vectors for the first four modes at the streamwise location of x d 1 8 the first pair of pod modes modes 1 and 2 shows a symmetric arranged vortex while the second pair modes 3 and 4 shows an antisymmetric arranged vortex the first four modes clearly exhibit several large scale streamwise vortices which are intimately connected with the spanwise vortex shedding from the cylinder sidewalls these figures indicate that the positive and negative streamwise vortices move up and down alternatingly in the x direction similar to the features of the kármán vortex besides the vortex structures near the free end disappear in the first two modes and thus it suggests that the tip vortex doesn t contain large energy this phenomenon was also observed in the finite length cylinder wake of aspect ratios 2 zhu et al 2017 however pairs of symmetric tip vortices and base vortices are first observed near the free end and wall in mode 3 the result conforms to the well established observation that the wake near the cylinder free end is characterized by a pair of symmetric tip vortices and as the downwash flow alters vortex shedding from antisymmetric to symmetrical in fig 27 the four slices at a position of z d 0 40 contoured by the dimensionless longitudinal vorticity ω z d u contours with the overlapped vector fields are extracted from the first four modes it is indicated that mode 1 and mode 2 represent an evidently symmetric arranged pattern the positive and negative contours and occur alternately as shown in fig 27 a b the vorticity concentrations seem to be stretched laterally this structure represents a signature of spanwise vortex shedding however these spanwise vortices break down further downstream and no alternately arranged vortex street occurs since strong downwash flow suppresses spanwise vortex shedding near the cylinder free end however the oppositely signed vorticity concentrations of mode 3 as shown in fig 27 c are symmetrically arranged about the centerline it suggests that mode 3 corresponding to vortex shedding plays a marked role in the near wake dynamics behind a finite length cylinder note that the contribution of turbulent fluctuating energy from mode 3 is 3 5 being a half counterpart of mode 1 7 3 the structure of mode 4 fig 27 d is distinct from any of the first three modes and appears more complicated and less organized its maximum strength also is higher than that of mode 3 one possible explanation is that the downwash and upwash flows both entrain highspeed free stream fluid into the wake which acts to cancel the reversed flow near the cylinder free end and base comparing with wavelet transform the pod is to extract the dominant flow structures from the complex flow field based on the mode energy distribution however the wavelet transform is to decompose the flow structures according to frequencies or scales 7 conclusions the tomo piv measurements are performed and 3d wavelet transform and pod are used to analyze 3d velocity field of tomo piv data in order to reveal the 3d multi scale flow structures around a wall mounted short cylinder the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the 3d w type arch vortex is found behind a short cylinder of aspect ratio 1 the central head of the horizontal part is induced by the upwash flow of the large flow separation and two shoulders of the horizontal part are caused by the downward flow and tip vortices 2 the instantaneous arch vortex and streamwise vortices are extracted at the wavelet level 1 and dominate the flow structures in the near wake 3 the horizontal shape of arch vortex structure is related to the aspect ratio of cylinder 4 the intermediate scale streamwise vortices and trailing vortices are also observed at the wavelet level 2 the intermediate scale upwash vortices induce w type head of arch vortex 5 the small scale structures increase downstream since the large and intermediate scale vortices break down 6 the first two pod modes account for 13 3 of the total turbulent fluctuating energy the first four pod modes exhibit several large scale streamwise vortices and pairs of symmetric tip vortices and base vortices appear in mode 3 credit authorship contribution statement hiroka rinoshika conceptualization methodology investigation

21103,course keeping control of ships deals with the automation of their trajectories for which a better rudder action is required to control the ship heading to continuously remain at the desired reference despite of environmental disturbances like sea winds and sea waves for this purpose this paper proposes robust integral backstepping synergetic and terminal synergetic controllers for good course keeping performance and reducing the energy consumption in course keeping control for ships output response of system energy consumption and smoothness performances have been computed to check the efficiency of these proposed controllers lyapunov stability theory has been used for the proposed nonlinear controllers to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the system proposed controllers

nonlinear controllers for the course keeping control of ships keywords course keeping control robust integral backstepping ibs smc controller synergetic controller sc terminal synergetic controller tsc lyapunov stability 1 introduction a ship is a watercraft that travels in the deep waterways and world s oceans carrying passengers goods and also used for fishing defense mission and research etc skjetne and fossen 2001 in traffic engineering the course keeping control for ships has been considered important research field because the sailing conditions can alter the ship direction of motion in the presence of environmental forces like sea winds and sea waves the control designers are working on designing a controller to ensure that the ship desired course should be accurately tracked by adjusting the rudder angle zhang et al 2017a perez 2005 in recent years the active research has been done to modify the ship model for better representation and performance for this purpose various mathematical models have been proposed in the literature the ship dynamical model is nonlinear in nature making it a challenging task to design controllers for real time control solution and better performance guoqing zhang et al presented composite neural learning fault tolerant algorithm to control the path following activity of underactuated vehicles along with event triggered input zhang et al 2020a due to the presence of uncertainties in actuator faults the neural networks nns weights should be chosen in such away to improve the performance this algorithm provides good control but with higher computational complexity the global tracking control of ships with saturated input where torques were in yaw and surge axis have been established by using the backstepping controller huang et al 2015 due to motor driven system the torque is also limited this controller does not provide good control objectives as it causes delayed convergence and computational complexity observed in case of boundedness of virtual controls nonlinear backstepping controller along with adaptive neural network has been presented for course control of underactuated ships yuan et al 2016 this method works well as compared to linear controllers but the adaptive neural network method is much complex which requires the exact information about the system to determine parameters in case of unknown virtual controls qiang zhang et al proposed a nonlinear adaptive backstepping control algorithm based on neural networks and dynamic surface control zhang et al 2017b which worked well as compared to other controllers but still there is a large energy consumption of course keeping control for ships optimal backstepping controller has been proposed by using the disturbance observer and firefly optimization algorithm ejaz and chen 2018 but the results show delayed convergence robust neural event triggered control has been proposed for dynamic positioning of ships in the presence of actuator faults zhang et al 2020b control method provides good results by catering out uncertainties that present in marine ship model but with higher computational complexity the proportional derivative pd and backstepping controllers have been implemented for station keeping control of an unmanned surface vehicle subjected to wind disturbance and current sarda et al 2016 the controllers performed well under low speed of wind but frequent fluctuations in wind speed reduces the efficiency of control action an algorithm of linear reduction of backstepping controller has been proposed based on nonlinear decoration control zhang et al 2018 the study showed that sine wave function cannot be employed directly in case of nonlinear feedback control because it reduces the performance of course keeping control for ships to overcome this problem bandwidth of system has been compromised xiaogong lin et al proposed nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller for the dynamic positioning system of ships lin et al 2018 but it completely depends upon the base rules made according to situation and present data set the design of integrated direct drive volume control for steering system has been proposed by using sliding mode controller shen et al 2017 but the results showed the delayed convergence h yasukawa et al presented a work on course stability and steady sailing conditions of ship under the effect of external disturbance by considering mmg standard method yasukawa and sakuno 2020 qiang zhang et al proposed pid based nonlinear feedback controller driven by bipolar sigmoid function zhang et al 2017c which works well but with large energy consumption of course keeping currently some nonlinear controllers have also been proposed for course keeping control of ships zhang and zhang 2019 backstepping algorithm used to develop a feedback control law through its recursive operation lyapunov stability study has been presented to ensure the global stability of entire system zhang and zhang 2019 khalil 2015 it shows overshoots undershoots in output high energy consumption poor smoothness and response performances improved concise backstepping algorithm has been proposed by using nonlinear feedback technique where arctan nonlinear function has been used zhang and zhang 2019 simulations results showed that the nonlinear feedback controller operates well as compared to backstepping controller but still large settling time has been observed for tracking the desired course signal and consumes more energy during course keeping control for ships moreover the bandwidth of the system has been compromised because if the sinusoidal function is applied directly to the proposed algorithm then the performance of course keeping control for ships will reduce now the need is to enhance the dynamic response of the system so that the proposed controller may work efficiently and exhibit the characteristics like minimum settling time higher response performance low energy consumption during course keeping control of ships low steady state error during tracking of desired course value and better performance under external disturbances like sea winds and waves in order to meet these requirements this paper proposed robust integral backstepping integral backstepping integrated with sliding mode controller synergetic and terminal synergetic controllers the robust integral backstepping controller has a switching function in its control law to provide strong robustness against external disturbances like sea winds and sea waves lyapunov stability theory has been presented to ensure the global asymptotic stability of entire system siffat et al 2020 ali et al 2019 synergetic controller that consists of macro variable function by considering all tracking errors of the system helps in tracking the desired values of system efficiently kolesnikov 2014 qian et al 2017 santi et al 2004 terminal synergetic controller tsc is based on the theory of terminal attractor and synergetic control it has an ability to track the system references in a finite time it also ensures the finite time convergence of tracking errors to zero without exhibiting chattering phenomenon lyapunov stability theory has been used to verify its finite time global stability of system liu and hsiao 2012 hachana and mohamed n 2018 the comparison of these proposed nonlinear controllers with the conventional pid controller and recently proposed nonlinear controllers zhang and zhang 2019 presents the difference in performances of these controllers during course keeping control for ships this paper has been arranged as follows the dynamical model of the ship has been discussed in section ii the design procedure of the proposed controllers has been discussed in section iii where tsc sc and ibs smc based controllers along with their stability proofs have been explained in subsections iii a iii b and iii c respectively simulation results and comparative study of proposed nonlinear controllers have been explained in section iv where the results of the proposed nonlinear controllers for course keeping and course tracking control of ships course keeping control in the presence of external disturbance and comparative study of proposed controllers have been detailed in subsections iv a iv b iv c and iv d respectively the conclusion has been mentioned in section v 2 dynamical model of ship different mathematical models for ships have been proposed in the literature showing the dynamic response of the system states over time they show the effective relationship between states of system in the presence of random disturbances like sea waves and sea winds a dynamical model of ship given in zhang and zhang 2019 by equation 1 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 f x 2 b u y x 1 where x 1 ω and x 2 ω represent the ship heading and yaw rates respectively y is the output of system and f x 2 is the nonlinearity in ship model given as 2 f x 2 k t h ω h ω α ω β ω 3 b k t u θ where u is the control input of system that is rudder angle and established for course keeping control of ship α and β are proportional coefficients of yaw rate ω and having positive values while k and t are maneuverability parameters of the ship the maximum value of rudder angle is limited to θ 35 35 and the swing rate for rudder set as 5 s see fig 1 3 controller design procedure ship model given by eq 1 has nonlinear function f x 2 given by eq 2 so a better nonlinear controller is needed to achieve the control objectives of the system fig 2 shows the closed loop representation of the nonlinear ship model actual ship heading appeared as feedback for the design of controller the difference between the actual value and reference value of ship heading has been considered as an error equation the controllers to be proposed are required to meet the following control objectives tracking the reference value of ship heading to maintain the course keeping control for ships sine wave course should be accurately tracked to ensure the energy saving effect to achieve better rudder action to save maximum output energy of controller and obtain better control performance the system as a whole should be globally stable 3 1 robust integral backstepping controller in order to design robust integral backstepping controller the first step is to introduced the reference value for ship heading say x 1 r e f the tracking error between ship heading and desired reference value is defined as 3 e 1 x 1 x 1 r e f in order to track the desired reference the error term must converge to zero taking time derivative of eq 3 gives 4 e 1 x 1 x 1 r e f by substituting the value of x 1 from eq 1 into eq 4 we have 5 e 1 x 2 x 1 r e f now consider integral term ρ to reduce the steady state error that is present in generic backstepping algorithm 6 ρ 0 t x 1 x 1 r e f d t taking time derivative of eq 6 we have 7 ρ x 1 x 1 r e f comparing eq 3 with eq 7 we have 8 ρ e 1 consider the lyapunov candidate function for the system as 9 v 1 1 2 e 1 2 γ 2 ρ 2 where γ is a positive constant taking time derivative of eq 9 we have 10 v 1 e 1 e 1 γ ρ ρ putting the value of ρ from eq 8 and the value of e 1 from eq 5 into eq 10 and simplifying we get 11 v 1 e 1 x 2 x 1 r e f γ ρ v 1 should be negative definite to ensure the stability of system for this purpose we take 12 x 2 x 1 r e f γ ρ c 1 e 1 where c 1 is a gain of controller and is positive constant from eq 11 and eq 12 we have 13 v 1 c 1 e 1 2 0 now by introducing the state x 2 reference value as a virtual control α 1 whose value is computed from eq 12 we have 14 α 1 c 1 e 1 x 1 r e f γ ρ x 2 should be equal to α 1 for a system to be stable so the next error is introduced as 15 e 2 x 2 α 1 where e 2 is the difference between actual yaw rate and virtual one now placing the value of α 1 and x 2 from eqs 14 and 15 respectively into eq 5 and simplifying it for e 1 we get 16 e 1 e 2 c 1 e 1 γ ρ taking time derivative of eq 15 we get 17 e 2 x 2 α 1 in order to find the value of α 1 taking time derivative of eq 14 and putting the value of ρ from eq 8 into obtained α 1 we have 18 α 1 c 1 e 1 e 1 γ to ensure the global stability of system the combined lyapunov candidate function is considered as 19 v c v 1 1 2 e 2 2 taking time derivative of eq 19 we have 20 v c v 1 e 2 e 2 by substituting the value of e 1 from eq 16 into eq 10 and simplifying it we get the updated value of v 1 as 21 v 1 e 1 e 2 c 1 e 1 2 now by placing the value of v 1 from eq 21 into eq 20 we have 22 v c c 1 e 1 2 e 2 e 1 e 2 v c should be negative definite for the system to be stable for which we put 23 e 1 e 2 c 2 e 2 where c 2 is the controller gain and is positive constant using eq 23 eq 22 becomes 24 v c c 1 e 1 2 c 2 e 2 2 since c 1 and c 2 are positive constants so 25 v c 0 putting the value of e 2 from eq 23 into eq 17 we have 26 x 2 α 1 c 2 e 2 e 1 by putting the value of x 2 from eq 1 into eq 26 we get the equivalent control law u as 27 u e q u 1 b e 1 c 2 e 2 f x 2 α 1 now considered a sliding surface to include the robustness in integral backstepping as 28 s c 1 e 1 c 2 e 2 in order to make the integral backstepping controller robust a switching term is added in equivalent control law u given as 29 u s w k 1 s g n s where k 1 is a switching gain and is positive constant and s g n s is a switching function represented as 30 s g n s 1 i f s 0 0 i f s 0 1 i f s 0 so the overall control law u can be written as 31 u u e q u u s w which is the required control law obtained by using ibs smc technique robustness can be analyzed in case of ibs smc by adding external disturbance d t in x 1 in eq 1 of the system as follows 32 x 1 x 2 d t where d t and d t satisfy the following inequalities 33 d t m 1 d t m 2 where m 1 and m 2 are the bounds of d t and d t respectively and their values should be greater than or equal to the variance of noise signal so by repeating the same process as done in the beginning of this section a the value of control input with disturbance can be calculated as 34 u 1 b e 1 c 2 e 2 f x 2 α 1 d t k 1 s g n s 3 2 synergetic controller in order to obtain the control law u from synergetic controller we introduced another error e 3 which is the difference between actual yaw rate and desired one x 2 r e f given as 35 e 3 x 2 x 2 r e f taking time derivative of eq 32 we have 36 e 3 x 2 x 2 r e f now we consider a macro variable which is linear combination of tracking errors since the dynamical model of ship given by eq 1 has only one control input u so we can have only one macro variable ψ as 37 ψ a 1 e 1 a 2 e 3 where a 1 and a 2 are positive gains of sc the values of these positive gains are manually set by using trail and error approach taking time derivative of eq 34 we get 38 ψ a 1 e 1 a 2 e 3 now substituting the values of e 1 and e 3 from eqs 4 and 33 respectively into eq 35 we have 39 ψ a 1 x 1 x 1 r e f a 2 x 2 x 2 r e f putting the values of x 1 and x 2 from eq 1 into eq 36 we get 40 ψ a 1 x 2 x 1 r e f a 2 f x 2 b u x 2 r e f consider the dynamic evaluation equation for macro variable ψ as 41 t 1 ψ ψ 0 where t 1 is the convergence rate of the tracking errors and is the positive constant by placing the value of ψ from eq 37 into eq 38 we have 42 t 1 a 1 x 2 x 1 r e f a 2 f x 2 b u x 2 r e f ψ 0 since the references are constant values so the derivative of x1ref and x 2 r e f will be zero after simplification of eq 39 and solving for control input u we have 43 u 1 a 2 b a 1 x 2 a 2 f x 2 ψ t 1 which is the required control law obtained by using synergetic controller to track the reference trajectory for stability of the system the lyapunov candidate function is considered as 44 v 2 1 2 ψ 2 taking time derivative of eq 41 we get 45 v 2 ψ ψ by substituting the value of ψ from eq 38 into eq 42 we have 46 v 2 ψ 2 t 1 from eq 43 the pursuing expression can be write as 47 v 2 2 t 1 v 2 finally the solution of eq 44 can be write as 48 v 2 v 2 0 e 2 t 1 t where v 2 0 is the value of lyapunov function v 2 at t 0 so eq 45 ensures the global exponential stability of system 3 3 terminal synergetic controller terminal synergetic controller depends upon the terminal attractor and synergetic control theory a control law is obtained by using synergetic control theory along with terminal attractor to achieve finite time convergence now by introducing a macro variable ζ by using terminal attractor as 49 ζ e 1 w 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 e 3 w 2 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 where w 1 and w 2 are designed positive constants while p 1 q 1 p 2 and q 2 are positive odd numbers such that 1 p 1 q 1 2 1 p 2 q 2 2 taking time derivative of eq 46 we have 50 ζ e 1 w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 e 3 w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 by putting the values of e 1 and e 3 from eqs 5 and 33 respectively into eq 47 we get 51 ζ x 1 x 1 r e f w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 x 2 x 2 r e f w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 now substituting the values of x 1 and x 2 from eq 1 into eq 48 we have 52 ζ x 2 x 1 r e f w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 f x 2 b u x 2 r e f w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 consider the dynamic evaluation equation for the macro variable ζ as follows 53 t 2 ζ ζ 0 where t 2 is the convergence rate of terminal attractor and is positive constant by substituting the value of ζ from eq 49 into eq 50 we get 54 t 2 x 2 x 1 r e f w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 f x 2 b u x 2 r e f w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 ζ 0 solving eq 51 for the control input u we have 55 u 1 b x 2 x 1 r e f w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 f x 2 x 2 r e f w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 ζ t 2 which is the required control law obtained by using terminal synergetic control technique to track the desired reference trajectory to ensure stability of system the lyapunov function can be considered as 56 v 3 1 2 ζ 2 taking time derivative of eq 53 we get 57 v 3 ζ ζ by substituting the value of ζ from eq 50 into eq 54 we have 58 v 3 ζ 2 t 2 from eq 55 the pursuing expression can be write as 59 v 3 2 t 2 v 3 finally the solution of eq 56 can be write as 60 v 3 v 3 0 e 2 t 2 t where v 3 0 is the value of lyapunov function v 3 at t 0 so eq 57 ensures the global exponential finite time stability of system 4 simulation results in order to check the validation of all the proposed controllers they have been simulated on matlab simulink the designed parameters have been chosen by hit and trial method and have positive values the various parameters of ship model under ballast condition have been mentioned in table 1 whereas the data about yupeng training ship of dalian maritime university is mentioned in table 2 4 1 course keeping control in case of course keeping control for ship the ship heading reference value has been set at ω r 50 tracked by x 1 state of system the response of ship heading is initiated from t 0 and its initial condition is to be taken as x 1 0 0 the parametric values have been mentioned in table 3 fig 3 represents the comparative analysis of proposed nonlinear controllers for checking tracking response of the ship heading by using the proposed controllers in case of ibs smc the settling time for tracking of ship heading is 117 24 s and the maximum rudder angle is 35 while the mean rudder angle is 0 27 whereas in case of sc the settling time for tracking of ship heading drops to 106 73 s and the maximum rudder angle drops to 19 8 while the mean rudder angle falls to 0 18 as mentioned in table 5 also no overshoot undershoot has been observed in the output signal tsc which provides fast and finite time convergence of system states tracking errors of ship tsc has settling time of 103 17 s for the tracking of ship heading the maximum rudder angle drops to 12 9 while the mean rudder angle falls to 0 11 also it can see that tsc depicts chattering free tracking of heading angle 50 of ship and no overshoot undershoot has been observed in the output signal furthermore to check out the control performance of proposed controller for course keeping control of ship we considered the three performance analysis specifications represented in the form of formulas mentioned in zhang et al 2018 and zhang and zhang 2019 as 61 mae 1 t t 0 t 0 t ω r y t d t mia 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t d t mtv 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t u t 1 d t where mean absolute error mae tells about the response performance of output of system mean integral absolute mia provides the analysis about energy consumption of control input and mean total variation mtv describes about the smoothness of algorithm according to table 5 it has been observed that mae value for ibs smc controller is 0 06639 for sc is 0 07147 and for tsc is 0 07814 this analysis shows that response performance of tsc controller is better than both sc and ibs smc furthermore mia value for ibs smc is 0 01326 for sc is 0 011002 and for tsc is 0 009071 this energy consumption analysis shows that tsc saves more energy as compared to the other proposed nonlinear controllers for course keeping control of ship likewise it has been observed that mtv value for ibs smc controller is 0 00223 for sc is 0 00085 and for tsc is 0 00077 showing that tsc performs better as compared to other proposed nonlinear controllers it means that rudder blade s revolution amplitude is smaller in case of tsc due to this smaller revolution amplitude the rudder s wear reduces and it saves more energy indirectly 4 2 course tracking control in case of course tracking control the simulations have been carried out with sine wave course tracking for which a sinusoidal function has been introduced as a reference angle for heading angle of ship ω r 30 sin 2 π 600 t the response of ship heading is initiated from t 0 and the initial condition for nonlinear controllers response is to be taken as ω o 10 the design parameters values for nonlinear controllers have been mentioned in table 4 fig 5 a presents the comparative analysis of the proposed nonlinear controllers for sine wave course tracking of ship which shows that the tracking of sine wave ship heading can be achieved by all the proposed nonlinear controllers but tsc provides better convergence as compared to all other proposed controllers fig 5 b shows that the maximum rudder angle for ibs smc controller is 19 2 and the mean rudder angle is 3 76 on the other hand the maximum rudder angle for sc drops to 12 6 and the mean rudder angle falls to 3 36 similarly the maximum rudder angle for tsc drops to 8 6 and its mean rudder angle drops to 3 15 this analysis shows that control effect of tsc is better furthermore in case of course tracking control the results of proposed controllers have been validated on the basis of performance analysis specifications mentioned in table 6 it has been observed that mae value for ibs smc controller is 0 03752 while the mia value is 0 05906 and mtv value is 0 00521 in case of sc mae is 0 03897 mia value is 0 01764 and mtv value is 0 00165 so the control effect of sc is better than ibs smc controller in case of tsc the mae mia and mtv values are 0 03922 0 01459 and 0 00124 respectively this comprehensive analysis shows that the according to energy saving effects due to sc and tsc are better as compared to ibs smc see fig 7 4 3 course keeping analysis in case of external disturbances during the navigation of ship at sea some of the external environmental parameters like winds ocean current and waves can cause a ship heading deviation liu 2017 so in this paper random generated sea waves and sea winds as a disturbance has been considered for this purpose the interference of sea winds is considered between average and impulse wind the white noise is used to represent the impulse wind zhang and zhang 2019 we introduced the equivalent value of rudder angle to support the simulation results with practical necessity and formula for calculation of θ w i n d zhang and zhang 2019 zhang and zhang 2014 presented as 62 θ w i n d k v r v 2 sin γ r where θ w i n d 3 v r is the relative speed of ship k is a leeway coefficient and γ r is a wind bearing here we actually introduced a second order oscillation system mentioned in zhang and zhang 2019 zhang et al 2017d and that is taken from white noise with finite frequency shown as 63 h s 0 4198 s s 2 0 3638 s 0 3675 so by reducing ship speed the value of k reduces and then the value of mean rudder angle increases in this way we can save controller output energy in an efficient manner 4 4 comparative analysis of nonlinear controllers this subsection describes the comparison b w various facets of proposed nonlinear controllers and recently suggested nonlinear controllers in the literature for this purpose tables 5 and 6 have been developed to point out the merits and demerits of these controllers pid controller has higher settling time of 445 58 s as compared to nonlinear controllers mentioned in table 5 the response performance of pid controller is less as it has lower value of mae consumes more energy and depicts lower smoothness as it has higher values of mia and mtv so the pid controller performance for course keeping and course tracking of ship is not better as compared to nonlinear controllers backstepping controller has higher settling time of 185 s and lower mae value its means that response performance of backstepping controller is lower as compared to tsc sc and ibs smc also it consumes more control input energy and its smoothness is low as it has higher mia and mtv values for both course keeping and course tracking control of ship as compared to proposed nonlinear controller nonlinear feedback controller has higher settling time of 157 s as compared to tsc sc and ibs smc the maximum and mean rudder angle values is higher as compared to sc and tsc mae value is lower as compared to proposed controller which means that it shows low response performance also it consumes more control input energy and depicts low smoothness as compared to sc and tsc as it has higher values of mia and mtv mentioned in table 6 ibs smc has higher settling time of 117 24 s as compared to tsc and sc but lower than nonlinear feedback backstepping and pid controller moreover it has higher value of mia as compared to backstepping and nonlinear feedback controller which simply means that its response performance is better than backstepping and nonlinear feedback controller for course keeping and course tracking control of ship it consumes more control input energy and exhibts low smoothness as compared to tsc and sc as it has higher values of mia and mtv respectively tsc and sc consume less energy and depict better smoothness for course keeping and course tracking control of ship as they have lower values of mia and mtv as compared to other nonlinear controllers their maximum and mean rudder angle values are also lower as compared to other controllers their settling times are of 103 17 s and 106 73 s respectively which is less as compared to ibs smc nonlinear feedback backstepping and pid controller according to this study tsc performs is better as compared to all other proposed controllers it provides fast and finite time convergence there is no overshoot undershoot observed and depicts the lesser settling time as compared to all other nonlinear controllers furthermore it consumes less control input energy and has better response performance as compared to all other nonlinear controllers ibs smc shows strong robustness against external disturbances like sea winds and sea waves which means that it has good ability to track the desired course in the presence of disturbances 5 conclusion maintaining the better performance of course keeping control for ships has been a major problem as the environmental factors like sea winds and sea waves can alter the sailing conditions that leads to variations in ship motion to overcome this problem three nonlinear controllers namely robust integral backstepping terminal synergetic and synergetic controllers have been proposed for course keeping control of ship simulation results in matlab simulink show that all the proposed nonlinear controllers work well but tsc provides fast and finite time convergence depicts better response performance and consumes less energy during course keeping control for ships when external disturbances like sea winds and sea waves have applied to ship dynamical model then controller ibs smc shows strong robustness against these disturbances and track the desired course efficiently furthermore the comparative analysis of proposed nonlinear controllers with conventional pid and recently proposed controllers shows that proposed nonlinear controllers have better results future work may comprises the implementation of these control techniques on real platform or to further reduce the energy consumption for course keeping by using different controllers credit authorship contribution statement muhammad muzammal islam software formal analysis validation writing original draftwriting original draft syed ahmad

tsc lyapunov stability 1 introduction a ship is a watercraft that travels in the deep waterways and world s oceans carrying passengers goods and also used for fishing defense mission and research etc skjetne and fossen 2001 in traffic engineering the course keeping control for ships has been considered important research field because the sailing conditions can alter the ship direction of motion in the presence of environmental forces like sea winds and sea waves the control designers are working on designing a controller to ensure that the ship desired course should be accurately tracked by adjusting the rudder angle zhang et al 2017a perez 2005 in recent years the active research has been done to modify the ship model for better representation and performance for this purpose various mathematical models have been proposed in the literature the ship dynamical model is nonlinear in nature making it a challenging task to design controllers for real time control solution and better performance guoqing zhang et al presented composite neural learning fault tolerant algorithm to control the path following activity of underactuated vehicles along with event triggered input zhang et al 2020a due to the presence of uncertainties in actuator faults the neural networks nns weights should be chosen in such away to improve the performance this algorithm provides good control but with higher computational complexity the global tracking control of ships with saturated input where torques were in yaw and surge axis have been established by using the backstepping controller huang et al 2015 due to motor driven system the torque is also limited this controller does not provide good control objectives as it causes delayed convergence and computational complexity observed in case of boundedness of virtual controls nonlinear backstepping controller along with adaptive neural network has been presented for course control of underactuated ships yuan et al 2016 this method works well as compared to linear controllers but the adaptive neural network method is much complex which requires the exact information about the system to determine parameters in case of unknown virtual controls qiang zhang et al proposed a nonlinear adaptive backstepping control algorithm based on neural networks and dynamic surface control zhang et al 2017b which worked well as compared to other controllers but still there is a large energy consumption of course keeping control for ships optimal backstepping controller has been proposed by using the disturbance observer and firefly optimization algorithm ejaz and chen 2018 but the results show delayed convergence robust neural event triggered control has been proposed for dynamic positioning of ships in the presence of actuator faults zhang et al 2020b control method provides good results by catering out uncertainties that present in marine ship model but with higher computational complexity the proportional derivative pd and backstepping controllers have been implemented for station keeping control of an unmanned surface vehicle subjected to wind disturbance and current sarda et al 2016 the controllers performed well under low speed of wind but frequent fluctuations in wind speed reduces the efficiency of control action an algorithm of linear reduction of backstepping controller has been proposed based on nonlinear decoration control zhang et al 2018 the study showed that sine wave function cannot be employed directly in case of nonlinear feedback control because it reduces the performance of course keeping control for ships to overcome this problem bandwidth of system has been compromised xiaogong lin et al proposed nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller for the dynamic positioning system of ships lin et al 2018 but it completely depends upon the base rules made according to situation and present data set the design of integrated direct drive volume control for steering system has been proposed by using sliding mode controller shen et al 2017 but the results showed the delayed convergence h yasukawa et al presented a work on course stability and steady sailing conditions of ship under the effect of external disturbance by considering mmg standard method yasukawa and sakuno 2020 qiang zhang et al proposed pid based nonlinear feedback controller driven by bipolar sigmoid function zhang et al 2017c which works well but with large energy consumption of course keeping currently some nonlinear controllers have also been proposed for course keeping control of ships zhang and zhang 2019 backstepping algorithm used to develop a feedback control law through its recursive operation lyapunov stability study has been presented to ensure the global stability of entire system zhang and zhang 2019 khalil 2015 it shows overshoots undershoots in output high energy consumption poor smoothness and response performances improved concise backstepping algorithm has been proposed by using nonlinear feedback technique where arctan nonlinear function has been used zhang and zhang 2019 simulations results showed that the nonlinear feedback controller operates well as compared to backstepping controller but still large settling time has been observed for tracking the desired course signal and consumes more energy during course keeping control for ships moreover the bandwidth of the system has been compromised because if the sinusoidal function is applied directly to the proposed algorithm then the performance of course keeping control for ships will reduce now the need is to enhance the dynamic response of the system so that the proposed controller may work efficiently and exhibit the characteristics like minimum settling time higher response performance low energy consumption during course keeping control of ships low steady state error during tracking of desired course value and better performance under external disturbances like sea winds and waves in order to meet these requirements this paper proposed robust integral backstepping integral backstepping integrated with sliding mode controller synergetic and terminal synergetic controllers the robust integral backstepping controller has a switching function in its control law to provide strong robustness against external disturbances like sea winds and sea waves lyapunov stability theory has been presented to ensure the global asymptotic stability of entire system siffat et al 2020 ali et al 2019 synergetic controller that consists of macro variable function by considering all tracking errors of the system helps in tracking the desired values of system efficiently kolesnikov 2014 qian et al 2017 santi et al 2004 terminal synergetic controller tsc is based on the theory of terminal attractor and synergetic control it has an ability to track the system references in a finite time it also ensures the finite time convergence of tracking errors to zero without exhibiting chattering phenomenon lyapunov stability theory has been used to verify its finite time global stability of system liu and hsiao 2012 hachana and mohamed n 2018 the comparison of these proposed nonlinear controllers with the conventional pid controller and recently proposed nonlinear controllers zhang and zhang 2019 presents the difference in performances of these controllers during course keeping control for ships this paper has been arranged as follows the dynamical model of the ship has been discussed in section ii the design procedure of the proposed controllers has been discussed in section iii where tsc sc and ibs smc based controllers along with their stability proofs have been explained in subsections iii a iii b and iii c respectively simulation results and comparative study of proposed nonlinear controllers have been explained in section iv where the results of the proposed nonlinear controllers for course keeping and course tracking control of ships course keeping control in the presence of external disturbance and comparative study of proposed controllers have been detailed in subsections iv a iv b iv c and iv d respectively the conclusion has been mentioned in section v 2 dynamical model of ship different mathematical models for ships have been proposed in the literature showing the dynamic response of the system states over time they show the effective relationship between states of system in the presence of random disturbances like sea waves and sea winds a dynamical model of ship given in zhang and zhang 2019 by equation 1 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 f x 2 b u y x 1 where x 1 ω and x 2 ω represent the ship heading and yaw rates respectively y is the output of system and f x 2 is the nonlinearity in ship model given as 2 f x 2 k t h ω h ω α ω β ω 3 b k t u θ where u is the control input of system that is rudder angle and established for course keeping control of ship α and β are proportional coefficients of yaw rate ω and having positive values while k and t are maneuverability parameters of the ship the maximum value of rudder angle is limited to θ 35 35 and the swing rate for rudder set as 5 s see fig 1 3 controller design procedure ship model given by eq 1 has nonlinear function f x 2 given by eq 2 so a better nonlinear controller is needed to achieve the control objectives of the system fig 2 shows the closed loop representation of the nonlinear ship model actual ship heading appeared as feedback for the design of controller the difference between the actual value and reference value of ship heading has been considered as an error equation the controllers to be proposed are required to meet the following control objectives tracking the reference value of ship heading to maintain the course keeping control for ships sine wave course should be accurately tracked to ensure the energy saving effect to achieve better rudder action to save maximum output energy of controller and obtain better control performance the system as a whole should be globally stable 3 1 robust integral backstepping controller in order to design robust integral backstepping controller the first step is to introduced the reference value for ship heading say x 1 r e f the tracking error between ship heading and desired reference value is defined as 3 e 1 x 1 x 1 r e f in order to track the desired reference the error term must converge to zero taking time derivative of eq 3 gives 4 e 1 x 1 x 1 r e f by substituting the value of x 1 from eq 1 into eq 4 we have 5 e 1 x 2 x 1 r e f now consider integral term ρ to reduce the steady state error that is present in generic backstepping algorithm 6 ρ 0 t x 1 x 1 r e f d t taking time derivative of eq 6 we have 7 ρ x 1 x 1 r e f comparing eq 3 with eq 7 we have 8 ρ e 1 consider the lyapunov candidate function for the system as 9 v 1 1 2 e 1 2 γ 2 ρ 2 where γ is a positive constant taking time derivative of eq 9 we have 10 v 1 e 1 e 1 γ ρ ρ putting the value of ρ from eq 8 and the value of e 1 from eq 5 into eq 10 and simplifying we get 11 v 1 e 1 x 2 x 1 r e f γ ρ v 1 should be negative definite to ensure the stability of system for this purpose we take 12 x 2 x 1 r e f γ ρ c 1 e 1 where c 1 is a gain of controller and is positive constant from eq 11 and eq 12 we have 13 v 1 c 1 e 1 2 0 now by introducing the state x 2 reference value as a virtual control α 1 whose value is computed from eq 12 we have 14 α 1 c 1 e 1 x 1 r e f γ ρ x 2 should be equal to α 1 for a system to be stable so the next error is introduced as 15 e 2 x 2 α 1 where e 2 is the difference between actual yaw rate and virtual one now placing the value of α 1 and x 2 from eqs 14 and 15 respectively into eq 5 and simplifying it for e 1 we get 16 e 1 e 2 c 1 e 1 γ ρ taking time derivative of eq 15 we get 17 e 2 x 2 α 1 in order to find the value of α 1 taking time derivative of eq 14 and putting the value of ρ from eq 8 into obtained α 1 we have 18 α 1 c 1 e 1 e 1 γ to ensure the global stability of system the combined lyapunov candidate function is considered as 19 v c v 1 1 2 e 2 2 taking time derivative of eq 19 we have 20 v c v 1 e 2 e 2 by substituting the value of e 1 from eq 16 into eq 10 and simplifying it we get the updated value of v 1 as 21 v 1 e 1 e 2 c 1 e 1 2 now by placing the value of v 1 from eq 21 into eq 20 we have 22 v c c 1 e 1 2 e 2 e 1 e 2 v c should be negative definite for the system to be stable for which we put 23 e 1 e 2 c 2 e 2 where c 2 is the controller gain and is positive constant using eq 23 eq 22 becomes 24 v c c 1 e 1 2 c 2 e 2 2 since c 1 and c 2 are positive constants so 25 v c 0 putting the value of e 2 from eq 23 into eq 17 we have 26 x 2 α 1 c 2 e 2 e 1 by putting the value of x 2 from eq 1 into eq 26 we get the equivalent control law u as 27 u e q u 1 b e 1 c 2 e 2 f x 2 α 1 now considered a sliding surface to include the robustness in integral backstepping as 28 s c 1 e 1 c 2 e 2 in order to make the integral backstepping controller robust a switching term is added in equivalent control law u given as 29 u s w k 1 s g n s where k 1 is a switching gain and is positive constant and s g n s is a switching function represented as 30 s g n s 1 i f s 0 0 i f s 0 1 i f s 0 so the overall control law u can be written as 31 u u e q u u s w which is the required control law obtained by using ibs smc technique robustness can be analyzed in case of ibs smc by adding external disturbance d t in x 1 in eq 1 of the system as follows 32 x 1 x 2 d t where d t and d t satisfy the following inequalities 33 d t m 1 d t m 2 where m 1 and m 2 are the bounds of d t and d t respectively and their values should be greater than or equal to the variance of noise signal so by repeating the same process as done in the beginning of this section a the value of control input with disturbance can be calculated as 34 u 1 b e 1 c 2 e 2 f x 2 α 1 d t k 1 s g n s 3 2 synergetic controller in order to obtain the control law u from synergetic controller we introduced another error e 3 which is the difference between actual yaw rate and desired one x 2 r e f given as 35 e 3 x 2 x 2 r e f taking time derivative of eq 32 we have 36 e 3 x 2 x 2 r e f now we consider a macro variable which is linear combination of tracking errors since the dynamical model of ship given by eq 1 has only one control input u so we can have only one macro variable ψ as 37 ψ a 1 e 1 a 2 e 3 where a 1 and a 2 are positive gains of sc the values of these positive gains are manually set by using trail and error approach taking time derivative of eq 34 we get 38 ψ a 1 e 1 a 2 e 3 now substituting the values of e 1 and e 3 from eqs 4 and 33 respectively into eq 35 we have 39 ψ a 1 x 1 x 1 r e f a 2 x 2 x 2 r e f putting the values of x 1 and x 2 from eq 1 into eq 36 we get 40 ψ a 1 x 2 x 1 r e f a 2 f x 2 b u x 2 r e f consider the dynamic evaluation equation for macro variable ψ as 41 t 1 ψ ψ 0 where t 1 is the convergence rate of the tracking errors and is the positive constant by placing the value of ψ from eq 37 into eq 38 we have 42 t 1 a 1 x 2 x 1 r e f a 2 f x 2 b u x 2 r e f ψ 0 since the references are constant values so the derivative of x1ref and x 2 r e f will be zero after simplification of eq 39 and solving for control input u we have 43 u 1 a 2 b a 1 x 2 a 2 f x 2 ψ t 1 which is the required control law obtained by using synergetic controller to track the reference trajectory for stability of the system the lyapunov candidate function is considered as 44 v 2 1 2 ψ 2 taking time derivative of eq 41 we get 45 v 2 ψ ψ by substituting the value of ψ from eq 38 into eq 42 we have 46 v 2 ψ 2 t 1 from eq 43 the pursuing expression can be write as 47 v 2 2 t 1 v 2 finally the solution of eq 44 can be write as 48 v 2 v 2 0 e 2 t 1 t where v 2 0 is the value of lyapunov function v 2 at t 0 so eq 45 ensures the global exponential stability of system 3 3 terminal synergetic controller terminal synergetic controller depends upon the terminal attractor and synergetic control theory a control law is obtained by using synergetic control theory along with terminal attractor to achieve finite time convergence now by introducing a macro variable ζ by using terminal attractor as 49 ζ e 1 w 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 e 3 w 2 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 where w 1 and w 2 are designed positive constants while p 1 q 1 p 2 and q 2 are positive odd numbers such that 1 p 1 q 1 2 1 p 2 q 2 2 taking time derivative of eq 46 we have 50 ζ e 1 w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 e 3 w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 by putting the values of e 1 and e 3 from eqs 5 and 33 respectively into eq 47 we get 51 ζ x 1 x 1 r e f w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 x 2 x 2 r e f w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 now substituting the values of x 1 and x 2 from eq 1 into eq 48 we have 52 ζ x 2 x 1 r e f w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 f x 2 b u x 2 r e f w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 consider the dynamic evaluation equation for the macro variable ζ as follows 53 t 2 ζ ζ 0 where t 2 is the convergence rate of terminal attractor and is positive constant by substituting the value of ζ from eq 49 into eq 50 we get 54 t 2 x 2 x 1 r e f w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 f x 2 b u x 2 r e f w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 ζ 0 solving eq 51 for the control input u we have 55 u 1 b x 2 x 1 r e f w 1 p 1 q 1 e 1 0 t e 1 d t p 1 q 1 1 f x 2 x 2 r e f w 2 p 2 q 2 e 3 0 t e 3 d t p 2 q 2 1 ζ t 2 which is the required control law obtained by using terminal synergetic control technique to track the desired reference trajectory to ensure stability of system the lyapunov function can be considered as 56 v 3 1 2 ζ 2 taking time derivative of eq 53 we get 57 v 3 ζ ζ by substituting the value of ζ from eq 50 into eq 54 we have 58 v 3 ζ 2 t 2 from eq 55 the pursuing expression can be write as 59 v 3 2 t 2 v 3 finally the solution of eq 56 can be write as 60 v 3 v 3 0 e 2 t 2 t where v 3 0 is the value of lyapunov function v 3 at t 0 so eq 57 ensures the global exponential finite time stability of system 4 simulation results in order to check the validation of all the proposed controllers they have been simulated on matlab simulink the designed parameters have been chosen by hit and trial method and have positive values the various parameters of ship model under ballast condition have been mentioned in table 1 whereas the data about yupeng training ship of dalian maritime university is mentioned in table 2 4 1 course keeping control in case of course keeping control for ship the ship heading reference value has been set at ω r 50 tracked by x 1 state of system the response of ship heading is initiated from t 0 and its initial condition is to be taken as x 1 0 0 the parametric values have been mentioned in table 3 fig 3 represents the comparative analysis of proposed nonlinear controllers for checking tracking response of the ship heading by using the proposed controllers in case of ibs smc the settling time for tracking of ship heading is 117 24 s and the maximum rudder angle is 35 while the mean rudder angle is 0 27 whereas in case of sc the settling time for tracking of ship heading drops to 106 73 s and the maximum rudder angle drops to 19 8 while the mean rudder angle falls to 0 18 as mentioned in table 5 also no overshoot undershoot has been observed in the output signal tsc which provides fast and finite time convergence of system states tracking errors of ship tsc has settling time of 103 17 s for the tracking of ship heading the maximum rudder angle drops to 12 9 while the mean rudder angle falls to 0 11 also it can see that tsc depicts chattering free tracking of heading angle 50 of ship and no overshoot undershoot has been observed in the output signal furthermore to check out the control performance of proposed controller for course keeping control of ship we considered the three performance analysis specifications represented in the form of formulas mentioned in zhang et al 2018 and zhang and zhang 2019 as 61 mae 1 t t 0 t 0 t ω r y t d t mia 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t d t mtv 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t u t 1 d t where mean absolute error mae tells about the response performance of output of system mean integral absolute mia provides the analysis about energy consumption of control input and mean total variation mtv describes about the smoothness of algorithm according to table 5 it has been observed that mae value for ibs smc controller is 0 06639 for sc is 0 07147 and for tsc is 0 07814 this analysis shows that response performance of tsc controller is better than both sc and ibs smc furthermore mia value for ibs smc is 0 01326 for sc is 0 011002 and for tsc is 0 009071 this energy consumption analysis shows that tsc saves more energy as compared to the other proposed nonlinear controllers for course keeping control of ship likewise it has been observed that mtv value for ibs smc controller is 0 00223 for sc is 0 00085 and for tsc is 0 00077 showing that tsc performs better as compared to other proposed nonlinear controllers it means that rudder blade s revolution amplitude is smaller in case of tsc due to this smaller revolution amplitude the rudder s wear reduces and it saves more energy indirectly 4 2 course tracking control in case of course tracking control the simulations have been carried out with sine wave course tracking for which a sinusoidal function has been introduced as a reference angle for heading angle of ship ω r 30 sin 2 π 600 t the response of ship heading is initiated from t 0 and the initial condition for nonlinear controllers response is to be taken as ω o 10 the design parameters values for nonlinear controllers have been mentioned in table 4 fig 5 a presents the comparative analysis of the proposed nonlinear controllers for sine wave course tracking of ship which shows that the tracking of sine wave ship heading can be achieved by all the proposed nonlinear controllers but tsc provides better convergence as compared to all other proposed controllers fig 5 b shows that the maximum rudder angle for ibs smc controller is 19 2 and the mean rudder angle is 3 76 on the other hand the maximum rudder angle for sc drops to 12 6 and the mean rudder angle falls to 3 36 similarly the maximum rudder angle for tsc drops to 8 6 and its mean rudder angle drops to 3 15 this analysis shows that control effect of tsc is better furthermore in case of course tracking control the results of proposed controllers have been validated on the basis of performance analysis specifications mentioned in table 6 it has been observed that mae value for ibs smc controller is 0 03752 while the mia value is 0 05906 and mtv value is 0 00521 in case of sc mae is 0 03897 mia value is 0 01764 and mtv value is 0 00165 so the control effect of sc is better than ibs smc controller in case of tsc the mae mia and mtv values are 0 03922 0 01459 and 0 00124 respectively this comprehensive analysis shows that the according to energy saving effects due to sc and tsc are better as compared to ibs smc see fig 7 4 3 course keeping analysis in case of external disturbances during the navigation of ship at sea some of the external environmental parameters like winds ocean current and waves can cause a ship heading deviation liu 2017 so in this paper random generated sea waves and sea winds as a disturbance has been considered for this purpose the interference of sea winds is considered between average and impulse wind the white noise is used to represent the impulse wind zhang and zhang 2019 we introduced the equivalent value of rudder angle to support the simulation results with practical necessity and formula for calculation of θ w i n d zhang and zhang 2019 zhang and zhang 2014 presented as 62 θ w i n d k v r v 2 sin γ r where θ w i n d 3 v r is the relative speed of ship k is a leeway coefficient and γ r is a wind bearing here we actually introduced a second order oscillation system mentioned in zhang and zhang 2019 zhang et al 2017d and that is taken from white noise with finite frequency shown as 63 h s 0 4198 s s 2 0 3638 s 0 3675 so by reducing ship speed the value of k reduces and then the value of mean rudder angle increases in this way we can save controller output energy in an efficient manner 4 4 comparative analysis of nonlinear controllers this subsection describes the comparison b w various facets of proposed nonlinear controllers and recently suggested nonlinear controllers in the literature for this purpose tables 5 and 6 have been developed to point out the merits and demerits of these controllers pid controller has higher settling time of 445 58 s as compared to nonlinear controllers mentioned in table 5 the response performance of pid controller is less as it has lower value of mae consumes more energy and depicts lower smoothness as it has higher values of mia and mtv so the pid controller performance for course keeping and course tracking of ship is not better as compared to nonlinear controllers backstepping controller has higher settling time of 185 s and lower mae value its means that response performance of backstepping controller is lower as compared to tsc sc and ibs smc also it consumes more control input energy and its smoothness is low as it has higher mia and mtv values for both course keeping and course tracking control of ship as compared to proposed nonlinear controller nonlinear feedback controller has higher settling time of 157 s as compared to tsc sc and ibs smc the maximum and mean rudder angle values is higher as compared to sc and tsc mae value is lower as compared to proposed controller which means that it shows low response performance also it consumes more control input energy and depicts low smoothness as compared to sc and tsc as it has higher values of mia and mtv mentioned in table 6 ibs smc has higher settling time of 117 24 s as compared to tsc and sc but lower than nonlinear feedback backstepping and pid controller moreover it has higher value of mia as compared to backstepping and nonlinear feedback controller which simply means that its response performance is better than backstepping and nonlinear feedback controller for course keeping and course tracking control of ship it consumes more control input energy and exhibts low smoothness as compared to tsc and sc as it has higher values of mia and mtv respectively tsc and sc consume less energy and depict better smoothness for course keeping and course tracking control of ship as they have lower values of mia and mtv as compared to other nonlinear controllers their maximum and mean rudder angle values are also lower as compared to other controllers their settling times are of 103 17 s and 106 73 s respectively which is less as compared to ibs smc nonlinear feedback backstepping and pid controller according to this study tsc performs is better as compared to all other proposed controllers it provides fast and finite time convergence there is no overshoot undershoot observed and depicts the lesser settling time as compared to all other nonlinear controllers furthermore it consumes less control input energy and has better response performance as compared to all other nonlinear controllers ibs smc shows strong robustness against external disturbances like sea winds and sea waves which means that it has good ability to track the desired course in the presence of disturbances 5 conclusion maintaining the better performance of course keeping control for ships has been a major problem as the environmental factors like sea winds and sea waves can alter the sailing conditions that leads to variations in ship motion to overcome this problem three nonlinear controllers namely robust integral backstepping terminal synergetic and synergetic controllers have been proposed for course keeping control of ship simulation results in matlab simulink show that all the proposed nonlinear controllers work well but tsc provides fast and finite time convergence depicts better response performance and consumes less energy during course keeping control for ships when external disturbances like sea winds and sea waves have applied to ship dynamical model then controller ibs smc shows strong robustness against these disturbances and track the desired course efficiently furthermore the comparative analysis of proposed nonlinear controllers with conventional pid and recently proposed controllers shows that proposed nonlinear controllers have better results future work may comprises the implementation of these control techniques on real platform or to further reduce the energy consumption for course keeping by using different controllers credit authorship contribution statement muhammad muzammal islam software formal analysis validation writing original draftwriting original draft syed ahmad

21104,currently all floating wind turbines served on the sea are positioned by the mooring system a novel conceptual design of using the dynamic positioning system dps to position the floating wind turbine is proposed in this paper certain benefit aspects of the proposed conceptual design are elaborated a time domain simulation for the designed floating wind turbine is conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness it is obtained from the results that approximately 1 2 of the generated energy is utilized by the dps to keep the floating wind turbine positioned if current forces are not considered while the ratio becomes 4 5 if current load effects are taken into account thus the proposed conceptual design is demonstrated to be feasible in the view of conservation of energy the impact of several primary design variables such as the diameter of the wind turbine rotor the diameter of the thruster and the wind speed on the power ratio is specifically investigated to make the conceptual design more convincible several representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime are analyzed it can be found that the situations that the consumed power is larger than the generated power can be effectively tackled by the stored hydrogen converted in the far long period of operation of the wind turbine in rated wind speed considering the proposed concept has particular benefits that cannot be replaced by conventional moored floating wind turbines further research on the novel concept is warranted keywords floating wind turbine dynamic positioning system conceptual design power ratio primary design variables 1 introduction currently the demand for fossil fuels is continuously increasing due to the rapidly developing economies of the world the expense of exploration and exploitation of the traditional fuel becomes rather high alternatively increasing attention is being paid to the clean energy which is sustainable and ecologically friendly wind energy is probably the most promising sustainable energy resource because it can be relatively easily converted to electricity and can be sustainably supplied during the year currently the high demand for renewable energy gives wind energy an opportunity to become one of the most heavily used energy resources in the near future nowadays the wind energy is mostly exploited by the wind turbine related researches can be found in the literature spera 1994 jonkman et al 2009 zaaijer 2006 nihei et al 2013a b wang and sweetman 2013 bae and kim 2014 the number of installed wind turbines is increasing continually in recent years it is known that in most deep sea regions the floating wind turbine is more suitable than the fixed one since the setup cost of the latter can be dramatically high in deep waters the floating wind turbine should be positioned during operation otherwise it may float away due to the wind current and wave forces currently all floating wind turbines are positioned by mooring systems the mooring system has the benefit that no fuel is required after the initial setup however its drawback is equally obvious that the initial setup is time consuming and often requires the assistance of supporting vessels moreover once the setup is done it is rather complicated to move the whole system although the floating wind turbine is not intended to be mobile after a final setup when an earthquake typhoon or tsunami is about to arrive if the floating wind turbine cannot be timely withdrawn an incredible amount of damage can be invoked manabe et al 2008 to address these issues as a maturely utilized positioning technique dynamic positioning systems dpss can be used to position the wind turbine the floating wind turbine can be easily positioned by the dps regardless of the water depth and sea bottom conditions hu et al 2015 and in addition can be easily deployed transferred and withdrawn if necessary in general the dps can allow the ocean space to be more sufficiently utilized in this paper a conceptual design of using the dps to position the floating wind turbine is proposed similarly manabe et al 2008 has previously proposed a sailing type offshore wind farm which consists of a very large floating structure vlfs with sails and a lot of wind turbines on the structure the floating structure sails around eez exclusive economic zone of japan seeking appropriate breezing and avoiding meeting heavy storm distinct from their study this paper focuses on the effectiveness demonstration of the conceptual design by examining the power efficiency of the proposed system although the novel conceptual design is endowed with many advantages the dps consumes much energy when it generates the required forces to keep the wind turbine being positioned specifically speaking the wind turbine as the upper part of the floating structure generates power subject to wind force however the wind force also acts on the wind turbine and the floating structure and finally should be compensated by the thrust force generated by the thrusters installed under the floating structure note that the current and wave forces on the structure should also be compensated by the dps the proposed wind turbine system generates power but also consumes power to function in this case a power ratio of the consumed power by the dps to the generated power by the wind turbine is defined to investigate the power efficiency if the power ratio is smaller than 1 it indicates that the proposed system can be theoretically effective note that if the situation that the consumed power is larger than the generated power occurs the dps can use the energy of the stored hydrogen which is converted from the wind energy by the wind turbine operating in rated wind speed a time domain simulation for a dynamically positioned floating wind turbine is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of this conceptual design the impact of certain primary design variables such as the wind turbine rotor diameter azimuth thruster diameter and the wind speed on the power ratio is examined to make the conceptual design more convincible several representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime are analyzed with the consideration of current loads and thruster failure modes this paper is organized as follows the novel conceptual design of the floating wind turbine with dps is given in section 2 followed by a mathematical modelling of the dps and wind turbine in section 3 section 4 gives a numerical framework to simulate the floating wind turbine in the time domain in section 5 the power ratio of a typical dynamically positioned floating wind turbine system is investigated and the impact of certain primary design variables such as the diameter of the wind turbine rotor the diameter of the thruster and the wind speed on the power ratio is further investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of the conceptual design in addition several representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime are analyzed finally conclusion is summarized in section 6 2 conceptual design of a novel floating wind turbine combined with the dps the floating wind turbine is mainly comprised of the upper wind turbine and the lower floating structure traditionally the floating structure is often positioned by a mooring system as a mature engineering solution for offshore structure positioning in deep sea regions dps has been widely used in the marine sector oil and gas industries and military services in many tasks such as drilling cable and pipe laying docking and towing supplying searching and rescuing surveying and the conceptual design of mobile offshore bases mobs each of these operations benefits from the dps s ability to include precise position keeping freedom from restrictions of mooring spread systems the ability to move quickly from one site to another and track keeping capabilities motivated by multiple advantages of the dps compared to mooring systems we propose a conceptual design of using the dps to position the floating wind turbine as shown in fig 1 the proposed system consists of a semi submersible type floating structure a wind turbine and a dp system with thrusters 2 1 floating structure as shown in fig 2 there are usually three types of structures for a floating wind turbine in addition to two types of fixed structures the tension leg platform tlp and semi submersible type floating structure are suited for shallow water typically 50 120 m the spar type floating structure is suited for relatively deep water i e greater than 120 m in this paper a semi submersible type floating structure is adopted since it is convenient to deploy azimuth thrusters at the bottom of each column for using by the dps the dimission details of the semi submersible type floating structure is given in figs 3 4 parameters of the floating structure are tabulated in table 1 2 2 wind turbine a horizontal axis type wind turbine with three bladed rotors is selected to form the conceptual design as recommended by many researches bianchi et al 2006 ackermann and söder 2002 twidell 2009 etc the rotor is located at the top of a tower where the wind has more energy and is less turbulent compared to that of a vertical axis one there is usually a yaw mechanism that turns the rotor to face the wind to capture as much energy as possible however the yaw mechanism is not necessarily utilized here since the turning of the rotor can be fulfilled by changing the heading of the entire floating structure with the upper wind turbine it is assumed that the wind turbine is always directly faced to the wind during operation since the structure is allowed always against the wind forces by the dps 2 3 thrust system of the dps considering the general layout of the floating structure four azimuth thrusters are deployed at the bottom of each column of the semi submersible platform the thrust system is adopted based on our previous study xu et al 2016b where a model test has been performed to investigate the open water performance of the ka4 70 type azimuth thruster with the duct of the wageningen 19a form carlton 2012 the open water performance curves of the thruster are shown in fig 5 where k t denotes the thrust coefficient of the thruster kq the torque coefficient of the thruster η the open water efficiency of the thruster these coefficients are the principle design basis to select the dimension of the thruster 2 4 benefits and drawbacks of the proposed system the most promising benefit of the proposed system is that it is convenient to build a wind turbine farm dedicated to supplying power for the vlfs or island in the future it is well known that the vlfs has attracted increasing attention due to its prospective use for production and life and potential use for enlarging the human living space beyond the continent kashiwagi 2000 suzuki 2005 watanabe et al 2006 xiao et al 2016 because the novel floating wind turbine does not require abundant space to be deployed the scale of the proposed wind turbine farm should not be as large as that of a moored wind turbine farm as presented in fig 6 although the deployment of the wind turbines needs to take into account the aerodynamic interaction among them therefore the ocean space can be more sufficiently utilized on the other hand the dynamically positioned floating wind turbine can also sail around designated ocean regions with more fruitful wind resources to capture more energy and automatically move to safe regions when the typhoon comes therefore the proposed conceptual design can make the utilization of the ocean space more flexible another benefit of the proposed system is that the floating wind turbine can transfer the hydrogen type wind energy more efficiently by itself as recently it is planning that the generated power is stored in the floating body in that case the usage of a shuttle vessel to carry the hydrogen is not necessarily needed although the proposed system has many advantages compared to moored floating wind turbines there are some drawbacks such as construction operation and maintenance of the dps are very expensive while risks of failure of the dps must be kept in mind moreover the dps should consume quite much energy to keep the floating wind turbine positioned during operation 3 mathematical modelling 3 1 three dof kinematics the different coordinate systems used in this paper are illustrated in fig 7 and described below sørensen and strand 2000 the global coordinate system also named earth fixed coordinate system is denoted as the x g y g z g coordinate system wind wave and

height namely the response amplitude operators raos which are obtained via numerical methods modelling the potential flow around the hull such an approach is grounded in the assumption of the linear response of wave frequency motions and in the uncoupling between wave frequency x w y w ψ w and low frequency x l y l ψ l motions therefore the real position of the vessel x y ψ can be given by 10 x y ψ x l y l ψ l x w y w ψ w since the dp controller does not explicitly suppress wave frequency motions to avoid wear and tear on the thrusters fossen and strand 2000 wave frequency motions must be effectively filtered off before being transmitted to the controller 3 4 controller a nonlinear horizontal plane positioning feedback controller of pid type is formulated as xu et al 2016a 11 τ r e t k p e k d v r t ψ d k i z where e r 3 is the position and heading deviation vector v r 3 is the velocity deviation vector and z r 3 is the integrator states defined as 12 e e 1 e 2 e 3 t r t ψ d η ˆ η d 13 v v ˆ r t ψ d η d 14 z η ˆ η d 15 r e r ψ ψ d r t ψ d r ψ where η d r 3 is the vector defining the desired position and heading angles of the vessel in the earth fixed coordinate system v ˆ and η ˆ are estimated velocity and position of the vessel respectively k p k d k i r 3 3 are the non negative controller gain matrices found by an appropriate controller synthesis method or the trial and error method in some complex cases the determination of k p k d k i are usually empirically or through experiment as the wind and second order low frequency wave forces are usually around the frequency of 0 02 rad s and quickly decayed beyond 0 05 rad s the proportional coefficient should be chosen such that the resonance frequency of the system is within or a little larger than the frequency range note that too large resonance frequency of the system may cause wear and tear of the thrusters the resonance frequency of the system can be expressed as 16 ω p k p m in this paper we choose ω p m i n 0 03 rad s and ω p m a x 0 05 rad s such that k p m i n m ω p m i n 2 and k p m a x m ω p m a x 2 the value of k d is set to 50 70 of the critical damping as proposed in serraris 2009 17 k d 50 70 d c r i t 18 d c r i t 2 m k p 3 5 observer a nonlinear passive observer proposed by fossen and strand 1999 is adopted here as a low pass filter the dp passive observer model is

vessel 25 a w 0 i ω 2 2 λω where a w 0 i and e w 0 k w t where ω diag ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 λ diag ζ 1 ζ 2 ζ 3 and k w diag k w 1 k w 2 k w 3 the detailed information about matrices c w a w t and e w and vector b can be found in fossen and strand 1999 3 6 thrust allocation the thrust allocation problem can be formulated as an optimization problem where the objective is typically to minimize the use of the control power and the gap between the commanded and achieved force subject to thruster rate and other operational constraints the commanded force moments comes from the higher level control law johansen et al 2004 proposed a constrained nonlinear thrust allocation method with singularity avoidance the method uses sequential quadratic programming solving at each sample a convex quadratic programming problem the following optimization problem is defined 26 j q p δ α δ u s i 1 m d w i d u i u 0 i δ u i d 2 w i d u i 2 u 0 i u i 2 s t q s δ α t ωδ α d d α ρ ε det b α b t α α α 0 δ α

thrust force respectively δ α and δ u are the azimuth thruster s angle and the thrust difference between this sample and the last sample respectively eq 26 penalizes the error between the commanded and achieved force the maximum and minimum forces by the thrusters are specified through the constraints in eq 28 the azimuth angles α are required to be constrained to given sectors defined by the vectors with lower and upper bounds α m i n and α m a x respectively in eq 29 moreover the rate of change in azimuths is constrained in eq 30 and is minimized by the third term in the criterion singularity is avoided through the last term in the criterion where ε 0 is required to avoid numerical problems and ρ 0 is a weighting parameter 3 7 power generation by the wind turbine the turbine aerodynamics describes the forces developed on a wind turbine via airflow the actuator disc theory and the blade element theory are two major aerodynamic models for wind forces calculation burton et al 2001 mccoin 2006 the former one as adopted in the paper explains the energy extraction in a simple manner the turbine can be observed as an actuator disc that extracts energy from the wind consider the actuator disc immersed in an airflow which can be regarded as incompressible fig 8 the upstream wind speed v is necessarily larger than the downstream speed v because the actuator disc extracts part of the kinetic energy of the wind in this case the upstream cross sectional area a is smaller than the downstream cross sectional area a because by definition the mass flow rate must be the same everywhere within the tube 31 ρ a v ρ a d v d ρ a v the air that passes though the disc undergoes a speed drop v v hence the force f d developed by the actuator disc on the incident airflow is the total speed drop times the mass flow rate 32 f d v v ρ a d v d the speed at the disc is usually written as 33 v d 1 a v where a is defined as the axial flow interference factor through a complicated derivation described by bianchi et al 2006 the force of the thruster disc on the airflow is 34 f d 2 ρ a d v 2 a 1 a the power extracted from the wind by the thruster disc is given by 35 p d f d v d 2 ρ a d v 3 a 1 a 2 a conventional way of characterizing the ability of a wind turbine to capture wind energy is through the power coefficient which is defined as the ratio of extracted power to the exiting wind power 36 c p p d p v 2 ρ a d v 3 a 1 a 2 0 5 ρ a d v 3 4 a 1 a 2 the maximum achievable value of c p known as the betz limit is c p max 16 27 0 593 and occurs for a factor a 1 3 in this paper c p 4 a 1 a 2 0 59 is utilized to gain the coefficient of f d while the power coefficient c p adopts the value of 0 52 which coincides with the power capture performance of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine lefebvre and collu 2012 the force f d on the thruster disc at the top of the wind turbine needs to be compensated by the dps installed at the bottom of the column of the semi submersible structure in order to make the floating wind turbine dynamically positioned 3 8 power consumption by the thruster the consumed power is defined as the power to generate the required thrust force by the azimuth thrusters the thrust force that the thruster can achieve is determined by 37 t k t ρ n 2 d 4 where k t is the thrust coefficient n is the revolution speed and d is the diameter of the thruster the resulting torque q is represented by 38 q k q ρ n 2 d 5 where k q is the torque coefficient the consumed power can be represented by 39 p 2 π n q from the above formulas eqs 37 39 when the achieved thrust force is determined the consumed power can be obtained 4 framework of the numerical model a flow diagram of the time domain simulation for the dynamically positioned floating wind turbine is shown in fig 9 the environmental force acting on the structure is determined by the environmental condition as well as the position heading of the floating structure based on the wind condition and constant parameters of the wind turbine the generated power can be obtained eq 35 the environmental forces and the achieved thrust forces transfer to the 3 dof kinetics module to calculate the real time position of the structure eq 5 the real time position should be compared with the desired position to obtain the position error which is used by the controller to calculate the thrust forces required to push the structure back to the desired position the thrust allocation logic eqs 26 30 allocates the required thrust forces among all available azimuth thrusters the consumed power can be obtained based on the achieved thrust force of all thrusters and their open water performances finally the power ratio of the consumed power to the generated power can be gained the simulation can be performed by a self dependently developed program solving by the fourth order runge kutta method in matlab simulink environment note that the power ratio r p can be represented by 40 r p p c p g where p c and p g indicate the consumed power by the dps and the generated power by the wind turbine respectively the power ratio is a critical output of the simulation in this paper if the novel concept that using the dps to position the wind turbine structure is feasible then the power ratio must be essentially smaller than 1 5 results and discussion 5 1 power ratio of the typical design based on the proposed design in section 2 the values of several primary parameters are selected to form a typical dynamically positioned floating wind turbine as shown in table 2 jonswap wave spectrum is adopted in the generation of the irregular waves the wind and wave conditions are selected based on a 5 mw wind turbine proposed in the literature lefebvre and collu 2012 the second order low frequency wave forces are calculated based on the qtf matrix fig 10 shows the amplitude of the qtf matrix of the vessel with heading of 0 current loads are not considered here since the floating wind turbine can move toward the operational site with insignificant currents nevertheless current loads are taken into account in the simulation in subsection 5 3 where the representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its life time are analyzed the current forces of the floating wind turbine in current velocity of 1 0 m s calculated based on imca 2012 are given in table 3 the adopted gain matrixes in the dp time domain simulation are given in table 4 by using the time domain simulation framework proposed in the last section the consumed and generated power for the proposed system can be obtained based on the open water performance of the thruster as shown in fig 11 it can be found from fig 11 that the initial power is notably high because the dps requires much more energy when it is initialized generally the thruster must rotate certain azimuth angle before it really increases its revolution speed to produce the required thrust force in that case the other thrusters may consume more energy to supply the required force after the initial state the propulsion system can find its optimal way to achieve the required force in order to maintain energy efficiency this is more important in practice because the direction of the environmental condition may change suddenly and the thruster may not change its direction fast enough thereby causing the thruster to require much more power than that in usual conditions note that the perturbations of the consumed power indicates that the thrusters perform different thrusting behaviors during the operation to keep the floating wind turbine at the predefined position although the consumed power is much larger than the generated power at the initial stage the consumed power becomes less than the generated power after the initial stage generally the mean power ratio during the simulation is approximately 0 5 which is smaller than 1 it can be concluded that the novel floating wind turbine integrated with the dynamic positioning system can be feasible in the view of conservation of energy figs 12 15 present the motion responses wind forces wave drift forces and generated thrust forces of the typical floating wind turbine with the dps it can be seen from fig 12 that initial large x and y motions are observed and gradually decreased while the yaw motion keeps a small perturbations at the desired heading and thus the wind forces always dominate in the x direction fig 13 as shown in fig 14 the second order wave drift forces contribute most of the dynamics of the floating wind turbine due to its high perturbations the generated thrust forces of the dynamic positioning system are given in fig 15 where the large perturbations occur at the moment of 100s 800s 1700s and 3400s and right at the moment of large perturbations of consumed power in fig 11 the corresponding relations also exist for motion responses and the wind forces in figs 12 and 13 respectively 5 2 effects of the wind turbine parameters on the power ratio time domain simulations for the proposed conceptual design presented in section 2 are conducted to investigate effect of the primary design parameters on the power ratio these parameters include the diameter of the rotor of the wind turbine d rot the diameter of the thruster d thru and the wind speed v w three sets of these parameters are reasonably determined based on the typical conceptual design note that all the other parameters are kept constant except the one being investigated in the simulation the relation between the mean power ratio and diameters of wind turbine rotor is shown in fig 16 it is obvious that the larger the diameter of the wind turbine rotor is the larger the power ratio is although using the larger wind turbine rotor can generate more power eq 35 the wind force also becomes rather larger eq 34 the dps should use much more energy to compensate the wind forces to make the power ratio in an acceptable range a reasonable diameter of the wind turbine rotor should be selected the impact of the thruster diameter on the mean power ratio is also investigated where the results are shown in fig 17 it is obvious that the larger the thruster diameter is the smaller the power ratio is this finding is easily proven theoretically using the relation between the thruster force and power it suggests that the larger the thruster diameter is selected the less power is consumed however construction expense and installation difficulty should always be taken into account in practice the impact of the wind speed on the mean power ratio is also investigated as shown in fig 18 it can be found that the mean power ratio shows a decrease trend with the increase of the velocity it is because that the significant wave height and wave peak period are assumed the same in the simulations the wave forces become relatively smaller compared to the wind forces when the wind speed increases it can be seen from the wind turbine parameters sensitivity study that for all the investigated cases the power ratios are smaller than 0 9 i e the consumed power of the wind turbine system is much smaller than the generated wind power thus the proposed conceptual design is further demonstrated to be feasible in the view of conservation of energy 5 3 representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine since the dps is used to keep the position of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime all representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine should be analyzed to further demonstrate the feasibility of the conceptual design the situation that the wind turbine is idling no power production while the floating wind turbine is subjected to moderated or harsh wave conditions the situation that the wind turbine is operating in different wind speeds and irregular waves the situation that the wind turbine is parked while the floating wind turbine is subjected to extreme wind and waves the situation that one of the azimuth thrusters of the dps fails when the wind turbine operates in operational and survival conditions to investigate more realistic performance of the proposed design current loads are considered in these situations the floating structure sustains 355 kn current force under the current speed of 1 m s at the heading of 0 the investigated representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine are tabulated in table 5 note that in the survival condition since the wind speed exceeds the cut out wind speed of the turbine thus v w 0 cases 10 12 is assumed in the simulation if the thruster no 3 or no 4 fails the wind turbine can turn its heading by 120 or 120 which is the same case with thruster no 2 fails at the heading of 0 note that the nacelle system is still required if thruster failure modes are considered since the failure of thruster no 3 or no 4 can cause the thrust system cannot supply enough transversal force and moment when the floating wind turbine structure faces the wind at 0 or 180 heading by using of the framework proposed in section 4 the floating wind turbine in all the representative cases can be well positioned by the dps note that in several cases the consumed power by the dps is larger than the generated power by the wind turbine the situations can be tackled by the stored hydrogen converted by the captured wind energy when the generated power is larger than the consumed power the consumed and generated power of the dynamically positioned floating wind turbine in cases 1 7 and 10 is shown in fig 19 it can be seen that in the operational condition taking into account the current loads the consumed power is still smaller than the generated power except at the initial stage however the mean power ratio is approximated 0 8 that is to say 80 of the generated power is used by the dps to position the floating wind turbine when the wind speed is above the rated in cases 5 and 6 it can be seen that the power ratio is smaller than 1 and decreases with the increase of the wind speed as have been revealed in fig 18 in cases 1 7 and 10 the wind forces are set as 0 since the wind turbine is idling to protect itself from damage it can be seen that the mean consumed power is respectively about 0 8 0 7 and 1 3 mw thus is with the same magnitude of the actual rated power output 1 mw of the wind turbine that is to say the floating wind turbine can be well sustained by the stored converted hydrogen in an enough long period waiting for the appropriate wind speed for operation the period that the turbine can sustain in the condition depends on the amount of the converted hydrogen stored in the platform if it is not enough the floating wind turbine requires to transfer to operational sites with more fruitful wind resources when the wind speed is below the rated in cases 2 and 3 the consumed power is larger than the generated power however the mean difference is less than 1 mw which also implies that the floating wind turbine can be well sustained by itself the consumed and generated power of the dynamically positioned floating wind turbine in cases 8 9 and 11 12 is given in fig 20 it can be found that curves of case 9 have a good coincidence of that of case 8 and the same phenomenon occurs for curves of cases 11 and 12 comparing the consumed power of case 8 or 9 with that of case 6 it can be found that with one thruster failure the power ratio slightly increases to a value of approximately 0 75 which is in practice acceptable with an actual 3 mw wind power output in cases 11 12 the consumed power is about 1 5 mw and is also with the same magnitude of the actual rated power output 1 mw of the wind turbine thus the floating wind turbine can be well sustained by the stored hydrogen converted in the far long period of operation of the wind turbine in rated wind speed 6 conclusion a novel conceptual design of using a dynamic positioning system to position the floating wind turbine is proposed in this paper the power ratio of the consumed power to the generated power of the conceptual design is defined and investigated by performing a time domain simulation for a typical dynamically positioned floating wind turbine it is obtained from the results that 1 2 of the generated energy is approximately utilized by the dps to position the floating wind turbine if current forces are not considered taking into account the current load effects approximately 4 5 of the generated power is used by the dps therefore the conceptual floating wind turbine is recommended to be deployed in the operational site with smaller current to gain a relatively larger actual wind power output the impact of certain primary design variables such as the wind turbine rotor diameter the azimuth thruster diameter and the wind speed on the power ratio is examined it can be found that 1 the larger the thruster diameter is the less the consumed power is and the smaller the power ratio is 2 the larger the wind turbine rotor diameter is the larger the power ratio is 3 the mean power ratio decreases with the increase of the wind velocity since the large wave drift forces that should be compensated by the dps becomes relatively small to make the conceptual design more convincible several representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime are analyzed with the consideration of current loads and thruster failure modes it can be found from the results that the situations that the consumed power is larger than the generated power can be effectively tackled by the stored hydrogen converted in the far long period of operation of the wind turbine in the rated wind speed note that an experimental evaluation of the conceptual design needs to be fulfilled in the future work although the proposed concept has particular benefits that cannot be replaced by conventional moored floating wind turbine more works such as comparison of the construction and maintenance cost of the dps with that of mooring lines and reliability analysis of the dps combined with floating wind turbine also needs to be done before actually conducting

21104,currently all floating wind turbines served on the sea are positioned by the mooring system a novel conceptual design of using the dynamic positioning system dps to position the floating wind turbine is proposed in this paper certain benefit aspects of the proposed conceptual design are elaborated a time domain simulation for the designed floating wind turbine is conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness it is obtained from the results that approximately 1 2 of the generated energy is utilized by the dps to keep the floating wind turbine positioned if current forces are not considered while the ratio becomes 4 5 if current load effects are taken into account thus the proposed conceptual design is demonstrated to be feasible in the view of conservation of energy the impact of several primary design variables such as the diameter of the wind turbine rotor the diameter of the thruster and the wind speed on the power ratio is specifically investigated to make the conceptual design more convincible several representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime are analyzed it can be found that the situations that the consumed power is larger than the generated power can be effectively tackled by the stored hydrogen converted in the far long period of operation of the wind turbine in rated wind speed considering the proposed concept has particular benefits that cannot be replaced by conventional moored floating wind turbines further research on the novel concept is warranted keywords floating wind turbine dynamic positioning system conceptual design power ratio primary design variables 1 introduction currently the demand for fossil fuels is continuously increasing due to the rapidly developing economies of the world the expense of exploration and exploitation of the traditional fuel becomes rather high alternatively increasing attention is being paid to the clean energy which is sustainable and ecologically friendly wind energy is probably the most promising sustainable energy resource because it can be relatively easily converted to electricity and can be sustainably supplied during the year currently the high demand for renewable energy gives wind energy an opportunity to become one of the most heavily used energy resources in the near future nowadays the wind energy is mostly exploited by the wind turbine related researches can be found in the literature spera 1994 jonkman et al 2009 zaaijer 2006 nihei et al 2013a b wang and sweetman 2013 bae and kim 2014 the number of installed wind turbines is increasing continually in recent years it is known that in most deep sea regions the floating wind turbine is more suitable than the fixed one since the setup cost of the latter can be dramatically high in deep waters the floating wind turbine should be positioned during operation otherwise it may float away due to the wind current and wave forces currently all floating wind turbines are positioned by mooring systems the mooring system has the benefit that no fuel is required after the initial setup however its drawback is equally obvious that the initial setup is time consuming and often requires the assistance of supporting vessels moreover once the setup is done it is rather complicated to move the whole system although the floating wind turbine is not intended to be mobile after a final setup when an earthquake typhoon or tsunami is about to arrive if the floating wind turbine cannot be timely withdrawn an incredible amount of damage can be invoked manabe et al 2008 to address these issues as a maturely utilized positioning technique dynamic positioning systems dpss can be used to position the wind turbine the floating wind turbine can be easily positioned by the dps regardless of the water depth and sea bottom conditions hu et al 2015 and in addition can be easily deployed transferred and withdrawn if necessary in general the dps can allow the ocean space to be more sufficiently utilized in this paper a conceptual design of using the dps to position the floating wind turbine is proposed similarly manabe et al 2008 has previously proposed a sailing type offshore wind farm which consists of a very large floating structure vlfs with sails and a lot of wind turbines on the structure the floating structure sails around eez exclusive economic zone of japan seeking appropriate breezing and avoiding meeting heavy storm distinct from their study this paper focuses on the effectiveness demonstration of the conceptual design by examining the power efficiency of the proposed system although the novel conceptual design is endowed with many advantages the dps consumes much energy when it generates the required forces to keep the wind turbine being positioned specifically speaking the wind turbine as the upper part of the floating structure generates power subject to wind force however the wind force also acts on the wind turbine and the floating structure and finally should be compensated by the thrust force generated by the thrusters installed under the floating structure note that the current and wave forces on the structure should also be compensated by the dps the proposed wind turbine system generates power but also consumes power to function in this case a power ratio of the consumed power by the dps to the generated power by the wind turbine is defined to investigate the power efficiency if the power ratio is smaller than 1 it indicates that the proposed system can be theoretically effective note that if the situation that the consumed power is larger than the generated power occurs the dps can use the energy of the stored hydrogen which is converted from the wind energy by the wind turbine operating in rated wind speed a time domain simulation for a dynamically positioned floating wind turbine is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of this conceptual design the impact of certain primary design variables such as the wind turbine rotor diameter azimuth thruster diameter and the wind speed on the power ratio is examined to make the conceptual design more convincible several representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime are analyzed with the consideration of current loads and thruster failure modes this paper is organized as follows the novel conceptual design of the floating wind turbine with dps is given in section 2 followed by a mathematical modelling of the dps and wind turbine in section 3 section 4 gives a numerical framework to simulate the floating wind turbine in the time domain in section 5 the power ratio of a typical dynamically positioned floating wind turbine system is investigated and the impact of certain primary design variables such as the diameter of the wind turbine rotor the diameter of the thruster and the wind speed on the power ratio is further investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of the conceptual design in addition several representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime are analyzed finally conclusion is summarized in section 6 2 conceptual design of a novel floating wind turbine combined with the dps the floating wind turbine is mainly comprised of the upper wind turbine and the lower floating structure traditionally the floating structure is often positioned by a mooring system as a mature engineering solution for offshore structure positioning in deep sea regions dps has been widely used in the marine sector oil and gas industries and military services in many tasks such as drilling cable and pipe laying docking and towing supplying searching and rescuing surveying and the conceptual design of mobile offshore bases mobs each of these operations benefits from the dps s ability to include precise position keeping freedom from restrictions of mooring spread systems the ability to move quickly from one site to another and track keeping capabilities motivated by multiple advantages of the dps compared to mooring systems we propose a conceptual design of using the dps to position the floating wind turbine as shown in fig 1 the proposed system consists of a semi submersible type floating structure a wind turbine and a dp system with thrusters 2 1 floating structure as shown in fig 2 there are usually three types of structures for a floating wind turbine in addition to two types of fixed structures the tension leg platform tlp and semi submersible type floating structure are suited for shallow water typically 50 120 m the spar type floating structure is suited for relatively deep water i e greater than 120 m in this paper a semi submersible type floating structure is adopted since it is convenient to deploy azimuth thrusters at the bottom of each column for using by the dps the dimission details of the semi submersible type floating structure is given in figs 3 4 parameters of the floating structure are tabulated in table 1 2 2 wind turbine a horizontal axis type wind turbine with three bladed rotors is selected to form the conceptual design as recommended by many researches bianchi et al 2006 ackermann and söder 2002 twidell 2009 etc the rotor is located at the top of a tower where the wind has more energy and is less turbulent compared to that of a vertical axis one there is usually a yaw mechanism that turns the rotor to face the wind to capture as much energy as possible however the yaw mechanism is not necessarily utilized here since the turning of the rotor can be fulfilled by changing the heading of the entire floating structure with the upper wind turbine it is assumed that the wind turbine is always directly faced to the wind during operation since the structure is allowed always against the wind forces by the dps 2 3 thrust system of the dps considering the general layout of the floating structure four azimuth thrusters are deployed at the bottom of each column of the semi submersible platform the thrust system is adopted based on our previous study xu et al 2016b where a model test has been performed to investigate the open water performance of the ka4 70 type azimuth thruster with the duct of the wageningen 19a form carlton 2012 the open water performance curves of the thruster are shown in fig 5 where k t denotes the thrust coefficient of the thruster kq the torque coefficient of the thruster η the open water efficiency of the thruster these coefficients are the principle design basis to select the dimension of the thruster 2 4 benefits and drawbacks of the proposed system the most promising benefit of the proposed system is that it is convenient to build a wind turbine farm dedicated to supplying power for the vlfs or island in the future it is well known that the vlfs has attracted increasing attention due to its prospective use for production and life and potential use for enlarging the human living space beyond the continent kashiwagi 2000 suzuki 2005 watanabe et al 2006 xiao et al 2016 because the novel floating wind turbine does not require abundant space to be deployed the scale of the proposed wind turbine farm should not be as large as that of a moored wind turbine farm as presented in fig 6 although the deployment of the wind turbines needs to take into account the aerodynamic interaction among them therefore the ocean space can be more sufficiently utilized on the other hand the dynamically positioned floating wind turbine can also sail around designated ocean regions with more fruitful wind resources to capture more energy and automatically move to safe regions when the typhoon comes therefore the proposed conceptual design can make the utilization of the ocean space more flexible another benefit of the proposed system is that the floating wind turbine can transfer the hydrogen type wind energy more efficiently by itself as recently it is planning that the generated power is stored in the floating body in that case the usage of a shuttle vessel to carry the hydrogen is not necessarily needed although the proposed system has many advantages compared to moored floating wind turbines there are some drawbacks such as construction operation and maintenance of the dps are very expensive while risks of failure of the dps must be kept in mind moreover the dps should consume quite much energy to keep the floating wind turbine positioned during operation 3 mathematical modelling 3 1 three dof kinematics the different coordinate systems used in this paper are illustrated in fig 7 and described below sørensen and strand 2000 the global coordinate system also named earth fixed coordinate system is denoted as the x g y g z g coordinate system wind wave and current are defined in the global coordinate system the origin is fixed at the sea surface near the desired position of the vessel v w β w denote the wind and wave velocities and directions

faltinsen 1993 for detailed expression c r b r 3 3 is the skew symmetric coriolis and centripetal matrix due to the rotation of the body coordinate system about the inertial earth coordinate system for a detailed expression refer to fossen 2011 wichers 1988 divided the effect of current into two parts the potential part and the viscous part the potential part is formulated as c a v r v r where v

according to 6 d v r d l v d n l v r γ r for most vessels it is difficult to calculate the damping coefficients a combination of empirical formulas model tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd are normally used to obtain the damping coefficients the detailed formulation of d v r can be found in sørensen and ronxss 2002 where γ r denotes the relative drag angle g η is the restoring vector which is a zero vector here when considering the horizontal plane model the right hand expression of eq 5 represents generalized external force on the vessel forces in surge and sway and the moment in yaw are referred to as the generalized force τ env r 3 represents the slowly varying environmental loads with the exception of current loads acting on the vessel i e the wind loads and the second order mean and low frequency wave loads the wind loads are estimated based on the offshore oil standard by the international marine contractors association imca imca 2012 the second order mean and low frequency wave loads can be determined by means of quadratic transfer functions faltinsen 1993 7 τ w a v e 2 2 i 1 n j i n ζ i ζ j p i j cos ω i ω j t ε i ε j 2 i 1 n j i n ζ i ζ j q i j sin ω i ω j t ε i ε j where ω i is the wave frequency ζ i is the wave amplitude ε i is a random phase angle and n is the number of regular wave components in the irregular wave the quadratic transfer functions qtfs p i j and q i j are dependent on both the first and second order velocity potentials which require a nonlinear panel methodology pinkster 1980 in this paper the second order wave force is calculated from the full qtf matrix obtained using the commercial software sesam dnv 1998 τ represents the generalized force generated by the propulsion system the generalized force generated by the propulsion

height namely the response amplitude operators raos which are obtained via numerical methods modelling the potential flow around the hull such an approach is grounded in the assumption of the linear response of wave frequency motions and in the uncoupling between wave frequency x w y w ψ w and low frequency x l y l ψ l motions therefore the real position of the vessel x y ψ can be given by 10 x y ψ x l y l ψ l x w y w ψ w since the dp controller does not explicitly suppress wave frequency motions to avoid wear and tear on the thrusters fossen and strand 2000 wave frequency motions must be effectively filtered off before being transmitted to the controller 3 4 controller a nonlinear horizontal plane positioning feedback controller of pid type is formulated as xu et al 2016a 11 τ r e t k p e k d v r t ψ d k i z where e r 3 is the position and heading deviation vector v r 3 is the velocity deviation vector and z r 3 is the integrator states defined as 12 e e 1 e 2 e 3 t r t ψ d η ˆ η d 13 v v ˆ r t ψ d η d 14 z η ˆ η d 15 r e r ψ ψ d r t ψ d r ψ where η d r 3 is the vector defining the desired position and heading angles of the vessel in the earth fixed coordinate system v ˆ and η ˆ are estimated velocity and position of the vessel respectively k p k d k i r 3 3 are the non negative controller gain matrices found by an appropriate controller synthesis method or the trial and error method in some complex cases the determination of k p k d k i are usually empirically or through experiment as the wind and second order low frequency wave forces are usually around the frequency of 0 02 rad s and quickly decayed beyond 0 05 rad s the proportional coefficient should be chosen such that the resonance frequency of the system is within or a little larger than the frequency range note that too large resonance frequency of the system may cause wear and tear of the thrusters the resonance frequency of the system can be expressed as 16 ω p k p m in this paper we choose ω p m i n 0 03 rad s and ω p m a x 0 05 rad s such that k p m i n m ω p m i n 2 and k p m a x m ω p m a x 2 the value of k d is set to 50 70 of the critical damping as proposed in serraris 2009

b can be found in fossen and strand 1999 3 6 thrust allocation the thrust allocation problem can be formulated as an optimization problem where the objective is typically to minimize the use of the control power and the gap between the commanded and achieved force subject to thruster rate and other operational constraints the commanded force moments comes from the higher level control law johansen et al 2004 proposed a constrained nonlinear thrust allocation method with singularity avoidance the method uses sequential quadratic programming solving at each sample a convex quadratic programming problem the following optimization problem is defined 26 j q p δ α δ u s i 1 m d w i d u i u 0 i δ u i d 2 w i d u i 2 u 0 i u i 2 s t q s δ α t ωδ α d d α ρ ε det b α b t α α α 0 δ α

thrust force respectively δ α and δ u are the azimuth thruster s angle and the thrust difference between this sample and the last sample respectively eq 26 penalizes the error between the commanded and achieved force the maximum and minimum forces by the thrusters are specified through the constraints in eq 28 the azimuth angles α are required to be constrained to given sectors defined by the vectors with lower and upper bounds α m i n and α m a x respectively in eq 29 moreover the rate of change in azimuths is constrained in eq 30 and is minimized by the third term in the criterion singularity is avoided through the last term in the criterion where ε 0 is required to avoid numerical problems and ρ 0 is a weighting parameter 3 7 power generation by the wind turbine the turbine aerodynamics describes the forces developed on a wind turbine via airflow the actuator disc theory and the blade element theory are two major aerodynamic models for wind forces calculation burton et al 2001 mccoin 2006 the former one as adopted in the paper explains the energy extraction in a simple manner the turbine can be observed as an actuator disc that extracts energy from the wind consider the actuator disc immersed in an airflow which can be regarded as incompressible fig 8 the upstream wind speed v is necessarily larger than the downstream speed v because the actuator disc extracts part of the kinetic energy of the wind in this case the upstream cross sectional area a is smaller than the downstream cross sectional area a because by definition the mass flow rate must be the same everywhere within the tube 31 ρ a v ρ a d v d ρ a v the air that passes though the disc undergoes a speed drop v v hence the force f d developed by the actuator disc on the incident airflow is the total speed drop times the mass flow rate 32 f d v v ρ a d v d the speed at the disc is usually written as 33 v d 1 a v where a is defined as the axial flow interference factor through a complicated derivation described by bianchi et al 2006 the force of the thruster disc on the airflow is 34 f d 2 ρ a d v 2 a 1 a the power extracted from the wind by the thruster disc is given by 35 p d f d v d 2 ρ a d v 3 a 1 a 2 a conventional way of characterizing the ability of a wind turbine to capture wind energy is through the power coefficient which is defined as the ratio of extracted power to the exiting wind power 36 c p p d p v 2 ρ a d v 3 a 1 a 2 0 5 ρ a d v 3 4 a 1 a 2 the maximum achievable value of c p known as the betz limit is c p max 16 27 0 593 and occurs for a factor a 1 3 in this paper c p 4 a 1 a 2 0 59 is utilized to gain the coefficient of f d while the power coefficient c p adopts the value of 0 52 which coincides with the power capture performance of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine lefebvre and collu 2012 the force f d on the thruster disc at the top of the wind turbine needs to be compensated by the dps installed at the bottom of the column of the semi submersible structure in order to make the floating wind turbine dynamically positioned 3 8 power consumption by the thruster the consumed power is defined as the power to generate the required thrust force by the azimuth thrusters the thrust force that the thruster can achieve is determined by 37 t k t ρ n 2 d 4 where k t is the thrust coefficient n is the revolution speed and d is the diameter of the thruster the resulting torque q is represented by 38 q k q ρ n 2 d 5 where k q is the torque coefficient the consumed power can be represented by 39 p 2 π n q from the above formulas eqs 37 39 when the achieved thrust force is determined the consumed power can be obtained 4 framework of the numerical model a flow diagram of the time domain simulation for the dynamically positioned floating wind turbine is shown in fig 9 the environmental force acting on the structure is determined by the environmental condition as well as the position heading of the floating structure based on the wind condition and constant parameters of the wind turbine the generated power can be obtained eq 35 the environmental forces and the achieved thrust forces transfer to the 3 dof kinetics module to calculate the real time position of the structure eq 5 the real time position should be compared with the desired position to obtain the position error which is used by the controller to calculate the thrust forces required to push the structure back to the desired position the thrust allocation logic eqs 26 30 allocates the required thrust forces among all available azimuth thrusters the consumed power can be obtained based on the achieved thrust force of all thrusters and their open water performances finally the power ratio of the consumed power to the generated power can be gained the simulation can be performed by a self dependently developed program solving by the fourth order runge kutta method in matlab simulink environment note that the power ratio r p can be represented by 40 r p p c p g where p c and p g indicate the consumed power by the dps and the generated power by the wind turbine respectively the power ratio is a critical output of the simulation in this paper if the novel concept that using the dps to position the wind turbine structure is feasible then the power ratio must be essentially smaller than 1 5 results and discussion 5 1 power ratio of the typical design based on the proposed design in section 2 the values of several primary parameters are selected to form a typical dynamically positioned floating wind turbine as shown in table 2 jonswap wave spectrum is adopted in the generation of the irregular waves the wind and wave conditions are selected based on a 5 mw wind turbine proposed in the literature lefebvre and collu 2012 the second order low frequency wave forces are calculated based on the qtf matrix fig 10 shows the amplitude of the qtf matrix of the vessel with heading of 0 current loads are not considered here since the floating wind turbine can move toward the operational site with insignificant currents nevertheless current loads are taken into account in the simulation in subsection 5 3 where the representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its life time are analyzed the current forces of the floating wind turbine in current velocity of 1 0 m s calculated based on imca 2012 are given in table 3 the adopted gain matrixes in the dp time domain simulation are given in table 4 by using the time domain simulation framework proposed in the last section the consumed and generated power for the proposed system can be obtained based on the open water performance of the thruster as shown in fig 11 it can be found from fig 11 that the initial power is notably high because the dps requires much more energy when it is initialized generally the thruster must rotate certain azimuth angle before it really increases its revolution speed to produce the required thrust force in that case the other thrusters may consume more energy to supply the required force after the initial state the propulsion system can find its optimal way to achieve the required force in order to maintain energy efficiency this is more important in practice because the direction of the environmental condition may change suddenly and the thruster may not change its direction fast enough thereby causing the thruster to require much more power than that in usual conditions note that the perturbations of the consumed power indicates that the thrusters perform different thrusting behaviors during the operation to keep the floating wind turbine at the predefined position although the consumed power is much larger than the generated power at the initial stage the consumed power becomes less than the generated power after the initial stage generally the mean power ratio during the simulation is approximately 0 5 which is smaller than 1 it can be concluded that the novel floating wind turbine integrated with the dynamic positioning system can be feasible in the view of conservation of energy figs 12 15 present the motion responses wind forces wave drift forces and generated thrust forces of the typical floating wind turbine with the dps it can be seen from fig 12 that initial large x and y motions are observed and gradually decreased while the yaw motion keeps a small perturbations at the desired heading and thus the wind forces always dominate in the x direction fig 13 as shown in fig 14 the second order wave drift forces contribute most of the dynamics of the floating wind turbine due to its high perturbations the generated thrust forces of the dynamic positioning system are given in fig 15 where the large perturbations occur at the moment of 100s 800s 1700s and 3400s and right at the moment of large perturbations of consumed power in fig 11 the corresponding relations also exist for motion responses and the wind forces in figs 12 and 13 respectively 5 2 effects of the wind turbine parameters on the power ratio time domain simulations for the proposed conceptual design presented in section 2 are conducted to investigate effect of the primary design parameters on the power ratio these parameters include the diameter of the rotor of the wind turbine d rot the diameter of the thruster d thru and the wind speed v w three sets of these parameters are reasonably determined based on the typical conceptual design note that all the other parameters are kept constant except the one being investigated in the simulation the relation between the mean power ratio and diameters of wind turbine rotor is shown in fig 16 it is obvious that the larger the diameter of the wind turbine rotor is the larger the power ratio is although using the larger wind turbine rotor can generate more power eq 35 the wind force also becomes rather larger eq 34 the dps should use much more energy to compensate the wind forces to make the power ratio in an acceptable range a reasonable diameter of the wind turbine rotor should be selected the impact of the thruster diameter on the mean power ratio is also investigated where the results are shown in fig 17 it is obvious that the larger the thruster diameter is the smaller the power ratio is this finding is easily proven theoretically using the relation between the thruster force and power it suggests that the larger the thruster diameter is selected the less power is consumed however construction expense and installation difficulty should always be taken into account in practice the impact of the wind speed on the mean power ratio is also investigated as shown in fig 18 it can be found that the mean power ratio shows a decrease trend with the increase of the velocity it is because that the significant wave height and wave peak period are assumed the same in the simulations the wave forces become relatively smaller compared to the wind forces when the wind speed increases it can be seen from the wind turbine parameters sensitivity study that for all the investigated cases the power ratios are smaller than 0 9 i e the consumed power of the wind turbine system is much smaller than the generated wind power thus the proposed conceptual design is further demonstrated to be feasible in the view of conservation of energy 5 3 representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine since the dps is used to keep the position of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime all representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine should be analyzed to further demonstrate the feasibility of the conceptual design the situation that the wind turbine is idling no power production while the floating wind turbine is subjected to moderated or harsh wave conditions the situation that the wind turbine is operating in different wind speeds and irregular waves the situation that the wind turbine is parked while the floating wind turbine is subjected to extreme wind and waves the situation that one of the azimuth thrusters of the dps fails when the wind turbine operates in operational and survival conditions to investigate more realistic performance of the proposed design current loads are considered in these situations the floating structure sustains 355 kn current force under the current speed of 1 m s at the heading of 0 the investigated representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine are tabulated in table 5 note that in the survival condition since the wind speed exceeds the cut out wind speed of the turbine thus v w 0 cases 10 12 is assumed in the simulation if the thruster no 3 or no 4 fails the wind turbine can turn its heading by 120 or 120 which is the same case with thruster no 2 fails at the heading of 0 note that the nacelle system is still required if thruster failure modes are considered since the failure of thruster no 3 or no 4 can cause the thrust system cannot supply enough transversal force and moment when the floating wind turbine structure faces the wind at 0 or 180 heading by using of the framework proposed in section 4 the floating wind turbine in all the representative cases can be well positioned by the dps note that in several cases the consumed power by the dps is larger than the generated power by the wind turbine the situations can be tackled by the stored hydrogen converted by the captured wind energy when the generated power is larger than the consumed power the consumed and generated power of the dynamically positioned floating wind turbine in cases 1 7 and 10 is shown in fig 19 it can be seen that in the operational condition taking into account the current loads the consumed power is still smaller than the generated power except at the initial stage however the mean power ratio is approximated 0 8 that is to say 80 of the generated power is used by the dps to position the floating wind turbine when the wind speed is above the rated in cases 5 and 6 it can be seen that the power ratio is smaller than 1 and decreases with the increase of the wind speed as have been revealed in fig 18 in cases 1 7 and 10 the wind forces are set as 0 since the wind turbine is idling to protect itself from damage it can be seen that the mean consumed power is respectively about 0 8 0 7 and 1 3 mw thus is with the same magnitude of the actual rated power output 1 mw of the wind turbine that is to say the floating wind turbine can be well sustained by the stored converted hydrogen in an enough long period waiting for the appropriate wind speed for operation the period that the turbine can sustain in the condition depends on the amount of the converted hydrogen stored in the platform if it is not enough the floating wind turbine requires to transfer to operational sites with more fruitful wind resources when the wind speed is below the rated in cases 2 and 3 the consumed power is larger than the generated power however the mean difference is less than 1 mw which also implies that the floating wind turbine can be well sustained by itself the consumed and generated power of the dynamically positioned floating wind turbine in cases 8 9 and 11 12 is given in fig 20 it can be found that curves of case 9 have a good coincidence of that of case 8 and the same phenomenon occurs for curves of cases 11 and 12 comparing the consumed power of case 8 or 9 with that of case 6 it can be found that with one thruster failure the power ratio slightly increases to a value of approximately 0 75 which is in practice acceptable with an actual 3 mw wind power output in cases 11 12 the consumed power is about 1 5 mw and is also with the same magnitude of the actual rated power output 1 mw of the wind turbine thus the floating wind turbine can be well sustained by the stored hydrogen converted in the far long period of operation of the wind turbine in rated wind speed 6 conclusion a novel conceptual design of using a dynamic positioning system to position the floating wind turbine is proposed in this paper the power ratio of the consumed power to the generated power of the conceptual design is defined and investigated by performing a time domain simulation for a typical dynamically positioned floating wind turbine it is obtained from the results that 1 2 of the generated energy is approximately utilized by the dps to position the floating wind turbine if current forces are not considered taking into account the current load effects approximately 4 5 of the generated power is used by the dps therefore the conceptual floating wind turbine is recommended to be deployed in the operational site with smaller current to gain a relatively larger actual wind power output the impact of certain primary design variables such as the wind turbine rotor diameter the azimuth thruster diameter and the wind speed on the power ratio is examined it can be found that 1 the larger the thruster diameter is the less the consumed power is and the smaller the power ratio is 2 the larger the wind turbine rotor diameter is the larger the power ratio is 3 the mean power ratio decreases with the increase of the wind velocity since the large wave drift forces that should be compensated by the dps becomes relatively small to make the conceptual design more convincible several representative operational situations of the floating wind turbine in its lifetime are analyzed with the consideration of current loads and thruster failure modes it can be found from the results that the situations that the consumed power is larger than the generated power can be effectively tackled by the stored hydrogen converted in the far long period of operation of the wind turbine in the rated wind speed note that an experimental evaluation of the conceptual design needs to be fulfilled in the future work although the proposed concept has particular benefits that cannot be replaced by conventional moored floating wind turbine more works such as comparison of the construction and maintenance cost of the dps with that of mooring lines and reliability analysis of the dps combined with floating wind turbine also needs to be done before actually conducting
