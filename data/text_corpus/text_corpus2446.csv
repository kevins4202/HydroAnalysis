studies of li et al 2015 can be mentioned as recently published research studies which address the successful application of bayesian method in water resources and environmental research in the field of groundwater maiti et al 2013 employed the bayesian neural networks to assess groundwater quality they have shown that the bayesian neural networks can be successfully applied to monitoring and

groundwater flow equations and artificial neural network based on the learning on the other hand the main objective of this study is to develop a statistical forecast model within the bayesian networks as well as the mathematical and ann models for forecasting groundwater level 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the birjand aquifer with an area of 3455 square kilometers is located in eastern part of iran the location of the aquifer is between 59 45 and 58 43 east longitudes and 33 08 and 32 34 north latitudes the highest elevation in the area is 2787 m and the lowest point is 1240 m the average annual precipitation equals 156 4 mm the 30 year average the study area is considered as an arid region the mean annual temperature is 16 4 celsius shahroud river is the main drainage river in the plain fig 1 illustrates the study area and the position of wells schematically for modeling a groundwater system accurately knowing the effective parameters on water budget is of great importance therefore basic studies of hydrology and hydrogeology in the area is necessary preliminary studies revealed that about 7 percent of precipitation one of the key elements affecting water table in the aquifer infiltrated to the groundwater resources moreover about 12 percent of the surface runoff changes into groundwater in the aquifer water flows from east to west the water table hydrograph of the birjand aquifer indicates a rapid decrease in water table for recent years in the aquifer average water table equals to 48 m and it changes between 100 and 13 m from north to south of the study area the average storage coefficient is about 0 05 in the aquifer there are about 300 wells which yield more than 85 million cubic meter per year regarding the aquifer input and output the aquifer has 10 million cubic meters of minus values in groundwater budget fig 2 illustrates the status of the birjand aquifer and the rate of decline and deficit of the reservoir during a period of 20 years 1996 2015 in this study 12 year period data of temperature evaporation recharge based on exploitation in the area discharge obtained regarding the precipitation and water tables recorded from november 2002 to november 2014 are used for the models 10 year data were applied to calibrating models and a 2 year period was left for testing or validating the model the unit of total monthly evaporation average temperature recharge and discharge and water table are millimeter mm celsius cubic meter per month and meter respectively modeling is applied to 13 observation wells separately the position of each well is presented in table 1 2 2 governing equations and mathematical model modflow laplace equation is the basic equation in groundwater flow regime in either steady or unsteady conditions in unsteady state in an isotropic media and in cartesian coordinate system along with original direction x y z flows are unequal in the confined aquifer as shown below 1 k x h 2 x 2 k y 2 h y 2 k z 2 h z 2 s s h t and for an unconfined aquifer 2 h 2 x 2 2 h y 2 2 h z 2 s y b k h t where h k b t and s y represent head hydraulic conductivity thickness of aquifer time and specific yield respectively in the conceptual models the boundary of the model recharge and discharge resources evaporation and recharge zones are the important elements after finding the key components of the conceptual model the modflow software was applied to modeling the groundwater mathematically modflow is the u s geological survey modular finite difference flow model which is a computer code that solves the equation of groundwater flow in this part two states of steady and unsteady flow were taken under consideration in order to achieve an optimized management for this purpose the modflow model which is based on finite difference approach was applied the network in the modflow has a dimension of 250 250 mm the modflow model was implemented in gms v7 software the quantitative model is composed of following components the topographic layers with the scale of 1 25000 the water table layer using kriging interpolation method the bedrock layer according to the last geophysics studies the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity obtained through pumping test the groundwater discharge the storage coefficient and etc these characteristics were introduced to the model afterwards the model was run for a 10 year period and for both steady and unsteady states using two methods of trial and error and stochastic method for validating the model it was found that the conditions of aquifer have a remarkable sensitivity and dependency on hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient in steady and unsteady states respectively 2 3 artificial neural networks ann ann is a common type of artificial intelligence which has been inspired by animal nervous systems the system can learn from past experiences and apply them to upcoming events a usual ann consists of three layers input output and hidden layers each layer consists of a number of neurons which are connected to all neurons in the following layer the connections are linked from input to hidden layer and from hidden layer to the output layer the network is firstly trained by an appropriate algorithm using a set of input output parameters this way the ann model can find the relationship between the input variables and the target variable and subsequently uses it for predicting the output for a new set of input parameters the strength and weakness of the connections among neurons are defined by a term called weight different back propagation algorithms can be employed to train an ann model in this study the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm which is a simplified version of the newton method has been applied to training ann in the ann modeling 13 separate models were developed to predict monthly values of groundwater level in 13 piezometers in these models monthly total evaporation monthly recharge and discharge and the water table in the previous month were utilized as input variables in order to predict water table in the current month fig 4 depicts different layouts of the ann models schematically in fig 3 e t 1 q t 1 r t 1 and t t 1 stand for evaporation discharge recharge and temperature respectively h t and h t 1 denote groundwater level in the current and previous months respectively moreover the term t 1 represents 1 lag time here 1 month ago 3 the bayesian networks bns the bayesian networks are statistical based models probabilistic graphical models which utilize bayes rule to compute the conditional probability associated with the occurrence of an event a usual bayesian network consists of a set of variables where their conditional dependencies are illustrated by a directed acyclic graph dag in this approach variables are represented via nodes the conditional dependencies of variables are defined through a direct connection among nodes in a way that a connection from node a to node b shows that parameter b is depended on parameter a in this case a is called the parent for node b and mutually b is called the child overall a bn is composed of a a set of variables and a set of directed links among the variables b a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states for each variable and c an assigned conditional probability for each variable with parents the dependencies are quantified by conditional probabilities for each node given its parents in the network these dependencies are quantified through a set of cpts conditional table of probabilities each variable is assigned a cpt of the variable given its parents in the case of a variable with no parents the conditional probability structure reduces to the unconditional probability up of that variable kabir et al 2015 the ups of the basic input parameters often are not known a priori consequently equal weights 1 n where n is the number of categories considered for each basic input can be assigned using the principle of insufficient reasoning e g ismail et al 2011 assume v x1 x2 x3 y1 y2 in which each of the v components are separate variables y1 f x1 x2 and y2 f x3 y1 therefore the joint distribution function of v can be described as 3 p v p x 1 p x 2 p y 1 x 1 x 2 p x 3 p y 2 x 3 y 1 in this study the hugin lite 8 3 software was employed for implementing the bayesian networks in the bn models monthly data of evaporation temperature precipitation and discharge from groundwater resources for a 10 year period were used for the training purpose the npc learning algorithm in hugin software was employed for training the bns regarding the input parameters 108 possible states generated during constructing the structure of bns with defining confidence level of 5 percent and considering existing uncertainty among input variables the network was designed fig 4 illustrates the components of the bn and how they affect on groundwater level as it is obvious the five inputs have a direct influence on the groundwater level it is noteworthy that the effect of precipitation was considered on recharge and water table and was eliminated in the structure in order to simulate groundwater level using artificial neural and bayesian networks the time series of effective parameters on groundwater level were identified according to the different studies the input parameters included rainfall groundwater level in the previous month average temperature and aquifer recharge and discharges subsequently the output parameter was groundwater level in the present month 4 results and discussion 4 1 modflow in this section the results obtained through mathematical modeling by means of the modflow module is presented one of the main purposes of groundwater modeling is to forecast how the quantity and quality of aquifer will change in future therefore model validation is of great importance for finding the appropriate relationship between the observed and forecasted data regarding the model s implementation and the sensitivity analysis of the model hydraulic conductivity and specific discharge coefficient were identified as sensitive factors in both steady and unsteady conditions then the model calibrated based on the determined parameters for calibration the information of log drilling results of pumping tests transferability and types of geological formations were used the calibration of the groundwater model has been carried out with the changes in the values of the both parameters to have a minimum error between the observed and simulated groundwater level fig 5 a and b shows the calibrated hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient in steady and unsteady states respectively the final quantitative models for steady and unsteady states are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively according to the calibration results the errors of steady and unsteady states are presented in table 2 the error values shows the appropriate outputs of simulation according to table 3 the modflow models applied to predicting groundwater level in 13 piezometers have a mean r2 of 0 72 and rmse of 0 091 these values demonstrate a relatively good agreement between observed and predicted values models with greater r2 and smaller rmse are considered as more accurate models for example the model developed for piezometer no 9 has a better performance than those of no 3 and 4 to give more details about the efficiency of the predictive models the scatter plots of the models no 3 and 8 are depicted in figs 8 and 9 respectively as figs 7 and 8 demonstrate the developed model gives a sound prediction of groundwater level in general aside from it for some data points there is a significant difference between the predicted and observed values overall the mathematical model overestimates the groundwater level in birjand aquifer 4 2 ann models to develop the ann models similar to the other models evaporation recharge discharge temperature in the current month and water table in the previous month were used as input variables the output of the ann model was the groundwater level in the current month the results related to the performance of ann models are presented in table 4 overall the ann models provide the groundwater level with a relatively high accurate prediction in birjand aquifer regardless the ann models proposed for piezometers no 1 and 11 the coefficient of correlation for all the other ann models are higher than 0 7 these values of correlation coefficient demonstrate a good correlation between predicted and observed values among all models developed for the 13 piezometers the ann model for piezometer no 5 has the best performance with r2 and rmse of 0 86 and 0 063 respectively for extreme values they underestimate the water tables in birjand aquifer for example the ann model for piezometer no 11 estimates the observed values of 116 5 and 116 1 about 109 5 and 108 7 respectively the scatter plots of the predicted values of groundwater levels obtained from the ann models for piezometers no 3 and 8 are presented in figs 9 and 10 according to figs 9 and 10 it can be concluded that the ann models provide the piezometers under consideration with an acceptable prediction of groundwater level overall the developed models give a relatively accurate prediction of water table for the low and normal values of groundwater level 4 3 the bayesian network models based on the input and target variables the structure of the bn were generated for existing piezometers in birjand aquifer results of the simulation table 5 demonstrate that the smallest and the greatest values of coefficient of determination are equal to 0 67 and 0 99 respectively generally the average value of coefficient of determination for the 13 wells was roughly equal to 0 9 that shows a relatively high correlation between the observed and the predicted values table 4 presents the correlation coefficient and rmse obtained through the bn models for 13 piezometers as it can be interpreted from table 5 for all piezometers the coefficient of determination is more than 0 76 excluding piezometer no 1 that demonstrate a great performance of the bn models for the predictions of groundwater level for piezometers no 8 9 10 and 12 the coefficient of determination is higher than 0 95 that is a very high value and implies a very accurate result in forecasting groundwater level the rmse of the bn models varies from 0 001 to 0 1 that are relatively small values and indicate negligible differences between the observed and the predicted values of water table the average of the coefficient of determination for 13 piezometers is equal to 0 9 that shows a great ability of the bn models for this purpose figs 11 and 12 illustrate the predicted and the observed values of groundwater level in 2 piezometers figs 11 and 12 show very high correlations between the measured and the predicted values of groundwater level the bn models provide all ranges of water tables from low to high values with an accurate prediction therefore the bn model is an efficient tool and can be applied to predicting groundwater level in aquifers successfully for piezometer no 11 the bn model predicts the extreme values of 116 5 and 116 1 about 114 5 and 114 respectively 4 4 statistical analysis and comparisons to have a better comparison of the performance of different models the results of testing validation period of the modflow ann and bn models are presented in table 6 the comparison revealed that the bn models developed for forecasting groundwater level are superior to the modflow and ann models the higher values of the coefficient of determination and the smaller values of rmse for the bn models demonstrate the superiority of bn models moreover the ann models outperform the modflow models for normal and low values of the target values the ann models have higher values of rmse than the modflow models which indicate the deficiency of ann models in predicting extreme values overall the bn and ann models have a great ability for predicting groundwater level a very high correlation between observed and predicted values of the water table in birjand aquifer is obtained when the bn and ann models are applied the highest value of r2 was achieved for the bn model of piezometer no 12 which equals to 0 99 the smallest value of rmse belongs to the bn model of piezometer no 12 which is about 0 004 the average values of r2 of the modflow ann and bn models are 0 72 0 76 and 0 9 respectively that depict the superiority of the bn model fig 14 shows the time series of different models and also the measured values of groundwater level in piezometer no 5 during the testing period 2 years as fig 13 presents the predicted values of groundwater level for the bn models are closer to the measured values also the predictions provided by the ann models are closer than those of modflow generally it can be observed that the bn and ann models provide a reliable prediction for groundwater level in the study area generally modflow overestimates water table values in piezometer no 5 while the ann model underestimate it furthermore the best fit between the observed and the predicted values of groundwater level is achieved by the bn model 4 5 analyzing the hydrograph of aquifer one of the main purposes in modeling groundwater level in an aquifer is to estimate the volume of accessible water in aquifer for future planning in this section the performance of three types of predictive models including the modflow ann and bn models are assessed using groundwater hydrograph in a 2 year period fig 14 illustrates the groundwater hydrograph obtained from different methods as shown in fig 14 the ann model provides a relatively accurate prediction of groundwater level and the modflow overestimates in any case the bn model achieved the best performance which is a very accurate prediction of groundwater level a very high correlation between the observed and the predicted values can be derived using the bn model the coefficient of determination of the modflow ann and bn models have been computed equal to 0 7 0 78 and 0 96 respectively moreover they have respective rmse values of 0 016 0 067 and 0 004 therefore the best model performance is of the bn models 5 discussion prediction of groundwater level is one of the most important factors influencing the use of groundwater resources determining the appropriate method with the least uncertainty for groundwater level forecasting may be helped the decision makers for better management the comparison of bayesian network numerical model and modflow model showed that the last model requires high volume of statistics and information and in addition it is time consuming and also has high uncertainty in the input parameters evaluation of prediction results showed that the bayesian network method has the lowest uncertainty with regard to the time series defined for input data that is due to the probability of occurrence one of the factors affecting the better accuracy of bayesian network in comparison to the other two methods is the dependence of groundwater data on previous time steps however for observational wells which groundwater are highly fluctuated over the time the accuracy of bayesian network reduces whereas the neural network and modflow models have better accuracies in this condition the results of this research is confirmed by moosavi et al 2013 sahoo and madan 2013 emamgholizadeh et al 2014 kardan and roozbahani 2015 jafari et al 2016 and rakhshandehroo et al 2018 6 conclusions in this study an attempt was made to examine the efficiency of different predictive models in order to determine the most accurate predictor of forecasting groundwater level in birjand aquifer in this regard three predictive models including the modflow ann and bn models have been taken under consideration monthly average temperature monthly total evaporation discharge from and recharge to the aquifer in the current month and also monthly average water table in the previous month were applied as input parameters to predicting the groundwater level in the current month for 13 piezometers in birjand aquifer among the three developed models the bn models showed the best performance the highest correlation between the observed and the predicted values of groundwater level was observed for the bn models however the ann models showed an acceptable performance too the average values of coefficient of determination for the modflow ann and bn models were achieved about 0 72 0 76 and 0 9 respectively also the average values of rmse for these models are equal to 0 091 0 11 and 0 023 therefore the bn model is recognized as the most accurate model the main advantage of the proposed forecast methodology is its probabilistic features it develops the conditional probabilities of the forecasted variables returning the most likely forecast within an uncertainty bound the groundwater hydrograph in birjand aquifer derived by the bn model indicates that the proposed model has a great ability in forecasting groundwater level a very high correlation can be achieved using the bn model the high value of r2 0 9 and the low value of rmse 0 004 show that the bn model can be successfully applied to forecasting groundwater level the easier implementation of bn model the higher forecasting accuracy and the great ability in dealing with missing or incomplete data are the main advantages of the bn models compared to the modflow and ann models the results of this study indicate a rapid decrease in water table in the aquifer that requires further action to prevent it moreover regarding the predicted values of water table in the study area aquifer drought and land settlement in some parts of the aquifer is expected in near future therefore the amount of discharge from the aquifer should be decreased in order to compensate the water table decline according to the study it can be concluded that the bn models are efficient tools for forecasting groundwater level accurately which is of great importance in water resources management and sustainable development of groundwater resources appendix

total monthly evaporation average temperature recharge and discharge and water table are millimeter mm celsius cubic meter per month and meter respectively modeling is applied to 13 observation wells separately the position of each well is presented in table 1 2 2 governing equations and mathematical model modflow laplace equation is the basic equation in groundwater flow regime in either steady or unsteady conditions in unsteady state in an isotropic media and in cartesian coordinate system along with original direction x y z flows are unequal in the confined aquifer as shown below 1 k x h 2 x 2 k y 2 h y 2 k z 2 h z 2 s s h t and for an unconfined aquifer 2 h 2 x 2 2 h y 2 2 h z 2 s y b k h t where h k b t and s y represent head hydraulic conductivity thickness of aquifer time and specific yield respectively in the conceptual models the boundary of the model recharge and discharge resources evaporation and recharge zones are the important elements after finding the key components of the conceptual model the modflow software was applied to modeling the groundwater mathematically modflow is the u s geological survey modular finite difference flow model which is a computer code that solves the equation of groundwater flow in this part two states of steady and unsteady flow were taken under consideration in order to achieve an optimized management for this purpose the modflow model which is based on finite difference approach was applied the network in the modflow has a dimension of 250 250 mm the modflow model was implemented in gms v7 software the quantitative model is composed of following components the topographic layers with the scale of 1 25000 the water table layer using kriging interpolation method the bedrock layer according to the last geophysics studies the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity obtained through pumping test the groundwater discharge the storage coefficient and etc these characteristics were introduced to the model afterwards the model was run for a 10 year period and for both steady and unsteady states using two methods of trial and error and stochastic method for validating the model it was found that the conditions of aquifer have a remarkable sensitivity and dependency on hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient in steady and unsteady states respectively 2 3 artificial neural networks ann ann is a common type of artificial intelligence which has been inspired by animal nervous systems the system can learn from past experiences and apply them to upcoming events a usual ann consists of three layers input output and hidden layers each layer consists of a number of neurons which are connected to all neurons in the following layer the connections are linked from input to hidden layer and from hidden layer to the output layer the network is firstly trained by an appropriate algorithm using a set of input output parameters this way the ann model can find the relationship between the input variables and the target variable and subsequently uses it for predicting the output for a new set of input parameters the strength and weakness of the connections among neurons are defined by a term called weight different back propagation algorithms can be employed to train an ann model in this study the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm which is a simplified version of the newton method has been applied to training ann in the ann modeling 13 separate models were developed to predict monthly values of groundwater level in 13 piezometers in these models monthly total evaporation monthly recharge and discharge and the water table in the previous month were utilized as input variables in order to predict water table in the current month fig 4 depicts different layouts of the ann models schematically in fig 3 e t 1 q t 1 r t 1 and t t 1 stand for evaporation discharge recharge and temperature respectively h t and h t 1 denote groundwater level in the current and previous months respectively moreover the term t 1 represents 1 lag time here 1 month ago 3 the bayesian networks bns the bayesian networks are statistical based models probabilistic graphical models which utilize bayes rule to compute the conditional probability associated with the occurrence of an event a usual bayesian network consists of a set of variables where their conditional dependencies are illustrated by a directed acyclic graph dag in this approach variables are represented via nodes the conditional dependencies of variables are defined through a direct connection among nodes in a way that a connection from node a to node b shows that parameter b is depended on parameter a in this case a is called the parent for node b and mutually b is called the child overall a bn is composed of a a set of variables and a set of directed links among the variables b a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states for each variable and c an assigned conditional probability for each variable with parents the dependencies are quantified by conditional probabilities for each node given its parents in the network these dependencies are quantified through a set of cpts conditional table of probabilities each variable is assigned a cpt of the variable given its parents in the case of a variable with no parents the conditional probability structure reduces to the unconditional probability up of that variable kabir et al 2015 the ups of the basic input parameters often are not known a priori consequently equal weights 1 n where n is the number of categories considered for each basic input can be assigned using the principle of insufficient reasoning e g ismail et al 2011 assume v x1 x2 x3 y1 y2 in which each of the v components are separate variables y1 f x1 x2 and y2 f x3 y1 therefore the joint distribution function of v can be described as 3 p v p x 1 p x 2 p y 1 x 1 x 2 p x 3 p y 2 x 3 y 1 in this study the hugin lite 8 3 software was employed for implementing the bayesian networks in the bn models monthly data of evaporation temperature precipitation and discharge from groundwater resources for a 10 year period were used for the training purpose the npc learning algorithm in hugin software was employed for training the bns regarding the input parameters 108 possible states generated during constructing the structure of bns with defining confidence level of 5 percent and considering existing uncertainty among input variables the network was designed fig 4 illustrates the components of the bn and how they affect on groundwater level as it is obvious the five inputs have a direct influence on the groundwater level it is noteworthy that the effect of precipitation was considered on recharge and water table and was eliminated in the structure in order to simulate groundwater level using artificial neural and bayesian networks the time series of effective parameters on groundwater level were identified according to the different studies the input parameters included rainfall groundwater level in the previous month average temperature and aquifer recharge and discharges subsequently the output parameter was groundwater level in the present month 4 results and discussion 4 1 modflow in this section the results obtained through mathematical modeling by means of the modflow module is presented one of the main purposes of groundwater modeling is to forecast how the quantity and quality of aquifer will change in future therefore model validation is of great importance for finding the appropriate relationship between the observed and forecasted data regarding the model s implementation and the sensitivity analysis of the model hydraulic conductivity and specific discharge coefficient were identified as sensitive factors in both steady and unsteady conditions then the model calibrated based on the determined parameters for calibration the information of log drilling results of pumping tests transferability and types of geological formations were used the calibration of the groundwater model has been carried out with the changes in the values of the both parameters to have a minimum error between the observed and simulated groundwater level fig 5 a and b shows the calibrated hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient in steady and unsteady states respectively the final quantitative models for steady and unsteady states are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively according to the calibration results the errors of steady and unsteady states are presented in table 2 the error values shows the appropriate outputs of simulation according to table 3 the modflow models applied to predicting groundwater level in 13 piezometers have a mean r2 of 0 72 and rmse of 0 091 these values demonstrate a relatively good agreement between observed and predicted values models with greater r2 and smaller rmse are considered as more accurate models for example the model developed for piezometer no 9 has a better performance than those of no 3 and 4 to give more details about the efficiency of the predictive models the scatter plots of the models no 3 and 8 are depicted in figs 8 and 9 respectively as figs 7 and 8 demonstrate the developed model gives a sound prediction of groundwater level in general aside from it for some data points there is a significant difference between the predicted and observed values overall the mathematical model overestimates the groundwater level in birjand aquifer 4 2 ann models to develop the ann models similar to the other models evaporation recharge discharge temperature in the current month and water table in the previous month were used as input variables the output of the ann model was the groundwater level in the current month the results related to the performance of ann models are presented in table 4 overall the ann models provide the groundwater level with a relatively high accurate prediction in birjand aquifer regardless the ann models proposed for piezometers no 1 and 11 the coefficient of correlation for all the other ann models are higher than 0 7 these values of correlation coefficient demonstrate a good correlation between predicted and observed values among all models developed for the 13 piezometers the ann model for piezometer no 5 has the best performance with r2 and rmse of 0 86 and 0 063 respectively for extreme values they underestimate the water tables in birjand aquifer for example the ann model for piezometer no 11 estimates the observed values of 116 5 and 116 1 about 109 5 and 108 7 respectively the scatter plots of the predicted values of groundwater levels obtained from the ann models for piezometers no 3 and 8 are presented in figs 9 and 10 according to figs 9 and 10 it can be concluded that the ann models provide the piezometers under consideration with an acceptable prediction of groundwater level overall the developed models give a relatively accurate prediction of water table for the low and normal values of groundwater level 4 3 the bayesian network models based on the input and target variables the structure of the bn were generated for existing piezometers in birjand aquifer results of the simulation table 5 demonstrate that the smallest and the greatest values of coefficient of determination are equal to 0 67 and 0 99 respectively generally the average value of coefficient of determination for the 13 wells was roughly equal to 0 9 that shows a relatively high correlation between the observed and the predicted values table 4 presents the correlation coefficient and rmse obtained through the bn models for 13 piezometers as it can be interpreted from table 5 for all piezometers the coefficient of determination is more than 0 76 excluding piezometer no 1 that demonstrate a great performance of the bn models for the predictions of groundwater level for piezometers no 8 9 10 and 12 the coefficient of determination is higher than 0 95 that is a very high value and implies a very accurate result in forecasting groundwater level the rmse of the bn models varies from 0 001 to 0 1 that are relatively small values and indicate negligible differences between the observed and the predicted values of water table the average of the coefficient of determination for 13 piezometers is equal to 0 9 that shows a great ability of the bn models for this purpose figs 11 and 12 illustrate the predicted and the observed values of groundwater level in 2 piezometers figs 11 and 12 show very high correlations between the measured and the predicted values of groundwater level the bn models provide all ranges of water tables from low to high values with an accurate prediction therefore the bn model is an efficient tool and can be applied to predicting groundwater level in aquifers successfully for piezometer no 11 the bn model predicts the extreme values of 116 5 and 116 1 about 114 5 and 114 respectively 4 4 statistical analysis and comparisons to have a better comparison of the performance of different models the results of testing validation period of the modflow ann and bn models are presented in table 6 the comparison revealed that the bn models developed for forecasting groundwater level are superior to the modflow and ann models the higher values of the coefficient of determination and the smaller values of rmse for the bn models demonstrate the superiority of bn models moreover the ann models outperform the modflow models for normal and low values of the target values the ann models have higher values of rmse than the modflow models which indicate the deficiency of ann models in predicting extreme values overall the bn and ann models have a great ability for predicting groundwater level a very high correlation between observed and predicted values of the water table in birjand aquifer is obtained when the bn and ann models are applied the highest value of r2 was achieved for the bn model of piezometer no 12 which equals to 0 99 the smallest value of rmse belongs to the bn model of piezometer no 12 which is about 0 004 the average values of r2 of the modflow ann and bn models are 0 72 0 76 and 0 9 respectively that depict the superiority of the bn model fig 14 shows the time series of different models and also the measured values of groundwater level in piezometer no 5 during the testing period 2 years as fig 13 presents the predicted values of groundwater level for the bn models are closer to the measured values also the predictions provided by the ann models are closer than those of modflow generally it can be observed that the bn and ann models provide a reliable prediction for groundwater level in the study area generally modflow overestimates water table values in piezometer no 5 while the ann model underestimate it furthermore the best fit between the observed and the predicted values of groundwater level is achieved by the bn model 4 5 analyzing the hydrograph of aquifer one of the main purposes in modeling groundwater level in an aquifer is to estimate the volume of accessible water in aquifer for future planning in this section the performance of three types of predictive models including the modflow ann and bn models are assessed using groundwater hydrograph in a 2 year period fig 14 illustrates the groundwater hydrograph obtained from different methods as shown in fig 14 the ann model provides a relatively accurate prediction of groundwater level and the modflow overestimates in any case the bn model achieved the best performance which is a very accurate prediction of groundwater level a very high correlation between the observed and the predicted values can be derived using the bn model the coefficient of determination of the modflow ann and bn models have been computed equal to 0 7 0 78 and 0 96 respectively moreover they have respective rmse values of 0 016 0 067 and 0 004 therefore the best model performance is of the bn models 5 discussion prediction of groundwater level is one of the most important factors influencing the use of groundwater resources determining the appropriate method with the least uncertainty for groundwater level forecasting may be helped the decision makers for better management the comparison of bayesian network numerical model and modflow model showed that the last model requires high volume of statistics and information and in addition it is time consuming and also has high uncertainty in the input parameters evaluation of prediction results showed that the bayesian network method has the lowest uncertainty with regard to the time series defined for input data that is due to the probability of occurrence one of the factors affecting the better accuracy of bayesian network in comparison to the other two methods is the dependence of groundwater data on previous time steps however for observational wells which groundwater are highly fluctuated over the time the accuracy of bayesian network reduces whereas the neural network and modflow models have better accuracies in this condition the results of this research is confirmed by moosavi et al 2013 sahoo and madan 2013 emamgholizadeh et al 2014 kardan and roozbahani 2015 jafari et al 2016 and rakhshandehroo et al 2018 6 conclusions in this study an attempt was made to examine the efficiency of different predictive models in order to determine the most accurate predictor of forecasting groundwater level in birjand aquifer in this regard three predictive models including the modflow ann and bn models have been taken under consideration monthly average temperature monthly total evaporation discharge from and recharge to the aquifer in the current month and also monthly average water table in the previous month were applied as input parameters to predicting the groundwater level in the current month for 13 piezometers in birjand aquifer among the three developed models the bn models showed the best performance the highest correlation between the observed and the predicted values of groundwater level was observed for the bn models however the ann models showed an acceptable performance too the average values of coefficient of determination for the modflow ann and bn models were achieved about 0 72 0 76 and 0 9 respectively also the average values of rmse for these models are equal to 0 091 0 11 and 0 023 therefore the bn model is recognized as the most accurate model the main advantage of the proposed forecast methodology is its probabilistic features it develops the conditional probabilities of the forecasted variables returning the most likely forecast within an uncertainty bound the groundwater hydrograph in birjand aquifer derived by the bn model indicates that the proposed model has a great ability in forecasting groundwater level a very high correlation can be achieved using the bn model the high value of r2 0 9 and the low value of rmse 0 004 show that the bn model can be successfully applied to forecasting groundwater level the easier implementation of bn model the higher forecasting accuracy and the great ability in dealing with missing or incomplete data are the main advantages of the bn models compared to the modflow and ann models the results of this study indicate a rapid decrease in water table in the aquifer that requires further action to prevent it moreover regarding the predicted values of water table in the study area aquifer drought and land settlement in some parts of the aquifer is expected in near future therefore the amount of discharge from the aquifer should be decreased in order to compensate the water table decline according to the study it can be concluded that the bn models are efficient tools for forecasting groundwater level accurately which is of great importance in water resources management and sustainable development of groundwater resources appendix

12231,the present study was attempted to characterize the groundwater of charhi and kuju coal mines in jharkhand india and assess its suitability for irrigation and domestic use groundwater samples were collected from thirty one locations covering active operational sites abandoned sites and areas yet to be mined control and analyzed for physical and chemical parameters including the ions and metals the obtained results were analyzed through various statistical tools to understand the nature of the groundwater irrigation indices were calculated to assess the fitness for irrigation and water quality indices were calculated to evaluate the suitability of the water for consumption overall results suggested the groundwater in the study area though fit for irrigation grossly unsuitable to be used as drinking water mainly due to its elevated concentration of arsenic and selenium concentration of total arsenic was 0 09 mg l in summer 0 08 and 0 06 mg l in monsoon and winter respectively total selenium concentration was as high as 0 29 mg l in summer 0 22 mg l in monsoon and 0 18 mg l in winter season the calculated carcinogenic risk was also prominent with 7 28 due to arsenic and 2 26 due to selenium in summer findings of this investigation would help to apply proper management perspectives to the stakeholders for improving the groundwater quality of the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords open cast coal mines groundwater quality irrigation indices wqi human health risk 1 introduction open cast coal mining has caused major environmental impacts throughout the world in the last few decades cravotta 2015 lechner et al 2016 countries like australia china india south africa and usa have been much affected due to massive coal mining activities liang et al 2017 johnson and hallberg 2005 suggested that coal and metal mines have impacted about 19 300 km stretch of rivers and 72 000 ha of lakes and reservoirs worldwide land disturbance and impacts on water regimes have significantly been more intense in open cast mines than underground mines lechner et al 2014 and the impacts of such open cut mines start from the active mining phases continuing till post mining phases liang et al 2017 it affects both water quality and hydrological characteristics wellen et al 2018 of the area the processes of mining along with the geological interactions determine the ultimate quality of the groundwater in mining areas singh et al 2007 anim gyampo et al 2019 moreover the matter of prime concern is that the contaminated water has the potential to impact neighboring water bodies and agricultural fields up to 10 km from its source naicker et al 2003 impacts of mining on groundwater generally comprises of two phenomena occurring simultaneously viz acid mine drainage and subsequent release of heavy metals due to rock water interaction in acidic ph mohanty et al 2018 the mobility of the metals is triggered due to the passage of the water through cracks and fractures within the rocks in acidic environment cravotta 2005 these phenomena considerably reduce the utilization potential of the groundwater for domestic agricultural recreational and industrial uses jain 2012 different heavy metals as cd fe mn ni se zn pb have been reported to be contaminating the aquifers of the coal mining areas throughout the world mohanty et al 2018 heavy metals are particularly hazardous group of pollutants due to their persistence and degree of toxicity jarup 2003 these heavy metals through prolonged irrigation by groundwater accumulates in soil and reaches the human beings via plants alam et al 2016 this increases the risk of heavy metal induced diseases in human beings md bodrud doza et al 2019 suitability of the water to be used for irrigation can be assessed through calculation of various indices like permeability index salinity hazard sodium adsorption ratio kelly index etc from the recorded values of the various physicochemical parameters similarly for domestic consumption and uses the quality of the water can be evaluated by calculation of water quality index and health water quality index regular monitoring and analysis of the parameters and calculation of the indices are of utmost importance to maintain a regular database of water quality in the mining area and take necessary mitigatory actions whenever required as rightly suggested by mahato et al 2018 in india groundwater pollution has been reported from mining areas like lignite mines of tiruchengode taluk namakkal district in tamil nadu khan et al 2013 korba coalfields chhattisgarh singh et al 2017 talcher coalfields odisha mohanty et al 2001 along with extensive areas of jharia north karanpura and west bokaro coal fields from jharkhand singh et al 2010 2011 2012 the present study area is in the state of jharkhand suffered extensively due to environmental impacts of unplanned and rampant mining activities since last forty years hydrogeochemical studies in different pockets of mining areas in jharkhand has been reported by several scientists singh et al 2018 have studied the metal contamination and hydrogeochemical interactions of east singhbhum district while the hydrogeochemical studies of ramgarh district was reported by mohanty et al 2018 suitability of groundwater in mining region of east bokaro coal field was studied by mahato et al 2018 other coal mining areas of west bokaro jharia raniganj pench singrauli and neyveli coalfields have also been reported by several researchers sarkar et al 2007 tiwary 2001 tiwari et al 2016a b in the present study area kuju charhi numerous mines have been abandoned without proper reclamation and presently the operating mines and associated industrial activities like railway siding washery workshops and powerhouse are in active stage in addition to this the groundwater of the area is used extensively for domestic purposes including drinking and irrigation of nearby agricultural fields in view of the above facts since the nature of groundwater has many interconnected perspectives including public health issues the present investigation comprises of hydro chemical characterization of the groundwater in charhi and kuju coal mining areas to understand its nature and asses its suitability for domestic and irrigational use this will help in sustainable utilization and management of the water resources in the area particularly at a time when the availability of enough good quality groundwater is scarce throughout the world bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area charhi and kuju coal mines belong to west bokaro coal fields and spread over 123 78 sq km approximately between the geographical coordinates 23 43 04 to 23 51 42 latitude 85 25 40 to 85 39 50 longitude the study area is under the administrative boundary of ramgarh hazaribagh and bokaro districts of jharkhand covered by the survey of india topo sheets f45b5 f45b6 f45b9 f45b10 fig 1 the area is sloping towards the south east and the drainage of the area is controlled by three streams nalas namely bokaronadi chutuanadi and chotanadi and finally emerging out of the study area as bokaro nadi the geology of the study area suggests its dominance by barakar formation with alternate bands of coarse to medium grained sandstones inter banded with sandstone shales and coal seams in addition to this grey shales and carbonaceous sandy shales with sideritic bands are present 66 villages with an approximate population of 1 9 lakhs solely depend on the mining and associated ancillary operations present within the study area at some location paddy fields with irrigation water sources from surface water of nalas and abandoned mining pits is found 2 2 sample collection preservation and analysis groundwater samples were collected from 31 locations of the study area in three seasons namely summer season april to june 2017 monsoon season july to september 2017 and winter season december to february 2019 samples were collected from tube wells of three representative zones of the study area viz near active mining sites abandoned zones and zones which have not yet been exposed to mining activities designated as control and the collection points were georeferenced with the help of a garmin etrex30 gps before collection groundwater was pumped out 40 80 times to avoid oxidized water of the ascent tube immediately after that physical and chemical parameters ammonium chloride electrical conductivity nitrate oxidation reduction potential ph and temperature were measured with the help of a hand held multiparameter analyzer ysi 6050000 apart from this groundwater was also collected in two sets from each location in polypropylene bottles one after filtration through whatman filter paper 0 45 μ and acidified to ph 2 with hno3 loring and rantala 1992 for metal analysis and the other set for different ion analysis as per apha awaa standard methods samples were stored at 4 c before analysis total hardness and total alkalinity were determined titrimetrically while fluoride was estimated by spadns method sodium and potassium were measured using flame photometer 2 3 metal analysis the concentration of the selected metals as cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb se and zn in filtered groundwater samples were analyzed

2015 1 14 gibbs diagram to assess the salinity hazard and wilcox diagram to understand the causative factor for the nature of the groundwater was constructed in microsoft excel 2010 2 5 irrigation water quality indices five types of irrigation water quality indices permeability index pi residual sodium carbonate rsc sodium adsorption ratio sar kelly ratio kr and percent sodium were calculated to understand the suitability of the groundwater quality for irrigation the indices were based on concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 ions and ca2 mg2 and na ions in the samples the formula used for the calculation and their classifications have been summarized in table 1 2 6 water quality index and health water quality index to understand the overall quality of the groundwater water quality index wqi was calculated based on eighteen physicochemical parameters the parameters considered were as ca2 cl do ec f fe k ca2 mg2 mn na no3 ph se so4 2 tot alkalinity tds and total hardness the considered parameters were assigned a weight wi 1 5 according to their relative contribution in the overall quality for irrigation and domestic purposes finally relative weight wi was calculated from the assigned weights by the below mentioned formula w i w i w i the quality rating scale qi for each parameter was calculated as q i c i s i x 100 where ci indicated the specific parameter s concentration in mg l and si was the permissible value prescribed by bureau of indian standards bis 2012 sub index si was calculated as a product of the relative weight of the selected parameter and the quality rating scale s i i q i x w i the water quality index wqi was finally calculated as the summation of the sub index of all the parameters w q i s i i based on the wqi values the quality of the water was classified as excellent if the wqi values were less than 50 good water if wqi was between 50 and 100 poor water for wqi values between 101 and 200 very poor water for values 201 300 and water not suitable for drinking if the wqi values were greater than 300 khan and kumar 2013 similarly health water quality index hwqi was calculated employing the same formula following the guidelines of ccme water quality index user s manual 2001 however for hwqi 10 physicochemical parameters namely as cr cd cu f fe mn pb se and no3 were considered and each parameter was assigned weight wi 1 5 as per their relative contribution in the overall water quality 2 7 health risk assessment consumption of metals and metalloids through drinking water poses carcinogenic or non carcinogenic risks usepa 2009 the two main toxicity factors determining the degree of risk are reference dose rfd for noncarcinogen risk and slope factor sf for carcinogen risk calculation usepa 1997 1999 the calculation of the risk was based on average daily dose add and rfd or sf values of as fe mn and se add was dependent on the mean concentration of the metals in groundwater c in mg l water intake or consumption rate ir 2 14 l day for children and 3 49 l day for adults exposure frequency ef 365 days in a year and exposure duration ed 10 years for children and 70 years for adults and the average body weight bw considered as 31 kg for children and 48 56 kg for adults of jharkhand state shome et al 2014 and the average time at of exposure in lifetime as 3650 days for children and 25 550 days for adults bortey sam et al 2015 a d d c x i r x e f x e d b w x a t the non carcinogenic risk hq was calculated as the ratio between add and rfd h q a d d r f d the individual values of the hq were combined to find the total health risk hi if the hq and or hi values exceeded 1 it implied significant non carcinogenic risk the carcinogenic risk was calculated as the product of add and sf and the scale of judgement was based upon guidelines by usepa 1999 as summarized in table 2 2 8 distribution mapping of heavy metal wqi and hwqi distribution the results obtained through water quality analysis were interpolated in geographic information system gis environment from the obtained geographic coordinates of sampling points with the help of gps inverse distance weightage idw technique in arcgis v10 software was employed to show the distribution of heavy metals along with wqi and hwqi spatially and temporally with respect to the three seasons this method predicts the values of the fed parameters even at unrecorded locations based on spatial correlation of variables kumar and krishna 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydro chemical characteristics of the groundwater samples the detailed results of the hydro chemical parameters from 31 locations in three seasons have been presented in table 3 a 3b 3c analysis of variance revealed 14 out of 20 parameters to be significantly varying with respect to sites and 12 out of 20 parameters to be significantly varying with respect to seasons table 4 the groundwater samples in all the three seasons were found to be varying from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline however all samples were within prescribed limits of 7 8 5 suggested by who 2006 only one sample gw 30 was found to be acidic with a ph value of 4 7 0 1 in summer 4 7 0 07 in monsoon and 4 8 0 1 in winter season the location of the sampling point gw 30 was adjacent to the coal washery which might be responsible for the lower ph value of the groundwater tds was fairly high in the samples in all the three seasons it ranged from 178 0 76 to 1705 2 08 mg l in summer 59 1 41 to 768 3 54 mg l in monsoon and 61 0 64 to 791 2 08 in winter season in summer around 70 of the samples showed tds levels above 500 mg l as prescribed in who 2006 and bis 2012 standards generally higher levels of tds in groundwater occurs due to enhanced dissolution and mineralisation during rock water interaction mohanty et al 2018 ec values were also within the range of bis 2012 as well as who 2006 standards the redox condition of the groundwater reflected as the orp values from positive to negative indicated that the groundwater was slightly oxidising to highly reducing environment shallow groundwater generally shows positive orp values and lowering of groundwater in open cast coal mining areas is a common phenomenon total hardness which generally occurs due to accelerated weathering of sedimentary rocks bearing calcium minerals was found to be elevated in the samples of the study area according to mcgowan classification mcgowan 2000 it was found that percentage of samples exhibiting moderately hard values were 30 in summer 20 in monsoon and 30 in winter hard water was observed in 47 of samples in summer 17 in monsoon and 37 in winter while very hard water was recorded in 20 of samples in summer 50 of the samples in monsoon and 23 in winter consumption of very hard water is known to cause kidney problems reddy and prasad 2005 hard water is a characteristic of mining areas due to accelerated un consolidation of rocks because of various mining activities apart from this 04 samples in summer 14 samples in monsoon and 03 samples in winter had their total hardness levels above bis 2012 standards total alkalinity was found to be relatively more than total hardness in all the three seasons indicating dominance of carbonate hardness anwar and aggarwal 2014 total alkalinity ranged within 23 2 52 to 790 4 73 mg l with a mean value of 175 mg l in summer 51 0 71 to 469 0 71 mg l with a mean value of 268 mg l in monsoon and 27 0 71 to 433 2 83 mg l with a mean value of 177 mg l in winter season 10 18 and 12 samples out of 30 were found to be exceeding bis 2012 standard 200 mg l calcium which is an important contributor to hardness of water was found to be present in higher concentrations in monsoon season compared to summer and winter 23 of the samples were having calcium concentration higher than bis 2012 permissible limit of 75 mg l however in the other two seasons all samples were within bis 2012 acceptable limits excess intake of calcium can lead to hypercalcaemic condition in human beings similarly magnesium was also found to be in higher concentrations than bis 2012 permissible limit of 30 mg l in 06 samples in monsoon and 03 samples in winter generally gypsum dissolution in aquifers lead to higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations in groundwater chenini et al 2010 excess mg2 in drinking water can lead to hypermagnesemia and where excess mg2 gets coupled with high sulphate in drinking water it has a laxative effect on human beings other cations and anions were within acceptable limit of who 2006 and bis 2012 standards fluoride concentration ranged from 0 26 0 38 mg l to 0 86 0 46 mg l in summer 0 14 0 04 to 0 92 0 04 mg l in monsoon and 0 14 0 01 to 0 88 0 01 mg l in winter season source of fluoride in groundwater is mainly weathering of granitic and granitic gneiss rocks containing minerals like apatite and biotite mishra and sharma 1975 among the metals and metalloids in the groundwater of the study area only arsenic iron manganese and selenium were found in higher concentrations rest of the metals were present in concentrations below detection limit of icp oes as presented in table 5 arsenic was found in the range of below detection limit bdl to 0 09 mg l with 68 of the samples in summer 55 in monsoon and 29 in winter above who 2006 and bis 2012 permissible limit of 0 01 mg l the highest concentration of arsenic was 0 09 mg l in summer 0 08 mg l in monsoon and 0 06 mg l in winter arsenic has been reported in groundwater of coal mining areas in some previous studies also singh et al 2017 herath et al 2016 arsenic contaminated water used for consumption or irrigation has been reported to be causing various health impacts in human beings like diabetes pulmonary diseases and cardiovascular diseases alam et al 2016 iron was also found to be exceeding the who 2006 and bis 2012 standards of 0 3 mg l in 35 samples in summer and monsoon and 29 in winter fe concentration varied between bdl to 4 90 mg l in summer 4 50 mg l in monsoon and 4 10 mg l in winter excess iron in drinking water has been reported to produce cellular and dna damage and consequent cell damage mutation and malignancy in human beings paponikolaou and pantopoulos 2005 manganese ranged within bdl to 2 90 mg l in summer 2 60 mg l in monsoon and 1 10 mg l in winter 61 of the samples in summer 45 samples in monsoon and 29 samples in winter were above bis 2012 acceptable limit of 0 3 mg l dna damage chromosomal aberration and neurotoxic effects are linked to consumption of mn enriched water gerber et al 2002 selenium is yet another metal which has been found to be in higher concentrations in the groundwater of the study area 87 of the samples in summer and 83 of the samples in monsoon and winter were above the bis 2012 acceptable limit of 0 01 mg l in drinking water concentrations varied between bdl to 0 27 mg l in summer 0 22 mg l in monsoon and 0 18 mg l in winter neurological ailments are commonly linked to high selenium in drinking water saint amour et al 2006 3 2 correlation between the hydro chemical parameters coefficient of correlation between the various parameters have been presented in table 6 a 6b 6c significant positive correlation was observed between ec and tds in summer season 0 98 ec is sometimes referred to as the surrogate measure of tds though all dissolved solids do not correspond to the electrical conductance thirumalini and joseph 2009 however though not linear a direct relation always exists between the tds and ec thirumalini and joseph 2009 significant positive correlation p 0 05 was also observed between ca2 0 86 and mg2 0 80 with total hardness in summer similar observation was noted for ca2 0 94 and mg2 0 85 with total hardness in monsoon these also have obvious reasons because calcium and magnesium are the most common sources of water hardness hco3 also showed strong positive correlation total alkalinity in summer 0 96 and winter 0 99 bicarbonate contributes towards the total alkalinity of any water sample the bicarbonate ions neutralize the h or oh ions of the water samples even so4 2 was found to be bearing significant positive correlation with hco3 0 99 in monsoon and no3 0 73 in winter suggesting same probable sources of dissolution due to rock water interaction oxidation of sulphide minerals like pyrite fes2 along with weathering of gypsum and anhydride generally lead to release of sulphate han et al 2013 singh et al 2011 presence of nitrate in mining areas can be attributed mainly to use of nitro glycerine explosives singh et al 2012 scatter plot constructed between the significantly correlated parameters also showed clear relation between tds vs ec r2 0 96 ca vs th r2 0 74 and hco3 vs total alkalinity r2 0 91 in summer and ca vs th r2 0 89 in monsoon as shown in fig 2 3 3 ionic constituents of the groundwater and their probable controlling mechanism trilinear piper diagram of the data in the study area showed the groundwater to be na hco3 type in summer and winter and ca2 hco3 type in monsoon fig 3 a 3 b 3 c which is due to weathering and dissolution of carbonate and silicates mahato et al 2018 seasonal variation of groundwater type mainly varies due to ion migration and mixing owing to natural or human influences han et al 2014 percolation of water during monsoon season accelerates the rock water interaction and dissolution of calcium carbonates the coal belts of jharkhand are known for their dominance of calcium ions in groundwater panigrahy et al 2015 this also suggests that most of the ions in the groundwater present is natural in origin the dominance of the ions was in the order of na ca2 mg2 k for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 for anions the probable controlling mechanism of the groundwater ionic chemistry was found to be rock dominance when the hydro chemical parameters were plotted in gibb s diagram with two different ratios of tds vs cl cl hco3 and tds vs na k na k ca2 as shown in fig 4 normally the gibb s diagram help us to understand the controlling mechanism of the water chemistry like whether it is rock weathering dominance or evaporation crystallization dominance or atmospheric precipitation dominance therefore in the present study area the water chemistry can be said to be mainly caused by the weathering and dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals along with granitic gneiss minerals samanta et al 2013 3 4 suitability assessment of the groundwater for irrigation several indices were calculated from the values of the hydro chemical characteristics of the groundwater samples and presented in fig 5 mean permeability index pi was 65 17 in summer 47 82 in monsoon and 84 39 in winter suggesting the overall water quality suitable for irrigation with respect to pi only one sample gw 31 22 38 was found to be unsuitable for irrigation in summer 16 samples in monsoon season 74 of the samples belonged to class i water for irrigation water with pi 25 reduces the permeability of the soil after prolonged irrigation which in turn hinders plant growth residual sodium carbonate rsc index value indicated greater fraction of the samples to be in safe limits only one sample was found in marginally safe level in summer while 05 31 and 04 31 samples were found unsuitable in summer and winter respectively this indicated that there is no risk of bicarbonate precipitation of calcium in majority of the sample due to irrigation and hence the water can be used for irrigation the sodicity hazard reflected by the sar ratio also indicated majority of the samples to be in the excellent category with only one sample in monsoon and three samples in winter to be good the mean sar values were 1 68 in summer 2 33 in monsoon and 5 16 in winter the kelly ratio kr however showed that though in summer and monsoon majority of the samples were suitable for irrigation most of the sample in winter are unsuitable the mean kr was 0 81 in summer 1 01 in monsoon and 2 02 in winter this indicates the increment of the ionic constituents in groundwater due to absence of freshwater infiltration of rainwater happening in monsoon sodium is considered hazardous among the ions present in irrigation water since its occurrence with chloride or sulphate turn the water saline and alkaline with carbonate or bicarbonate both affecting the soil and plant growth percent sodium na mean values were 91 in summer 112 in monsoon and 207 in winter all representing unsuitable character of the water samples for irrigation according to the todd classification 1959 the groundwater was found grossly unsuitable for irrigation in monsoon and winter 53 and 76 of the samples were found unsuitable in monsoon and winter respectively more dissolution of sodium from the aquifer rocks in monsoon can be the reason for increase in monsoon which persists in winter where additionally lack of fresh water also accounts for the maximum concentration so the gross results of irrigation indices suggested that though sodicity hazard and permeability problems associated with prolonged irrigation is not prominent in the area sodium percentage is elevated and can cause irrigational problems the ionic constituent data when plotted in us salinity diagram richards 1954 as shown in fig 6 suggested low to medium salinity hazard and low to very high sodium alkali hazard in summer majority of the samples indicated medium salinity hazard c2 and low sodium alkali hazard s1 salinity hazard in the other two seasons existed in low to medium intensity c1 and c2 however the sodium alkali hazard was though low for most of the locations in monsoon few locations had medium and high hazard in winter even very high s4 hazard was observed for some samples and rest in high and low hazard categories similar observations were reported from damodar valley coalfields by singh et al 2009 3 5 water quality indices the overall quality of the groundwater in the study area was attempted to be understood by the water quality index wqi and health water quality index hwqi considerable amount of variation was noticed for the wqi values of the groundwater with respect to season in summer season maximum number of locations indicated water quality unsuitable for drinking 13 31 42 32 of the locations had very poor water and 20 showed poor water fig 7 in monsoon however percentage of water unsuitable for drinking decreased to 23 though 52 locations exhibited very poor water according to the classification of khan and kumar 2013 in winter season the highest percentage of water quality was poor water 52 while 23 was very poor water and only 10 water was unsuitable for drinking in none of the seasons the water quality was found to be excellent highest number of unsuitable water quality locations were found in summer which suggests that influx of rainwater during monsoon causes dilution of the groundwater through recharge and improves the quality of the water in the study area similar influence of monsoon recharge on groundwater quality due to hydro chemical reactions in aquifer has been mentioned by vutla and ravichandran 2011 similarly hwqi calculation considering selected water quality parameters also hinted at majority of the locations to be having water quality from poor to unsuitable for drinking poor quality water was noted in 10 13 and 35 of the water samples in summer monsoon and winter respectively very poor water was observed in 8 10 and 9 locations out of 31 locations in summer monsoon and winter season percentage of locations exhibiting water quality unsuitable for drinking was 58 in summer 42 in monsoon and 20 in winter season these values indicate that the water quality of the area has got serious potential to jeopardize the health of the local population 3 6 health risk index the health risk associated with consumption of groundwater in the study area was expressed as three representative zones viz control area active operational area and abandoned area in this paper to express a summarized picture of the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic hazard quotient usepa 2009 table 7 according to bortey sam et al 2015 none of locations showed any carcinogenic risk for adults or children in any of the three seasons however non carcinogenic risk was significantly high for arsenic and selenium in all the three seasons both for children and adults the mean non carcinogenic risk was highest in operational area 7 28 for adults and 7 00 for children in summer in the other two seasons also though less than summer the arsenic induced non carcinogenic risk for both adults and children was highest in operational area similar trend was observed for selenium induced non carcinogenic risk maximum risk was noted in operational area in summer 2 26 for adults and 2 17 for children hi varied significantly with season as well as representative zones it varied between 3 39 and 9 74 in adults and 3 31 to 9 36 in children which falls under high risk category usepa 1999 maximum risk for adults and children was observed in summer season and active operational area the two main elements responsible for the high hi values in the study area were arsenic and selenium manganese did not pose any risk to the local inhabitants consuming the groundwater in the area under investigation arsenic induced carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk in jharkhand has previously been reported by alam et al 2016 and tirkey et al 2017 elevated concentrations of arsenic and selenium in groundwater and less average body weight of the local inhabitants of jharkhand shome et al 2014 can be held responsible for the high hi in the area especially the active operational areas of the mining region have high health risk potential as evident from the health risk index calculations 4 conclusion present investigation on the groundwater quality have supplied several insights variation in the physical and chemical parameters were significant within sites as well as seasons as evident from analysis of variance majority of the groundwater samples had high tds and was hard to very hard in nature groundwater was found to be na hco3 in summer and winter while ca2 hco3 in monsoon which might be due to enhanced weathering and dissolution of carbonate and silicate rocks characteristic of coal mining areas from gibb s diagram it was evident that the groundwater was due to rock water interactions and among cations ca2 in summer and mg2 was higher in monsoon and winter season above bis 2012 guideline values regarding the suitability of the water for irrigation it was observed that though permeability index residual sodium carbonate and sodium adsorption ratio did not indicate any unsuitable nature kelly ratio and percentage sodium suggested the groundwater to be unsuitable for irrigation mainly in monsoon and winter sodium alkali hazard was also found to be high and very high in monsoon and winter these observations suggested the deterioration of the groundwater quality mainly attributable to enhanced dissolution of aquifer rocks of the study area in monsoon among the metals arsenic and selenium in groundwater was found higher than who 2011 and bis 2012 guideline values and imparting considerably high non carcinogenic hazards to the local people wqi and hwqi also showed poor to unsuitable quality of groundwater in the study area overall analysis of the results indicated the groundwater to be not suitable for drinking purpose unless properly treated even prolonged irrigation with the groundwater hinted at growing salinity as well as sodium alkali hazard acknowledgement the authors are thankful to ugc new delhi for financing this study through the startup grant for newly recruited

12231,the present study was attempted to characterize the groundwater of charhi and kuju coal mines in jharkhand india and assess its suitability for irrigation and domestic use groundwater samples were collected from thirty one locations covering active operational sites abandoned sites and areas yet to be mined control and analyzed for physical and chemical parameters including the ions and metals the obtained results were analyzed through various statistical tools to understand the nature of the groundwater irrigation indices were calculated to assess the fitness for irrigation and water quality indices were calculated to evaluate the suitability of the water for consumption overall results suggested the groundwater in the study area though fit for irrigation grossly unsuitable to be used as drinking water mainly due to its elevated concentration of arsenic and selenium concentration of total arsenic was 0 09 mg l in summer 0 08 and 0 06 mg l in monsoon and winter respectively total selenium concentration was as high as 0 29 mg l in summer 0 22 mg l in monsoon and 0 18 mg l in winter season the calculated carcinogenic risk was also prominent with 7 28 due to arsenic and 2 26 due to selenium in summer findings of this investigation would help to apply proper management perspectives to the stakeholders for improving the groundwater quality of the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords open cast coal mines groundwater quality irrigation indices wqi human health risk 1 introduction open cast coal mining has caused major environmental impacts throughout the world in the last few decades cravotta 2015 lechner et al 2016 countries like australia china india south africa and usa have been much affected due to massive coal mining activities liang et al 2017 johnson and hallberg 2005 suggested that coal and metal mines have impacted about 19 300 km stretch of rivers and 72 000 ha of lakes and reservoirs worldwide land disturbance and impacts on water regimes have significantly been more intense in open cast mines than underground mines lechner et al 2014 and the impacts of such open cut mines start from the active mining phases continuing till post mining phases liang et al 2017 it affects both water quality and hydrological characteristics wellen et al 2018 of the area the processes of mining along with the geological interactions determine the ultimate quality of the groundwater in mining areas singh et al 2007 anim gyampo et al 2019 moreover the matter of prime concern is that the contaminated water has the potential to impact neighboring water bodies and agricultural fields up to 10 km from its source naicker et al 2003 impacts of mining on groundwater generally comprises of two phenomena occurring simultaneously viz acid mine drainage and subsequent release of heavy metals due to rock water interaction in acidic ph mohanty et al 2018 the mobility of the metals is triggered due to the passage of the water through cracks and fractures within the rocks in acidic environment cravotta 2005 these phenomena considerably reduce the utilization potential of the groundwater for domestic agricultural recreational and industrial uses jain 2012 different heavy metals as cd fe mn ni se zn pb have been reported to be contaminating the aquifers of the coal mining areas throughout the world mohanty et al 2018 heavy metals are particularly hazardous group of pollutants due to their persistence and degree of toxicity jarup 2003 these heavy metals through prolonged irrigation by groundwater accumulates in soil and reaches the human beings via plants alam et al 2016 this increases the risk of heavy metal induced diseases in human beings md bodrud doza et al 2019 suitability of the water to be used for irrigation can be assessed through calculation of various indices like permeability index salinity hazard sodium adsorption ratio kelly index etc from the recorded values of the various physicochemical parameters similarly for domestic consumption and uses the quality of the water can be evaluated by calculation of water quality index and health water quality index regular monitoring and analysis of the parameters and calculation of the indices are of utmost importance to maintain a regular database of water quality in the mining area and take necessary mitigatory actions whenever required as rightly suggested by mahato et al 2018 in india groundwater pollution has been reported from mining areas like lignite mines of tiruchengode taluk namakkal district in tamil nadu khan et al 2013 korba coalfields chhattisgarh singh et al 2017 talcher coalfields odisha mohanty et al 2001 along with extensive areas of jharia north karanpura and west bokaro coal fields from jharkhand singh et al 2010 2011 2012 the present study area is in the state of jharkhand suffered extensively due to environmental impacts of unplanned and rampant mining activities since last forty years hydrogeochemical studies in different pockets of mining areas in jharkhand has been reported by several scientists singh et al 2018 have studied the metal contamination and hydrogeochemical interactions of east singhbhum district while the hydrogeochemical studies of ramgarh district was reported by mohanty et al 2018 suitability of groundwater in mining region of east bokaro coal field was studied by mahato et al 2018 other coal mining areas of west bokaro jharia raniganj pench singrauli and neyveli coalfields have also been reported by several researchers sarkar et al 2007 tiwary 2001 tiwari et al 2016a b in the present study area kuju charhi numerous mines have been abandoned without proper reclamation and presently the operating mines and associated industrial activities like railway siding washery workshops and powerhouse are in active stage in addition to this the groundwater of the area is used extensively for domestic purposes including drinking and irrigation of nearby agricultural fields in view of the above facts since the nature of groundwater has many interconnected perspectives including public health issues the present investigation comprises of hydro chemical characterization of the groundwater in charhi and kuju coal mining areas to understand its nature and asses its suitability for domestic and irrigational use this will help in sustainable utilization and management of the water resources in the area particularly at a time when the availability of enough good quality groundwater is scarce throughout the world bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area charhi and kuju coal mines belong to west bokaro coal fields and spread over 123 78 sq km approximately between the geographical coordinates 23 43 04 to 23 51 42 latitude 85 25 40 to 85 39 50 longitude the study area is under the administrative boundary of ramgarh hazaribagh and bokaro districts of jharkhand covered by the survey of india topo sheets f45b5 f45b6 f45b9 f45b10 fig 1 the area is sloping towards the south east and the drainage of the area is controlled by three streams nalas namely bokaronadi chutuanadi and chotanadi and finally emerging out of the study area as bokaro nadi the geology of the study area suggests its dominance by barakar formation with alternate bands of coarse to medium grained sandstones inter banded with sandstone shales and coal seams in addition to this grey shales and carbonaceous sandy shales with sideritic bands are present 66 villages with an approximate population of 1 9 lakhs solely depend on the mining and associated ancillary operations present within the study area at some location paddy fields with irrigation water sources from surface water of nalas and abandoned mining pits is found 2 2 sample collection preservation and analysis groundwater samples were collected from 31 locations of the study area in three seasons namely summer season april to june 2017 monsoon season july to september 2017 and winter season december to february 2019 samples were collected from tube wells of three representative zones of the study area viz near active mining sites abandoned zones and zones which have not yet been exposed to mining activities designated as control and the collection points were georeferenced with the help of a garmin etrex30 gps before collection groundwater was pumped out 40 80 times to avoid oxidized water of the ascent tube immediately after that physical and chemical parameters ammonium chloride electrical conductivity nitrate oxidation reduction potential ph and temperature were measured with the help of a hand held multiparameter analyzer ysi 6050000 apart from this groundwater was also collected in two sets from each location in polypropylene bottles one after filtration through whatman filter paper 0 45 μ and acidified to ph 2 with hno3 loring and rantala 1992 for metal analysis and the other set for different ion analysis as per apha awaa standard methods samples were stored at 4 c before analysis total hardness and total alkalinity were determined titrimetrically while fluoride was estimated by spadns method sodium and potassium were measured using flame photometer 2 3 metal analysis the concentration of the selected metals as cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb se and zn in filtered groundwater samples were analyzed directly by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry model optima 2100 dv icp oes spectrophotometer of perkinelmer the carrier gas used was argon and temperature of the plasma zone was maintained at 8000 10 000 c readings were compared using multi element mixture merck supra pure for standard curve to ensure analytical quality control blanks multi elemental standards and spiked samples were run periodically in between samples 2 4 statistical analysis statistical calculations of the physical and chemical parameters of the groundwater data like mean standard error pearson s correlation single factor analysis of variance and scatter plots were calculated using microsoft excel 2010 trilinear piper diagram was constructed with the help of aq qa rockware software version 2015 1 14 gibbs diagram to assess the salinity hazard and wilcox diagram to understand the causative factor for the nature of the groundwater was constructed in microsoft excel 2010 2 5 irrigation water quality indices five types of irrigation water quality indices permeability index pi residual sodium carbonate rsc sodium adsorption ratio sar kelly ratio kr and percent sodium were calculated to understand the suitability of the groundwater quality for irrigation the indices were based on concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 ions and ca2 mg2 and na ions in the samples the formula used for the calculation and their classifications have been summarized in table 1 2 6 water quality index and health water quality index to understand the overall quality of the groundwater water quality index wqi was calculated based on eighteen physicochemical parameters the parameters considered were as ca2 cl do ec f fe k ca2 mg2 mn na no3 ph se so4 2 tot alkalinity tds and total hardness the considered parameters were assigned a weight wi 1 5 according to their relative contribution in the overall quality for irrigation and domestic purposes finally relative weight wi was calculated from the assigned weights by the below mentioned formula w i w i w i the quality rating scale qi for each parameter was calculated as q i c i s i x 100 where ci indicated the specific parameter s concentration in mg l and si was the permissible value prescribed by bureau of indian standards bis 2012 sub index si was calculated as a product of the relative weight of the selected parameter and the quality rating scale s i i q i x w i the water quality index wqi was finally calculated as the summation of the sub index of all the parameters w q i s i i based on the wqi values the quality of the water was classified as excellent if the wqi values were less than 50 good water if wqi was between 50 and 100 poor water for wqi values between 101 and 200 very poor water for values 201 300 and water not suitable for drinking if the wqi values were greater than 300 khan and kumar 2013 similarly health water quality index hwqi was calculated employing the same formula following the guidelines of ccme water quality index user s manual 2001 however for hwqi 10 physicochemical parameters namely as cr cd cu f fe mn pb se and no3 were considered and each parameter was assigned weight wi 1 5 as per their relative contribution in the overall water quality 2 7 health risk assessment consumption of metals and metalloids through drinking water poses carcinogenic or non carcinogenic risks usepa 2009 the two main toxicity factors determining the degree of risk are reference dose rfd for noncarcinogen risk and slope factor sf for carcinogen risk calculation usepa 1997 1999 the calculation of the risk was based on average daily dose add and rfd or sf values of as fe mn and se add was dependent on the mean concentration of the metals in groundwater c in mg l water intake or consumption rate ir 2 14 l day for children and 3 49 l day for adults exposure frequency ef 365 days in a year and exposure duration ed 10 years for children and 70 years for adults and the average body weight bw considered as 31 kg for children and 48 56 kg for adults of jharkhand state shome et al 2014 and the average time at of exposure in lifetime as 3650 days for children and 25 550 days for adults bortey sam et al 2015 a d d c x i r x e f x e d b w x a t the non carcinogenic risk hq was calculated as the ratio between add and rfd h q a d d r f d the individual values of the hq were combined to find the total health risk hi if the hq and or hi values exceeded 1 it implied significant non carcinogenic risk the carcinogenic risk was calculated as the product of add and sf and the scale of judgement was based upon guidelines by usepa 1999 as summarized in table 2 2 8 distribution mapping of heavy metal wqi and hwqi distribution the results obtained through water quality analysis were interpolated in geographic information system gis environment from the obtained geographic coordinates of sampling points with the help of gps inverse distance weightage idw technique in arcgis v10 software was employed to show the distribution of heavy metals along with wqi and hwqi spatially and temporally with respect to the three seasons this method predicts the values of the fed parameters even at unrecorded locations based on spatial correlation of variables kumar and krishna 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydro chemical characteristics of the groundwater samples the detailed results of the hydro chemical parameters from 31 locations in three seasons have been presented in table 3 a 3b 3c analysis of variance revealed 14 out of 20 parameters to be significantly varying with respect to sites and 12 out of 20 parameters to be significantly varying with respect to seasons table 4 the groundwater samples in all the three seasons were found to be varying from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline however all samples were within prescribed limits of 7 8 5 suggested by who 2006 only one sample gw 30 was found to be acidic with a ph value of 4 7 0 1 in summer 4 7 0 07 in monsoon and 4 8 0 1 in winter season the location of the sampling point gw 30 was adjacent to the coal washery which might be responsible for the lower ph value of the groundwater tds was fairly high in the samples in all the three seasons it ranged from 178 0 76 to 1705 2 08 mg l in summer 59 1 41 to 768 3 54 mg l in monsoon and 61 0 64 to 791 2 08 in winter season in summer around 70 of the samples showed tds levels above 500 mg l as prescribed in who 2006 and bis 2012 standards generally higher levels of tds in groundwater occurs due to enhanced dissolution and mineralisation during rock water interaction mohanty et al 2018 ec values were also within the range of bis 2012 as well as who 2006 standards the redox condition of the groundwater reflected as the orp values from positive to negative indicated that the groundwater was slightly oxidising to highly reducing environment shallow groundwater generally shows positive orp values and lowering of groundwater in open cast coal mining areas is a common phenomenon total hardness which generally occurs due to accelerated weathering of sedimentary rocks bearing calcium minerals was found to be elevated in the samples of the study area according to mcgowan classification mcgowan 2000 it was found that percentage of samples exhibiting moderately hard values were 30 in summer 20 in monsoon and 30 in winter hard water was observed in 47 of samples in summer 17 in monsoon and 37 in winter while very hard water was recorded in 20 of samples in summer 50 of the samples in monsoon and 23 in winter consumption of very hard water is known to cause kidney problems reddy and prasad 2005 hard water is a characteristic of mining areas due to accelerated un consolidation of rocks because of various mining activities apart from this 04 samples in summer 14 samples in monsoon and 03 samples in winter had their total hardness levels above bis 2012 standards total alkalinity was found to be relatively more than total hardness in all the three seasons indicating dominance of carbonate hardness anwar and aggarwal 2014 total alkalinity ranged within 23 2 52 to 790 4 73 mg l with a mean value of 175 mg l in summer 51 0 71 to 469 0 71 mg l with a mean value of 268 mg l in monsoon and 27 0 71 to 433 2 83 mg l with a mean value of 177 mg l in winter season 10 18 and 12 samples out of 30 were found to be exceeding bis 2012 standard 200 mg l calcium which is an important contributor to hardness of water was found to be present in higher concentrations in monsoon season compared to summer and winter 23 of the samples were having calcium concentration higher than bis 2012 permissible limit of 75 mg l however in the other two seasons all samples were within bis 2012 acceptable limits excess intake of calcium can lead to hypercalcaemic condition in human beings similarly magnesium was also found to be in higher concentrations than bis 2012 permissible limit of 30 mg l in 06 samples in monsoon and 03 samples in winter generally gypsum dissolution in aquifers lead to higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations in groundwater chenini et al 2010 excess mg2 in drinking water can lead to hypermagnesemia and where excess mg2 gets coupled with high sulphate in drinking water it has a laxative effect on human beings other cations and anions were within acceptable limit of who 2006 and bis 2012 standards fluoride concentration ranged from 0 26 0 38 mg l to 0 86 0 46 mg l in summer 0 14 0 04 to 0 92 0 04 mg l in monsoon and 0 14 0 01 to 0 88 0 01 mg l in winter season source of fluoride in groundwater is mainly weathering of granitic and granitic gneiss rocks containing minerals like apatite and biotite mishra and sharma 1975 among the metals and metalloids in the groundwater of the study area only arsenic iron manganese and selenium were found in higher concentrations rest of the metals were present in concentrations below detection limit of icp oes as presented in table 5 arsenic was found in the range of below detection limit bdl to 0 09 mg l with 68 of the samples in summer 55 in monsoon and 29 in winter above who 2006 and bis 2012 permissible limit of 0 01 mg l the highest concentration of arsenic was 0 09 mg l in summer 0 08 mg l in monsoon and 0 06 mg l in winter arsenic has been reported in groundwater of coal mining areas in some previous studies also singh et al 2017 herath et al 2016 arsenic contaminated water used for consumption or irrigation has been reported to be causing various health impacts in human beings like diabetes pulmonary diseases and cardiovascular diseases alam et al 2016 iron was also found to be exceeding the who 2006 and bis 2012 standards of 0 3 mg l in 35 samples in summer and monsoon and 29 in winter fe concentration varied between bdl to 4 90 mg l in summer 4 50 mg l in monsoon and 4 10 mg l in winter excess iron in drinking water has been reported to produce cellular and dna damage and consequent cell damage mutation and malignancy in human beings paponikolaou and pantopoulos 2005 manganese ranged within bdl to 2 90 mg l in summer 2 60 mg l in monsoon and 1 10 mg l in winter 61 of the samples in summer 45 samples in monsoon and 29 samples in winter were above bis 2012 acceptable limit of 0 3 mg l dna damage chromosomal aberration and neurotoxic effects are linked to consumption of mn enriched water gerber et al 2002 selenium is yet another metal which has been found to be in higher concentrations in the groundwater of the study area 87 of the samples in summer and 83 of the samples in monsoon and winter were above the bis 2012 acceptable limit of 0 01 mg l in drinking water concentrations varied between bdl to 0 27 mg l in summer 0 22 mg l in monsoon and 0 18 mg l in winter neurological ailments are commonly linked to high selenium in drinking water saint amour et al 2006 3 2 correlation between the hydro chemical parameters coefficient of correlation between the various parameters have been presented in table 6 a 6b 6c significant positive correlation was observed between ec and tds in summer season 0 98 ec is sometimes referred to as the surrogate measure of tds though all dissolved solids do not correspond to the electrical conductance thirumalini and joseph 2009 however though not linear a direct relation always exists between the tds and ec thirumalini and joseph 2009 significant positive correlation p 0 05 was also observed between ca2 0 86 and mg2 0 80 with total hardness in summer similar observation was noted for ca2 0 94 and mg2 0 85 with total hardness in monsoon these also have obvious reasons because calcium and magnesium are the most common sources of water hardness hco3 also showed strong positive correlation total alkalinity in summer 0 96 and winter 0 99 bicarbonate contributes towards the total alkalinity of any water sample the bicarbonate ions neutralize the h or oh ions of the water samples even so4 2 was found to be bearing significant positive correlation with hco3 0 99 in monsoon and no3 0 73 in winter suggesting same probable sources of dissolution due to rock water interaction oxidation of sulphide minerals like pyrite fes2 along with weathering of gypsum and anhydride generally lead to release of sulphate han et al 2013 singh et al 2011 presence of nitrate in mining areas can be attributed mainly to use of nitro glycerine explosives singh et al 2012 scatter plot constructed between the significantly correlated parameters also showed clear relation between tds vs ec r2 0 96 ca vs th r2 0 74 and hco3 vs total alkalinity r2 0 91 in summer and ca vs th r2 0 89 in monsoon as shown in fig 2 3 3 ionic constituents of the groundwater and their probable controlling mechanism trilinear piper diagram of the data in the study area showed the groundwater to be na hco3 type in summer and winter and ca2 hco3 type in monsoon fig 3 a 3 b 3 c which is due to weathering and dissolution of carbonate and silicates mahato et al 2018 seasonal variation of groundwater type mainly varies due to ion migration and mixing owing to natural or human influences han et al 2014 percolation of water during monsoon season accelerates the rock water interaction and dissolution of calcium carbonates the coal belts of jharkhand are known for their dominance of calcium ions in groundwater panigrahy et al 2015 this also suggests that most of the ions in the groundwater present is natural in origin the dominance of the ions was in the order of na ca2 mg2 k for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 for anions the probable controlling mechanism of the groundwater ionic chemistry was found to be rock dominance when the hydro chemical parameters were plotted in gibb s diagram with two different ratios of tds vs cl cl hco3 and tds vs na k na k ca2 as shown in fig 4 normally the gibb s diagram help us to understand the controlling mechanism of the water chemistry like whether it is rock weathering dominance or evaporation crystallization dominance or atmospheric precipitation dominance therefore in the present study area the water chemistry can be said to be mainly caused by the weathering and dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals along with granitic gneiss minerals samanta et al 2013 3 4 suitability assessment of the groundwater for irrigation several indices were calculated from the values of the hydro chemical characteristics of the groundwater samples and presented in fig 5 mean permeability index pi was 65 17 in summer 47 82 in monsoon and 84 39 in winter suggesting the overall water quality suitable for irrigation with respect to pi only one sample gw 31 22 38 was found to be unsuitable for irrigation in summer 16 samples in monsoon season 74 of the samples belonged to class i water for irrigation water with pi 25 reduces the permeability of the soil after prolonged irrigation which in turn hinders plant growth residual sodium carbonate rsc index value indicated greater fraction of the samples to be in safe limits only one sample was found in marginally safe level in summer while 05 31 and 04 31 samples were found unsuitable in summer and winter respectively this indicated that there is no risk of bicarbonate precipitation of calcium in majority of the sample due to irrigation and hence the water can be used for irrigation the sodicity hazard reflected by the sar ratio also indicated majority of the samples to be in the excellent category with only one sample in monsoon and three samples in winter to be good the mean sar values were 1 68 in summer 2 33 in monsoon and 5 16 in winter the kelly ratio kr however showed that though in summer and monsoon majority of the samples were suitable for irrigation most of the sample in winter are unsuitable the mean kr was 0 81 in summer 1 01 in monsoon and 2 02 in winter this indicates the increment of the ionic constituents in groundwater due to absence of freshwater infiltration of rainwater happening in monsoon sodium is considered hazardous among the ions present in irrigation water since its occurrence with chloride or sulphate turn the water saline and alkaline with carbonate or bicarbonate both affecting the soil and plant growth percent sodium na mean values were 91 in summer 112 in monsoon and 207 in winter all representing unsuitable character of the water samples for irrigation according to the todd classification 1959 the groundwater was found grossly unsuitable for irrigation in monsoon and winter 53 and 76 of the samples were found unsuitable in monsoon and winter respectively more dissolution of sodium from the aquifer rocks in monsoon can be the reason for increase in monsoon which persists in winter where additionally lack of fresh water also accounts for the maximum concentration so the gross results of irrigation indices suggested that though sodicity hazard and permeability problems associated with prolonged irrigation is not prominent in the area sodium percentage is elevated and can cause irrigational problems the ionic constituent data when plotted in us salinity diagram richards 1954 as shown in fig 6 suggested low to medium salinity hazard and low to very high sodium alkali hazard in summer majority of the samples indicated medium salinity hazard c2 and low sodium alkali hazard s1 salinity hazard in the other two seasons existed in low to medium intensity c1 and c2 however the sodium alkali hazard was though low for most of the locations in monsoon few locations had medium and high hazard in winter even very high s4 hazard was observed for some samples and rest in high and low hazard categories similar observations were reported from damodar valley coalfields by singh et al 2009 3 5 water quality indices the overall quality of the groundwater in the study area was attempted to be understood by the water quality index wqi and health water quality index hwqi considerable amount of variation was noticed for the wqi values of the groundwater with respect to season in summer season maximum number of locations indicated water quality unsuitable for drinking 13 31 42 32 of the locations had very poor water and 20 showed poor water fig 7 in monsoon however percentage of water unsuitable for drinking decreased to 23 though 52 locations exhibited very poor water according to the classification of khan and kumar 2013 in winter season the highest percentage of water quality was poor water 52 while 23 was very poor water and only 10 water was unsuitable for drinking in none of the seasons the water quality was found to be excellent highest number of unsuitable water quality locations were found in summer which suggests that influx of rainwater during monsoon causes dilution of the groundwater through recharge and improves the quality of the water in the study area similar influence of monsoon recharge on groundwater quality due to hydro chemical reactions in aquifer has been mentioned by vutla and ravichandran 2011 similarly hwqi calculation considering selected water quality parameters also hinted at majority of the locations to be having water quality from poor to unsuitable for drinking poor quality water was noted in 10 13 and 35 of the water samples in summer monsoon and winter respectively very poor water was observed in 8 10 and 9 locations out of 31 locations in summer monsoon and winter season percentage of locations exhibiting water quality unsuitable for drinking was 58 in summer 42 in monsoon and 20 in winter season these values indicate that the water quality of the area has got serious potential to jeopardize the health of the local population 3 6 health risk index the health risk associated with consumption of groundwater in the study area was expressed as three representative zones viz control area active operational area and abandoned area in this paper to express a summarized picture of the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic hazard quotient usepa 2009 table 7 according to bortey sam et al 2015 none of locations showed any carcinogenic risk for adults or children in any of the three seasons however non carcinogenic risk was significantly high for arsenic and selenium in all the three seasons both for children and adults the mean non carcinogenic risk was highest in operational area 7 28 for adults and 7 00 for children in summer in the other two seasons also though less than summer the arsenic induced non carcinogenic risk for both adults and children was highest in operational area similar trend was observed for selenium induced non carcinogenic risk maximum risk was noted in operational area in summer 2 26 for adults and 2 17 for children hi varied significantly with season as well as representative zones it varied between 3 39 and 9 74 in adults and 3 31 to 9 36 in children which falls under high risk category usepa 1999 maximum risk for adults and children was observed in summer season and active operational area the two main elements responsible for the high hi values in the study area were arsenic and selenium manganese did not pose any risk to the local inhabitants consuming the groundwater in the area under investigation arsenic induced carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk in jharkhand has previously been reported by alam et al 2016 and tirkey et al 2017 elevated concentrations of arsenic and selenium in groundwater and less average body weight of the local inhabitants of jharkhand shome et al 2014 can be held responsible for the high hi in the area especially the active operational areas of the mining region have high health risk potential as evident from the health risk index calculations 4 conclusion present investigation on the groundwater quality have supplied several insights variation in the physical and chemical parameters were significant within sites as well as seasons as evident from analysis of variance majority of the groundwater samples had high tds and was hard to very hard in nature groundwater was found to be na hco3 in summer and winter while ca2 hco3 in monsoon which might be due to enhanced weathering and dissolution of carbonate and silicate rocks characteristic of coal mining areas from gibb s diagram it was evident that the groundwater was due to rock water interactions and among cations ca2 in summer and mg2 was higher in monsoon and winter season above bis 2012 guideline values regarding the suitability of the water for irrigation it was observed that though permeability index residual sodium carbonate and sodium adsorption ratio did not indicate any unsuitable nature kelly ratio and percentage sodium suggested the groundwater to be unsuitable for irrigation mainly in monsoon and winter sodium alkali hazard was also found to be high and very high in monsoon and winter these observations suggested the deterioration of the groundwater quality mainly attributable to enhanced dissolution of aquifer rocks of the study area in monsoon among the metals arsenic and selenium in groundwater was found higher than who 2011 and bis 2012 guideline values and imparting considerably high non carcinogenic hazards to the local people wqi and hwqi also showed poor to unsuitable quality of groundwater in the study area overall analysis of the results indicated the groundwater to be not suitable for drinking purpose unless properly treated even prolonged irrigation with the groundwater hinted at growing salinity as well as sodium alkali hazard acknowledgement the authors are thankful to ugc new delhi for financing this study through the startup grant for newly recruited

12232,bazman watershed and groundwater basin system is one of the major water sources which supplies water to dalgan iranshahr and bazman cities in sistan and baluchestan province of iran due to the importance of groundwater quality in the basin this research work centers on integrated approaches for characterizing hydrochemistry and suitability of groundwater quality based on heavy metal

undergoing anthropogenic activities keywords groundwater hydrogeochemistry heavy metal indices multivariate statistical analyses bazman iran 1 introduction groundwater is a natural resource the evaluation of groundwater using the long term water quality helps in developing new strategies water scarcity has led to wide use of reclaimed water for irrigation worldwide which may threaten groundwater quality groundwater has become the most important source of water supply for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors of many countries including iran rezaei and hassani 2017 iran is located in an arid to semi arid region where the average annual precipitation is less than one third of that of the world and the evaporation rate is extremely high especially in southeast parts of the country baghvand et al 2010 in many parts of the world demand for freshwater such as groundwater has experienced increase due to population explosion urbanization irrigation and domestic activities macdonald et al 2014 sustainable water resources management is a crucial concern in most countries across the globe kalhor et al 2019 due to severely deficient sustainable water resources groundwater is the primary source of water for irrigation as well as human consumption in southeast iran therefore regular monitoring of groundwater resources coupled with hydrogeochemistry study and heavy metals assessment plays a key role in the sustainable management of these resources heavy metal pollution is considered to be one of the most pronounced issues threatening water quality water quality contamination by heavy metal pollution has severe effects on public health heavy metals are well known for their carcinogenic effects and toxicity towards living beings long residence times often exceeding decades and persistent bioavailability especially when dissolved in ionic form in water maanan et al 2015 heavy metals exist in water in colloidal particulate and dissolved phases adepoju bello et al 2009 with their occurrence in water bodies being either of natural e g eroded minerals within sediments leaching of ore deposits and volcanism extruded products or anthropogenic origin i e solid waste disposal industrial or domestic effluents marcovecchio et al 2007 elevated heavy metals concentrations in water leads to environmental problems making it necessary to center studies around potential water contamination from metals sources rezaei et al 2017a the hydrochemical evaluation is very important to assess the groundwater quality in any region in which the groundwater is used for both irrigation and irrigation needs kumar et al 2014 many studies have focused on groundwater quality and pollution sources influenced by anthropogenic and natural processes sue et al 2013 mehdi et al 2014 nasrabadi and abbasi 2014 ying et al 2014 mohamad et al 2016 rezaei et al 2017b a widely used approach in groundwater metals studies is to employ pollution indices pollution indices are useful tools for water quality executives environmental managers and decision makers as measures which combine influences of all parameters into one single number rezaei et al 2017a when studying heavy metals pollutants are generally monitored for assessment of water quality by comparing the recorded concentration with allowable heavy metal concentrations recommended by water standards knowing concentrations of pollutants one can develop different pollution indices several water quality indices and corresponding applications of index methods have been proposed for estimation of water quality edet and offiong 2002 bhuiyan et al 2010 chaturvedi et al 2018 in recent years attention has been vastly given to evaluation of heavy metal pollution in groundwater using

pollution status and probable sources of pollutants in the bazman region 2 study area 2 1 location topography and climate the area of study is located in northwestern of sistan and baluchestan province in southeast iran this region is located in the makran volcanic arc part and is part of the jazmurian depression basin that lies between longitudes 59 10 00 to 60 22 00 e and latitudes 27 20 00 to 27 50 00 n covering an estimated area of about 5 500 km2 belongs to bazman iranshahr and dalgan cities fig 1 the altitude of the area varies from 350 to 1000 m above sea level the topography is the mixture of rugged mountains with flat plains the study area has a hot arid climate and the temperature are highest in july 45 c and lowest in january 10 c with an annual average of 28 c the climate of the study area is considered to be semi arid to arid with the mean annual precipitation is about 60 95 mm in the region groundwater is an important water resource for drinking and agriculture mainly palm trees uses in the study area it is noticeable that in recent years 2005 2015 low precipitation and overexploitation of groundwater resources have caused an extensive groundwater level decline in this region in 2017 due to heavy rainfall in the study area the jazmurian basin has been dewatered to some extent 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area is located within the boundaries of the district in sistan and baluchestan province southeastern iran which is structurally part of the urumieh dokhtar zone and at the southeastern extremity of the urumieh dokhtar volcano plutonic belt north of the makran accretionary prisms west of the sistan suture zone flysch zone and south of the lut block where the iranian continental collision between the afro arabian continent and the iranian microcontinent during closure of the tethys ocean in the late cretaceous resulted in the development of a volcanic arc in se iran stocklin 1977 berberian and king 1981 and continuing through to the miocene arc stage shahabpour 2005 to quaternary volcanism farhoudi and karig 1977 saadat and stern 2011 fig 2 a main magmatic belts in south and east of iran and location of study area are shown in fig 2b detailed geological information of the study area will be investigated in this section the pyroclastic rocks and lava with rhyodacitic to basaltic composition and calc alkaline affinities erupted from the central and lateral craters of this volcano during the quaternary period geology of the study area consists of carboniferous shale sandstone and limestone and permian siltstone shale sandstone limestone and dolomite that were intruded by the bazman granitoids fig 3 these granitoids include various phases of granite granodiorite quartz monzodiorite monzodiorite diorite and gabbro ghodsi et al 2016a the oldest and youngest sediments in the study area are related precambrian and quaternary age respectively in the western part of the region igneous rocks are expanding the middle part of the study area is formed of bazman intrusive igneous rocks sedimentary and carbonate rocks belong on carboniferous and permian age the southern part is formed by fan deposits and consists of plain and smooth lands the study area is a tectonized and crushed region which due to the intensity of the compression is created numerous fractures and faults the fractured and weathered nature of the bedrock together with the overlying pyroclastic and basaltic materials gives a high porosity and permeability that favor the recharge of the aquifers rezaei et al 2017a the structure of the study area has affected a series of faults and fractures with the trend of the ne sw which is due to mechanism of two major fault nosrat abad fault in the eastern part of the region and the kahurak fault in the western part of the region in the study area the bazman granitoid complex is cut by two relatively young fault systems the first consists of en echelon dextral strike slip faults with a general n30 e trend distributed in the eastern part of the complex whereas another minor system appears as sinistral strike slip faulting with a general n45 w trend in the western part of the complex ghodsi et al 2016a geomorphology plays an important role in the formation of groundwater the most important aquifer amongst the plain sediments is found among the mountains and the depression these sediments bahada have high permeability the jazmurian basin is located in the southeast of iran and near the study area the stretch of this depression is east west so that its northern boundary is limited by a series of high mountains called jebal barez and the bazman volcanic mountain makran mountains are located in the southern part of the basin in the center of the basin is hamoon jazmourian which represents a seasonal lake the water of this playa evaporates during dry years and creates flat clay in the study area most springs have been created in alluvial parts numerous thermal and cold springs are located in active volcanic regions all over the world as a result of eruptive events as well as obvious manifestations of long lived hydrothermal systems shakeri et al 2008 extensive areas of iran are made up of tertiary volcanic rock in a long belt from turkey to pakistan according to the geological information geothermal resources are available throughout iran in a variety of geothermal form and settings with thermal springs in the study area there are thermal springs containing iron and sulfur most of the mineral springs of the study area have a high water flow which makes proper construction around the springs valid for better usage for drinking bathing and irrigation purposes bazman has been considered a potential site for development of geothermal energy with a surface area of 8 356 km2 most of the basin discharge zones has delimited in recent alluvial sediments the study area water resources include qanats spring and wells qanats and wells are the primary sources of water supply in the study area 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analytical procedures in order to achieve the research objectives 67 water samples from different locations 3 qanats 14 springs and 50 wells were collected during the period of june to july 2015 in the study area selected sites are all used for agriculture drinking and domestic purposes map of sampling locations is demonstrated in fig 4 that was prepared by using arcgis software the procedure of collecting samples included 10 min of pumping drying cleaning and storing samples in 100 ml polyethylene bottles the samples were then vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size membrane and acidified to a final concentration of about 1 nitric acid as part of heavy metals concentration measurement the collected samples were labeled sealed and transported to the laboratory and preserved in the refrigerator at a temperature of about 4 c until analysis time immediately after sampling physicochemical parameters including temperature ph eh ec do concentration and tds were measured in the field using a multi parameter portable meter hach germany for each sampling station the ph electrode was calibrated using two buffers merck germany that bracketed the measured ph and that was thermally equilibrated with the water sample the ph meter was calibrated daily at ph 4 and 9 whereas the conductivity meter was calibrated daily using 450 μs cm and 1000 μs cm standards calcium was determined titrimetrically using standard edta water samples collected in the field were analyzed in laboratory for major cations k na ca2 and mg2 and major anions cl hco3 co3 2 no3 and so4 2 using the standard methods within 48 h after sampling survey magnesium was calculated on the basis of the difference in concentration between total hardness and ca2 chloride cl was determined by the standard agno3 titration method mohr method carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 were determined by titration with hcl sodium na and potassium k were measured by flame photometry and sulfate so4 2 by spectrophotometric turbidimetry rowell 1994 tds was measured by evaporating a pre filtered sample to dryness also for samples taken from different sampling sites the concentration of heavy metals were estimated by inductively coupled plasma and mass spectrometry icp ms method in the filtered and acidified water samples at the lab west laboratories australia the validity of the analytical ion measurement was determined by calculating the ion balance errors with the analytical precision and reproducibility measurement was less than 10 cations anions cations anions 100 3 2 indexing approach the information of the heavy metal contamination is very useful for utilization of groundwater resources that may also help in future water resource planning surface and groundwater samples suitability for agriculture and drinking purposes were determined by evaluating the heavy metal concentrations in terms of pollution evaluation indices namely heavy metal pollution index hpi heavy metal evaluation index hei degree of contamination cd and the modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi are applied as quantitative measures of water quality in the study area hpi is based on spatial extension of heavy metals and can be helpful in identifying and quantifying trends in groundwater quality mishra et al 2017 hpi in water depends on two factors first number of heavy metal ions and second their concentrations vis à vis permissible levels as per water quality standards chaturvedi et al 2018 as a semi empirical index is there are many analytical formulations proposed for hpi mohan et al 1996 prasad and jaiprakash 1999 prasad and bose 2001 edet and offiong 2002 two of the mostly used indexing techniques with reference to heavy metal ions in groundwater are the one proposed by mohan and coworkers based on highest desirable and maximum permissible concentration mohan et al 1996 prasad and jaiprakash 1999 prasad and mondal 2008 prasad et al 2014 herojeet et al 2015 mahato et al 2017 rezaei et al 2017b singh et al 2017 and also the one that uses maximum allowable concentration mac edet and offiong 2002 venkatramanan et al 2014 singaraja et al 2015 rezaei et al 2017b singh et al 2017 another index is the hei that helps in quickly evaluating the overall quality of water with respect to heavy metal content prasanna et al 2012 m hpi is a new robust and flexible index that has been proposed for indexing heavy metal pollution in groundwater based on highest desirable and maximum permissible concentrations chaturvedi et al 2018 according to this new indexing system heavy metal pollution status of any water sample may be expressed by a pair of positive index pi and negative index ni 3 2 1 heavy metal pollution index hpi hpi is defined as a quantity reflecting the composite influence of different dissolved heavy metals and represent the total quality of water with respect to heavy metals concentration sirajudeen et al 2014 hpi is a powerful technique for the assessment of the composite influence of heavy metals concentration on overall water quality through assigning a rating or weighting wi for each selected parameter the rating is a value between 0 and 1 which reflects the relative importance of an individual parameter and can be defined as inversely proportional to the recommended standard si for each parameter mohan et al 1996 prasad and mondal 2008 prasanna et al 2012 different hpi ranges have been assigned to classify water quality as poor good very good and excellent the highest tolerance value for drinking water si refers to the maximum allowable concentration in drinking water in the absence of any alternate water source the desirable maximum value ii indicates the standard limits for the same parameters in drinking water for this study the concentration limits i e maximum admissible concentration of drinking water mac highest permissive value for drinking water si and the maximum desirable value ii for each heavy metal were retrieved from the who standards who 2011 the method consists of the following the first step involves computing wi of each parameter using equation 1 wi is the unit weightage factor which is inversely proportional to the maximum allowable concentration 1 w i 1 m a c w i k m a c with k being the constant of proportionality which is considered as 1 for all the parameters mohan et al 1996 prasad et al 2014 wi is the relative weightage factor and is computed for each parameter using equation 2 2 w i w i i 1 n w i in the second step an individual quality rating qi is calculated for each parameter using equation 3 3 q i i 1 n m i i i s i m i 100 where mi is the measured concentration of heavy metal of the ith parameter in the water sample ii is highest desirable concentration of the ith parameter the ideal value of the parameter and si is the maximum permissible concentration of the ith parameter standard value of the parameter third summing these sub indices to compute the overall index the hpi model is computed from equation below 4 h p i i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where wi is the unit weight for the ith parameter qi is the sub index of the ith parameter and n is the number of the considered parameters it is considerable that the critical value of hpi for drinking water is 100 critical pollution index 3 2 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei hei method is consistent with the hpi which gives an overall quality of the water regarding heavy metal content edet and offiong 2002 prasanna et al 2012 this indicator is widely used in the determination of groundwater quality the hei is computed as follows 5 h e i i 1 n m i s i where mi indicates the monitored value of the ith parameter and si represents maximum admissible concentration mac of the ith parameter if the heavy metal concentration is higher than si value then the water quality is bad 3 2 3 degree of contamination cd in this index the water quality is assessed by the computation of the degree of contamination and calculated separately for each sample of water as a sum of the contamination factors of individual components exceeding the maximum admissible concentration mac the cd summarizes the combined effects of several water quality parameters considered harmful to domestic water backman et al 1997 prasanna et al 2012 according to backman et al 1997 and edet and offiong 2002 cd may be divided into three classifications as low cd 1 medium cd 1 3 and high cd 3 thus the value of contamination index exceeds 3 suggesting that water is highly polluted in this research the components considered including as ba cr cu fe mn ni se and zn the cd is calculated as follows 6 c d i 1 n c f i where 7 c f i m i s i 1 cfi mi and si represent the contamination factor the monitored value and the mac of the ith component respectively elements and ionic species with monitored values below the maximum admissible concentration value are not taken into consideration 3 2 4 modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi chaturvedi et al 2018 has proposed a modified formulation for heavy metal pollution index m hpi this index is flexible enough to accommodate any water quality standard and is able to diagnose obviously if the water is drinkable this new approach is based on two basic aspects firstly the number of heavy metals to be considered for computing the m hpi should be decided a priori any comparison between two indices two samples is meaningful only when the same set of parameters is considered for calculating the indices secondly this formulation for calculating metal pollution index is applicable to all water quality standards chaturvedi et al 2018 based on the first feature assuming the water sample contains n number of heavy metal ions 8 m h p i i 1 n m h p i i where m hpi is the modified heavy metal pollution index corresponding to the ith heavy metal ion and may be calculated as 9 m h p i i w i q i where wi is the relative weightage factor defined as 10 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the unit weightage factor inversely proportional to the highest desirable concentration ii and defined as 11 w i 1 i i the proportionality constant in this case is consistently taken as 1 for all the parameters sub index qi for the ith parameter is defined as 12 q i m i i i i i mi is the monitored concentration of the ith parameter as defined earlier and ii is usually the maximum allowable concentration based on who standard it should be noted that the numerator in eq 12 is not a modulus as was in eq 3 thus if mi ii qi will be negative and indicating the sample just passes the quality test for particular parameter qi will be zero and when mi ii qi will be positive two factors should be considered in calculation of m hpi each water sample is represented by a pair of indices a positive index pi and a negative index ni pi reflects the contribution of heavy metal ions to water quality that are above the highest desirable limit and ni the contribution of metal ions that are below the limit chaturvedi et al 2018 negative index may vary from 0 to 1 while positive index varies from 0 to any positive value for mi ii the pi for the corresponding parameter is zero and ni is a negative number while for mi ii pi is positive and ni is zero thus in a water sample if there are n number of parameters of which n1have mi ii and n2 have mi ii then the m hpi for that water sample will be represented by a pair of indices pi and ni such that 13 n i i 1 n 1 m h p i i and 14 p i i 1 n 2 m h p i i n1 and n2 are to be treated as independent and mutually exclusive subsets such that n1 n2 n m hpi is inversely correlated with water quality higher the index poorer the water quality chaturvedi et al 2018 if mi 0 i e below detection limit dl for all the heavy metal ions in the water sample the sum of negative indices should be 1 implying considered heavy metal ions are all absent in the water sample the pi for that sample will however be 0 water samples having pi 0 are suitable for drinking ni in such cases may vary from 0 to 1 but not less than 1 in the absence of alternate source pi ul may also be accepted for drinking purpose ni in such cases may vary from 0 to 1 but not less than 1 water samples having pi ul are unsuitable for drinking regardless of ni value between two samples having close pi ni decides the relative quality lower the ni better the quality thus the water quality scale using modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi pi and ni is categorized based on table 1 the m hpi indexing system is based on only highest desirable concentration ii and does not depend on the maximum permissible concentration si 3 2 5 statistical analyses multivariate statistical techniques have been extensively used to facilitate the solution of environmental problems and suggest evidence for the understanding of some natural and anthropogenic processes correlation analysis ca and principal component analysis pca have been broadly used as unbiased methods in the analysis of water quality data for drawing meaningful information singh et al 2005 the correlation matrix of heavy metals concentrations and physicochemical parameters was constructed to find relations among parameters pca is one of the best multivariate statistical techniques for extracting linear relationships among a set of variables simeonov et al 2003 multivariate statistical analyses are applied to identify the relationship between heavy metals and physicochemical parameters in the study area in fact application of multivariate statistical techniques facilitates interpretation of complex data matrices for a better understanding a variety of environmental factors rezaei and hassani 2017 ca and pca with varimax normalized rotation vnr kaiser 1958 are performed using the commercial statistical software package spss version 21 0 for windows spss inc 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 general characteristics of water quality descriptive statistics of physicochemical parameters and heavy metals concentration of groundwater samples consisting of minimum maximum and mean values of each parameter along with standard deviation are listed in table 2 which were compared with the drinking water standards recommended by who who 2011 understanding the main factors controlling groundwater chemistry is very important for sustainable groundwater development in this research work the statistical results of physiochemical parameters of groundwater samples were compared with the standard guideline values recommended by the world health organization who for drinking and public health purposes who 2011 the ph values in the study area ranges of 6 97 8 95 with a mean value of 7 80 and standard deviation of 0 37 indicating a neutral to slightly alkaline water environment nearly 4 i e 3 samples of the total samples show ph values above who standard who 2011 the possible reason of higher ph in this area is likely to be controlled by hco3 co3 2 these ions are formed during hydrothermal process due to the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide sappa et al 2014 the eh can be used with other redox indicators to ascertain in a qualitative sense the relative redox conditions of an aquifer smedley and edmunds 2002 eh values vary from 280 2 303 mv the relationship between eh and ph indicates that eh decreases with increasing ph this relationship shows the progressive reduction of fe2 with deeper circulation associated with ph increase water temperature directly affects the availability of dissolved oxygen in the water dalai et al 2002 temperature values of groundwater samples vary from 13 1 c to 42 9 c with a mean of 28 9 c the highest temperature relates to the thermal spring near the bazman city the high temperature in thermal springs easily enhances the evaporation rate and precipitation of salt into the water bodies nordstrom 2011 tds values vary between 258 and 5790 mg l with a mean value of 2035 5 mg l groundwater with high tds is not suitable for both drinking and irrigation purposes rezaei and hassani 2017 for drinking purpose the maximum allowable tds guideline value according to who standard is 1000 mg l who 2011 classification of groundwater quality based on tds content according to who standard are shown in table 3 and indicated that 86 57 samples of the samples exceeds the desirable limit given by who the majority of groundwater samples in the study area are in range slightly saline to moderately saline water type in the study area the high tds at some sampling stations can be due to the percolation of channel water containing solids and agricultural wastes also the country rocks are the most important sources of increasing dissolved solids in the groundwater selvakumar et al 2017 ec values vary from 532 to 10580 μs cm with an average of 3906 μs cm ec is a good indicator of total salinity or total amount of dissolved solids in water and helps to determine the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation based on who standard maximum allowable limit for ec in drinking water is 1500 μs cm who 2011 analysis of the results show that the ec values of 90 i e 60 samples of the samples are above the standard value fig 6 in groundwater samples of the study area ec values higher than 1500 μs cm are saline and or polluted waters the high ec in the study area due to high hydrothermal activities it is considerable that ec and tds are the most important parameters to demarcate salinity hazard and suitability of water for irrigation purposes do values of all collected samples vary from o 15 to 11 2 mg l with a mean value of 6 30 mg l which indicates that all the studied samples have moderate concentration of dissolved oxygen eight ions have been studied in groundwater samples of bazman the ionic compositions of the samples are characterized by na so4 2 cl ca2 hco3 mg2 k no3 facies it is well documented that within a water sample the number of positively charged ions in solution cations should balance the number of negatively charged ion anions the ionic balance calculation should encompass all anions and all cations with the sample when an ionic balance calculation does not give results between 10 other checks are possible to identify what might be responsible for the disparity freeze and cherry 1979 in this study the cation anion balance was analyzed by comparing the sum of cation milliequivalents per million to the sum of anion milliequivalents per million while values are inside the 10 range in this section the heavy metals behavior has been investigated mean metal concentrations in groundwater followed a descending order ba as cr ni se zn mn cu fe with all concentrations falling below mac values from table 2 the concentration of as 1 9 74 60 μg l in 31 samples 46 is higher than the mac of 10 μg l and four samples 5 show se in excess of 10 μg l the high as values are related to volcanic and carbonate rocks 4 2 hydrogeochemical facies hydrochemical facies is a term used to describe the bodies of groundwater in an aquifer that different their geochemical characteristics yang et al 2016 to understand the hydrochemical evolution and determination of the dominant groundwater types in the study area major cations and anions in meq l were plotted on a trilinear piper diagram which indicates the origin of groundwater and the source of their dissolved salts and explains the different processes affecting groundwater characters piper 1944 according to the plotting the groundwater samples on the piper s diagram the dominant water types are in the order of na cl na hco3 ca cl the results show that the vast majority of groundwater samples are na cl dominant fluids based on the evolution of water types from the recharge zone to discharge zone bicarbonate sulfate chloride this evolution can be observed in water samples in the study area the discharge zone rezaei and hassani 2017 water evaporitic minerals interaction can also be other reasons for the presence of chloride type in this area todd and mays 2005 merkel and planer friedrich 2008 ca cl water type indicates mineral dissolution an interaction between rock and water with sufficient recharge of fresh water mondal and singh 2012 srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 fig 5 shows the general distribution of water types in the groundwater of the study area the mixing of the jazmurian basin water with the groundwater triggers many chemical reactions such as ion exchange redox reactions sorption dissolution and precipitation nagaraju et al 2016 4 3 pollution evaluation indices pollution indices for trace elements were identified significantly by means of heavy metal evaluation index different indices represent different classes of risk levels the water quality of the study area was analyzed using several pollution evaluation indices to calculate the hpi mac values for heavy metals were used based on who standard concentration of ba cr cu fe mn and zn were below the mac for drinking water while concentrations of as 5 samples ni 7 samples and se 4 samples exceed the mac the unit weight wi for various water quality parameters is assumed to be inversely proportional to the maximum admissible concentration mac for the corresponding parameter table 4 in order to calculate the hpi of the groundwater the mean concentration value of the selected metals as ba cr cu fe mn ni se and zn have been taken into account hpi for 67 samples in the study area was calculated with mean concentration values of all heavy metals hpi values is ranging from 31 7 to 56 35 while the mean hpi for all of the samples is calculated as 9 17 0 2176 42 14 which is far below the critical pollution index value of 100 table 5 spatial distribution of hpi values is shown in fig 6 in all of the cases the mean hpi is well below the permissible index value of 100 proposed for drinking water by mohan et al 1996 overall the results of calculation showed that the hpi values for all of the samples were below the critical limit of 100 in order to apply these hpi indices the scales were slightly modified using multiples of the median as a criterion for this purpose the values are divided into three classes to demarcate different levels of contamination as low medium and high table 6 the hpi values were computed for each sampling station table 7 using scaled hpi values 34 of samples were classified as having low pollution levels low risk level and 66 with medium pollution levels medium risk level hei was used for easy interpretation of the pollution index edet and offiong 2002 the hei values ranged from 0 22 to 3 65 with a mean value of 1 2 the hei values were computed for each sampling station table 7 the results of computation showed that the 60 0 of the samples fell below the respective mean values of hei based on the approach of edet and offiong 2002 the calculated hei values were classified in terms of pollution levels as low medium and high different hei criteria values have been developed for the samples guided by their respective mean values and the different levels of contamination are demarcated by a multiple of the mean values therefore the proposed hei criteria for the samples are as follows low hei 1 medium hei 1 2 and high 2 based on scaled hei values 52 of samples were classified as having low pollution levels low risk level 31 with medium pollution levels medium risk level and 17 with high pollution levels high risk level fig 7 the degree of contamination cd was used as a reference of estimating the extent of metal pollution the range and mean values of cd of the groundwater samples are 5 35 8 78 and 7 77 respectively the cd values were computed for each sampling station table 7 the study of cd values reveals that the heavy metals concentration of groundwater samples is low to medium level of pollution fig 8 the variation trends of c d and hei at different sampling points reveals similar deviation for groundwater samples the new index of heavy metals pollution is applied for the calculation of m hpi pi and ni for 67 groundwater samples in the study area m hpi values were computed for each sampling station table 7 as per the outlined criteria any water sample having pi 0 is suitable for drinking chaturvedi et al 2018 in the study area pi of about 95 of the water sample was in between 0 and 0 1 that indicating very good quality also many of the samples have a low ni in the range of 0 05 to 0 2 that represents very good quality with reference to heavy metal ions the results of pollution evaluation indices are presented in table 7 existing contamination levels for hpi hei cd and m hpi pi and ni have also been classified according to obtained results in tables 1 and 6 the best water samples as per hpi hei and cd were 55 15 and 50 numbers respectively the best water samples for m hpi index was 45 and 55 because having pi 0 and low ni similar studies on groundwater quality have not been carried out in iran according to our knowledge thus it provides an important tool to estimate impacts of agricultural practices as well as to drive public health policy in the bazman region 4 4 multivariate statistics analyses statistical tools including pca and ca are used to resolve data sets interpretation correlation analysis in groundwater studies a preliminary descriptive technique was employed on the groundwater from bazman region in order to measure the degree of association observed between any analyzed chemical variables most of the parameters were found to bear statistically significant correlation with each other signifying close associations pearson correlation r 0 05 is applied to investigate the inter elemental correlation for all selected elements derived from the linear relationship of two variables rezaei et al 2019 the correlation matrix of 14 parameters for the 67 samples in the study area is indicated in table 8 the highest correlation occurs between ec and tds r 0 99 because all of the dissolved components cause increased ionic concentration leading to an increased ec concentration the high correlation between ec and tds reflects the interdependency of these measurements as general measures of the amount of total dissolved solutes the correlation studies show that copper has significant positive correlation with nickel r 0 71 this correlation among individual heavy metals indicate common sources mutual dependences and similar behavior in the transportation processes in the research area also the correlation between ec and tds with eh and ph with ni is negative r 0 62 and r 0 63 respectively and indicate one variable increases as the other decreases and vice versa the correlation studies show that the significant correlation between ec and tds with ni r 0 72 and r 0 71 respectively and between ec and tds with se r 0 75 and r 0 74 respectively pca was used to identify the potential sources of trace metals and to verify and quantify interrelationships among the real variables in a data set in this study pca was executed for 14 variables from 67 sampling stations the rotated factor pattern after extraction using varimax rotation and the cumulative percentage and percentage of variance explained by each factor is given in table 9 according to the obtained results of the pca four principal components were extracted for groundwater quality data sets based on eigenvalues more than 1 which represented 83 49 of the total variance which is quite good and can be relied upon to identify the main sources of variation in the hydrochemistry pca was classified into three categories thus value 0 75 indicate strong loadings 0 50 0 75 have moderate loading and 0 30 0 50 indicate weak loadings liu et al 2003 pc1 explained 32 81 of the total variance indicates that ec and tds have high positive loading and reflecting the physicochemical characteristics of water quality ni and se show strong positive loadings while cu and zn represent moderate positive loadings some metals do not occur normally in groundwater and so their origin is from external sources and not geogenic sources fertilizers used for agriculture are a well known source for copper and zinc also it can be attributed to the excessive use of zinc sulfate which is an important constituent of fertilizers used in the region the selenium concentration in groundwater from the study area is controlled by the composition of the aquifer materials se is potentially mobile and soluble in water under aerobic high oxygen concentration and alkaline high ph conditions and could lead to environmental contamination in this study some sampling stations contain high levels of se the second component pc2 with 23 55 of the total variance contains high positive loadings for mn and negative loadings for eh the main sources of mn are leaching from local bedrock and mn might be originated from gigantic sources which could be released by chemical weathering of parent materials the solubility of mn minerals in water depends directly on anions and oxidation reduction potential particularly at near neutral ph lorite herrera et al 2008 pc3 was loaded fe as and temperature and accounted for 16 40 of the total variance the presence of fe in pc3 revealed the process of rock water interaction as in groundwater and aquifer is mobilized e g hydraulic fracturing murcott 2012 also it reflects that the source of as in the groundwater is anthropogenic activities in the study area arsenical pesticides for protecting crops pc4 was responsible for 10 70 of the total variance positively considered cr and inversely to ba dissolved ba is controlled by barite solubility and concentrations may exceed the drinking water mac of 1 mg l who 2011 barium values less than 0 5 1 mg lit would likely represent water that is not impacted by saline water betcher et al 2003 generally agricultural fertilizer and stagnant water may be attributed the main sources of this groundwater hydrochemical evolution in the study area it can be said that common rock water interaction and anthropogenic activities are responsible for the ionic alteration of groundwater in the study area 5 conclusions in this study the analytical results of physiochemical parameters of groundwater showed that the concentrations of heavy metals in water samples are within the permissible who limits in drinking water two metals of them as and se were detected in some sampling stations higher than permissible limits according to the dominant cations and anions three types of water could be identified in the water samples na cl na hco3 and ca cl according to pollution evaluation indices classification hpi cd hei and m hpi showed that majority samples reveals low to medium level of pollution in the study area however the values of these four indices in totally below the critical values but severe precautions consideration such as manage the use of agricultural inputs prevention of use of wastewater and sewage sludge in agriculture control of overuse of organic fertilizers are recommended in this area from the integrated pollution indices study it is assessed that 55 water samples are safe to drink with respect to metal ion concentration the results of ca and pca analyses suggested that most of the variations are explained by the anthropogenic pollutants and the set of natural soluble contents geogenic processes rock weathering and ion exchange are the only mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry in deep aquifers human activities such as wastewater effluents irrigation fertilizer application and groundwater abstraction have been found to have a great influence on groundwater quality pollution due to heavy metals is significant in these areas and it is important to continuously monitor the water quality to prevent further deterioration of water resources data from this study will not only contribute to an improved understanding of the factors controlling groundwater hydrochemistry and quality but also it provides information about potential uses of these water sources thus contributing to the management of this resource this information is important

undergoing anthropogenic activities keywords groundwater hydrogeochemistry heavy metal indices multivariate statistical analyses bazman iran 1 introduction groundwater is a natural resource the evaluation of groundwater using the long term water quality helps in developing new strategies water scarcity has led to wide use of reclaimed water for irrigation worldwide which may threaten groundwater quality groundwater has become the most important source of water supply for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors of many countries including iran rezaei and hassani 2017 iran is located in an arid to semi arid region where the average annual precipitation is less than one third of that of the world and the evaporation rate is extremely high especially in southeast parts of the country baghvand et al 2010 in many parts of the world demand for freshwater such as groundwater has experienced increase due to population explosion urbanization irrigation and domestic activities macdonald et al 2014 sustainable water resources management is a crucial concern in most countries across the globe kalhor et al 2019 due to severely deficient sustainable water resources groundwater is the primary source of water for irrigation as well as human consumption in southeast iran therefore regular monitoring of groundwater resources coupled with hydrogeochemistry study and heavy metals assessment plays a key role in the sustainable management of these resources heavy metal pollution is considered to be one of the most pronounced issues threatening water quality water quality contamination by heavy metal pollution has severe effects on public health heavy metals are well known for their carcinogenic effects and toxicity towards living beings long residence times often exceeding decades and persistent bioavailability especially when dissolved in ionic form in water maanan et al 2015 heavy metals exist in water in colloidal particulate and dissolved phases adepoju bello et al 2009 with their occurrence in water bodies being either of natural e g eroded minerals within sediments leaching of ore deposits and volcanism extruded products or anthropogenic origin i e solid waste disposal industrial or domestic effluents marcovecchio et al 2007 elevated heavy metals concentrations in water leads to environmental problems making it necessary to center studies around potential water contamination from metals sources rezaei et al 2017a the hydrochemical evaluation is very important to assess the groundwater quality in any region in which the groundwater is used for both irrigation and irrigation needs kumar et al 2014 many studies have focused on groundwater quality and pollution sources influenced by anthropogenic and natural processes sue et al 2013 mehdi et al 2014 nasrabadi and abbasi 2014 ying et al 2014 mohamad et al 2016 rezaei et al 2017b a widely used approach in groundwater metals studies is to employ pollution indices pollution indices are useful tools for water quality executives environmental managers and decision makers as measures which combine influences of all parameters into one single number rezaei et al 2017a when studying heavy metals pollutants are generally monitored for assessment of water quality by comparing the recorded concentration with allowable heavy metal concentrations recommended by water standards knowing concentrations of pollutants one can develop different pollution indices several water quality indices and corresponding applications of index methods have been proposed for estimation of water quality edet and offiong 2002 bhuiyan et al 2010 chaturvedi et al 2018 in recent years attention has been vastly given to evaluation of heavy metal pollution in groundwater using

pollution status and probable sources of pollutants in the bazman region 2 study area 2 1 location topography and climate the area of study is located in northwestern of sistan and baluchestan province in southeast iran this region is located in the makran volcanic arc part and is part of the jazmurian depression basin that lies between longitudes 59 10 00 to 60 22 00 e and latitudes 27 20 00 to 27 50 00 n covering an estimated area of about 5 500 km2 belongs to bazman iranshahr and dalgan cities fig 1 the altitude of the area varies from 350 to 1000 m above sea level the topography is the mixture of rugged mountains with flat plains the study area has a hot arid climate and the temperature are highest in july 45 c and lowest in january 10 c with an annual average of 28 c the climate of the study area is considered to be semi arid to arid with the mean annual precipitation is about 60 95 mm in the region groundwater is an important water resource for drinking and agriculture mainly palm trees uses in the study area it is noticeable that in recent years 2005 2015 low precipitation and overexploitation of groundwater resources have caused an extensive groundwater level decline in this region in 2017 due to heavy rainfall in the study area the jazmurian basin has been dewatered to some extent 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area is located within the boundaries of the district in sistan and baluchestan province southeastern iran which is structurally part of the urumieh dokhtar zone and at the southeastern extremity of the urumieh dokhtar volcano plutonic belt north of the makran accretionary prisms west of the sistan suture zone flysch zone and south of the lut block where the iranian continental collision between the afro arabian continent and the iranian microcontinent during closure of the tethys ocean in the late cretaceous resulted in the development of a volcanic arc in se iran stocklin 1977 berberian and king 1981 and continuing through to the miocene arc stage shahabpour 2005 to quaternary volcanism farhoudi and karig 1977 saadat and stern 2011 fig 2 a main magmatic belts in south and east of iran and location of study area are shown in fig 2b detailed geological information of the study area will be investigated in this section the pyroclastic rocks and lava with rhyodacitic to basaltic composition and calc alkaline affinities erupted from the central and lateral craters of this volcano during the quaternary period geology of the study area consists of carboniferous shale sandstone and limestone and permian siltstone shale sandstone limestone and dolomite that were intruded by the bazman granitoids fig 3 these granitoids include various phases of granite granodiorite quartz monzodiorite monzodiorite diorite and gabbro ghodsi et al 2016a the oldest and youngest sediments in the study area are related precambrian and quaternary age respectively in the western part of the region igneous rocks are expanding the middle part of the study area is formed of bazman intrusive igneous rocks sedimentary and carbonate rocks belong on carboniferous and permian age the southern part is formed by fan deposits and consists of plain and smooth lands the study area is a tectonized and crushed region which due to the intensity of the compression is created numerous fractures and faults the fractured and weathered nature of the bedrock together with the overlying pyroclastic and basaltic materials gives a high porosity and permeability that favor the recharge of the aquifers rezaei et al 2017a the structure of the study area has affected a series of faults and fractures with the trend of the ne sw which is due to mechanism of two major fault nosrat abad fault in the eastern part of the region and the kahurak fault in the western part of the region in the study area the bazman granitoid complex is cut by two relatively young fault systems the first consists of en echelon dextral strike slip faults with a general n30 e trend distributed in the eastern part of the complex whereas another minor system appears as sinistral strike slip faulting with a general n45 w trend in the western part of the complex ghodsi et al 2016a geomorphology plays an important role in the formation of groundwater the most important aquifer amongst the plain sediments is found among the mountains and the depression these sediments bahada have high permeability the jazmurian basin is located in the southeast of iran and near the study area the stretch of this depression is east west so that its northern boundary is limited by a series of high mountains called jebal barez and the bazman volcanic mountain makran mountains are located in the southern part of the basin in the center of the basin is hamoon jazmourian which represents a seasonal lake the water of this playa evaporates during dry years and creates flat clay in the study area most springs have been created in alluvial parts numerous thermal and cold springs are located in active volcanic regions all over the world as a result of eruptive events as well as obvious manifestations of long lived hydrothermal systems shakeri et al 2008 extensive areas of iran are made up of tertiary volcanic rock in a long belt from turkey to pakistan according to the geological information geothermal resources are available throughout iran in a variety of geothermal form and settings with thermal springs in the study area there are thermal springs containing iron and sulfur most of the mineral springs of the study area have a high water flow which makes proper construction around the springs valid for better usage for drinking bathing and irrigation purposes bazman has been considered a potential site for development of geothermal energy with a surface area of 8 356 km2 most of the basin discharge zones has delimited in recent alluvial sediments the study area water resources include qanats spring and wells qanats and wells are the primary sources of water supply in the study area 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analytical procedures in order to achieve the research objectives 67 water samples from different locations 3 qanats 14 springs and 50 wells were collected during the period of june to july 2015 in the study area selected sites are all used for agriculture drinking and domestic purposes map of sampling locations is demonstrated in fig 4 that was prepared by using arcgis software the procedure of collecting samples included 10 min of pumping drying cleaning and storing samples in 100 ml polyethylene bottles the samples were then vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size membrane and acidified to a final concentration of about 1 nitric acid as part of heavy metals concentration measurement the collected samples were labeled sealed and transported to the laboratory and preserved in the refrigerator at a temperature of about 4 c until analysis time immediately after sampling physicochemical parameters including temperature ph eh ec do concentration and tds were measured in the field using a multi parameter portable meter hach germany for each sampling station the ph electrode was calibrated using two buffers merck germany that bracketed the measured ph and that was thermally equilibrated with the water sample the ph meter was calibrated daily at ph 4 and 9 whereas the conductivity meter was calibrated daily using 450 μs cm and 1000 μs cm standards calcium was determined titrimetrically using standard edta water samples collected in the field were analyzed in laboratory for major cations k na ca2 and mg2 and major anions cl hco3 co3 2 no3 and so4 2 using the standard methods within 48 h after sampling survey magnesium was calculated on the basis of the difference in concentration between total hardness and ca2 chloride cl was determined by the standard agno3 titration method mohr method carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 were determined by titration with hcl sodium na and potassium k were measured by flame photometry and sulfate so4 2 by spectrophotometric turbidimetry rowell 1994 tds was measured by evaporating a pre filtered sample to dryness also for samples taken from different sampling sites the concentration of heavy metals were estimated by inductively coupled plasma and mass spectrometry icp ms method in the filtered and acidified water samples at the lab west laboratories australia the validity of the analytical ion measurement was determined by calculating the ion balance errors with the analytical precision and reproducibility measurement was less than 10 cations anions cations anions 100 3 2 indexing approach the information of the heavy metal contamination is very useful for utilization of groundwater resources that may also help in future water resource planning surface and groundwater samples suitability for agriculture and drinking purposes were determined by evaluating the heavy metal concentrations in terms of pollution evaluation indices namely heavy metal pollution index hpi heavy metal evaluation index hei degree of contamination cd and the modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi are applied as quantitative measures of water quality in the study area hpi is based on spatial extension of heavy metals and can be helpful in identifying and quantifying trends in groundwater quality mishra et al 2017 hpi in water depends on two factors first number of heavy metal ions and second their concentrations vis à vis permissible levels as per water quality standards chaturvedi et al 2018 as a semi empirical index is there are many analytical formulations proposed for hpi mohan et al 1996 prasad and jaiprakash 1999 prasad and bose 2001 edet and offiong 2002 two of the mostly used indexing techniques with reference to heavy metal ions in groundwater are the one proposed by mohan and coworkers based on highest desirable and maximum permissible concentration mohan et al 1996 prasad and jaiprakash 1999 prasad and mondal 2008 prasad et al 2014 herojeet et al 2015 mahato et al 2017 rezaei et al 2017b singh et al 2017 and also the one that uses maximum allowable concentration mac edet and offiong 2002 venkatramanan et al 2014 singaraja et al 2015 rezaei et al 2017b singh et al 2017 another index is the hei that helps in quickly evaluating the overall quality of water with respect to heavy metal content prasanna et al 2012 m hpi is a new robust and flexible index that has been proposed for indexing heavy metal pollution in groundwater based on highest desirable and maximum permissible concentrations chaturvedi et al 2018 according to this new indexing system heavy metal pollution status of any water sample may be expressed by a pair of positive index pi and negative index ni 3 2 1 heavy metal pollution index hpi hpi is defined as a quantity reflecting the composite influence of different dissolved heavy metals and represent the total quality of water with respect to heavy metals concentration sirajudeen et al 2014 hpi is a powerful technique for the assessment of the composite influence of heavy metals concentration on overall water quality through assigning a rating or weighting wi for each selected parameter the rating is a value between 0 and 1 which reflects the relative importance of an individual parameter and can be defined as inversely proportional to the recommended standard si for each parameter mohan et al 1996 prasad and mondal 2008 prasanna et al 2012 different hpi ranges have been assigned to classify water quality as poor good very good and excellent the highest tolerance value for drinking water si refers to the maximum allowable concentration in drinking water in the absence of any alternate water source the desirable maximum value ii indicates the standard limits for the same parameters in drinking water for this study the concentration limits i e maximum admissible concentration of drinking water mac highest permissive value for drinking water si and the maximum desirable value ii for each heavy metal were retrieved from the who standards who 2011 the method consists of the following the first step involves computing wi of each parameter using equation 1 wi is the unit weightage factor which is inversely proportional to the maximum allowable concentration 1 w i 1 m a c w i k m a c with k being the constant of proportionality which is considered as 1 for all the parameters mohan et al 1996 prasad et al 2014 wi is the relative weightage factor and is computed for each parameter using equation 2 2 w i w i i 1 n w i in the second step an individual quality rating qi is calculated for each parameter using equation 3 3 q i i 1 n m i i i s i m i 100 where mi is the measured concentration of heavy metal of the ith parameter in the water sample ii is highest desirable concentration of the ith parameter the ideal value of the parameter and si is the maximum permissible concentration of the ith parameter standard value of the parameter third summing these sub indices to compute the overall index the hpi model is computed from equation below 4 h p i i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where wi is the unit weight for the ith parameter qi is the sub index of the ith parameter and n is the number of the considered parameters it is considerable that the critical value of hpi for drinking water is 100 critical pollution index 3 2 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei hei method is consistent with the hpi which gives an overall quality of the water regarding heavy metal content edet and offiong 2002 prasanna et al 2012 this indicator is widely used in the determination of groundwater quality the hei is computed as follows 5 h e i i 1 n m i s i where mi indicates the monitored value of the ith parameter and si represents maximum admissible concentration mac of the ith parameter if the heavy metal concentration is higher than si value then the water quality is bad 3 2 3 degree of contamination cd in this index the water quality is assessed by the computation of the degree of contamination and calculated separately for each sample of water as a sum of the contamination factors of individual components exceeding the maximum admissible concentration mac the cd summarizes the combined effects of several water quality parameters considered harmful to domestic water backman et al 1997 prasanna et al 2012 according to backman et al 1997 and edet and offiong 2002 cd may be divided into three classifications as low cd 1 medium cd 1 3 and high cd 3 thus the value of contamination index exceeds 3 suggesting that water is highly polluted in this research the components considered including as ba cr cu fe mn ni se and zn the cd is calculated as follows 6 c d i 1 n c f i where 7 c f i m i s i 1 cfi mi and si represent the contamination factor the monitored value and the mac of the ith component respectively elements and ionic species with monitored values below the maximum admissible concentration value are not taken into consideration 3 2 4 modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi chaturvedi et al 2018 has proposed a modified formulation for heavy metal pollution index m hpi this index is flexible enough to accommodate any water quality standard and is able to diagnose obviously if the water is drinkable this new approach is based on two basic aspects firstly the number of heavy metals to be considered for computing the m hpi should be decided a priori any comparison between two indices two samples is meaningful only when the same set of parameters is considered for calculating the indices secondly this formulation for calculating metal pollution index is applicable to all water quality standards chaturvedi et al 2018 based on the first feature assuming the water sample contains n number of heavy metal ions 8 m h p i i 1 n m h p i i where m hpi is the modified heavy metal pollution index corresponding to the ith heavy metal ion and may be calculated as 9 m h p i i w i q i where wi is the relative weightage factor defined as 10 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the unit weightage factor inversely proportional to the highest desirable concentration ii and defined as 11 w i 1 i i the proportionality constant in this case is consistently taken as 1 for all the parameters sub index qi for the ith parameter is defined as 12 q i m i i i i i mi is the monitored concentration of the ith parameter as defined earlier and ii is usually the maximum allowable concentration based on who standard it should be noted that the numerator in eq 12 is not a modulus as was in eq 3 thus if mi ii qi will be negative and indicating the sample just passes the quality test for particular parameter qi will be zero and when mi ii qi will be positive two factors should be considered in calculation of m hpi each water sample is represented by a pair of indices a positive index pi and a negative index ni pi reflects the contribution of heavy metal ions to water quality that are above the highest desirable limit and ni the contribution of metal ions that are below the limit chaturvedi et al 2018 negative index may vary from 0 to 1 while positive index varies from 0 to any positive value for mi ii the pi for the corresponding parameter is zero and ni is a negative number while for mi ii pi is positive and ni is zero thus in a water sample if there are n number of parameters of which n1have mi ii and n2 have mi ii then the m hpi for that water sample will be represented by a pair of indices pi and ni such that 13 n i i 1 n 1 m h p i i and 14 p i i 1 n 2 m h p i i n1 and n2 are to be treated as independent and mutually exclusive subsets such that n1 n2 n m hpi is inversely correlated with water quality higher the index poorer the water quality chaturvedi et al 2018 if mi 0 i e below detection limit dl for all the heavy metal ions in the water sample the sum of negative indices should be 1 implying considered heavy metal ions are all absent in the water sample the pi for that sample will however be 0 water samples having pi 0 are suitable for drinking ni in such cases may vary from 0 to 1 but not less than 1 in the absence of alternate source pi ul may also be accepted for drinking purpose ni in such cases may vary from 0 to 1 but not less than 1 water samples having pi ul are unsuitable for drinking regardless of ni value between two samples having close pi ni decides the relative quality lower the ni better the quality thus the water quality scale using modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi pi and ni is categorized based on table 1 the m hpi indexing system is based on only highest desirable concentration ii and does not depend on the maximum permissible concentration si 3 2 5 statistical analyses multivariate statistical techniques have been extensively used to facilitate the solution of environmental problems and suggest evidence for the understanding of some natural and anthropogenic processes correlation analysis ca and principal component analysis pca have been broadly used as unbiased methods in the analysis of water quality data for drawing meaningful information singh et al 2005 the correlation matrix of heavy metals concentrations and physicochemical parameters was constructed to find relations among parameters pca is one of the best multivariate statistical techniques for extracting linear relationships among a set of variables simeonov et al 2003 multivariate statistical analyses are applied to identify the relationship between heavy metals and physicochemical parameters in the study area in fact application of multivariate statistical techniques facilitates interpretation of complex data matrices for a better understanding a variety of environmental factors rezaei and hassani 2017 ca and pca with varimax normalized rotation vnr kaiser 1958 are performed using the commercial statistical software package spss version 21 0 for windows spss inc 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 general characteristics of water quality descriptive statistics of physicochemical parameters and heavy metals concentration of groundwater samples consisting of minimum maximum and mean values of each parameter along with standard deviation are listed in table 2 which were compared with the drinking water standards recommended by who who 2011 understanding the main factors controlling groundwater chemistry is very important for sustainable groundwater development in this research work the statistical results of physiochemical parameters of groundwater samples were compared with the standard guideline values recommended by the world health organization who for drinking and public health purposes who 2011 the ph values in the study area ranges of 6 97 8 95 with a mean value of 7 80 and standard deviation of 0 37 indicating a neutral to slightly alkaline water environment nearly 4 i e 3 samples of the total samples show ph values above who standard who 2011 the possible reason of higher ph in this area is likely to be controlled by hco3 co3 2 these ions are formed during hydrothermal process due to the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide sappa et al 2014 the eh can be used with other redox indicators to ascertain in a qualitative sense the relative redox conditions of an aquifer smedley and edmunds 2002 eh values vary from 280 2 303 mv the relationship between eh and ph indicates that eh decreases with increasing ph this relationship shows the progressive reduction of fe2 with deeper circulation associated with ph increase water temperature directly affects the availability of dissolved oxygen in the water dalai et al 2002 temperature values of groundwater samples vary from 13 1 c to 42 9 c with a mean of 28 9 c the highest temperature relates to the thermal spring near the bazman city the high temperature in thermal springs easily enhances the evaporation rate and precipitation of salt into the water bodies nordstrom 2011 tds values vary between 258 and 5790 mg l with a mean value of 2035 5 mg l groundwater with high tds is not suitable for both drinking and irrigation purposes rezaei and hassani 2017 for drinking purpose the maximum allowable tds guideline value according to who standard is 1000 mg l who 2011 classification of groundwater quality based on tds content according to who standard are shown in table 3 and indicated that 86 57 samples of the samples exceeds the desirable limit given by who the majority of groundwater samples in the study area are in range slightly saline to moderately saline water type in the study area the high tds at some sampling stations can be due to the percolation of channel water containing solids and agricultural wastes also the country rocks are the most important sources of increasing dissolved solids in the groundwater selvakumar et al 2017 ec values vary from 532 to 10580 μs cm with an average of 3906 μs cm ec is a good indicator of total salinity or total amount of dissolved solids in water and helps to determine the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation based on who standard maximum allowable limit for ec in drinking water is 1500 μs cm who 2011 analysis of the results show that the ec values of 90 i e 60 samples of the samples are above the standard value fig 6 in groundwater samples of the study area ec values higher than 1500 μs cm are saline and or polluted waters the high ec in the study area due to high hydrothermal activities it is considerable that ec and tds are the most important parameters to demarcate salinity hazard and suitability of water for irrigation purposes do values of all collected samples vary from o 15 to 11 2 mg l with a mean value of 6 30 mg l which indicates that all the studied samples have moderate concentration of dissolved oxygen eight ions have been studied in groundwater samples of bazman the ionic compositions of the samples are characterized by na so4 2 cl ca2 hco3 mg2 k no3 facies it is well documented that within a water sample the number of positively charged ions in solution cations should balance the number of negatively charged ion anions the ionic balance calculation should encompass all anions and all cations with the sample when an ionic balance calculation does not give results between 10 other checks are possible to identify what might be responsible for the disparity freeze and cherry 1979 in this study the cation anion balance was analyzed by comparing the sum of cation milliequivalents per million to the sum of anion milliequivalents per million while values are inside the 10 range in this section the heavy metals behavior has been investigated mean metal concentrations in groundwater followed a descending order ba as cr ni se zn mn cu fe with all concentrations falling below mac values from table 2 the concentration of as 1 9 74 60 μg l in 31 samples 46 is higher than the mac of 10 μg l and four samples 5 show se in excess of 10 μg l the high as values are related to volcanic and carbonate rocks 4 2 hydrogeochemical facies hydrochemical facies is a term used to describe the bodies of groundwater in an aquifer that different their geochemical characteristics yang et al 2016 to understand the hydrochemical evolution and determination of the dominant groundwater types in the study area major cations and anions in meq l were plotted on a trilinear piper diagram which indicates the origin of groundwater and the source of their dissolved salts and explains the different processes affecting groundwater characters piper 1944 according to the plotting the groundwater samples on the piper s diagram the dominant water types are in the order of na cl na hco3 ca cl the results show that the vast majority of groundwater samples are na cl dominant fluids based on the evolution of water types from the recharge zone to discharge zone bicarbonate sulfate chloride this evolution can be observed in water samples in the study area the discharge zone rezaei and hassani 2017 water evaporitic minerals interaction can also be other reasons for the presence of chloride type in this area todd and mays 2005 merkel and planer friedrich 2008 ca cl water type indicates mineral dissolution an interaction between rock and water with sufficient recharge of fresh water mondal and singh 2012 srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 fig 5 shows the general distribution of water types in the groundwater of the study area the mixing of the jazmurian basin water with the groundwater triggers many chemical reactions such as ion exchange redox reactions sorption dissolution and precipitation nagaraju et al 2016 4 3 pollution evaluation indices pollution indices for trace elements were identified significantly by means of heavy metal evaluation index different indices represent different classes of risk levels the water quality of the study area was analyzed using several pollution evaluation indices to calculate the hpi mac values for heavy metals were used based on who standard concentration of ba cr cu fe mn and zn were below the mac for drinking water while concentrations of as 5 samples ni 7 samples and se 4 samples exceed the mac the unit weight wi for various water quality parameters is assumed to be inversely proportional to the maximum admissible concentration mac for the corresponding parameter table 4 in order to calculate the hpi of the groundwater the mean concentration value of the selected metals as ba cr cu fe mn ni se and zn have been taken into account hpi for 67 samples in the study area was calculated with mean concentration values of all heavy metals hpi values is ranging from 31 7 to 56 35 while the mean hpi for all of the samples is calculated as 9 17 0 2176 42 14 which is far below the critical pollution index value of 100 table 5 spatial distribution of hpi values is shown in fig 6 in all of the cases the mean hpi is well below the permissible index value of 100 proposed for drinking water by mohan et al 1996 overall the results of calculation showed that the hpi values for all of the samples were below the critical limit of 100 in order to apply these hpi indices the scales were slightly modified using multiples of the median as a criterion for this purpose the values are divided into three classes to demarcate different levels of contamination as low medium and high table 6 the hpi values were computed for each sampling station table 7 using scaled hpi values 34 of samples were classified as having low pollution levels low risk level and 66 with medium pollution levels medium risk level hei was used for easy interpretation of the pollution index edet and offiong 2002 the hei values ranged from 0 22 to 3 65 with a mean value of 1 2 the hei values were computed for each sampling station table 7 the results of computation showed that the 60 0 of the samples fell below the respective mean values of hei based on the approach of edet and offiong 2002 the calculated hei values were classified in terms of pollution levels as low medium and high different hei criteria values have been developed for the samples guided by their respective mean values and the different levels of contamination are demarcated by a multiple of the mean values therefore the proposed hei criteria for the samples are as follows low hei 1 medium hei 1 2 and high 2 based on scaled hei values 52 of samples were classified as having low pollution levels low risk level 31 with medium pollution levels medium risk level and 17 with high pollution levels high risk level fig 7 the degree of contamination cd was used as a reference of estimating the extent of metal pollution the range and mean values of cd of the groundwater samples are 5 35 8 78 and 7 77 respectively the cd values were computed for each sampling station table 7 the study of cd values reveals that the heavy metals concentration of groundwater samples is low to medium level of pollution fig 8 the variation trends of c d and hei at different sampling points reveals similar deviation for groundwater samples the new index of heavy metals pollution is applied for the calculation of m hpi pi and ni for 67 groundwater samples in the study area m hpi values were computed for each sampling station table 7 as per the outlined criteria any water sample having pi 0 is suitable for drinking chaturvedi et al 2018 in the study area pi of about 95 of the water sample was in between 0 and 0 1 that indicating very good quality also many of the samples have a low ni in the range of 0 05 to 0 2 that represents very good quality with reference to heavy metal ions the results of pollution evaluation indices are presented in table 7 existing contamination levels for hpi hei cd and m hpi pi and ni have also been classified according to obtained results in tables 1 and 6 the best water samples as per hpi hei and cd were 55 15 and 50 numbers respectively the best water samples for m hpi index was 45 and 55 because having pi 0 and low ni similar studies on groundwater quality have not been carried out in iran according to our knowledge thus it provides an important tool to estimate impacts of agricultural practices as well as to drive public health policy in the bazman region 4 4 multivariate statistics analyses statistical tools including pca and ca are used to resolve data sets interpretation correlation analysis in groundwater studies a preliminary descriptive technique was employed on the groundwater from bazman region in order to measure the degree of association observed between any analyzed chemical variables most of the parameters were found to bear statistically significant correlation with each other signifying close associations pearson correlation r 0 05 is applied to investigate the inter elemental correlation for all selected elements derived from the linear relationship of two variables rezaei et al 2019 the correlation matrix of 14 parameters for the 67 samples in the study area is indicated in table 8 the highest correlation occurs between ec and tds r 0 99 because all of the dissolved components cause increased ionic concentration leading to an increased ec concentration the high correlation between ec and tds reflects the interdependency of these measurements as general measures of the amount of total dissolved solutes the correlation studies show that copper has significant positive correlation with nickel r 0 71 this correlation among individual heavy metals indicate common sources mutual dependences and similar behavior in the transportation processes in the research area also the correlation between ec and tds with eh and ph with ni is negative r 0 62 and r 0 63 respectively and indicate one variable increases as the other decreases and vice versa the correlation studies show that the significant correlation between ec and tds with ni r 0 72 and r 0 71 respectively and between ec and tds with se r 0 75 and r 0 74 respectively pca was used to identify the potential sources of trace metals and to verify and quantify interrelationships among the real variables in a data set in this study pca was executed for 14 variables from 67 sampling stations the rotated factor pattern after extraction using varimax rotation and the cumulative percentage and percentage of variance explained by each factor is given in table 9 according to the obtained results of the pca four principal components were extracted for groundwater quality data sets based on eigenvalues more than 1 which represented 83 49 of the total variance which is quite good and can be relied upon to identify the main sources of variation in the hydrochemistry pca was classified into three categories thus value 0 75 indicate strong loadings 0 50 0 75 have moderate loading and 0 30 0 50 indicate weak loadings liu et al 2003 pc1 explained 32 81 of the total variance indicates that ec and tds have high positive loading and reflecting the physicochemical characteristics of water quality ni and se show strong positive loadings while cu and zn represent moderate positive loadings some metals do not occur normally in groundwater and so their origin is from external sources and not geogenic sources fertilizers used for agriculture are a well known source for copper and zinc also it can be attributed to the excessive use of zinc sulfate which is an important constituent of fertilizers used in the region the selenium concentration in groundwater from the study area is controlled by the composition of the aquifer materials se is potentially mobile and soluble in water under aerobic high oxygen concentration and alkaline high ph conditions and could lead to environmental contamination in this study some sampling stations contain high levels of se the second component pc2 with 23 55 of the total variance contains high positive loadings for mn and negative loadings for eh the main sources of mn are leaching from local bedrock and mn might be originated from gigantic sources which could be released by chemical weathering of parent materials the solubility of mn minerals in water depends directly on anions and oxidation reduction potential particularly at near neutral ph lorite herrera et al 2008 pc3 was loaded fe as and temperature and accounted for 16 40 of the total variance the presence of fe in pc3 revealed the process of rock water interaction as in groundwater and aquifer is mobilized e g hydraulic fracturing murcott 2012 also it reflects that the source of as in the groundwater is anthropogenic activities in the study area arsenical pesticides for protecting crops pc4 was responsible for 10 70 of the total variance positively considered cr and inversely to ba dissolved ba is controlled by barite solubility and concentrations may exceed the drinking water mac of 1 mg l who 2011 barium values less than 0 5 1 mg lit would likely represent water that is not impacted by saline water betcher et al 2003 generally agricultural fertilizer and stagnant water may be attributed the main sources of this groundwater hydrochemical evolution in the study area it can be said that common rock water interaction and anthropogenic activities are responsible for the ionic alteration of groundwater in the study area 5 conclusions in this study the analytical results of physiochemical parameters of groundwater showed that the concentrations of heavy metals in water samples are within the permissible who limits in drinking water two metals of them as and se were detected in some sampling stations higher than permissible limits according to the dominant cations and anions three types of water could be identified in the water samples na cl na hco3 and ca cl according to pollution evaluation indices classification hpi cd hei and m hpi showed that majority samples reveals low to medium level of pollution in the study area however the values of these four indices in totally below the critical values but severe precautions consideration such as manage the use of agricultural inputs prevention of use of wastewater and sewage sludge in agriculture control of overuse of organic fertilizers are recommended in this area from the integrated pollution indices study it is assessed that 55 water samples are safe to drink with respect to metal ion concentration the results of ca and pca analyses suggested that most of the variations are explained by the anthropogenic pollutants and the set of natural soluble contents geogenic processes rock weathering and ion exchange are the only mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry in deep aquifers human activities such as wastewater effluents irrigation fertilizer application and groundwater abstraction have been found to have a great influence on groundwater quality pollution due to heavy metals is significant in these areas and it is important to continuously monitor the water quality to prevent further deterioration of water resources data from this study will not only contribute to an improved understanding of the factors controlling groundwater hydrochemistry and quality but also it provides information about potential uses of these water sources thus contributing to the management of this resource this information is important for groundwater management and may help in the effective utilization of groundwater resources acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the amirkabir university of technology polytechnic tehran

12233,researching citizens sense of personal responsibility to engage in groundwater resource management their perception of risks associated with potential threats to groundwater their degrees of dependence on groundwater resources and their socioeconomic characteristics this study aimed to investigate how these variables predict citizens engagement in groundwater resource management participation was divided into three categories participation in obtaining groundwater information in developing groundwater policies and strategies and in implementing those policies thailand s rayong groundwater basin which currently faces various threats such as seawater intrusion erratic rainfall and intensive use of groundwater for industrialization was chosen as a case study questionnaire surveys were conducted with the participants who were selected based on a purposive method focusing on groundwater users in five sectors the business and industrial agricultural household environmental and public organization sectors the results of multiple regression analyses revealed that the sense of personal responsibility alone could not highly motivate groundwater users to engage in groundwater policy development and implementation perceived risks associated with potential threats to groundwater resources significantly influenced participation in developing and implementing groundwater policies users degree of groundwater dependence also influenced their participation in obtaining information relevant to groundwater and in implementing policies males were determined to be more engaged in managing groundwater resources particularly in obtaining information and implementing policies this study suggests that a sense of personal responsibility and risk perceptions should be promoted together to enhance people s motivation and enthusiasm for cooperating with organizations responsible for sustainable groundwater management gm keywords groundwater resource management public participation sense of personal responsibility perceived risk associated with threats to groundwater 1 introduction groundwater resources provide massive services for human well being and the environment in many areas diverse human activities such as industrial manufacturing businesses and services household consumption agriculture and recreation are enormously dependent on groundwater resources currently groundwater resources are facing various threats including both natural e g geochemical processes associated with geological characteristics seawater intrusion and erratic rainfall and anthropogenic e g climate change related situations overexploitation urbanization and industrialization these threats cause problems associated with both the quantity and quality of groundwater resources for instance in india climate change potentially causes erratic rainfall and increases demands on groundwater usage among farmers who must adapt to new rainfall patterns fishman 2018 taraz 2017 ntanganedzeni et al 2018 showed that both geochemical processes e g ion exchange mineral dissolution and saline sources and contamination generated by human activities e g wastewater infiltration from domestic sewage and septic tank leakage and irrigation return flow affected groundwater quality in the coastal aquifer of tugela catchment in south africa several studies illustrated causes of groundwater quality degradation related to population growth hoque et al 2007 mpamba and hussen 2008 naik and tambe 2008 chang 2010 tabatabaei et al 2014 urban development sajikumar and remya 2015 tam and viet nga 2018 and industrial development in areas adjacent to groundwater basins abdelkader and brahim 2016 tamta 2003 for instance abdelkader and brahim 2016 demonstrated that overpumping of the groundwater aquifer in the coastal region of northwest oman caused the intrusion of seawater thus leading to deterioration of the groundwater quality regarding various threats to groundwater resources an effective management of groundwater resources is heavily needed however groundwater is difficult to manage because of its common pool nature common access potentially causes overexploitation rules regulations managerial processes and responsible institutions are therefore required for defining usage rights and supporting and implementing sustainable resource use dietz et al 2003 marothia et al 2003 anderies and janssen 2013 though effective rules have previously been set implementation of those rules has been unsuccessful many scholars identified that invisibility of groundwater resources and limitation of groundwater information caused failures in groundwater management unlike surface water groundwater is as the name suggests under the ground so its quality and quantity are difficult to inspect theesfeld 2010 policy makers usually cannot access all types of important information needed for creating effective management plans for instance it is difficult to clearly indicate the number of wells and the amount of water used theesfeld 2010 it is also difficult to understand how groundwater is used and essential to each group of people in a particular area implementing groundwater policies without gaining stakeholders support is therefore not successful responsibility for managing groundwater resources and overcoming management obstacles should not lie with only one organization each group of stakeholders possesses particular important resources which might benefit groundwater management therefore stakeholder engagement can ensure that a comprehensive range of interests relevant important knowledge and various perspectives are considered mutually shared and understood stakeholder engagement in management processes also contributes to mutual education as well as eliminating existing or potential conflicts and creating trust among stakeholders additionally stakeholder participation could help develop a better understanding of groundwater demands and disseminate scientific information employed by managers jakeman et al 2016 currently the engagement of groundwater users in gm is problematic since many groups of users are reluctant to participate in both policy decision making processes and policy implementation and monitoring some of them have no awareness of groundwater deterioration associated with their use and with severe natural events in other aspects the environment for fostering participation is not well prepared and managed by authorities holding gm power thus groundwater users are not motivated to engage in management processes kool and van steenbergen 2017 have indicated that social participation in gm still remains a challenge and documented participation efforts are required for guidance groundwater users sense of responsibility to engage in gm is thought to be an important driver of public participation in gm kaiser et al 1999 have indicated that public participation in natural resource management nrm is relatively driven by this sense of responsibility however to what extent and to which level of gm participation that sense of responsibility could be beneficial has never been empirically investigated furthermore water users perceived risks associated with potential threats to groundwater can be one possible driver of the gm participation braune and adams 2013 have suggested that lack of awareness about threats to groundwater potentially contribute to poor or no gm action because people have no sense of urgency people s risk perception could therefore motivate them to take part in gm however the way people judge and perceive risks can vary thus it is important to understand how each different viewpoint of risk judgment can motivate people to take part in gm in another facet degree of groundwater dependence which can reflect people s perceptions of groundwater value is also a potential driver of participation in gm it can be assumed that if people have high perceptions of groundwater value they may decide to engage in gm this study aims to investigate how groundwater users senses of responsibility perceptions of risks associated with potential threats to groundwater and levels of groundwater dependence affect their engagement in gm which includes their participation in obtaining information and in policy development and implementation the rayong groundwater basin in thailand was selected as a case study because it is facing several threats such as seawater intrusion erratic rainfall emergence of special economic development zone projects and rapid urbanization finally it is expected that the results of this study will provide some implications for promoting groundwater users participation in gm 2 literature review 2 1 public participation in groundwater management several pieces of literature indicate that public participation pp plays a significant role in creating shared relevant important knowledge and experiences that positively contribute to sustainable and equitable gm borowski and hare 2007 fritsch 2016 barthel and villholth 2017 for instance barthel and villholth 2017 indicated that threats to sustainable groundwater utilization could be effectively addressed through cooperation among stakeholders such as experts and a diverse group of practitioners more comprehensively quevauviller et al 2016 explained that pp is essential for planning and policy making pp can be used as a means for empowering individuals groups and local communities and as a means of improving the quality of decision making regarding the legal right of pp quevauviller et al 2016 added that people or social groups affected by decisions should have the opportunity to reflect their perspectives notions and needs becoming involved in decision making processes even though groundwater is difficult to manage because of its relative invisibility and the complexities surrounding its governance a decentralized management approach based on the principle of pp can improve decision making offer more effective solutions for long term groundwater sustainability and continuously ensure social equity newig et al 2005 ghose et al 2018 several key policy documents international guidelines and important regulatory initiatives such as the european water framework directive quevauviller et al 2005 integrated water resources management foster and ait kadi 2005 and the us clean water act carr et al 2012 mostert et al 2007 have emphasized the application of pp in water management for achieving sustainability regarding the core concept of pp the international association for public participation iap2 defined pp as any process that involves the public in problem solving or decision making and uses public input to make better decisions iap2 2003 much research related to pp has cited arnstein s ladder of citizen participation which indicates levels of citizen involvement in the decision making process in the urban planning context arnstein 1969 pretty 1995 classified the degree of participation according to the participants involvement in activities and their control over outcomes the level of participation pretty proposed ranges from manipulative in which power over development and decisions lies with people who are less relevant to the issues being handled or people who are outside the local community to self mobilized in which the local community take initiatives and has full power and control over the development michener 1998 classified participation into two types the planner centered approach and the people centered approach many other scholars have simply distinguished the degree of pp into three main levels including information supply consultation and active involvement arnstein 1969 mostert 2003 newig et al 2005 information supply means members of the public are authorized or encouraged to access documents or information from competent authorities consultation emphasizes more interactive communication between the public and public authorities members of the public are encouraged to exhibit their viewpoints opinions and concerns on the issues being handled through several channels such as interviews surveys in writing etc finally active involvement means the public is given the opportunity to actively participate in the decision making process by deliberatively discussing issues being handled and selecting solutions eu 2002 voices of the public can fully influence decisions in the context of water resource management the european water framework directive commission of the european communities 2000 has also distinguished participation into three levels information supply consultation and active involvement european commission 2003 cases are categorized as information supply when participants are provided with only information related to the results of decisions progress updates water management strategies or practical plans if participants are given opportunities to share ideas or comment on issues the case is categorized as consultation active involvement as the name suggests requires participants to actively contribute to water resource management processes participants can propose ideas and solutions and influence final decisions in active involvement all stakeholders such as water users public authorities provider organizations experts etc are required to participate similarly quevauviller et al 2016 have proposed three aspects of pp in gm including access to knowledge and information involvement in decision making processes for groundwater management e g opportunities to comment and access to justice right of legal review to promote pp in groundwater management effective social organization is a prerequisite for developing connections and platforms to foster communication among different stakeholder groups garduño et al 2010 lopez gunn and cortina 2006 van steenbergen 2006 ghose b et al 2018 noticed that poor coordination among stakeholders has led to an overall lack of accountability within management systems leonard and pelling 2010 added that inadequate collaboration among local leaders has hindered the formation of cooperation and social trust between leaders and local residents for collectively responding to contaminated groundwater considering the roles of groundwater users and other stakeholders in gm stakeholders can engage in several ways such as groundwater monitoring making rules on water use policing groundwater use implementing groundwater protection participating in setting targets and settling groundwater disputes garduño et al 2010 indicated that groundwater users should engage in the following activities 1 participating in local allocation access to groundwater 2 monitoring groundwater 3 engaging in implementation of gm plans 4 facilitating shared access and use of groundwater facilities 5 promoting demand reduction measures 6 engaging in recharge and retention measures 7 mobilizing additional water sources 8 participating in binding rules on water use 9 implementing groundwater protection measures 10 settling groundwater resource disputes 11 negotiating with other policy actors this study emphasizes enhancing the participation of groundwater users in gm groundwater users levels of participation in gm will be investigated participation in this study is classified into three types participation in obtaining information participation in developing gm policy and strategy and participation in implementing policies and plans 2 2 determinants of public participation in groundwater management 2 2 1 sense of personal responsibility this sense of personal responsibility reflects an individual s feeling of ownership over and responsibility for groundwater resources and management wondolleck and yaffee 2000 described the feeling of ownership as individuals sense of responsibility for and obligation to problem solving and public resource planning and management people s sense of personal responsibility for natural resource planning is also used to explain the term ownership in natural resources van riper 2003 mccool and guthrie 2001 when individuals have a sense of ownership over the resources they utilize the related sense of responsibility for managing those resources can be constructed followed by motivation to engage in management processes when offered opportunities to engage in these management processes people with strong feelings of responsibility potentially decide to take part in gm raufirad et al 2017 investigated determinants of natural resource users participation lpp in nrm in isfahan iran the result revealed that besides the sociocultural and religious beliefs that contributed to resource users decisions to engage in nrm a sense of responsibility toward sustainable natural resource management snrm was also an important factor kaiser et al 1999 indicated that a sense of responsibility or commitment is connected with a person s attitudes toward natural resources and it potentially influences that person s decision to engage in nrm to enhance people s sense of responsibility it is important that policy makers help potential participants feel invested important and influential in the nrm process zurba and trimble 2014 khalili et al 2014 2 2 2 risk perception individuals perceptions of the risks to natural resources associated with natural threats and human activities can construct in those individuals a sense of awareness and urgency they may consequently decide to take action in nrm braune and adams 2013 indicated that a lack of awareness about threats to groundwater causes a lack of developing and implementing gm actions because there is no sense of urgency theoretically individuals risk perceptions refers to their judgment of the negative consequences of a particular hazard aven and renn 2010 the world health organization who 2013 affirmed that risk perception can refer to natural hazards and threats to the environment or health risk perception can be constructed by both belief and self appraisal who 2013 aven and renn 2010 slovic and weber 2012 there are several ways of construing risks people s risk perception could be construed based on analytical thinking about the nature of risks leiserowitz et al 2001 leiserowitz 2006 people may judge the level of risk based on how they perceive the probability of environmental contamination of receiving impacts or of the severity of catastrophic consequences leiserowitz et al 2001 leiserowitz 2006 regarding the connection between risk perception and decisions to take action rogers 1957 proposed the protection motivation theory pmt which explains that individuals motivations to take protective actions depend on how they perceive risk associated with threats such as global climate change natural disasters and technological disasters rogers 1983 further explained that a decision to take actions is done based on the results of threat appraisal and coping appraisal threat appraisal refers to people s evaluation of the perceived severity of a threat and their evaluation of the perceived probability being negatively impacted by the threat threat appraisal also considers the reward which refers to perceptions of the benefits of current practices in addition to threat appraisal the protection motivation is also influenced by coping appraisal which refers to the degree to which individuals believe they can perform risk preventative behaviors however a negative relationship between risk perception and pp was also found in a previous study zanetell and knuth 2004 determined that a high level of concern for venezuelan fisheries had a negative relationship with participation in fishery management they called this situation as a defeatist attitude a term referring to people being highly concerned but believing that no intervention or action can solve the problem in the context of groundwater management it can be assumed that if groundwater users perceive a high risk associated with threats to groundwater resources and perceive the potential impacts they will possibly suffer they may decide to cooperate with responsible agencies to protect their resources 2 2 3 dependence on groundwater individuals dependence on groundwater resources reflects their interest in the resource if people recognize the benefits of the resource they may be more motivated to take action for sustaining the resource that provides their welfare lise 2000 zanetell and knuth 2004 dalton et al 2012 coulibaly lingani et al 2011 in addition when groundwater users recognize potential threats to groundwater users with a higher level of dependence on the resource may also be more aware of the threats thus they can be more enthusiastic in taking actions to protect the resource from deterioration tuinstra and wensem 2014 illustrated that awareness of groundwater value potentially contributes to balanced decisions for utilizing ecosystem services essentially groundwater stakeholders want to engage in gm because they have an interest in the resource therefore it is possible that people with a level of groundwater dependence also perceive groundwater as being highly valuable thus this group of people may be more active gm participants for example dalton et al 2012 clearly revealed that the outcome of public participation in the management of marine protected areas in the wider caribbean was influenced by the degree of resource dependence 2 2 4 socioeconomic characteristics it is important to consider the socioeconomic characteristics of stakeholders when pp in gm is promoted this is because people with different socioeconomic characteristics such as gender educational level career etc may have different motivations levels of awareness and capabilities for engaging in gm for instance males may be more capable and have more opportunities to participate in nrm depending on their surrounding cultures and educational access fonjong 2008 and machlis et al 1997 showed that sociodemographic attributes of a population such as age gender and educational level can demonstrate the sociocultural dimensions of nrm and thereby influence its level of sustainability jakeman et al 2016 added the assertion that social drivers including concerns for ecosystems and future generations influenced the demand for groundwater sustainability and protection several pieces of research have indicated that the social characteristics of stakeholders affected their decision to participate in nrm raufirad et al 2017 found a significant relationship between local people s education levels and their participation in nrm regarding the role of gender according wanjala 2009 females were not empowered to engage in water resource management due to poverty lack of education cultural beliefs and gender inequality therefore females were passive about participating in water management similarly were et al 2008 demonstrated that females in kenya exhibited a very low level of engagement in community groups with decision making powers for water management the explanation for this issue was that participatory activities might be organized at times of day when males were free and able to engage while females were too busy to attend additionally males typically control land access to water and public spaces therefore they rather than the females were encouraged to engage in water management by understanding stakeholders socioeconomic characteristics strategies to promote stakeholders gm engagement can be effectively developed 2 3 promotion of public participation in groundwater management in rayong groundwater basin thailand currently the department of groundwater resources ministry of natural resources and the environment thailand is officially responsible for sustainable groundwater management the issue of public participation and stakeholder collaboration was emphasized and taken into gm strategies between 2015 and 2018 department of groundwater resources 2015 in strategy no 3 enhancing the capability of gm authorities and promoting public gm participation was defined in addition the thai groundwater act 2520 1977 b c section 8 14 1 and section 15 stated that the minister should have the power with the advice of the committee to issue ministerial regulations prescribing the establishment of stakeholder networks for supporting groundwater resource management in a particular groundwater basin and enhancing public nrm participation royal gazette 1978 though the plan and regulations for encouraging pp in gm have already been launched in actuality pp in gm is still challenging and problematic poor participation in policy and lawmaking processes has caused problems for enforcing laws and implementing policies interviews with public officers of the department of groundwater resources revealed that many groundwater users illegally occupied groundwater wells and illegally pumped groundwater while public authorities did not have the sufficient capability to inspect all users since those wells were on private land therefore the department of groundwater resources pointed out that the only way to sustainably manage groundwater resources is to promote pp in each gm stage based on the current groundwater management system in thailand which is still centralized roles of pp are still limited by regulatory systems for instance only people having an educational degree in the field of geography or relevant disciplines can be hired as full time officers in the department of groundwater resources the organization therefore lacks staffs who have expertise in pp skills additionally local municipalities cannot gain full authority to manage groundwater resources they still work under decisions made by the central organization the department of groundwater resources therefore in this study only three types of pp in gm are investigated and these three types of pp can be carried out under the current regulatory system 1 participation in receiving information related to groundwater management to encourage users to obtain legal permissions for using groundwater and developing groundwater wells as well as to enhance their awareness of sustainable groundwater use users should clearly understand the process of license application and possess information or knowledge related to the groundwater situations in their areas 2 participation in developing gm policies such policies constitute practical regulations that are related to each specific local context 3 participation in implementing gm policies such participation may include monitoring the quality and quantity of groundwater resources complying with laws and regulations or informing responsible organizations about groundwater situations in the area if these types of pp are successful they will definitely improve gm 2 4 rayong groundwater basin thailand the rayong groundwater basin is located in the watershed of thailand s eastern coast districts in two provinces including rayong and chonburi are located in this basin these two provinces are home to many industrial factories which are important drivers of thailand s national economic development rayong province in particular contains a chemical industrial hub the map ta phut industrial estate where many petrochemical industries are located ieap 2015 the existence of many industries also induces the growth of urbanization in the area these phenomena increase demands for groundwater putting the resource at greater risk department of groundwater resources 2008 the watershed has a relatively limited groundwater potential the floodplain contains thailand s major rivers such as the yai canal to the north and south the river is predominantly composed of sandy sediment and clay and because the porosity of these materials is low the area s aquifer has a low quantity department of groundwater resources 2015 therefore the availability of groundwater for abstraction is minimal along coastal areas salt water can intrude creating brackish groundwater and the rayong groundwater basin is located on the eastern coastal watershed there are two types of groundwater to be obtained one from the fragile sediment aquifer and the other from the hard rock aquifer most of the region s groundwater comes from the aquifer located in sediment rock and hard rock on the floodplain the aquitards are layered on the aquifer and they are made of clay mixed sediment sand and gravelly sand the average groundwater yield is 20 50 m3 h department of groundwater resources 2008 the area of the case study is shown in fig 2 in this region groundwater is an alternative source of fresh water bureau of water management 2016 groundwater resources tremendously support the economic and industrial development of cities in the rayong groundwater basin however if there is utilization and water demand increases for industrial activities the elevation of the groundwater table which relies on each year s rainfall intensity can be affected precipitation itself can also influence the elevation of the groundwater table and groundwater quality bunsri et al 2004 this study found that groundwater demand is increased by both urbanization and industrialization moreover extensive development of industrial activities creates pollutants which can contaminate groundwater resources according to the characteristics of industrial activities in the area ieap 2015 groundwater may be contaminated by several heavy metals which may originate from domestic and industrial wastewater or waste such as leachate from landfills groundwater can also be naturally contaminated because of the basin s geographical characteristics bunsri et al 2004 currently iron fe contamination is considered the most common problem in the rayong groundwater basin contamination was found in the pluak daeng district and the rayong district this study s survey results also revealed a high concentration of iron in groundwater samples above the allowable limit furthermore seawater intrusion was observed in the rayong groundwater basin the seawater intrusion occurred along the floodplain at a coastal aquifer where there is an interface between fresh water and seawater according to the results of this project s water demand analysis the estimated water demands for domestic and industrial sectors were 3 25 and 290 million m3 per year respectively therefore the total water demand is 293 25 million m3 per year the available surface water in this area is only 240 million m3 per year saengow and wongkhean 2007 department of groundwater resources 2008 this means that the water demand is higher than the water supply and 53 25 million m3 per year are still required groundwater is a source of fresh water used to meet the demand however the availability of groundwater in some areas may still be lower than the demand causing water scarcity the utilization of groundwater in the rayong basin is divided into three types as follows 2 4 1 water for consumption as of 2011 a total of 21 90 million m3 of groundwater was consumed per year the water supply from the provincial waterworks authority pwa and the metropolitan waterworks authority mwa was consumed at a rate 16 33 million m3 per year provincial waterworks authority 2013 metropolitan waterworks authority 2013 the water supply from municipal water supply plants was consumed at a rate of 3 85 million m3 per year department of groundwater resources 2014 and that from private groundwater wells was consumed at a rate of 1 51 million m3 per year department of groundwater resources 2014 shallow wells provided approximately 0 21 million m3 of water per year department of groundwater resources 2014 most of the water consumed came from surface water resources approximately 85 84 or 18 79 million m3 per year groundwater resources provided approximately 14 16 or 3 10 million m3 per year 2 4 2 agricultural uses agriculture consumed the groundwater at a total of 9 51 million m3 per year department of groundwater resources 2014 most of the groundwater was abstracted from the region s unconfined aquifer and only a small amount of the remaining water use came from the confined aquifers at deeper layers 2 4 3 industrial uses based on the data from the pwa provincial waterworks authority 2013 and the records of water pumped from private groundwater wells department of groundwater resources 2014 a total of 6 66 million m3 was supplied to industries only private groundwater wells were accessed by the industries 2 5 participants participants in this study were selected based on purposive and random sampling methods focusing on people who depend on groundwater utilization in addition in the selection of participants we focused on those in the areas where groundwater resources were potentially threatened by human activities and seawater intrusion namely groundwater users living in nearby coastal areas and living in highly urbanized areas where many industrial plants and urban communities were chosen participants were divided into five groups as follows 1 business and industrial sector people who utilize groundwater for business or economic purposes 2 agricultural sector those whose agricultural activities such as gardening or farming rely on groundwater resources 3 household sector people who use groundwater for daily consumption and activities 4 public organization sector organizations that partially or fully use groundwater for consumption or activities 5 environmental sector people who do not directly use groundwater but realize that the existence of groundwater maintains the quality of the environment the number of participants in each group is identified in table 1 due to the nature of the area which contains diverse business and industrial activities and is an industrial hub of the country the number of participants from the business and industrial sector was double that of participants from each of the other sectors the number of participants from public organizations specifically schools was also 10 13 members higher than the number of participants from each of the other sectors because many schools in the area rely on groundwater for consumption and school activities in addition the department of groundwater resources established groundwater development projects in the schools 3 research methods 3 1 study framework to determine potential drivers of groundwater users gm participation this study investigated the influence of groundwater users perceptions of risks associated with potential threats to groundwater their sense of responsibility to gm their levels of groundwater dependence and their socioeconomic characteristics these points were studied as they relate to users gm participation including participation in receiving gm related information participation in developing policies and strategies and participation in implementing those policies or strategies perceived risks in this study were classified into two types 1 the perceived possibility of future adverse consequences to groundwater resources such as shortage and degraded quality caused by the current ways in which groundwater is extracted and consumed and 2 the perceived possibility of being personally affected by deteriorated groundwater quality and quantity both risk viewpoints can affect people s motivation to engage in gm this study assumed that higher levels of perceived risk associated with threats to groundwater a sense of responsibility and high levels of groundwater dependence would motivate groundwater users to engage in gm in addition the socioeconomic characteristics of groundwater users might also influence users capability and motivation to participate in gm the framework of this study is shown in fig 1 3 2 data collection interviews with participants were performed to investigate groundwater users opinions related to risk perception and their participation in gm questionnaire surveys were distributed in the area of the rayong groundwater basin factors indicators questions used and response categories are shown in table 2 in measuring levels of participation in receiving information participants were asked to indicate their frequency in receiving information about legal processes for well construction and groundwater situations in the area the department of groundwater resources has created many channels to communicate with groundwater users and the general public about these two issues those efforts include creating community networks organizing training or workshops organizing exhibitions and meeting with local communities in measuring levels of participation in developing relevant policies and strategies participants were asked to indicate their frequency in participating in meetings or events that the department of groundwater resources had organized for sharing information with the public or gathering groundwater users perspectives with the purpose of developing groundwater management policies for the measurement of participation in implementing policies or strategies participants were asked to indicate their frequency in informing responsible organizations about groundwater situations such as contamination groundwater shortage and the like currently in implementing policies groundwater users are encouraged to share information about groundwater situations with the department of groundwater resources and a local stakeholder network containing diverse groups such as community leaders local units of the department of groundwater resources nongovernmental organizations ngos or local authorities moreover groundwater users are required to receive official permission to use groundwater resources thus they need to inform the responsible organization before constructing a well all corrected data were carefully inspected content validity was confirmed based on the face validity technique and it was tested against participants whose characteristics were similar to the sample group in addition cronbach s alpha was calculated to test the internal consistency of the scales used for measuring all variables in this study the values of cronbach s alpha were above 0 7 which ensured that the data gained from the questionnaires were reliable data collection was carried out from december 2017 to march 2018 response rates for each group of participants are shown in table 1 3 3 data analysis multiple regression analyses were performed to test the effects of variables including sense of responsibility perceived risks associated with potential threats degrees of dependence on groundwater and socioeconomic characteristics on levels gm participation three multiple regression models were presented to demonstrate significant variables predicting each step of gm participation including participation in obtaining relevant information participation in developing groundwater policies and strategies and participation in implementing those policies and strategies the results provided implications for developing communication strategies that could potentially engage people in gm 4 results 4 1 characteristics of participants the participants socioeconomic characteristics are shown in table 3 the sample included more male participants 54 1 than female participants 45 9 the proportion of participants with a bachelor s degree was the highest 48 0 whereas the proportion of participants with only a primary school education was the lowest 4 1 and 21 4 had a high school education level the number of participants reporting their income as lower than 462 usd month 15 000 baht month was equivalent to the number of participants reporting their income as higher than 1076 usd month 35 0001 baht month participants with an average income of 462 615 usd month 15 000 20 000 baht month accounted for 22 4 regarding types of groundwater users the largest group 33 7 mainly used groundwater for business and industrial activities while participants who focused on the existence of groundwater for the environment 12 2 constituted the smallest group the number of participants from public organizations where groundwater was utilized accounted for 22 5 of the sample and the proportions of participants who mainly used groundwater for household consumption and agricultural activities were 15 3 and 13 3 respectively 4 2 participation in groundwater management sense of responsibility perceived risks associated with threats to groundwater and degree of groundwater dependence table 4 presents levels of gm participation reported by participants as well as other variable scores participants reported low participation in both receiving information related to gm m 2 6 sd 0 800 and implementing groundwater policies and strategies m 2 2 1 1 0 800 the results of interviews revealed that many groundwater users did not clearly understand the legal processes to construct a well because of the complexity of the processes and many users did not comprehend information about groundwater situations in rayong groundwater basin moreover participants reported low participation in gm for instance when seeing an illegally constructed well people would not inform any responsible organization or take any action it was reported that illegally constructed wells could be seen in the area and each person had acceptable reasons to act in this illegal way in addition the result of a statistical test showed that the average score of participation in developing gm policies and strategies was 3 5 sd 1 0 this type of participation was more engaged by participants the result of interviews revealed that people recognized the importance of groundwater management policy they would cooperate with the department of groundwater resources when being asked to take part in the process regarding participants perceptions of risk with a total of score of 3 the average score of perceived possible adverse consequences to groundwater quantity and quality was 1 8 with a standard deviation of 0 6 participants recognized the possibility of change in groundwater resources both in terms of quality and quantity as both rayong and chonburi provinces are highly urbanized and have been experiencing economic growth constantly the demand for groundwater uses must be increased accordingly furthermore rayong groundwater basin is located nearby the coast thus the seawater intrusion could occur the statistical results also showed that with a total score of 5 the average score of perceived possible impacts suffered by participants was 3 7 with a standard deviation of 1 3 participants were aware of potential impacts particularly the impacts caused by degradation of groundwater quality due to heavy mental contamination from industrial activities the average score for sense of responsibility was 3 4 with a standard deviation of 0 9 considering participants level of groundwater dependence the number of groundwater wells participants possessed and the number of years the participants have used groundwater were investigated the result revealed that the average number of wells possessed by participants was 1 7 sd 1 8 and the average number of years utilizing groundwater was 7 5 sd 6 5 in the interviews participants stated that groundwater resources were very important for processing both economic and industrial activities in the area water supply services are costly and limited in the summer many factories and business sectors could benefit from the availability of groundwater resources in the area table 3 also shows the reliability of the scales as measured by cronbach s alpha all the variables showed good reliability with cronbach s alpha values higher than 0 70 these results implied that all the data gained from the survey were reliable and suitable for statistical analyses 4 3 role of risk perception sense of personal responsibility groundwater dependence and socioeconomic characteristics of participation in groundwater management table 5 shows three multiple regression models for predicting groundwater users participation in gm including participation in receiving information participation in developing policies and strategies and participation in policy implementation according to the results three types of participation were predicted by different sets of variables first the multiple regression model for predicting participation in receiving information was significant with f 9 88 4 707 p 0 000 the multiple correlation coefficient r was 0 570 and r squared was 0 325 based on these results approximately 32 5 of the variance in the level of participation in receiving information could be accounted for by the linear combination of all the predicting variables in addition the vif results were within the range of 1 29 1 73 less than the threshold value of ten field 2009 which implies that there was no multicollinearity regarding the variables that predicted the level of participation in receiving information sense of responsibility number of occupied wells and gender were significant predictors and considering beta values sense of responsibility was the most powerful males were also shown to be more actively engaged in receiving information related to groundwater the results showed that the multiple regression model to predict participation in developing groundwater policies and strategies was significant with f 9 88 4 975 p 0 000 r was 0 581 and r squared was 0 337 based on these results 33 7 of the variance in the level of participation in developing groundwater policies and strategies could be accounted for by the linear combination of all investigated variables only two variables were statistically significant at 1 sense of responsibility and participants perceptions of the possibility of their being affected by groundwater degradation the multiple regression analysis results also indicated that the model for predicting the level of participation in policy implementation was significant with f 9 88 7 627 p 0 000 r was 0 662 and r squared was 0 438 gender the number of wells the perceived possibilities of adverse consequences to groundwater and a sense of responsibility were all significant variables the perceived possibilities of adverse consequences to groundwater and a sense of responsibility were significant at the 5 level while gender and the number of occupied wells were significant at 1 participants having a higher level of sense of responsibility higher groundwater dependence and greater perceptions of the possibility of adverse consequences to groundwater reported more engagement in policy implementation in addition male participants were also more active in implementation 5 discussion and conclusion this study revealed that a sense of personal responsibility for groundwater resources management positively affected groundwater users participation in all stages of gm including participation in receiving information in groundwater policy and strategy development and in policy and strategy implementation these findings are consistent with the work of kaiser et al 1999 which indicated that individuals perceived sense of responsibility or personal norms could influence their decisions to take environmental actions similarly schwartz 1977 indicated that a strong sense of personal responsibility could direct individuals to engage in collectivistic behaviors many works in the field of natural resource conservation also found the related results showing that a sense of responsibility influenced people s participation in conservatory behaviors pradhananga et al 2015 2017 for instance valizadeh et al 2018 found that the variables of moral norms for water conservation could predict famers active participation in water conservation however this study found that the mere role of a sense of responsibility could not contribute to groundwater users decisions to engage in groundwater policy and strategy development and implementation perceived risks associated with threats to groundwater could play an important role in driving groundwater users motivation to take part in gm as presented in section 2 4 groundwater resources in this area have been facing risks associated with urbanization and intensive industrial development an increase in water demand potentially causes a negative impact on the elevation of the groundwater table moreover the area has been planned as an industrial development hub of the nation the future development can put a greater risk to groundwater resources in the area in this study people having risk perceptions related to adverse consequences to groundwater resources are expected to be more motivated to engage in gm the result revealed that participants with a strong sense of responsibility and a high level of risk perception tended to participate in both policy and strategy development and implementation as stated by braune and adams 2013 perceived threats to groundwater contributed to people s formation of awareness and sense of urgency and led them to implement gm action this study also provided more details related to the role of diverse risk perception based on different viewpoints the results of multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the perceived possibility of adverse consequences to groundwater quality and quantity significantly influenced groundwater users decisions to engage in policy implementation while the perceived possibility of being affected by groundwater degradation significantly influenced decisions to engage in policy and strategy development possibly when groundwater users recognized that they might be negatively affected by groundwater deterioration they felt a sense of urgency that led them to participate in policy development in cases when groundwater users were aware of the possibility of adverse consequences to groundwater because of natural threats and intensive groundwater use they decided to participate in implementing groundwater policies and strategies possibly groundwater users realize that by protecting groundwater resources from deterioration they must follow the regulation and cooperate with responsible organizations to implement the policy additionally the degree of groundwater dependence was also proved to be a powerful predictor of groundwater users decisions to engage in gm particularly in receiving information and in policy implementation a previous study related to people participating in water resource management revealed that the level of water resource dependence did not influence people s motivation to participate in water resource management jennewein and jones 2016 this was because most participants relied on surface water and the surface water resource was largely able to fill their demand compared to other types of natural resources such as forests or aquatic fisheries water resources are less tangible thus their value may not be well perceived the result of this study differed from those of jennewein and jones determining that the more people utilize groundwater the more they are motivated to engage in gm this result is similar to other studies that investigated the influence of natural resource dependence on participation in managing resources that were obviously tangible and scarce the degree of dependence on natural resources e g forest products or fisheries was found to drive people s motivation to engage in conservation protection and recovery actions lise 2000 zanetell and knuth 2004 dalton et al 2012 coulibaly lingani et al 2011 this study insists that the level of groundwater dependence potentially influences groundwater users motivation to participate in gm it is also important to consider participants genders when public participation in gm is promoted this study showed that males were significantly more actively engaged in gm than females particularly in receiving information and in policy implementation some other studies also found that females reported a significantly lower level of participation in water management than males wanjala 2009 were et al 2008 gm essentially requires some technical and scientific knowledge for developing and managing the resource males gaining more opportunities to access education and having more interest in the issue were therefore more motivated to participate in gm considering the practical contribution of this study it could be suggested that to enhance people s motivation to participate in groundwater management it is important to educate them with knowledge and information related to potential groundwater resource threats and their possible impacts on human well being this study also suggests that a sense of responsibility is just a basic requirement for encouraging people to engage in gm the mere role of this sense of responsibility cannot alone enhance people s efforts to engage in groundwater policy development and implementation the result of this investigation implied that people should be educated with knowledge related to potential threats to groundwater resources in the area such knowledge includes impacts of climate change on groundwater resources in rayong groundwater basin impacts of urbanization and industrialization and impacts of seawater intrusion on the groundwater basin educating people with general groundwater knowledge that is not relevant to their area risks facing failure in cultivating people s motivation in addition the link between groundwater deterioration situations and potential impacts on humans living should be understood by groundwater users so that they can estimate possible impacts they may experience leading to motivation to participate in gm levels of groundwater dependence are also important people who heavily rely on groundwater resources can take an important role in the participatory processes since the results of this study showed that this group of people would be more active than people who are less dependent on groundwater in addition more attention should be put to less dependent groundwater users since the result showed that they were more hesitate to engage in gm though being less dependent on groundwater without proper and sufficient groundwater knowledge these people can behave in ways that cause groundwater contamination finally females should be more involved in developing participatory strategies since females were determined to be less active participants in gm this is possibly because of the nature of female interest as well as capability females may require more capability enhancement in terms of relevant knowledge and information it is also important to consider institutional and legal frameworks which may enable the public to engage in participatory groundwater management as suggested by barthel and villholth 2017 formally or informally recognized coherent social institutions should be established to provide platforms for stakeholder cooperation and to facilitate effective decision making finally it could be highlighted that people s participation in gm can be influenced by other potential factors that are not investigated in this study those factors include time availability of groundwater users to participate in gm and social skills of governmental staffs who are responsible for conducting participatory groundwater management compliance with ethical standards conflict of interest the author declares no conflict of interest acknowledgement this research would have not been possible without financial support from groundwater development fund ministry of natural resources and environment thailand the authors would like to acknowledge the field supports from department of groundwater resources both central and local units and provincial office of natural resources and environment rayong province thailand most importantly the authors really appreciated the support from all groundwater users from various organizations such as schools private companies in rayong and chonburi provinces non governmental organizations ngos and people who have an interest in groundwater resources 
12233,researching citizens sense of personal responsibility to engage in groundwater resource management their perception of risks associated with potential threats to groundwater their degrees of dependence on groundwater resources and their socioeconomic characteristics this study aimed to investigate how these variables predict citizens engagement in groundwater resource management participation was divided into three categories participation in obtaining groundwater information in developing groundwater policies and strategies and in implementing those policies thailand s rayong groundwater basin which currently faces various threats such as seawater intrusion erratic rainfall and intensive use of groundwater for industrialization was chosen as a case study questionnaire surveys were conducted with the participants who were selected based on a purposive method focusing on groundwater users in five sectors the business and industrial agricultural household environmental and public organization sectors the results of multiple regression analyses revealed that the sense of personal responsibility alone could not highly motivate groundwater users to engage in groundwater policy development and implementation perceived risks associated with potential threats to groundwater resources significantly influenced participation in developing and implementing groundwater policies users degree of groundwater dependence also influenced their participation in obtaining information relevant to groundwater and in implementing policies males were determined to be more engaged in managing groundwater resources particularly in obtaining information and implementing policies this study suggests that a sense of personal responsibility and risk perceptions should be promoted together to enhance people s motivation and enthusiasm for cooperating with organizations responsible for sustainable groundwater management gm keywords groundwater resource management public participation sense of personal responsibility perceived risk associated with threats to groundwater 1 introduction groundwater resources provide massive services for human well being and the environment in many areas diverse human activities such as industrial manufacturing businesses and services household consumption agriculture and recreation are enormously dependent on groundwater resources currently groundwater resources are facing various threats including both natural e g geochemical processes associated with geological characteristics seawater intrusion and erratic rainfall and anthropogenic e g climate change related situations overexploitation urbanization and industrialization these threats cause problems associated with both the quantity and quality of groundwater resources for instance in india climate change potentially causes erratic rainfall and increases demands on groundwater usage among farmers who must adapt to new rainfall patterns fishman 2018 taraz 2017 ntanganedzeni et al 2018 showed that both geochemical processes e g ion exchange mineral dissolution and saline sources and contamination generated by human activities e g wastewater infiltration from domestic sewage and septic tank leakage and irrigation return flow affected groundwater quality in the coastal aquifer of tugela catchment in south africa several studies illustrated causes of groundwater quality degradation related to population growth hoque et al 2007 mpamba and hussen 2008 naik and tambe 2008 chang 2010 tabatabaei et al 2014 urban development sajikumar and remya 2015 tam and viet nga 2018 and industrial development in areas adjacent to groundwater basins abdelkader and brahim 2016 tamta 2003 for instance abdelkader and brahim 2016 demonstrated that overpumping of the groundwater aquifer in the coastal region of northwest oman caused the intrusion of seawater thus leading to deterioration of the groundwater quality regarding various threats to groundwater resources an effective management of groundwater resources is heavily needed however groundwater is difficult to manage because of its common pool nature common access potentially causes overexploitation rules regulations managerial processes and responsible institutions are therefore required for defining usage rights and supporting and implementing sustainable resource use dietz et al 2003 marothia et al 2003 anderies and janssen 2013 though effective rules have previously been set implementation of those rules has been unsuccessful many scholars identified that invisibility of groundwater resources and limitation of groundwater information caused failures in groundwater management unlike surface water groundwater is as the name suggests under the ground so its quality and quantity are difficult to inspect theesfeld 2010 policy makers usually cannot access all types of important information needed for creating effective management plans for instance it is difficult to clearly indicate the number of wells and the amount of water used theesfeld 2010 it is also difficult to understand how groundwater is used and essential to each group of people in a particular area implementing groundwater policies without gaining stakeholders support is therefore not successful responsibility for managing groundwater resources and overcoming management obstacles should not lie with only one organization each group of stakeholders possesses particular important resources which might benefit groundwater management therefore stakeholder engagement can ensure that a comprehensive range of interests relevant important knowledge and various perspectives are considered mutually shared and understood stakeholder engagement in management processes also contributes to mutual education as well as eliminating existing or potential conflicts and creating trust among stakeholders additionally stakeholder participation could help develop a better understanding of groundwater demands and disseminate scientific information employed by managers jakeman et al 2016 currently the engagement of groundwater users in gm is problematic since many groups of users are reluctant to participate in both policy decision making processes and policy implementation and monitoring some of them have no awareness of groundwater deterioration associated with their use and with severe natural events in other aspects the environment for fostering participation is not well prepared and managed by authorities holding gm power thus groundwater users are not motivated to engage in management processes kool and van steenbergen 2017 have indicated that social participation in gm still remains a challenge and documented participation efforts are required for guidance groundwater users sense of responsibility to engage in gm is thought to be an important driver of public participation in gm kaiser et al 1999 have indicated that public participation in natural resource management nrm is relatively driven by this sense of responsibility however to what extent and to which level of gm participation that sense of responsibility could be beneficial has never been empirically investigated furthermore water users perceived risks associated with potential threats to groundwater can be one possible driver of the gm participation braune and adams 2013 have suggested that lack of awareness about threats to groundwater potentially contribute to poor or no gm action because people have no sense of urgency people s risk perception could therefore motivate them to take part in gm however the way people judge and perceive risks can vary thus it is important to understand how each different viewpoint of risk judgment can motivate people to take part in gm in another facet degree of groundwater dependence which can reflect people s perceptions of groundwater value is also a potential driver of participation in gm it can be assumed that if people have high perceptions of groundwater value they may decide to engage in gm this study aims to investigate how groundwater users senses of responsibility perceptions of risks associated with potential threats to groundwater and levels of groundwater dependence affect their engagement in gm which includes their participation in obtaining information and in policy development and implementation the rayong groundwater basin in thailand was selected as a case study because it is facing several threats such as seawater intrusion erratic rainfall emergence of special economic development zone projects and rapid urbanization finally it is expected that the results of this study will provide some implications for promoting groundwater users participation in gm 2 literature review 2 1 public participation in groundwater management several pieces of literature indicate that public participation pp plays a significant role in creating shared relevant important knowledge and experiences that positively contribute to sustainable and equitable gm borowski and hare 2007 fritsch 2016 barthel and villholth 2017 for instance barthel and villholth 2017 indicated that threats to sustainable groundwater utilization could be effectively addressed through cooperation among stakeholders such as experts and a diverse group of practitioners more comprehensively quevauviller et al 2016 explained that pp is essential for planning and policy making pp can be used as a means for empowering individuals groups and local communities and as a means of improving the quality of decision making regarding the legal right of pp quevauviller et al 2016 added that people or social groups affected by decisions should have the opportunity to reflect their perspectives notions and needs becoming involved in decision making processes even though groundwater is difficult to manage because of its relative invisibility and the complexities surrounding its governance a decentralized management approach based on the principle of pp can improve decision making offer more effective solutions for long term groundwater sustainability and continuously ensure social equity newig et al 2005 ghose et al 2018 several key policy documents international guidelines and important regulatory initiatives such as the european water framework directive quevauviller et al 2005 integrated water resources management foster and ait kadi 2005 and the us clean water act carr et al 2012 mostert et al 2007 have emphasized the application of pp in water management for achieving sustainability regarding the core concept of pp the international association for public participation iap2 defined pp as any process that involves the public in problem solving or decision making and uses public input to make better decisions iap2 2003 much research related to pp has cited arnstein s ladder of citizen participation which indicates levels of citizen involvement in the decision making process in the urban planning context arnstein 1969 pretty 1995 classified the degree of participation according to the participants involvement in activities and their control over outcomes the level of participation pretty proposed ranges from manipulative in which power over development and decisions lies with people who are less relevant to the issues being handled or people who are outside the local community to self mobilized in which the local community take initiatives and has full power and control over the development michener 1998 classified participation into two types the planner centered approach and the people centered approach many other scholars have simply distinguished the degree of pp into three main levels including information supply consultation and active involvement arnstein 1969 mostert 2003 newig et al 2005 information supply means members of the public are authorized or encouraged to access documents or information from competent authorities consultation emphasizes more interactive communication between the public and public authorities members of the public are encouraged to exhibit their viewpoints opinions and concerns on the issues being handled through several channels such as interviews surveys in writing etc finally active involvement means the public is given the opportunity to actively participate in the decision making process by deliberatively discussing issues being handled and selecting solutions eu 2002 voices of the public can fully influence decisions in the context of water resource management the european water framework directive commission of the european communities 2000 has also distinguished participation into three levels information supply consultation and active involvement european commission 2003 cases are categorized as information supply when participants are provided with only information related to the results of decisions progress updates water management strategies or practical plans if participants are given opportunities to share ideas or comment on issues the case is categorized as consultation active involvement as the name suggests requires participants to actively contribute to water resource management processes participants can propose ideas and solutions and influence final decisions in active involvement all stakeholders such as water users public authorities provider organizations experts etc are required to participate similarly quevauviller et al 2016 have proposed three aspects of pp in gm including access to knowledge and information involvement in decision making processes for groundwater management e g opportunities to comment and access to justice right of legal review to promote pp in groundwater management effective social organization is a prerequisite for developing connections and platforms to foster communication among different stakeholder groups garduño et al 2010 lopez gunn and cortina 2006 van steenbergen 2006 ghose b et al 2018 noticed that poor coordination among stakeholders has led to an overall lack of accountability within management systems leonard and pelling 2010 added that inadequate collaboration among local leaders has hindered the formation of cooperation and social trust between leaders and local residents for collectively responding to contaminated groundwater considering the roles of groundwater users and other stakeholders in gm stakeholders can engage in several ways such as groundwater monitoring making rules on water use policing groundwater use implementing groundwater protection participating in setting targets and settling groundwater disputes garduño et al 2010 indicated that groundwater users should engage in the following activities 1 participating in local allocation access to groundwater 2 monitoring groundwater 3 engaging in implementation of gm plans 4 facilitating shared access and use of groundwater facilities 5 promoting demand reduction measures 6 engaging in recharge and retention measures 7 mobilizing additional water sources 8 participating in binding rules on water use 9 implementing groundwater protection measures 10 settling groundwater resource disputes 11 negotiating with other policy actors this study emphasizes enhancing the participation of groundwater users in gm groundwater users levels of participation in gm will be investigated participation in this study is classified into three types participation in obtaining information participation in developing gm policy and strategy and participation in implementing policies and plans 2 2 determinants of public participation in groundwater management 2 2 1 sense of personal responsibility this sense of personal responsibility reflects an individual s feeling of ownership over and responsibility for groundwater resources and management wondolleck and yaffee 2000 described the feeling of ownership as individuals sense of responsibility for and obligation to problem solving and public resource planning and management people s sense of personal responsibility for natural resource planning is also used to explain the term ownership in natural resources van riper 2003 mccool and guthrie 2001 when individuals have a sense of ownership over the resources they utilize the related sense of responsibility for managing those resources can be constructed followed by motivation to engage in management processes when offered opportunities to engage in these management processes people with strong feelings of responsibility potentially decide to take part in gm raufirad et al 2017 investigated determinants of natural resource users participation lpp in nrm in isfahan iran the result revealed that besides the sociocultural and religious beliefs that contributed to resource users decisions to engage in nrm a sense of responsibility toward sustainable natural resource management snrm was also an important factor kaiser et al 1999 indicated that a sense of responsibility or commitment is connected with a person s attitudes toward natural resources and it potentially influences that person s decision to engage in nrm to enhance people s sense of responsibility it is important that policy makers help potential participants feel invested important and influential in the nrm process zurba and trimble 2014 khalili et al 2014 2 2 2 risk perception individuals perceptions of the risks to natural resources associated with natural threats and human activities can construct in those individuals a sense of awareness and urgency they may consequently decide to take action in nrm braune and adams 2013 indicated that a lack of awareness about threats to groundwater causes a lack of developing and implementing gm actions because there is no sense of urgency theoretically individuals risk perceptions refers to their judgment of the negative consequences of a particular hazard aven and renn 2010 the world health organization who 2013 affirmed that risk perception can refer to natural hazards and threats to the environment or health risk perception can be constructed by both belief and self appraisal who 2013 aven and renn 2010 slovic and weber 2012 there are several ways of construing risks people s risk perception could be construed based on analytical thinking about the nature of risks leiserowitz et al 2001 leiserowitz 2006 people may judge the level of risk based on how they perceive the probability of environmental contamination of receiving impacts or of the severity of catastrophic consequences leiserowitz et al 2001 leiserowitz 2006 regarding the connection between risk perception and decisions to take action rogers 1957 proposed the protection motivation theory pmt which explains that individuals motivations to take protective actions depend on how they perceive risk associated with threats such as global climate change natural disasters and technological disasters rogers 1983 further explained that a decision to take actions is done based on the results of threat appraisal and coping appraisal threat appraisal refers to people s evaluation of the perceived severity of a threat and their evaluation of the perceived probability being negatively impacted by the threat threat appraisal also considers the reward which refers to perceptions of the benefits of current practices in addition to threat appraisal the protection motivation is also influenced by coping appraisal which refers to the degree to which individuals believe they can perform risk preventative behaviors however a negative relationship between risk perception and pp was also found in a previous study zanetell and knuth 2004 determined that a high level of concern for venezuelan fisheries had a negative relationship with participation in fishery management they called this situation as a defeatist attitude a term referring to people being highly concerned but believing that no intervention or action can solve the problem in the context of groundwater management it can be assumed that if groundwater users perceive a high risk associated with threats to groundwater resources and perceive the potential impacts they will possibly suffer they may decide to cooperate with responsible agencies to protect their resources 2 2 3 dependence on groundwater individuals dependence on groundwater resources reflects their interest in the resource if people recognize the benefits of the resource they may be more motivated to take action for sustaining the resource that provides their welfare lise 2000 zanetell and knuth 2004 dalton et al 2012 coulibaly lingani et al 2011 in addition when groundwater users recognize potential threats to groundwater users with a higher level of dependence on the resource may also be more aware of the threats thus they can be more enthusiastic in taking actions to protect the resource from deterioration tuinstra and wensem 2014 illustrated that awareness of groundwater value potentially contributes to balanced decisions for utilizing ecosystem services essentially groundwater stakeholders want to engage in gm because they have an interest in the resource therefore it is possible that people with a level of groundwater dependence also perceive groundwater as being highly valuable thus this group of people may be more active gm participants for example dalton et al 2012 clearly revealed that the outcome of public participation in the management of marine protected areas in the wider caribbean was influenced by the degree of resource dependence 2 2 4 socioeconomic characteristics it is important to consider the socioeconomic characteristics of stakeholders when pp in gm is promoted this is because people with different socioeconomic characteristics such as gender educational level career etc may have different motivations levels of awareness and capabilities for engaging in gm for instance males may be more capable and have more opportunities to participate in nrm depending on their surrounding cultures and educational access fonjong 2008 and machlis et al 1997 showed that sociodemographic attributes of a population such as age gender and educational level can demonstrate the sociocultural dimensions of nrm and thereby influence its level of sustainability jakeman et al 2016 added the assertion that social drivers including concerns for ecosystems and future generations influenced the demand for groundwater sustainability and protection several pieces of research have indicated that the social characteristics of stakeholders affected their decision to participate in nrm raufirad et al 2017 found a significant relationship between local people s education levels and their participation in nrm regarding the role of gender according wanjala 2009 females were not empowered to engage in water resource management due to poverty lack of education cultural beliefs and gender inequality therefore females were passive about participating in water management similarly were et al 2008 demonstrated that females in kenya exhibited a very low level of engagement in community groups with decision making powers for water management the explanation for this issue was that participatory activities might be organized at times of day when males were free and able to engage while females were too busy to attend additionally males typically control land access to water and public spaces therefore they rather than the females were encouraged to engage in water management by understanding stakeholders socioeconomic characteristics strategies to promote stakeholders gm engagement can be effectively developed 2 3 promotion of public participation in groundwater management in rayong groundwater basin thailand currently the department of groundwater resources ministry of natural resources and the environment thailand is officially responsible for sustainable groundwater management the issue of public participation and stakeholder collaboration was emphasized and taken into gm strategies between 2015 and 2018 department of groundwater resources 2015 in strategy no 3 enhancing the capability of gm authorities and promoting public gm participation was defined in addition the thai groundwater act 2520 1977 b c section 8 14 1 and section 15 stated that the minister should have the power with the advice of the committee to issue ministerial regulations prescribing the establishment of stakeholder networks for supporting groundwater resource management in a particular groundwater basin and enhancing public nrm participation royal gazette 1978 though the plan and regulations for encouraging pp in gm have already been launched in actuality pp in gm is still challenging and problematic poor participation in policy and lawmaking processes has caused problems for enforcing laws and implementing policies interviews with public officers of the department of groundwater resources revealed that many groundwater users illegally occupied groundwater wells and illegally pumped groundwater while public authorities did not have the sufficient capability to inspect all users since those wells were on private land therefore the department of groundwater resources pointed out that the only way to sustainably manage groundwater resources is to promote pp in each gm stage based on the current groundwater management system in thailand which is still centralized roles of pp are still limited by regulatory systems for instance only people having an educational degree in the field of geography or relevant disciplines can be hired as full time officers in the department of groundwater resources the organization therefore lacks staffs who have expertise in pp skills additionally local municipalities cannot gain full authority to manage groundwater resources they still work under decisions made by the central organization the department of groundwater resources therefore in this study only three types of pp in gm are investigated and these three types of pp can be carried out under the current regulatory system 1 participation in receiving information related to groundwater management to encourage users to obtain legal permissions for using groundwater and developing groundwater wells as well as to enhance their awareness of sustainable groundwater use users should clearly understand the process of license application and possess information or knowledge related to the groundwater situations in their areas 2 participation in developing gm policies such policies constitute practical regulations that are related to each specific local context 3 participation in implementing gm policies such participation may include monitoring the quality and quantity of groundwater resources complying with laws and regulations or informing responsible organizations about groundwater situations in the area if these types of pp are successful they will definitely improve gm 2 4 rayong groundwater basin thailand the rayong groundwater basin is located in the watershed of thailand s eastern coast districts in two provinces including rayong and chonburi are located in this basin these two provinces are home to many industrial factories which are important drivers of thailand s national economic development rayong province in particular contains a chemical industrial hub the map ta phut industrial estate where many petrochemical industries are located ieap 2015 the existence of many industries also induces the growth of urbanization in the area these phenomena increase demands for groundwater putting the resource at greater risk department of groundwater resources 2008 the watershed has a relatively limited groundwater potential the floodplain contains thailand s major rivers such as the yai canal to the north and south the river is predominantly composed of sandy sediment and clay and because the porosity of these materials is low the area s aquifer has a low quantity department of groundwater resources 2015 therefore the availability of groundwater for abstraction is minimal along coastal areas salt water can intrude creating brackish groundwater and the rayong groundwater basin is located on the eastern coastal watershed there are two types of groundwater to be obtained one from the fragile sediment aquifer and the other from the hard rock aquifer most of the region s groundwater comes from the aquifer located in sediment rock and hard rock on the floodplain the aquitards are layered on the aquifer and they are made of clay mixed sediment sand and gravelly sand the average groundwater yield is 20 50 m3 h department of groundwater resources 2008 the area of the case study is shown in fig 2 in this region groundwater is an alternative source of fresh water bureau of water management 2016 groundwater resources tremendously support the economic and industrial development of cities in the rayong groundwater basin however if there is utilization and water demand increases for industrial activities the elevation of the groundwater table which relies on each year s rainfall intensity can be affected precipitation itself can also influence the elevation of the groundwater table and groundwater quality bunsri et al 2004 this study found that groundwater demand is increased by both urbanization and industrialization moreover extensive development of industrial activities creates pollutants which can contaminate groundwater resources according to the characteristics of industrial activities in the area ieap 2015 groundwater may be contaminated by several heavy metals which may originate from domestic and industrial wastewater or waste such as leachate from landfills groundwater can also be naturally contaminated because of the basin s geographical characteristics bunsri et al 2004 currently iron fe contamination is considered the most common problem in the rayong groundwater basin contamination was found in the pluak daeng district and the rayong district this study s survey results also revealed a high concentration of iron in groundwater samples above the allowable limit furthermore seawater intrusion was observed in the rayong groundwater basin the seawater intrusion occurred along the floodplain at a coastal aquifer where there is an interface between fresh water and seawater according to the results of this project s water demand analysis the estimated water demands for domestic and industrial sectors were 3 25 and 290 million m3 per year respectively therefore the total water demand is 293 25 million m3 per year the available surface water in this area is only 240 million m3 per year saengow and wongkhean 2007 department of groundwater resources 2008 this means that the water demand is higher than the water supply and 53 25 million m3 per year are still required groundwater is a source of fresh water used to meet the demand however the availability of groundwater in some areas may still be lower than the demand causing water scarcity the utilization of groundwater in the rayong basin is divided into three types as follows 2 4 1 water for consumption as of 2011 a total of 21 90 million m3 of groundwater was consumed per year the water supply from the provincial waterworks authority pwa and the metropolitan waterworks authority mwa was consumed at a rate 16 33 million m3 per year provincial waterworks authority 2013 metropolitan waterworks authority 2013 the water supply from municipal water supply plants was consumed at a rate of 3 85 million m3 per year department of groundwater resources 2014 and that from private groundwater wells was consumed at a rate of 1 51 million m3 per year department of groundwater resources 2014 shallow wells provided approximately 0 21 million m3 of water per year department of groundwater resources 2014 most of the water consumed came from surface water resources approximately 85 84 or 18 79 million m3 per year groundwater resources provided approximately 14 16 or 3 10 million m3 per year 2 4 2 agricultural uses agriculture consumed the groundwater at a total of 9 51 million m3 per year department of groundwater resources 2014 most of the groundwater was abstracted from the region s unconfined aquifer and only a small amount of the remaining water use came from the confined aquifers at deeper layers 2 4 3 industrial uses based on the data from the pwa provincial waterworks authority 2013 and the records of water pumped from private groundwater wells department of groundwater resources 2014 a total of 6 66 million m3 was supplied to industries only private groundwater wells were accessed by the industries 2 5 participants participants in this study were selected based on purposive and random sampling methods focusing on people who depend on groundwater utilization in addition in the selection of participants we focused on those in the areas where groundwater resources were potentially threatened by human activities and seawater intrusion namely groundwater users living in nearby coastal areas and living in highly urbanized areas where many industrial plants and urban communities were chosen participants were divided into five groups as follows 1 business and industrial sector people who utilize groundwater for business or economic purposes 2 agricultural sector those whose agricultural activities such as gardening or farming rely on groundwater resources 3 household sector people who use groundwater for daily consumption and activities 4 public organization sector organizations that partially or fully use groundwater for consumption or activities 5 environmental sector people who do not directly use groundwater but realize that the existence of groundwater maintains the quality of the environment the number of participants in each group is identified in table 1 due to the nature of the area which contains diverse business and industrial activities and is an industrial hub of the country the number of participants from the business and industrial sector was double that of participants from each of the other sectors the number of participants from public organizations specifically schools was also 10 13 members higher than the number of participants from each of the other sectors because many schools in the area rely on groundwater for consumption and school activities in addition the department of groundwater resources established groundwater development projects in the schools 3 research methods 3 1 study framework to determine potential drivers of groundwater users gm participation this study investigated the influence of groundwater users perceptions of risks associated with potential threats to groundwater their sense of responsibility to gm their levels of groundwater dependence and their socioeconomic characteristics these points were studied as they relate to users gm participation including participation in receiving gm related information participation in developing policies and strategies and participation in implementing those policies or strategies perceived risks in this study were classified into two types 1 the perceived possibility of future adverse consequences to groundwater resources such as shortage and degraded quality caused by the current ways in which groundwater is extracted and consumed and 2 the perceived possibility of being personally affected by deteriorated groundwater quality and quantity both risk viewpoints can affect people s motivation to engage in gm this study assumed that higher levels of perceived risk associated with threats to groundwater a sense of responsibility and high levels of groundwater dependence would motivate groundwater users to engage in gm in addition the socioeconomic characteristics of groundwater users might also influence users capability and motivation to participate in gm the framework of this study is shown in fig 1 3 2 data collection interviews with participants were performed to investigate groundwater users opinions related to risk perception and their participation in gm questionnaire surveys were distributed in the area of the rayong groundwater basin factors indicators questions used and response categories are shown in table 2 in measuring levels of participation in receiving information participants were asked to indicate their frequency in receiving information about legal processes for well construction and groundwater situations in the area the department of groundwater resources has created many channels to communicate with groundwater users and the general public about these two issues those efforts include creating community networks organizing training or workshops organizing exhibitions and meeting with local communities in measuring levels of participation in developing relevant policies and strategies participants were asked to indicate their frequency in participating in meetings or events that the department of groundwater resources had organized for sharing information with the public or gathering groundwater users perspectives with the purpose of developing groundwater management policies for the measurement of participation in implementing policies or strategies participants were asked to indicate their frequency in informing responsible organizations about groundwater situations such as contamination groundwater shortage and the like currently in implementing policies groundwater users are encouraged to share information about groundwater situations with the department of groundwater resources and a local stakeholder network containing diverse groups such as community leaders local units of the department of groundwater resources nongovernmental organizations ngos or local authorities moreover groundwater users are required to receive official permission to use groundwater resources thus they need to inform the responsible organization before constructing a well all corrected data were carefully inspected content validity was confirmed based on the face validity technique and it was tested against participants whose characteristics were similar to the sample group in addition cronbach s alpha was calculated to test the internal consistency of the scales used for measuring all variables in this study the values of cronbach s alpha were above 0 7 which ensured that the data gained from the questionnaires were reliable data collection was carried out from december 2017 to march 2018 response rates for each group of participants are shown in table 1 3 3 data analysis multiple regression analyses were performed to test the effects of variables including sense of responsibility perceived risks associated with potential threats degrees of dependence on groundwater and socioeconomic characteristics on levels gm participation three multiple regression models were presented to demonstrate significant variables predicting each step of gm participation including participation in obtaining relevant information participation in developing groundwater policies and strategies and participation in implementing those policies and strategies the results provided implications for developing communication strategies that could potentially engage people in gm 4 results 4 1 characteristics of participants the participants socioeconomic characteristics are shown in table 3 the sample included more male participants 54 1 than female participants 45 9 the proportion of participants with a bachelor s degree was the highest 48 0 whereas the proportion of participants with only a primary school education was the lowest 4 1 and 21 4 had a high school education level the number of participants reporting their income as lower than 462 usd month 15 000 baht month was equivalent to the number of participants reporting their income as higher than 1076 usd month 35 0001 baht month participants with an average income of 462 615 usd month 15 000 20 000 baht month accounted for 22 4 regarding types of groundwater users the largest group 33 7 mainly used groundwater for business and industrial activities while participants who focused on the existence of groundwater for the environment 12 2 constituted the smallest group the number of participants from public organizations where groundwater was utilized accounted for 22 5 of the sample and the proportions of participants who mainly used groundwater for household consumption and agricultural activities were 15 3 and 13 3 respectively 4 2 participation in groundwater management sense of responsibility perceived risks associated with threats to groundwater and degree of groundwater dependence table 4 presents levels of gm participation reported by participants as well as other variable scores participants reported low participation in both receiving information related to gm m 2 6 sd 0 800 and implementing groundwater policies and strategies m 2 2 1 1 0 800 the results of interviews revealed that many groundwater users did not clearly understand the legal processes to construct a well because of the complexity of the processes and many users did not comprehend information about groundwater situations in rayong groundwater basin moreover participants reported low participation in gm for instance when seeing an illegally constructed well people would not inform any responsible organization or take any action it was reported that illegally constructed wells could be seen in the area and each person had acceptable reasons to act in this illegal way in addition the result of a statistical test showed that the average score of participation in developing gm policies and strategies was 3 5 sd 1 0 this type of participation was more engaged by participants the result of interviews revealed that people recognized the importance of groundwater management policy they would cooperate with the department of groundwater resources when being asked to take part in the process regarding participants perceptions of risk with a total of score of 3 the average score of perceived possible adverse consequences to groundwater quantity and quality was 1 8 with a standard deviation of 0 6 participants recognized the possibility of change in groundwater resources both in terms of quality and quantity as both rayong and chonburi provinces are highly urbanized and have been experiencing economic growth constantly the demand for groundwater uses must be increased accordingly furthermore rayong groundwater basin is located nearby the coast thus the seawater intrusion could occur the statistical results also showed that with a total score of 5 the average score of perceived possible impacts suffered by participants was 3 7 with a standard deviation of 1 3 participants were aware of potential impacts particularly the impacts caused by degradation of groundwater quality due to heavy mental contamination from industrial activities the average score for sense of responsibility was 3 4 with a standard deviation of 0 9 considering participants level of groundwater dependence the number of groundwater wells participants possessed and the number of years the participants have used groundwater were investigated the result revealed that the average number of wells possessed by participants was 1 7 sd 1 8 and the average number of years utilizing groundwater was 7 5 sd 6 5 in the interviews participants stated that groundwater resources were very important for processing both economic and industrial activities in the area water supply services are costly and limited in the summer many factories and business sectors could benefit from the availability of groundwater resources in the area table 3 also shows the reliability of the scales as measured by cronbach s alpha all the variables showed good reliability with cronbach s alpha values higher than 0 70 these results implied that all the data gained from the survey were reliable and suitable for statistical analyses 4 3 role of risk perception sense of personal responsibility groundwater dependence and socioeconomic characteristics of participation in groundwater management table 5 shows three multiple regression models for predicting groundwater users participation in gm including participation in receiving information participation in developing policies and strategies and participation in policy implementation according to the results three types of participation were predicted by different sets of variables first the multiple regression model for predicting participation in receiving information was significant with f 9 88 4 707 p 0 000 the multiple correlation coefficient r was 0 570 and r squared was 0 325 based on these results approximately 32 5 of the variance in the level of participation in receiving information could be accounted for by the linear combination of all the predicting variables in addition the vif results were within the range of 1 29 1 73 less than the threshold value of ten field 2009 which implies that there was no multicollinearity regarding the variables that predicted the level of participation in receiving information sense of responsibility number of occupied wells and gender were significant predictors and considering beta values sense of responsibility was the most powerful males were also shown to be more actively engaged in receiving information related to groundwater the results showed that the multiple regression model to predict participation in developing groundwater policies and strategies was significant with f 9 88 4 975 p 0 000 r was 0 581 and r squared was 0 337 based on these results 33 7 of the variance in the level of participation in developing groundwater policies and strategies could be accounted for by the linear combination of all investigated variables only two variables were statistically significant at 1 sense of responsibility and participants perceptions of the possibility of their being affected by groundwater degradation the multiple regression analysis results also indicated that the model for predicting the level of participation in policy implementation was significant with f 9 88 7 627 p 0 000 r was 0 662 and r squared was 0 438 gender the number of wells the perceived possibilities of adverse consequences to groundwater and a sense of responsibility were all significant variables the perceived possibilities of adverse consequences to groundwater and a sense of responsibility were significant at the 5 level while gender and the number of occupied wells were significant at 1 participants having a higher level of sense of responsibility higher groundwater dependence and greater perceptions of the possibility of adverse consequences to groundwater reported more engagement in policy implementation in addition male participants were also more active in implementation 5 discussion and conclusion this study revealed that a sense of personal responsibility for groundwater resources management positively affected groundwater users participation in all stages of gm including participation in receiving information in groundwater policy and strategy development and in policy and strategy implementation these findings are consistent with the work of kaiser et al 1999 which indicated that individuals perceived sense of responsibility or personal norms could influence their decisions to take environmental actions similarly schwartz 1977 indicated that a strong sense of personal responsibility could direct individuals to engage in collectivistic behaviors many works in the field of natural resource conservation also found the related results showing that a sense of responsibility influenced people s participation in conservatory behaviors pradhananga et al 2015 2017 for instance valizadeh et al 2018 found that the variables of moral norms for water conservation could predict famers active participation in water conservation however this study found that the mere role of a sense of responsibility could not contribute to groundwater users decisions to engage in groundwater policy and strategy development and implementation perceived risks associated with threats to groundwater could play an important role in driving groundwater users motivation to take part in gm as presented in section 2 4 groundwater resources in this area have been facing risks associated with urbanization and intensive industrial development an increase in water demand potentially causes a negative impact on the elevation of the groundwater table moreover the area has been planned as an industrial development hub of the nation the future development can put a greater risk to groundwater resources in the area in this study people having risk perceptions related to adverse consequences to groundwater resources are expected to be more motivated to engage in gm the result revealed that participants with a strong sense of responsibility and a high level of risk perception tended to participate in both policy and strategy development and implementation as stated by braune and adams 2013 perceived threats to groundwater contributed to people s formation of awareness and sense of urgency and led them to implement gm action this study also provided more details related to the role of diverse risk perception based on different viewpoints the results of multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the perceived possibility of adverse consequences to groundwater quality and quantity significantly influenced groundwater users decisions to engage in policy implementation while the perceived possibility of being affected by groundwater degradation significantly influenced decisions to engage in policy and strategy development possibly when groundwater users recognized that they might be negatively affected by groundwater deterioration they felt a sense of urgency that led them to participate in policy development in cases when groundwater users were aware of the possibility of adverse consequences to groundwater because of natural threats and intensive groundwater use they decided to participate in implementing groundwater policies and strategies possibly groundwater users realize that by protecting groundwater resources from deterioration they must follow the regulation and cooperate with responsible organizations to implement the policy additionally the degree of groundwater dependence was also proved to be a powerful predictor of groundwater users decisions to engage in gm particularly in receiving information and in policy implementation a previous study related to people participating in water resource management revealed that the level of water resource dependence did not influence people s motivation to participate in water resource management jennewein and jones 2016 this was because most participants relied on surface water and the surface water resource was largely able to fill their demand compared to other types of natural resources such as forests or aquatic fisheries water resources are less tangible thus their value may not be well perceived the result of this study differed from those of jennewein and jones determining that the more people utilize groundwater the more they are motivated to engage in gm this result is similar to other studies that investigated the influence of natural resource dependence on participation in managing resources that were obviously tangible and scarce the degree of dependence on natural resources e g forest products or fisheries was found to drive people s motivation to engage in conservation protection and recovery actions lise 2000 zanetell and knuth 2004 dalton et al 2012 coulibaly lingani et al 2011 this study insists that the level of groundwater dependence potentially influences groundwater users motivation to participate in gm it is also important to consider participants genders when public participation in gm is promoted this study showed that males were significantly more actively engaged in gm than females particularly in receiving information and in policy implementation some other studies also found that females reported a significantly lower level of participation in water management than males wanjala 2009 were et al 2008 gm essentially requires some technical and scientific knowledge for developing and managing the resource males gaining more opportunities to access education and having more interest in the issue were therefore more motivated to participate in gm considering the practical contribution of this study it could be suggested that to enhance people s motivation to participate in groundwater management it is important to educate them with knowledge and information related to potential groundwater resource threats and their possible impacts on human well being this study also suggests that a sense of responsibility is just a basic requirement for encouraging people to engage in gm the mere role of this sense of responsibility cannot alone enhance people s efforts to engage in groundwater policy development and implementation the result of this investigation implied that people should be educated with knowledge related to potential threats to groundwater resources in the area such knowledge includes impacts of climate change on groundwater resources in rayong groundwater basin impacts of urbanization and industrialization and impacts of seawater intrusion on the groundwater basin educating people with general groundwater knowledge that is not relevant to their area risks facing failure in cultivating people s motivation in addition the link between groundwater deterioration situations and potential impacts on humans living should be understood by groundwater users so that they can estimate possible impacts they may experience leading to motivation to participate in gm levels of groundwater dependence are also important people who heavily rely on groundwater resources can take an important role in the participatory processes since the results of this study showed that this group of people would be more active than people who are less dependent on groundwater in addition more attention should be put to less dependent groundwater users since the result showed that they were more hesitate to engage in gm though being less dependent on groundwater without proper and sufficient groundwater knowledge these people can behave in ways that cause groundwater contamination finally females should be more involved in developing participatory strategies since females were determined to be less active participants in gm this is possibly because of the nature of female interest as well as capability females may require more capability enhancement in terms of relevant knowledge and information it is also important to consider institutional and legal frameworks which may enable the public to engage in participatory groundwater management as suggested by barthel and villholth 2017 formally or informally recognized coherent social institutions should be established to provide platforms for stakeholder cooperation and to facilitate effective decision making finally it could be highlighted that people s participation in gm can be influenced by other potential factors that are not investigated in this study those factors include time availability of groundwater users to participate in gm and social skills of governmental staffs who are responsible for conducting participatory groundwater management compliance with ethical standards conflict of interest the author declares no conflict of interest acknowledgement this research would have not been possible without financial support from groundwater development fund ministry of natural resources and environment thailand the authors would like to acknowledge the field supports from department of groundwater resources both central and local units and provincial office of natural resources and environment rayong province thailand most importantly the authors really appreciated the support from all groundwater users from various organizations such as schools private companies

12234,global fresh water resources are finite and are rapidly diminishing due to poor water management and increasing population at alarming rate in the view of this quality water studies were undertaken for total 11 water samples from various resources via surface ground and thermal spring water of konkan division india samples were collected and experimental analyses of its various physio chemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds total hardness cation such as na k ca2 mg2 and anions such as cl hco3 so42 f br the suitability of water quality to meet drinking and irrigation standards in the study area were assessed using chemical indices like sodium absorption ratio percentage of sodium na kelly ratio kr permeability index pi were calculated indicating high overall salinity hazard in the study area which maybe as a result of intrusion of sea water as study area lies near the coastal arena piper plots gibbs diagram stiff diagram wilcox diagram were used to evaluate irrigation suitability indicating sodium and calcium along with chloride dominance due to evaporation or dissolution which can be correlated from gibbs diagram

indispensable resource furnished by nature water is present in many forms such as ocean sea river groundwater and springs most of the daily human activities require ample quantities of water there has been an immense hike in demand of fresh water due to population explosion intense agricultural activities urbanization and standard of living domestic and industrial uses talabi et al 2015 nematollahi et al 2016 on the other hand the resources of accessible fresh water are decreasing due to overuse annapoorna and janardhana 2015 there is a huge gap in the demand and supply of water amalraj and pius 2018 groundwater is a vital source of fresh water predominantly in india due to variability and uncertainty of rain joshi et al 2009 jain et al 2011 raju and singh 2017 it contributes up to 20 of the world s fresh water supply the lack of surface water to fulfil the necessity has led to the extensive use of groundwater ahmed et al 2013 ghalib 2017 wells are the main means of extracting groundwater adams et al 2001 kumar et al 2016 during the rainy season the wells are enriched with water but these wells are over extracted either for domestic use or commercial purpose as a result wells go dry within a few months this creates a problem for potable water in the non monsoon period and the dependency on other sources such as water tankers increases islam et al 2014 as india is an agricultural based country with main sources of irrigation water coming from rivers and groundwater in many rural regions of india people sustain only on groundwater saba and umar 2016 due to the scarcity of rain in many regions use of groundwater utilization for irrigation has increased also groundwater is recognized as much cleaner than the surface water so it becomes world s most extracted raw material but due to interaction of country rock with water and various other anthropogenic leads to the development of secondary mineral phases ahmed et al 2015 many activities such as rapid industrialization excessive use of phosphate fertilizers pesticides herbicides and overutilization of groundwater have led to the deployment of a large quantity of unwanted contaminants into groundwater and surface water ximing et al 2003 use of polluted water for irrigation can cause serious damage to crop and consequently harms the health etteieb et al 2017 people all over the world reckon groundwater for drinking shankar et al 2011 so the presence of contaminants in groundwater or any other water available from other source utilized in drinking can lead to serious health effects tanttu and jokela 2018 thus the hydro geochemical assessment of the water is essential while utilizing it for drinking and irrigation shah et al 2018a 2018b maharashtra is india s second most densely populous state and has immense potable water demand maharashtra has 24 drought prone area of the country in groundwater rich areas over extraction of groundwater has been observed with emphasis on cash crops such as sugarcane bananas grapes and oranges maharashtra has 49 polluted rivers which makes the highest number of polluted rivers in the country in present paper evaluation has been carried out in the konkan division of maharashtra it occupies the entire west coast of the state people residing in the study area have agriculture as their main occupation thus the quality of water needs to be ensured before being utilized for drinking and irrigation purpose kumar et al 2015 irrigation water is classified on the basis of sodium absorption ratio sar who 1989 sar indicates the degree to which the irrigation water tends to enter into cation exchange reaction in soil excess sodium changes the soil properties by getting absorbed on the soil particles which also results in decrease in permeability ayers and bronson 1975 guy 1995 so percentage of sodium is very important to identify water quality hosseinifrad and aminiyan 2015 kelly has suggested formula for the sodium content in irrigation water based on which it s suitability could be very conveniently worked on the basis of the values of kelly s ratio as per kelly 1951 sodium ion is measured against calcium and magnesium for considering this parameter permeability index is also used to indicate the suitability of water the soil permeability is affected by long term irrigation influenced by na ca2 mg2 and hco3 contents of the soil güngör and arslan 2016 piper diagram is used to interpret the suitability of chemical type of groundwater it indicates the chemical composition of the water which is controlled by dissolution and mixing of irrigation return flow ali et al 2018 roy et al 2018 the chemical composition of groundwater is significantly influenced by weathering and anthropogenic inputs for which the gibbs diagram used the gibbs diagram establishes the relationship of water composition and aquifer lithological characteristics gibbs 1970 stiff diagram indicates the composition in terms of common cations and anions with concentration represented in electrical equivalents stiff diagram graphically represents the common cations and anions with their concentration in their electrical equivalents which influences the water quality this diagram also investigates dominant cation and anion the water quality index wqi is calculated for evaluating influence of natural and anthropogenic activities based on several key parameters of groundwater chemistry as wqi is one of the most effective tools used in passing information on the quality of water to the concerned citizens and policy makers atulegwu and njoku 2004 adimalla et al 2018 khadse et al 2016 there are numerous studies carried out on water quality assessment in many parts of india for its suitability in irrigation and drinking brindha and elango 2011 carried out research on groundwater assessment in madhuranthakan tamil nadu and india groundwater assessment was conducted to study its fitness in drinking and irrigation means samples from 20 wells were analyzed 85 of the samples were permissible for irrigation also 95 of samples were fresh and appropriate for drinking vincy et al 2015 has studied on hydrochemical characterization for irrigation and drinking purpose in meenachil river basin western ghats kerala india water samples from 41 wells were used to carry out the study water was observed to be unsuitable for drinking but could be used for irrigation khan et al 2015 and balaji et al 2017 conducted their studies in specific region of different states of india i e west bengal uttar pradesh andhra pradesh respectively majority of samples were found to be admissible for both drinking and irrigation in above mentioned studies ali and ali 2018 and srinivas 2017 carried out their research in particular area of uttar pradesh and tamil nadu respectively concluded that water was unfit for drinking as well as irrigation few hydrochemical studies on water in semi arid countries like tunisia etteieb et al 2017 and iraq hosseinifard and aminiyan 2015 also showed unsuitability of water in drinking and irrigation purpose shah et al 2019a 2019b the main intent of the paper is to evaluate the permissibility of water in irrigation and drinking purpose 2 study area the study area is situated in konkan division of maharashtra includes from sativali to rajapur which has distance of about 420 km fig 1 study area falls between 19 37 51 6 to 16 38 44 2 lattitude and 72 54 32 to 73 31 52 longitude area is restricted on west by arabian sea and on east by sahyadri crests by the kankavali in south and nala sopara in north see fig 2 area receives rainfall of 2000 3000 mm annually and climate is highly humid all over the year because of being in the proximity of the sea temperature through out the division varies from 17 1 c to 40 7 c with the highest temperature being record in the month of may however the fluctuation is less frequent due to the influence of close to the marinal environment thane district which is part of konkan division has 33 thermal springs which are categorised into 5 groups amidst which samples were taken from vajreshwari group akloli area and sativali group total 7 samples were collected from thermal springs 2 from ground water and 2 from river surface water mostly thermal springs were observed on the fringe of dykes soil of the region is predominantly of basalt which is converted to laterite because of climate and topography of the region granites and gneiss moreover the area is also characterised by coastal alluvial soil clay loom and coarse sandy soils and laterite soils laterite soils has less phosphorus and potash content also lime and organic material while coastal alluvial soil is found all along the west coast which has varying content of salt according to the distance from sea coastal soil is important for agriculture and horticulture point of view and fertility of the soil is dependent on the proportion of clay in them however there is only small proportion of this type of soil clay loom and coarse sandy soils are formed from deccan trap and are low in basic and medium acidic in nature industries of the surrounding area are dependent on the geological resources region for their raw materials and power supplies konkan has the population of approximately 7 million excluding greater bombay among which 55 8 are directly dependent on agriculture ubale 2012 3 materials and methods the present research work is based to investigate the water quality for irrigation and drinking purposes eleven water samples have been studied from different regions of konkan area the water samples were assessed to show its characteristics towards irrigational development in the study area preservation of samples carried out in a way that it could not reduce the rate of any biological or chemical reactions the parameters such as temperature and ph were measured in the field using thermometric and electrometric methods respectively after the collection of samples these were evaluated in the laboratory to know the concentration of various components in each water samples for which 13 physical and chemical parameters comprising of major ion concentrations na k ca 2 mg 2 cl hco3 so4 2 f br sio2 temperature c ph electrical conductivity nagaraju et al 2016 to determine the concentration of other significant ions researchers have used the standard sampling method as mentioned in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical facies graphical representation of collected samples major dissolved constituents major cations and major anions helps in understanding its hydrochemical evolution grouping and areal distribution belkhiri and mouni 2012 mostafa et al 2017 in the present study piper trilinear diagram stiff diagram and gibbs ratio plot were constructed to evaluate variation in hydrochemical facies piper diagram is a graphical representation made in such a way that the milli equivalent percentage of the major cations and anions are plotted in a separate triangle these points plotted in triangular fields are projected further in the central diagram field which enables to provide the overall character of water piper 1944 plot are utilized to understand to understand the hydrochemistry of the water and process involved in it as chlorine is good indicator for mixing phenomenon relationship of between different water bodies and processes influencing their chemical composition was investigated throught use of major concentration versus cl concentration shanmugasundharam et al 2017 water quality depends on various factors such as topography nature of bedrock soil atmosphere and air precipitation ravikumar et al 2015 in our study area most of water samples fall in calcium sulphate and sodium chloride regime that indicates gypsum ground water and marine or deep ancient ground water simultaneously few of our samples also lies in the quadrant of calcium bicarbonate in diamond plot which indicates the origin of shallow fresh ground water sodium content in water is dangerous for drinking and irrigation as it contributes to exceed the value of sar high sodium and chloride content in water is because of ocean influences of study area being near coastal area or maybe due to dissolution or anthropogenic activities li et al 2016 water having higher sodium contributes to sodium salts in the soil solution through the capillary rise following surface evaporation in order to understand the relation of the chemical components of water from the respective aquifer lithologies a diagram was proposed by gibbs 1970 gibbs diagram gives the information on natural mechanics controlling water evaporation dominance rock weathering dominance precipitation dominance which reveals the information on the possible source of that resulting hydrochemistry of water fig 3 for the gibbs cation ratio the bivariate plot is drawn of tds v s cation ratio whereas for gibbs anion the anion ratio is considered gibbs ratio i c l c l h c o 3 gibbs ratio ii n a k n a k c a 2 where the ionic concentrations are in mg kg for our study area the gibbs ratio i ranges from 0 9929 to 0 0609 with average value of 0 5913 and gibbs ratio ii ranges from 0 9442 to 0 2587 with average value of 0 5968 with the tds value range from 2653 2 to 107 468 with average of 984 1386 five sample fall in rock dominance in case of gibbs anion ratio and four samples to rock dominance and four to evaporation dominance for in case of gibbs cation ratio hence can be deduce that groundwater chemistry is controlled by rock dominance and to some extent by evaporation dominance leading to the increasing salinity and therefore poor water quality in addition samples falling outside the undefined fields may indicate anthropogenic activities that result in altering the chemistry of the groundwater statistically the presence of different components was evaluated using stiff diagram that enables the graphical representation of the major ions present in the water sample stiff 1951 singh and kumar 2015 typically stiff diagrams plots the cations on left of center axis and anions on right of center axis having equivalent concentrations where the concentrations represented in electrical equivalents meq l from fig 4 it is evident that na cation is high dominance among the cations where cl is high dominance among the anions this indicates the most predominant water type is na cl water type in study area the concentration orders for cations is na ca 2 mg 2 k and for anions is cl so4 2 hco3 f br only for few samples of river and ground water the cl ion is not dominant where hco3 ion is dominant which can be interpreted as deep groundwater influenced by high ion exchange 4 2 suitability for irrigation suitability of water for irrigation was evaluated using salinity hazard present using wilcox diagram for the classification of irrigation water wilcox 1955 based on which simple scatter of sodium hazard sar on y axis versus salinity hazard ec on x axis ec is by default in a log scale fig 5 in our study area the samples fall in c1s1 are three which belong to kalji river amba surface water sov which is ground water sample of area can be used for irrigation for all type of crops including crops sensitive to sodium hazard two samples belong to c2s1 of aravali which is ground water and rapapur unhale which is thermal springs can be used for irrigation for crops having medium salinity tolerance like farming of salinity tolerance potatoes two samples belong to c3s2 of tural and dasgaon area of thermal springs can be used for irrigation for crops having good drainage system rest of samples fall in c4s2 and c4s3 which can t be used for irrigation as having high sodium content or special treatment is required to meet irrigation standards to samples belonging to thermal springs where areas having over exploitation and subsequent sea intrusion which may increase the sodium content kumar et al 2014 sakram and adimalla 2018 sodium ion measured against calcium and magnesium ion is considered for calculating this parameter kelly 1940 kelly s ratio enables to determine the hazardous effect of sodium on water quality for irrigation purposes in terms of kelly s ratio kelly s ratio value showing more than 1 indicates more amount of sodium in water hence water is unsuitable for irrigation purposes kelly 1963 k r n a c a 2 m g 2 where the ionic concentration are in mg kg kelly s ratio calculated for our study area which ranges from 0 257 to 16 551 with an average of 3 797 most of samples are unsuitable for irrigation having value greater than 1 for kelly ratio except samples from kalji river amba surface water and sov aravali ground water thus the sodium content is very high in the region making the filtration of crops difficult shammi et al 2016 classification on the basis of sodium percentage table 2 allows more viable approach to the salinity of the study area and can be interpreted that few samples including river water and ground water can be used for irrigation purpose as high salt concentration influence osmotic pressure of the soil solution and affect the ability of plants to absorbs the water through the roots glover 1996 suitability of water based on classification by usda united states department of agriculture using electrical conductivity ec parameter samples of the study area falls within all classes of water indicating the high fluctuation table 3 samples of few river water and groundwater can be used for irrigation purpose based on the requirements as crops which are highly sensitive may take the damage based on individual crop permissible limit the water for the same should be selected see tables 4 6 sodium absorption ratio sar is a common index of suitability of water to meet the irrigation standards as it is determined from the concentrations of the main alkaline and earth alkaline cations present in the water asadollahfardi et al 2013 nagaraju et al 2014 high the concentration of sodium ion negatively affect the soil integrity and reduces the permeability causing infiltration problems rahman et al 2014 sodium and potassium ion make the dispersion of clay particles easier while calcium and magnesium promote flocculation suarez 1974 s a r n a 1 2 c a 2 m g 2 where the ionic concentration are in mg kg hence high value of sar is not favourable for the irrigation table 4 suitability of water to for irrigation of study area for which sar value range from 2 037 to 79 724 with average of 29 5523 most of the sample of thermal springs are above the range of 27 which is unsuitable for irrigation however sample from kalji river amba surface water and sov aravalli ground water samples are within the permissible limit and is suitable for the irrigation permeability index is an essential parameter to evaluate the quality of irrigation water in relation to soil for improvement in agriculture thilagavathi et al 2012 thivya et al 2013 the salinization of the groundwater would be expected to result from increase in ionic concentrations due to evaporation of recharge water or maybe due to intrusion of seawater as study area lies within the coastal arena mirabbasi et al 2008 on the basis of formula below the suitability of sample for irrigation were calculated p i n a h c o 3 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a where the concentration of the samples were in mg kg the permeability of the soil is influenced by sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate reddy 2013 suitability of water for irrigation based on permeability such assessment was done by doneen 1964 accordingly the water can be classified as class i class ii and class iii orders among which class i categorised as favourable for irrigation since have 75 or more maximum permeability class ii moderately suitable since have 25 75 permeability class iii are unsuitable since they have maximum 25 permeability in our study area the minimum value of permeability is 40 9737 whereas the maximum is 96 9927 eight samples belong to class ii whereas rest three belong to class i which are aravalli of ground water tural rajapur unhale of thermal springs having suitability for irrigation based on doneen s classification hence the overall permeability of the area was suitable for irrigation based on the classification 4 3 suitability for drinking electrical conductivity electrical conductivity is the property of the water to transmit electric current it depends on the availability of ions their total concentration

negative logarithm of hydrogen ion concentration ph log h presence in the solution in collected samples ph is greater than 7 means most of the samples are basic in nature sircar et al 2015 shah et al 2019a 2019b 4 3 1 total dissolve solid tds total dissolve solid is define as the suspended and dissolved matter in water in samples of water tds ranges from 140 to 2500 again sov well has lowest tds compared to other well according to who specification tds up to 500 mg l is the highest desirable and up to 1500 mg l is maximum permissible srinivas et al 2017 based on the tds observed ground water can be classified as fresh brackish saline and brine for fresh water tds must be less than 500 for brackish water it varied from 1000 to 10 000 for saline tds varied from 10 000 100 0000 and for brine it is more than 100 000 raju 2007 calcium is most important parameter for shell construction and bone building in our case well no 10 has lowest concentration of calcium while akloli well has maximum calcium along with magnesium is one of the important parameter for the calculation of hardness of the water these elements are most abundant in surface and ground water and exists mainly as bicarbonate the contamination of chloride in drinking water arises from sewage and industrial effluents in most of the samples chlorine varies from 12 to 1410 the concentration of na in samples varied from 8 06 to 587 na is one of the most abundant element among cation this is because of the silicate weathering or dissolution of soil salts stored by the influences of evaporation anthropogenic activities agricultural activities and poor drainage conditions k is natural occurring element but its concentration is lowest among the cation in samples potassium vary only from 0 18 to 17 9 the concentration of carbonates is mainly a function of dissolved co2 temperature ph cations and other dissolved salts the concentration of bicarbonate observed from 10 to 255 according to the who if the concentration of sulphate exceeds the maximum allowable limit of 400 mg l it will react with human organs in our sample sulphate is observed 0 2 275 drinking water quality was evaluated using the water quality index wqi drinking water quality analysis based on the various physico chemical parameter such as eh conductivity tds and presence of various elements such as sodium potassium calcium magnesium sulphate and bicarbonate were ardent to find out the water quality index of the given wells the objective of water quality index is to provide us suitable information regarding the use of water for public industrial or agriculture purposestable 6 salifu et al 2017 to calculate the water quality index the weight has been assigned for various physico chemical parameter according to their priority in over all quality of the water the assigned weight ranges from 1 to 5 li et al 2015 the maximum weight of 5 is assigned for the tds 1 for magnesium 2 for ca na and k 3 for hco3 and 4 for eh ec and so4 4 4 statistical analysis assessment of the water quality were carried out to use that water in the water stressed areas of the district the statistical parameter of each physio chemical components is represented in table 9 table 9 shows the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation concentrations of various parameters the dominance of cation is in the order of na ca 2 mg 2 k and for the anion dominance cl so4 2 hco3 f br see tables 7 and 8 pearson s correlation matrices were used to find the relationships between two or more variables of the data set routroy et al 2013 the correlation coefficient of various parameters of water samples were calculated and their values of correlation coefficients are given in table 10 statically the correlation matrix expressed numerically the extent to which two variables are associated according pearson s correlations samples indicating r 0 7 are considered strongly correlated whereas r 0 5 0 7 are moderately correlated and r 0 5 are poorly correlated das and nag 2017 in present study area the correlation matrix of 12 parameters for 11 samples is shown in table from which the interpretation can be done that there is strong positive correlation between cl and na r 0 9735 cl and ec r 0 994 cl and ca r 0 9172 also tds shows good correlation with ec na ca cl br which indicates that they are most likely to derived from the same water source and negative correlation with mg and hco3 so4 shows poor correlation with most of the ions and negative correlation with mg and hco3 and f and br ion shows moderate to poor correlation and negative with mg and hco3 respectively hco3 ion mostly shows negative or poor correlation except with mg indicating the lower dominance over the region almost all ions shown negative relation with mg ion singh and singh 2018 hierarchical cluster analysis hca is statistical method for characterising set of data into the groups according to their similarities dendrogram provides the visual approach to the data set as from the diagram the standard deviations between the data set varies can be interpreted yidana et al 2010 the multiple water quality parameters or sampling locations can be grouped based on the similarities in the samples collected from various locations in study area routroy et al 2013 singh et al 2005 shrestha and kazama 2007 in present dendrogram fig 6 the single linkage is used in which the similarity of the closest pair is merged together as cluster group the data set which has correlation near to each other will be clustered near in the vertical axis while the horizontal axis represents the distance of the data set for which dependent on the value of the concentrations of each parameter of the data jothivenkatachalam et al 2010 in the present study area of the konkan division the dendrogram shows the linkage of the 11 wells for various parameters based on the concentrations it can be interpreted from the diagram that the variation in the value of br f mg 2 and ph are compatible with each other while there are huge variations in the values of k so4 2 ca 2 sio2 na cl hco3 ec tds this variation maybe be as result of different intrusions by the sea water at different parts as proximity of each location is the equal from coast tiri et al 2015 5 conclusion on the basis of several hydro geochemical parameters assessment of the quality of thermal ground river surface water of different district in the konkan division maharastra india as the principal strategy was to investigate out the water sample which is genuinely fit for irrigation and drinking purposes results concluded that amba kajli river of river surface water and sov of ground water are suitable for irrigation utilization which fall within the permissible limits conclusion can be derived from result of analysis of permeability index in which most samples are unsuitable for irrigation purpose out of 11 samples 3 belong to class 1 and rest belong to class 2 however on the further analysis of sar sodium percentage na wilcox plot and piper diagram conclusion can be derived that most of the thermal spring samples are unsuitable for irrigation whereas few river and groundwater are in within the permissible limit and are suitable for irrigation purpose which include sample from amba kajli river of surface water and sov aravali of ground water can be used for irrigation for all types of crops including sensitive crops however water samples having slightly high sodium ion can also be used depending on the sensitivity of crop from aravali and rajapur unhale region of groundwater and thermal springs water sample respectively for drinking purpose appraised the water quality index wqi based on the various ion composition in data on complete evaluation results indicated that amba surface water sov and aravali groundwater can be used for drinking purpose because their water quality index falls below 50 among thermal springs water sample rajapur unhale has shown some potential for drinking purpose water quality index greater than 100 is not suitable for drinking on the basis of correlation index dendrogram can be interpreted how different physio chemical parameters are related to each other and discovered that high values of sodium and calcium along with chloride dominance maybe as a result of intrusion of seawater at different parts of study area as the proximity of each location from the coast is high or due to anthropogenic activities hence for the usage of water having higher values than permissible limit the pre treatment is required before consumption thus this water can be utilized in the water stressed parts of country declaration availability of data and material all relevant data and material are presented in the

12234,global fresh water resources are finite and are rapidly diminishing due to poor water management and increasing population at alarming rate in the view of this quality water studies were undertaken for total 11 water samples from various resources via surface ground and thermal spring water of konkan division india samples were collected and experimental analyses of its various physio chemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds total hardness cation such as na k ca2 mg2 and anions such as cl hco3 so42 f br the suitability of water quality to meet drinking and irrigation standards in the study area were assessed using chemical indices like sodium absorption ratio percentage of sodium na kelly ratio kr permeability index pi were calculated indicating high overall salinity hazard in the study area which maybe as a result of intrusion of sea water as study area lies near the coastal arena piper plots gibbs diagram stiff diagram wilcox diagram were used to evaluate irrigation suitability indicating sodium and calcium along with chloride dominance due to evaporation or dissolution which can be correlated from gibbs diagram interpretation of samples falling in rock and evaporation dominance few samples of amba kajli river and sov of study area can be used for irrigation for all types of crop while aravali and rajapur unhale can be used depending on the sensitivity of the crops according to water quality index wqi calculated to determine the suitability of water for drinking purpose based on the statistical parameters like correlation matrix dendrogram can be interpreted that various parameters are correlated with each other while few are outliners in the data set results compared with the standards

indispensable resource furnished by nature water is present in many forms such as ocean sea river groundwater and springs most of the daily human activities require ample quantities of water there has been an immense hike in demand of fresh water due to population explosion intense agricultural activities urbanization and standard of living domestic and industrial uses talabi et al 2015 nematollahi et al 2016 on the other hand the resources of accessible fresh water are decreasing due to overuse annapoorna and janardhana 2015 there is a huge gap in the demand and supply of water amalraj and pius 2018 groundwater is a vital source of fresh water predominantly in india due to variability and uncertainty of rain joshi et al 2009 jain et al 2011 raju and singh 2017 it contributes up to 20 of the world s fresh water supply the lack of surface water to fulfil the necessity has led to the extensive use of groundwater ahmed et al 2013 ghalib 2017 wells are the main means of extracting groundwater adams et al 2001 kumar et al 2016 during the rainy season the wells are enriched with water but these wells are over extracted either for domestic use or commercial purpose as a result wells go dry within a few months this creates a problem for potable water in the non monsoon period and the dependency on other sources such as water tankers increases islam et al 2014 as india is an agricultural based country with main sources of irrigation water coming from rivers and groundwater in many rural regions of india people sustain only on groundwater saba and umar 2016 due to the scarcity of rain in many regions use of groundwater utilization for irrigation has increased also groundwater is recognized as much cleaner than the surface water so it becomes world s most extracted raw material but due to interaction of country rock with water and various other anthropogenic leads to the development of secondary mineral phases ahmed et al 2015 many activities such as rapid industrialization excessive use of phosphate fertilizers pesticides herbicides and overutilization of groundwater have led to the deployment of a large quantity of unwanted contaminants into groundwater and surface water ximing et al 2003 use of polluted water for irrigation can cause serious damage to crop and consequently harms the health etteieb et al 2017 people all over the world reckon groundwater for drinking shankar et al 2011 so the presence of contaminants in groundwater or any other water available from other source utilized in drinking can lead to serious health effects tanttu and jokela 2018 thus the hydro geochemical assessment of the water is essential while utilizing it for drinking and irrigation shah et al 2018a 2018b maharashtra is india s second most densely populous state and has immense potable water demand maharashtra has 24 drought prone area of the country in groundwater rich areas over extraction of groundwater has been observed with emphasis on cash crops such as sugarcane bananas grapes and oranges maharashtra has 49 polluted rivers which makes the highest number of polluted rivers in the country in present paper evaluation has been carried out in the konkan division of maharashtra it occupies the entire west coast of the state people residing in the study area have agriculture as their main occupation thus the quality of water needs to be ensured before being utilized for drinking and irrigation purpose kumar et al 2015 irrigation water is classified on the basis of sodium absorption ratio sar who 1989 sar indicates the degree to which the irrigation water tends to enter into cation exchange reaction in soil excess sodium changes the soil properties by getting absorbed on the soil particles which also results in decrease in permeability ayers and bronson 1975 guy 1995 so percentage of sodium is very important to identify water quality hosseinifrad and aminiyan 2015 kelly has suggested formula for the sodium content in irrigation water based on which it s suitability could be very conveniently worked on the basis of the values of kelly s ratio as per kelly 1951 sodium ion is measured against calcium and magnesium for considering this parameter permeability index is also used to indicate the suitability of water the soil permeability is affected by long term irrigation influenced by na ca2 mg2 and hco3 contents of the soil güngör and arslan 2016 piper diagram is used to interpret the suitability of chemical type of groundwater it indicates the chemical composition of the water which is controlled by dissolution and mixing of irrigation return flow ali et al 2018 roy et al 2018 the chemical composition of groundwater is significantly influenced by weathering and anthropogenic inputs for which the gibbs diagram used the gibbs diagram establishes the relationship of water composition and aquifer lithological characteristics gibbs 1970 stiff diagram indicates the composition in terms of common cations and anions with concentration represented in electrical equivalents stiff diagram graphically represents the common cations and anions with their concentration in their electrical equivalents which influences the water quality this diagram also investigates dominant cation and anion the water quality index wqi is calculated for evaluating influence of natural and anthropogenic activities based on several key parameters of groundwater chemistry as wqi is one of the most effective tools used in passing information on the quality of water to the concerned citizens and policy makers atulegwu and njoku 2004 adimalla et al 2018 khadse et al 2016 there are numerous studies carried out on water quality assessment in many parts of india for its suitability in irrigation and drinking brindha and elango 2011 carried out research on groundwater assessment in madhuranthakan tamil nadu and india groundwater assessment was conducted to study its fitness in drinking and irrigation means samples from 20 wells were analyzed 85 of the samples were permissible for irrigation also 95 of samples were fresh and appropriate for drinking vincy et al 2015 has studied on hydrochemical characterization for irrigation and drinking purpose in meenachil river basin western ghats kerala india water samples from 41 wells were used to carry out the study water was observed to be unsuitable for drinking but could be used for irrigation khan et al 2015 and balaji et al 2017 conducted their studies in specific region of different states of india i e west bengal uttar pradesh andhra pradesh respectively majority of samples were found to be admissible for both drinking and irrigation in above mentioned studies ali and ali 2018 and srinivas 2017 carried out their research in particular area of uttar pradesh and tamil nadu respectively concluded that water was unfit for drinking as well as irrigation few hydrochemical studies on water in semi arid countries like tunisia etteieb et al 2017 and iraq hosseinifard and aminiyan 2015 also showed unsuitability of water in drinking and irrigation purpose shah et al 2019a 2019b the main intent of the paper is to evaluate the permissibility of water in irrigation and drinking purpose 2 study area the study area is situated in konkan division of maharashtra includes from sativali to rajapur which has distance of about 420 km fig 1 study area falls between 19 37 51 6 to 16 38 44 2 lattitude and 72 54 32 to 73 31 52 longitude area is restricted on west by arabian sea and on east by sahyadri crests by the kankavali in south and nala sopara in north see fig 2 area receives rainfall of 2000 3000 mm annually and climate is highly humid all over the year because of being in the proximity of the sea temperature through out the division varies from 17 1 c to 40 7 c with the highest temperature being record in the month of may however the fluctuation is less frequent due to the influence of close to the marinal environment thane district which is part of konkan division has 33 thermal springs which are categorised into 5 groups amidst which samples were taken from vajreshwari group akloli area and sativali group total 7 samples were collected from thermal springs 2 from ground water and 2 from river surface water mostly thermal springs were observed on the fringe of dykes soil of the region is predominantly of basalt which is converted to laterite because of climate and topography of the region granites and gneiss moreover the area is also characterised by coastal alluvial soil clay loom and coarse sandy soils and laterite soils laterite soils has less phosphorus and potash content also lime and organic material while coastal alluvial soil is found all along the west coast which has varying content of salt according to the distance from sea coastal soil is important for agriculture and horticulture point of view and fertility of the soil is dependent on the proportion of clay in them however there is only small proportion of this type of soil clay loom and coarse sandy soils are formed from deccan trap and are low in basic and medium acidic in nature industries of the surrounding area are dependent on the geological resources region for their raw materials and power supplies konkan has the population of approximately 7 million excluding greater bombay among which 55 8 are directly dependent on agriculture ubale 2012 3 materials and methods the present research work is based to investigate the water quality for irrigation and drinking purposes eleven water samples have been studied from different regions of konkan area the water samples were assessed to show its characteristics towards irrigational development in the study area preservation of samples carried out in a way that it could not reduce the rate of any biological or chemical reactions the parameters such as temperature and ph were measured in the field using thermometric and electrometric methods respectively after the collection of samples these were evaluated in the laboratory to know the concentration of various components in each water samples for which 13 physical and chemical parameters comprising of major ion concentrations na k ca 2 mg 2 cl hco3 so4 2 f br sio2 temperature c ph electrical conductivity nagaraju et al 2016 to determine the concentration of other significant ions researchers have used the standard sampling method as mentioned in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical facies graphical representation of collected samples major dissolved constituents major cations and major anions helps in understanding its hydrochemical evolution grouping and areal distribution belkhiri and mouni 2012 mostafa et al 2017 in the present study piper trilinear diagram stiff diagram and gibbs ratio plot were constructed to evaluate variation in hydrochemical facies piper diagram is a graphical representation made in such a way that the milli equivalent percentage of the major cations and anions are plotted in a separate triangle these points plotted in triangular fields are projected further in the central diagram field which enables to provide the overall character of water piper 1944 plot are utilized to understand to understand the hydrochemistry of the water and process involved in it as chlorine is good indicator for mixing phenomenon relationship of between different water bodies and processes influencing their chemical composition was investigated throught use of major concentration versus cl concentration shanmugasundharam et al 2017 water quality depends on various factors such as topography nature of bedrock soil atmosphere and air precipitation ravikumar et al 2015 in our study area most of water samples fall in calcium sulphate and sodium chloride regime that indicates gypsum ground water and marine or deep ancient ground water simultaneously few of our samples also lies in the quadrant of calcium bicarbonate in diamond plot which indicates the origin of shallow fresh ground water sodium content in water is dangerous for drinking and irrigation as it contributes to exceed the value of sar high sodium and chloride content in water is because of ocean influences of study area being near coastal area or maybe due to dissolution or anthropogenic activities li et al 2016 water having higher sodium contributes to sodium salts in the soil solution through the capillary rise following surface evaporation in order to understand the relation of the chemical components of water from the respective aquifer lithologies a diagram was proposed by gibbs 1970 gibbs diagram gives the information on natural mechanics controlling water evaporation dominance rock weathering dominance precipitation dominance which reveals the information on the possible source of that resulting hydrochemistry of water fig 3 for the gibbs cation ratio the bivariate plot is drawn of tds v s cation ratio whereas for gibbs anion the anion ratio is considered gibbs ratio i c l c l h c o 3 gibbs ratio ii n a k n a k c a 2 where the ionic concentrations are in mg kg for our study area the gibbs ratio i ranges from 0 9929 to 0 0609 with average value of 0 5913 and gibbs ratio ii ranges from 0 9442 to 0 2587 with average value of 0 5968 with the tds value range from 2653 2 to 107 468 with average of 984 1386 five sample fall in rock dominance in case of gibbs anion ratio and four samples to rock dominance and four to evaporation dominance for in case of gibbs cation ratio hence can be deduce that groundwater chemistry is controlled by rock dominance and to some extent by evaporation dominance leading to the increasing salinity and therefore poor water quality in addition samples falling outside the undefined fields may indicate anthropogenic activities that result in altering the chemistry of the groundwater statistically the presence of different components was evaluated using stiff diagram that enables the graphical representation of the major ions present in the water sample stiff 1951 singh and kumar 2015 typically stiff diagrams plots the cations on left of center axis and anions on right of center axis having equivalent concentrations where the concentrations represented in electrical equivalents meq l from fig 4 it is evident that na cation is high dominance among the cations where cl is high dominance among the anions this indicates the most predominant water type is na cl water type in study area the concentration orders for cations is na ca 2 mg 2 k and for anions is cl so4 2 hco3 f br only for few samples of river and ground water the cl ion is not dominant where hco3 ion is dominant which can be interpreted as deep groundwater influenced by high ion exchange 4 2 suitability for irrigation suitability of water for irrigation was evaluated using salinity hazard present using wilcox diagram for the classification of irrigation water wilcox 1955 based on which simple scatter of sodium hazard sar on y axis versus salinity hazard ec on x axis ec is by default in a log scale fig 5 in our study area the samples fall in c1s1 are three which belong to kalji river amba surface water sov which is ground water sample of area can be used for irrigation for all type of crops including crops sensitive to sodium hazard two samples belong to c2s1 of aravali which is ground water and rapapur unhale which is thermal springs can be used for irrigation for crops having medium salinity tolerance like farming of salinity tolerance potatoes two samples belong to c3s2 of tural and dasgaon area of thermal springs can be used for irrigation for crops having good drainage system rest of samples fall in c4s2 and c4s3 which can t be used for irrigation as having high sodium content or special treatment is required to meet irrigation standards to samples belonging to thermal springs where areas having over exploitation and subsequent sea intrusion which may increase the sodium content kumar et al 2014 sakram and adimalla 2018 sodium ion measured against calcium and magnesium ion is considered for calculating this parameter kelly 1940 kelly s ratio enables to determine the hazardous effect of sodium on water quality for irrigation purposes in terms of kelly s ratio kelly s ratio value showing more than 1 indicates more amount of sodium in water hence water is unsuitable for irrigation purposes kelly 1963 k r n a c a 2 m g 2 where the ionic concentration are in mg kg kelly s ratio calculated for our study area which ranges from 0 257 to 16 551 with an average of 3 797 most of samples are unsuitable for irrigation having value greater than 1 for kelly ratio except samples from kalji river amba surface water and sov aravali ground water thus the sodium content is very high in the region making the filtration of crops difficult shammi et al 2016 classification on the basis of sodium percentage table 2 allows more viable approach to the salinity of the study area and can be interpreted that few samples including river water and ground water can be used for irrigation purpose as high salt concentration influence osmotic pressure of the soil solution and affect the ability of plants to absorbs the water through the roots glover 1996 suitability of water based on classification by usda united states department of agriculture using electrical conductivity ec parameter samples of the study area falls within all classes of water indicating the high fluctuation table 3 samples of few river water and groundwater can be used for irrigation purpose based on the requirements as crops which are highly sensitive may take the damage based on individual crop permissible limit the water for the same should be selected see tables 4 6 sodium absorption ratio sar is a common index of suitability of water to meet the irrigation standards as it is determined from the concentrations of the main alkaline and earth alkaline cations present in the water asadollahfardi et al 2013 nagaraju et al 2014 high the concentration of sodium ion negatively affect the soil integrity and reduces the permeability causing infiltration problems rahman et al 2014 sodium and potassium ion make the dispersion of clay particles easier while calcium and magnesium promote flocculation suarez 1974 s a r n a 1 2 c a 2 m g 2 where the ionic concentration are in mg kg hence high value of sar is not favourable for the irrigation table 4 suitability of water to for irrigation of study area for which sar value range from 2 037 to 79 724 with average of 29 5523 most of the sample of thermal springs are above the range of 27 which is unsuitable for irrigation however sample from kalji river amba surface water and sov aravalli ground water samples are within the permissible limit and is suitable for the irrigation permeability index is an essential parameter to evaluate the quality of irrigation water in relation to soil for improvement in agriculture thilagavathi et al 2012 thivya et al 2013 the salinization of the groundwater would be expected to result from increase in ionic concentrations due to evaporation of recharge water or maybe due to intrusion of seawater as study area lies within the coastal arena mirabbasi et al 2008 on the basis of formula below the suitability of sample for irrigation were calculated p i n a h c o 3 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a where the concentration of the samples were in mg kg the permeability of the soil is influenced by sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate reddy 2013 suitability of water for irrigation based on permeability such assessment was done by doneen 1964 accordingly the water can be classified as class i class ii and class iii orders among which class i categorised as favourable for irrigation since have 75 or more maximum permeability class ii moderately suitable since have 25 75 permeability class iii are unsuitable since they have maximum 25 permeability in our study area the minimum value of permeability is 40 9737 whereas the maximum is 96 9927 eight samples belong to class ii whereas rest three belong to class i which are aravalli of ground water tural rajapur unhale of thermal springs having suitability for irrigation based on doneen s classification hence the overall permeability of the area was suitable for irrigation based on the classification 4 3 suitability for drinking electrical conductivity electrical conductivity is the property of the water to transmit electric current it depends on the availability of ions their total concentration

negative logarithm of hydrogen ion concentration ph log h presence in the solution in collected samples ph is greater than 7 means most of the samples are basic in nature sircar et al 2015 shah et al 2019a 2019b 4 3 1 total dissolve solid tds total dissolve solid is define as the suspended and dissolved matter in water in samples of water tds ranges from 140 to 2500 again sov well has lowest tds compared to other well according to who specification tds up to 500 mg l is the highest desirable and up to 1500 mg l is maximum permissible srinivas et al 2017 based on the tds observed ground water can be classified as fresh brackish saline and brine for fresh water tds must be less than 500 for brackish water it varied from 1000 to 10 000 for saline tds varied from 10 000 100 0000 and for brine it is more than 100 000 raju 2007 calcium is most important parameter for shell construction and bone building in our case well no 10 has lowest concentration of calcium while akloli well has maximum calcium along with magnesium is one of the important parameter for the calculation of hardness of the water these elements are most abundant in surface and ground water and exists mainly as bicarbonate the contamination of chloride in drinking water arises from sewage and industrial effluents in most of the samples chlorine varies from 12 to 1410 the concentration of na in samples varied from 8 06 to 587 na is one of the most abundant element among cation this is because of the silicate weathering or dissolution of soil salts stored by the influences of evaporation anthropogenic activities agricultural activities and poor drainage conditions k is natural occurring element but its concentration is lowest among the cation in samples potassium vary only from 0 18 to 17 9 the concentration of carbonates is mainly a function of dissolved co2 temperature ph cations and other dissolved salts the concentration of bicarbonate observed from 10 to 255 according to the who if the concentration of sulphate exceeds the maximum allowable limit of 400 mg l it will react with human organs in our sample sulphate is observed 0 2 275 drinking water quality was evaluated using the water quality index wqi drinking water quality analysis based on the various physico chemical parameter such as eh conductivity tds and presence of various elements such as sodium potassium calcium magnesium sulphate and bicarbonate were ardent to find out the water quality index of the given wells the objective of water quality index is to provide us suitable information regarding the use of water for public industrial or agriculture purposestable 6 salifu et al 2017 to calculate the water quality index the weight has been assigned for various physico chemical parameter according to their priority in over all quality of the water the assigned weight ranges from 1 to 5 li et al 2015 the maximum weight of 5 is assigned for the tds 1 for magnesium 2 for ca na and k 3 for hco3 and 4 for eh ec and so4 4 4 statistical analysis assessment of the water quality were carried out to use that water in the water stressed areas of the district the statistical parameter of each physio chemical components is represented in table 9 table 9 shows the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation concentrations of various parameters the dominance of cation is in the order of na ca 2 mg 2 k and for the anion dominance cl so4 2 hco3 f br see tables 7 and 8 pearson s correlation matrices were used to find the relationships between two or more variables of the data set routroy et al 2013 the correlation coefficient of various parameters of water samples were calculated and their values of correlation coefficients are given in table 10 statically the correlation matrix expressed numerically the extent to which two variables are associated according pearson s correlations samples indicating r 0 7 are considered strongly correlated whereas r 0 5 0 7 are moderately correlated and r 0 5 are poorly correlated das and nag 2017 in present study area the correlation matrix of 12 parameters for 11 samples is shown in table from which the interpretation can be done that there is strong positive correlation between cl and na r 0 9735 cl and ec r 0 994 cl and ca r 0 9172 also tds shows good correlation with ec na ca cl br which indicates that they are most likely to derived from the same water source and negative correlation with mg and hco3 so4 shows poor correlation with most of the ions and negative correlation with mg and hco3 and f and br ion shows moderate to poor correlation and negative with mg and hco3 respectively hco3 ion mostly shows negative or poor correlation except with mg indicating the lower dominance over the region almost all ions shown negative relation with mg ion singh and singh 2018 hierarchical cluster analysis hca is statistical method for characterising set of data into the groups according to their similarities dendrogram provides the visual approach to the data set as from the diagram the standard deviations between the data set varies can be interpreted yidana et al 2010 the multiple water quality parameters or sampling locations can be grouped based on the similarities in the samples collected from various locations in study area routroy et al 2013 singh et al 2005 shrestha and kazama 2007 in present dendrogram fig 6 the single linkage is used in which the similarity of the closest pair is merged together as cluster group the data set which has correlation near to each other will be clustered near in the vertical axis while the horizontal axis represents the distance of the data set for which dependent on the value of the concentrations of each parameter of the data jothivenkatachalam et al 2010 in the present study area of the konkan division the dendrogram shows the linkage of the 11 wells for various parameters based on the concentrations it can be interpreted from the diagram that the variation in the value of br f mg 2 and ph are compatible with each other while there are huge variations in the values of k so4 2 ca 2 sio2 na cl hco3 ec tds this variation maybe be as result of different intrusions by the sea water at different parts as proximity of each location is the equal from coast tiri et al 2015 5 conclusion on the basis of several hydro geochemical parameters assessment of the quality of thermal ground river surface water of different district in the konkan division maharastra india as the principal strategy was to investigate out the water sample which is genuinely fit for irrigation and drinking purposes results concluded that amba kajli river of river surface water and sov of ground water are suitable for irrigation utilization which fall within the permissible limits conclusion can be derived from result of analysis of permeability index in which most samples are unsuitable for irrigation purpose out of 11 samples 3 belong to class 1 and rest belong to class 2 however on the further analysis of sar sodium percentage na wilcox plot and piper diagram conclusion can be derived that most of the thermal spring samples are unsuitable for irrigation whereas few river and groundwater are in within the permissible limit and are suitable for irrigation purpose which include sample from amba kajli river of surface water and sov aravali of ground water can be used for irrigation for all types of crops including sensitive crops however water samples having slightly high sodium ion can also be used depending on the sensitivity of crop from aravali and rajapur unhale region of groundwater and thermal springs water sample respectively for drinking purpose appraised the water quality index wqi based on the various ion composition in data on complete evaluation results indicated that amba surface water sov and aravali groundwater can be used for drinking purpose because their water quality index falls below 50 among thermal springs water sample rajapur unhale has shown some potential for drinking purpose water quality index greater than 100 is not suitable for drinking on the basis of correlation index dendrogram can be interpreted how different physio chemical parameters are related to each other and discovered that high values of sodium and calcium along with chloride dominance maybe as a result of intrusion of seawater at different parts of study area as the proximity of each location from the coast is high or due to anthropogenic activities hence for the usage of water having higher values than permissible limit the pre treatment is required before consumption thus this water can be utilized in the water stressed parts of country declaration availability of data and material all relevant data and material are presented in the
