17395,clay polymer nanocomposites cpns have been studied for two decades as sorbents for water pollutants but their applicability remains limited our aim in this review is to present the latest progress in cpn research using a meta analysis approach and identify key steps necessary to bridge the gap between basic research and cpn application based on results extracted from 99 research articles on cpns and 8 review articles on other widely studies sorbents cpns had higher adsorption capacities for several inorganic and organic pollutant classes including heavy metals oxyanions and dyes n 308 observations we applied principal component analysis analysis of variance and multiple linear regressions to test how cpn and pollutant properties correlated with langmuir adsorption model coefficients while adsorption was surprisingly not influenced by mineral properties it was influenced by cpn fabrication method polymer functional groups and pollutant properties for example among the pollutant classes heavy metals had the highest adsorption capacity but the lowest adsorption affinity on the other hand dyes had high adsorption affinities as reflected by the linear correlation between adsorption affinity and pollutant molecular weight scaling from basic research to technological application requires testing cpn performance in real water application in columns comparison to commercial sorbents regeneration and cost evaluation however our survey indicates that of the 158 observations only 20 compared the cpn s performance to that of a commercial sorbent we anticipate that this review will promote the design of smart and functional cpns which can then evolve into an effective water treatment technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords clay polymer nanocomposites adsorption water treatment meta analysis 1 introduction water resources often contain an array of pollutants that pose public health and environmental concerns schwarzenbach et al 2010 removing organic and inorganic pollutants from water is often achieved by adsorbing them to activated carbon ion exchange resins and oxides driehaus et al 1998 fu and wang 2011 kumar et al 2019 worch 2012 however each of these sorbents has various critical shortcomings such as reduced effectiveness in the presence of background electrolytes and organic matter dixit et al 2018 quinlivan et al 2005 low pollutant specificity ling et al 2017 high operating costs alhashimi and aktas 2017 and energy intensive regeneration foo and hameed 2012 therefore in recent decades there has been enormous interest in tailoring sorbents to provide efficient inexpensive and pollutant specific alternatives to conventional sorbents kyzas and matis 2015 clay polymer nanocomposites cpns are a broad group of materials designed using many combinations of clay minerals and polymers originally clay minerals were dispersed into individual layers and incorporated into the polymer phase typically at less than 5 wt to enhance polymer properties chen et al 2008 clay minerals such as smectites have layers that are approximately 1 nm thick and a diameter of up to several microns the young s modulus in the layer direction is 50 to 400 times higher than that of a typical polymer thus the composite material has improved properties such as young s modulus tensile strength fire retardancy barrier resistance and ion conductivity chen et al 2008 clay minerals often bare a negative charge resulting from isomorphous substitution and have the capacity to adsorb positively charged pollutants such as heavy metals and cationic dyes via exchange of their counter cation more recently cpns have been studied as materials for pollutant removal from water in membrane flocculation oxidation and adsorption processes by combining the valuable properties of the mineral component low cost low toxicity mechanical stability and large surface area with those of the polymeric components high adsorption efficiencies diverse functional group chemistry enhanced swelling and surface area cpns can be tailored to target specific pollutants with enhanced adsorption performance compared to bare clay minerals the field has rapidly evolved since breen and watson first reported a cpn sorbent composed of a polycation adsorbed to a smectite mineral breen and watson 1998 recent studies have reported smart multi component composite sorbents based on multiple polymers and modifiers that are characterized using advanced techniques gardi and mishael 2018 hatami et al 2020 lv et al 2020 ma et al 2017 rethinasabapathy et al 2018 sarkar et al 2018 and employed for the removal of an array of pollutants ray et al 2019 recent literature reviews on cpns have qualitatively discussed cpn building blocks clays and polymers fabrication methods and properties e g surface area and charge compiled adsorption results from relevant studies and suggested future challenges and research directions han et al 2019 kar et al 2019 mukhopadhyay et al 2020 srinivasan 2011 unuabonah and taubert 2014 such literature reviews are instrumental for summarizing recent progress in a given discipline but they cannot quantitatively synthesize and interpret large scale datasets and results across studies in contrast meta analyses are aimed at determining overall trends by statistically analyzing data from several independent studies of the same subject meta analyses are adept at summarizing and synthesizing diverse studies meng et al 2016 meyer et al 2019 wolfram et al 2018 a key benefit of analyzing numerous studies is the aggregation of information that leads to a higher statistical power and more robust estimates than are possible from any individual study meta analyses have been implemented to identify universal trends in topics central to water research such as phosphorous removal from lake waters spears et al 2016 decay rates of viruses and coliphages in surface waters beohm et al 2019 and contaminant removal by conventional and emerging media for urban stormwater treatment okaikue woodi et al 2020 however only a handful of meta analyses have been performed on sorbents in general alhashimi and aktas 2017 benstoem et al 2017 mejias carpio et al 2018 and none have been performed on clay based sorbents here we present a quantitative meta analysis of the data published on cpns in the last decade from a basic science perspective it is important to identify how cpn and pollutant properties influence adsorption performance kar et al 2019 but a meta analysis can reveal more general trends based on numerous observations translating cpn laboratory based data into technology based processes is complex mukhopadhyay et al 2020 and seldom addressed gardi et al 2015 kumar et al 2012 ray et al 2019 this review highlights the key steps necessary to bridge cpn laboratory scale performance to technological applicability which is a crucial stage towards commercialization of cpns or any other sorbent accordingly we collected sorbent pollutant and adsorption data from 397 observations published in 99 original research articles and 8 review articles we analyzed the adsorption performance of cpns for different pollutants using principal component analysis pca analysis of variance anova and stepwise multiple linear regression mlr the aims of this review were to 1 compile a database consisting of information from cpn studies of the past decade to quantify the number of studies reporting different clays and polymers modes of cpn fabrication pollutants and adsorption models 2 analyze the linkages between cpn properties pollutant chemistry and adsorption performance 3 highlight the necessary steps to benchmark novel cpns in realistic water treatment scenarios and 4 identify underexplored research opportunities 2 methods the workflow and methodology of this review is depicted in fig 1 2 1 literature review we identified potentially relevant studies n 548 using the search string clay or clay mineral and polymer or composite or nanocomposite and water or wastewater and adsorption or sorption or removal and pollutant or contaminant occurring in the title abstract and or keywords of articles published in the years 2008 2019 using the web of science core collection and google scholar our search cutoff date was 14 9 2019 and our selection criteria below yielded 99 articles and 158 experimental observations fig s1 we verified that each article reported original quantitative data for pollutant adsorption from an aqueous matrix to a composite material consisting of at the least a clay mineral or iron fe oxide functionalized with a synthetic or natural polymer studies on cpns based on an unidentified mixture of clay minerals were excluded only studies that reported langmuir adsorption capacity qmax and affinity kl or freundlich model coefficients n and kf see below based on replicated adsorption isotherms were included separately google scholar was searched for review articles on widely studied sorbents that compiled published data of pollutant adsorption we chose commonly studied pollutants for which we could extract n 10 observations from at least four additional sorbents and extracted their qmax values kl values were often not reported in these reviews and therefore not included while we acknowledge that a few sorbents included in our meta analysis may not meet the accepted definition of a nanomaterial the vast majority of them do we chose to classify all sorbents reviewed here as cpns to continue the terminology used in recent reviews and papers kar et al 2019 mukhopadhyay et al 2020 unuabonah and taubert 2014 2 2 data extraction information about the cpn the targeted pollutant adsorption metrics and other information were extracted from every experimental observation in each study 33 of the 99 studies contained more than one experimental observation e g one cpn tested for more than one pollutant cpn information included clay mineral and polymer type and cpn fabrication method adsorption cross linking in situ polymerization or grafting montmorillonite and bentonite were collectively classified as smectites while attapulgite sepiolite and palygorskite were classified as palygorskites active adsorption sites termed functional groups were inferred from a priori knowledge about polymer chemistry experimental results e g effect of solution chemistry on adsorption evidence of cation or anion exchange or spectroscopic findings and based on the discussion in each study where relevant the ph of the adsorption system was used to help assign functional groups for example carboxyl groups were assigned as a cpn functional group when the ph was higher than its typical pka 4 5 we recorded where available cpn surface charge n 68 observations inferred from electrophoretic mobility zadaka et al 2010 or potentiometric titration pereira et al 2017 measurements and bet surface area n 62 observations dogan et al 2006 we recorded where available cpn polymer or organic component content n 50 observations cpn polymer content was mostly determined using thermogravimetric or elemental analysis of the solid phase or in the case of cpn fabrication using direct polymer adsorption by measuring the non adsorbed polymer concentration however thermogravimetric analysis results were only included if they accounted for mass loss from cpn dehydration and other structural decomposition of the clay mineral as described by ray et al ray et al 2019 organic and inorganic pollutants were binned into four classes dyes n 53 micropollutants n 23 heavy metals n 65 and oxyanions n 17 studies on the adsorption of other inorganic ions including fluoride n 4 cesium n 1 and ammonium n 1 were excluded due to insufficient sample size pollutant information included molecular weight mw and charge negative neutral or positive at the ph value of the adsorption experiment we excluded studies on substances lacking a definitive mw such as dissolved organic matter cpn adsorption performance was evaluated by analyzing adsorption isotherm coefficients an adsorption isotherm is a curve describing the retention of a substance at equilibrium on a solid particle data from adsorption isotherms are typically fit to langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir isotherm equation was developed to model homogenous monolayer adsorption of gas to a solid surface foo and hameed 2010 but is the most widely used model to interpret adsorption from aqueous media the langmuir adsorption capacity qmax reflects the maximum amount of adsorbed pollutants per unit mass sorbent and the langmuir adsorption coefficient kl quantifies the affinity of a pollutant to the sorbent surface across the entire database cpns had median qmax and kl values of 0 55 mmol g and 29 64 l mmol respectively the freundlich isotherm equation is a power function while lacking a thermodynamic basis it is often used to fit adsorption data to heterogenous adsorption sites foo and hameed 2010 freundlich coefficients include the dimensionless n and the freundlich constant kf which relays information on the extent of adsorption though it does not predict adsorption capacity foo and hameed 2010 in cases where langmuir and freundlich models were applied to the same adsorption isotherm we extracted the coefficients that provided a better fit for the data adsorption coefficients were converted to molar basis using pollutant mw as necessary we used the reported ph in the adsorption experiment to determine the mw of oxyanions which varies with ph thermodynamic parameters δg⁰ δh⁰ and δs⁰ which can be calculated from adsorption isotherms measured at several temperatures and the pseudo second order kinetic model coefficient calculated from adsorption kinetic experiments tran et al 2017 were also extracted to assess whether cpns were benchmarked and tested for water treatment applications we recorded whether the following experiments were performed in addition to those described above i pollutant adsorption from varying solution chemistry ph and ionic strength ii pollutant adsorption from real water wastewater natural water or synthetic real water i e deionized water containing multiple pollutants and background solutes iii regeneration of spent cpns iv adsorption experiments in fixed bed columns v experimental comparison of cpns to commercially used sorbents and vi cost evaluation the complete database and references for the articles used in this meta analysis are included in the supplementary material 2 3 statistical analyses 2 3 1 principal component analysis pca we tested for an association between minerals functional groups pollutant properties class charge cpn fabrication methods and langmuir coefficients using principal components analysis pca pca results were computed after scaling using factominer an r package for multivariate analysis lê et al 2008 and visualized using statistical tools for high throughput data analysis kassambara 2017 confidence ellipses were used to visualize whether categorical groups were significantly different from each other and defined as regions containing 95 of all samples that can be drawn from the underlying gaussian distribution variables with n 10 observations or p values 0 05 were excluded 2 3 2 one way analysis of variance anova we used one way anova models to identify the main effects of mineral pollutant properties class charge and cpn fabrication method on our dependent variable of interest qmax and kl we compared anova results with those from linear mixed effect models lmer using the lme4 package bates et al 2007 lmer models were constructed as above but included study id as a categorical random effect to account for the nonindependence of observations originating from the same study for all models qmax and kl values were transformed to fit assumptions of normality using the log10 scale normal distributions were evaluated using shapiro wilk tests and qq plots estimated marginal means were computed using the emmeans package lenth et al 2018 and coefficients b i b j were back transformed in the manuscript for ease of interpretation lane 2002 p values were calculated using tukey s hsd method for comparing a family of estimates 2 3 3 multiple linear regression mlr we constructed multiple linear regression models using cpn and pollutant properties as covariates for predicting variation in qmax and kl dummy variables were made from categorical variables excluding those with fewer than 10 observations we used exhaustive forwards and backwards stepwise aic akaike information criterion selected linear regression models to identify relationships between our dependent variable of interest qmax or kl and potential predictor variables for two common pollutant classes heavy metals and cationic dyes we analyzed subsets of the database so mutually exclusive variables were not included in the same model for example heavy metals which are always positively charged and oxyanions which are always negatively charged stepwise multiple linear regressions were conducted following reported procedure lynch et al 2019 using the stats package in r team 2013 we normalized dependent variables using the boxcox power transformation to yield normally distributed errors assessed using shapiro wilk tests of the residuals q q plots studentized residuals and non constant variance scores best fit model results aic scores and boxcox λ values are reported in the supplementary material table s5 3 results 3 1 dataset our literature search yielded 158 experimental observations from 99 published papers for comparison similar meta analyses of adsorption systems consisted of n 44 n 195 and n 63 observations benstoem et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 mejias carpio et al 2018 for each of the observations we compiled information and the following data were included in statistical analyses clay and polymer type cpn fabrication method and pollutant class charge and molecular weight data on cpn surface area surface charge and polymer content potentially important variables describing cpn properties were available for a limited number of observations and therefore not included in the formal meta analysis principal component analyses examining freundlich n 46 and pseudo second order kinetic n 98 model coefficients and thermodynamic parameters n 54 as adsorption metrics were constrained by few observations and reported in the supplementary material figures s2 s4 we ultimately restricted our pca anova and mlr analyses to langmuir model coefficients qmax and kl n 141 due to the low number of observations of the adsorption metrics to assess the percentage of observations that report cpn benchmarking and application testing we recorded if the following experiments were performed pollutant adsorption from real water regeneration of spent cpns adsorption in fixed bed columns experimental comparison of cpns to commercially used sorbents and cost evaluation 3 2 synthesis of data on cpn adsorption performance 3 2 1 pollutant adsorption by cpns versus common sorbents our survey indicates the langmuir adsorption capacities qmax of cpns for several commonly studied organic dyes and inorganic heavy metals and oxyanions pollutant classes exceeded or equaled those of other sorbents including biochar activated carbon and modified chitosan fig 2 and table s1 kl values were often not reported for these sorbents and therefore not included although variation in solution chemistry and experimental conditions affects adsorption coefficients wang and giammar 2019 we observed significant differences in qmax among sorbents p 0 0001 and significant interactions between sorbent and pollutant class p 0 01 across this large dataset which encompassed multiple experimental conditions n 308 observations while some sorbents have a high qmax because they are chemically compatible with one specific pollutant class for example activated carbons for dyes mezohegyi et al 2012 yagub et al 2014 or graphene oxides for heavy metals peng et al 2017 the high qmax of cpns for each pollutant class stems from their tunability or chemically compatibility with a wide range of pollutants cpns are also superior sorbents than their clay mineral building blocks the qmax of cpns averaged over all three pollutant classes is 1 72 mmol g and the kl is 201 45 l mmol for comparison the qmax of smectite for cu2 and methylene blue the most widely studied mineral heavy metal and cationic dye in our survey is 0 45 mmol g and 0 9 mmol g respectively while the kl is 1 9 l mmol and 3 2 l mmol respectively almeida et al 2009 bhattacharyya and gupta 2006 the advantage of positive cpns over bare smectite which bears a negative surface charge would likely be more pronounced for the adsorption of anionic pollutants 3 2 2 visualizing relationships among variables to identify parameters driving the high qmax of cpns we used principal component analysis pca to assess relationships between cpn properties pollutant properties and langmuir model coefficients within ordination space dimensions 1 and 2 together explained 25 of the variance fig 3 and table s2 based on 95 confidence intervals visualized as shaded ellipses dyes and heavy metals were significantly different from each other and from micropollutants and oxyanions micropollutants and oxyanions were not significantly different qmax loaded in the opposite direction from oxyanions and micropollutants suggesting adsorption capacity for these classes was lower though qmax values accounted for only 5 of the variability across the first two dimensions in contrast kl values accounted for 10 of the variability along dimension 2 alone suggesting the affinity of dyes and high mw pollutants for the tested cpns especially those based on smectites were higher than average the positive correlation between mw and kl p 0 0001 figure s5 supports established evidence that adsorption affinities increase with mw breen 1999 this trend may be related to the energy gain of high mw pollutants dehydrating and forming multiple interactions with the sorbent surface fabrication methods influence the chemical and structural properties of cpns thereby influencing their adsorption performance see section 3 3 3 fabrication using the in situ polymerization approach was positively correlated with dimension 2 0 55 and explained 14 of the variance loading with qmax and sulfonate and cation exchange functional groups fig 3 and table s2 in contrast adsorption fabrication methods were negatively correlated with dimension 2 0 67 and explained an additional 20 of the variance along with cross linking fabrication methods explained 38 of the variance indicating their crucial role in cpn adsorption performance oxyanions were strongly related to cpns bearing cationic amine functional groups which accounted for 15 of the variability across dimension 1 while micropollutants were associated with aromatic functional groups accounting for 10 of variance explained across the first two dimensions table s2 in contrast heavy metals were associated with amine carboxyl and cation exchange functional groups which together accounted for 17 of the variability across dimension 1 together these results reveal that observations are separated across pollutant class and charge polymer functional group and fabrication method demonstrating that cpns can be rationally designed to maximize chemical interactions between the polymer and targeted pollutant 3 2 3 cpn building blocks at their simplest form cpns consist of a clay mineral functionalized with a polymer we present these cpn building blocks and discuss how various fabrication methods shape the structure and properties of cpns we then assess their contribution to adsorption performance using one way anova table 1 and table s4 and stepwise multiple linear regressions table 2 and s5 3 2 3 1 cpn building blocks clay minerals clay minerals are well known sorbents with exhaustively characterized adsorption sites gaines and thomas 1953 ikhsan et al 1999 our survey shows that most cpns were designed using six different mineral classes fig 4 a smectites phyllosilicates based on si tetrahedra and al octahedra 2 1 were the most commonly used mineral 63 of observations likely because they easily disperse in water and polar organic solvents gardi and mishael 2018 herrera et al 2004 and possess a large total surface area 710 m2 g and cation exchange capacity 0 85 meq g borden and giese 2001 these traits are well suited for the adsorption of cationic and neutral polymers deng et al 2006 and the exchange sites serve as additional adsorption sites for cationic pollutants such as heavy metals barbier et al 2000 other clay minerals included palygorskite 10 zeolite 6 layered double hydroxide ldh 6 fe oxide 5 halloysite 5 kaolinite 3 and k feldspar 2 while fe oxides are not clay minerals they are mineralogically related and widely reported as useful sorbents for water treatment xu et al 2012 although smectites were the most prevalent clay building block several interesting studies selected less explored clay minerals including zeolites ldhs and palygorskites zeolites are aluminosilicates based on al and si tetrahedra that form microporous negatively charged frameworks containing exchangeable metal cations zeolite pores can serve as adsorption sites that target a specific pollutant or a broad mixture of pollutants based on the uniformity of their structure rossner et al 2009 in contrast to most clay minerals synthetic ldhs possess a positive surface charge because of partial substitution of trivalent for divalent cations in the brucite like layers goh et al 2008 this allows for facile functionalization of ldhs with anionic bio polymers such as alginate and fulvic acids and subsequent removal of cationic pollutants li et al 2018 palygorskites are fibrous clay minerals with high porosity 0 38 0 58 cm3 g high specific surface area 173 m2 g dogan et al 2006 and abundant surface si oh groups that can be hydrolyzed to obtain ph dependent charged groups liu et al 2015 or grafted with organo silanes as a first step for surface initiated polymerization chen et al 2009 xue et al 2011 due to small sample sizes n 5 k feldspar and kaolinite were excluded from anova models despite large differences in their structure surface area and exchange capacity table s3 qmax values did not differ across mineral classes in the standard p 0 5 or random mixed effects p 0 9 model table 1 and figure s6 kl values varied across mineral class p 0 02 but all pairwise comparisons were insignificant similar cpn adsorption performances across clay building blocks is likely caused by the dominating influence of polymer functional group chemistry ray et al 2019 cpn surface charge shabtai and mishael 2016 and cpn structure levy et al 2019 shabtai and mishael 2018 in addition the paucity of experimental evidence for clay minerals other than smectite limits insight on the advantages of alternate mineral building blocks 3 2 3 2 cpn building blocks polymers the polymer building block of cpns constitutes the driving force behind pollutant adsorption as it contains numerous and often diverse adsorption sites in addition to those on the mineral surface functionalization of clay minerals with a polymer is often associated with desorption of water and ions from the mineral surface significantly changing its surface chemistry the polymer can change the mineral s surface charge seyrek et al 2011 influencing the attraction and repulsion of charged pollutants chen et al 2013 l li et al 2018 m li et al 2018 polymers can also alter the mineral s crystal structure and surface morphology by intercalating between clay layers exfoliating them or agglomerating them into larger particles chen et al 2008 shaikh et al 2017 these processes result from complex mineral polymer interactions that can induce conformational changes of polymer chains on the mineral surface kohay et al 2015 implications for adsorption performance shabtai and mishael 2018 2016 are discussed below section 4 2 because these parameters are difficult to compare and often unreported we focus instead on polymer functional group chemistry as a proxy for cpn pollutant compatibility our survey identified 39 polymer types fig 4b the most frequently studied were chitosan 23 polyacrylamide 11 and polyacrylic acid 10 chitosan is a water soluble at low ph biocompatible biopolymer with amino and hydroxyl functional groups polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid are water soluble easily cross linked synthetic polymers that contain amide and carboxylic functional groups respectively accordingly the most common functional groups in cpns are hydroxyl carboxylic amine and cationic amine along with aromatic aliphatic amide and cation exchange groups fig 4c because cpns contain combinations of two or more functional groups we tested the effect of polymer functional group on adsorption metrics using stepwise multiple linear regressions section 3 5 3 2 3 3 cpn fabrication method building with the blocks we identified four principal approaches to functionalizing clay minerals with polymers adsorption in situ polymerization cross linking and grafting figure s7 most of the cpns 40 of observations were fabricated using direct polymer adsorption onto the clay surface by mixing a polymer solution with a clay dispersion this method utilizes attractive electrostatic and non specific van der waals interactions van de steeg et al 1992 between polymers and clay mineral surfaces polymer adsorption is often driven by entropic gains associated with dehydration of large polymer chains as they adsorb on the mineral and desorption of mineral bound water chen and evans 2004 lee and ruckenstein 1988 the in situ polymerization method 34 of observations begins with mixing monomers or polymer precursors with dispersed clay followed by the addition of a polymerization initiator e g azobisisobutyronitrile or ammonium persulfate zhu and wilkie 2000 the cross linking method 10 of observations consists of reacting a clay or clay polymer mixture with a cross linking compound e g alginate or epichlorohydrin that forms bonds between adsorbed polymer chains polymer chains and clay or that self polymerizes and as a result reinforces the cpn structure tirtom et al 2012 cross linked cpns are often capable of swelling and adsorbing large amounts of water hydrogels which facilitates rapid pollutant transport to adsorption sites massaro et al 2017 the grafting method 9 of observations consists of covalently bonding a polymer to the mineral surface or rarely by grafting an initiator to the surface followed by in situ polymerization liu 2007 the grafting approach achieves a chemically stable nanocomposite due to the covalent bonding of mineral and polymer building blocks an additional 6 of observations used other fabrication methods such as electrospinning melt mixing calcination and gamma radiation figure s7 which may offer new pathways to cpn development but were excluded from anova models due to low sample size n 5 qmax values were significantly different across cpn fabrication methods p 0 0001 where the mean effect of in situ polymerization was significantly higher than adsorption cross linking and grafting fig 5 a table 1 in both the linear and linear mixed effects models the mean effect of in situ polymerization was 4 8 times that of adsorption p 0 0001 and associated with observations of positively charge pollutants fig 5a and table s4 to account for the fact that mostly positively charged pollutants were tested by in situ polymerized cpns we also tested the interaction between cpn fabrication method and pollutant charge on qmax qmax was significantly affected by the interaction between fabrication method and pollutant classes p 0 01 this could suggest that polymers employed for this type of cpn such as polyacrylic acid and polyacrylamide were especially suited for the adsorption of positively charged pollutants we suggest that future studies investigate designing in situ polymerized cpns for removal of anionic pollutants as well including study id as a random effect reduced differences in estimated means p 0 002 such that only in situ polymerization and adsorption methods differed from each other table s4 the higher qmax associated with in situ polymerization is likely due to the high polymer loading achievable relative to other fabrication methods gardi and mishael 2018 normalizing pollutant adsorption to polymer loading on the mineral mass pollutant per mass polymer would enable a direct comparison of cpn efficiency in contrast kl is expected to be more influenced by polymer pollutant interactions than polymer loading levy et al 2019 kl values were also significantly influenced by cpn fabrication method p 0 05 here the mean effect of adsorption was 3 times greater than in situ polymerization p 0 05 and associated with negatively charged pollutants fig 5b tables 1 and s4 difference in means did not remain significant when study id was included as a random effect while higher qmax values indicates a cpn can adsorb more pollutant molecules higher kl values are related to the nature of the interaction we previously found that cpns with higher kl performed better in fixed bed columns than cpns or activated carbons with lower kl but higher qmax kohay et al 2015 shabtai and mishael 2018 a sorbent with high kl is also likely to remove pollutants at low concentrations more efficiently than a sorbent with a similar qmax but a lower kl as a result one must consider qmax and kl in tandem when testing a sorbent for water treatment wang and giammar 2019 for example cnps fabricated via in situ polymerization may be appropriate in applications that require the removal of pollutants present at high concentrations wang et al 2011 in contrast cpns fabricated via the adsorption method may be better suited for the rapid and complete removal of pollutants at trace concentrations guillossou et al 2019 3 2 4 pollutant class and charge surveyed studies tested the adsorption of 58 different organic and inorganic pollutants figure s8 which were binned into four classes dyes micropollutants heavy metals and oxyanions dyes n 53 are high molecular weight organic compounds that have pi electron systems that can be excited by visible light and often exhibit ph dependent charge micropollutants n 23 are organic compounds such as agrochemicals pharmaceuticals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons which have a lower molecular weight are mostly non charged or negatively charged in this study and often have pi electron systems inorganic pollutants include heavy metals ali and khan 2018 n 65 and oxyanions n 17 the most frequently studied pollutants were the heavy metals cu2 n 16 pb2 n 15 and cd2 n 12 the oxyanion cr vi n 10 the dye methylene blue n 19 and the micropollutant bisphenol a n 4 these heavy metals oxyanions and micropollutants are all epa regulated water pollutants or included in contaminant candidate lists ccls and their removal from water warrants the development of novel sorbents however methylene blue is neither regulated nor included in ccls but receives disproportionate focus in the field of novel water remediation technologies bielska and szymanowski 2006 houas et al 2001 rafatullah et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 perhaps due to the ease with which it can be quantified and to the vast existing literature that allows easy comparison of results we strongly suggest future research limits its focus on methylene blue and instead focus on persistent emerging micropollutants bai et al 2018 tran et al 2018 qmax values were significantly influenced by pollutant class and charge p 0 001 fig 6 a and c table 1 micropollutants had significantly lower qmax values than dyes p 0 03 and heavy metals p 0 0001 accordingly qmax values were higher for positively than neutral p 0 003 or negatively p 0 02 charged pollutants with estimated mean effect sizes of 4 2 and 2 4 respectively table s4 kl values were also significantly influenced by pollutant class p 0 001 and charge p 0 01 fig 6b and d table 1 the mean effect of dyes was 6 5 times higher than heavy metals p 0 001 table s4 kl values were significantly higher for negatively than positively charged pollutants p 0 01 fig 6c table 1 though post hoc tests did not reveal significant pairwise comparisons suggesting negatively charged dyes and oxyanions drive high kl values these results correspond well to the pca plot which showed that kl was associated with negatively charged dyes fig 3 and to the regression between kl and pollutant mw fig s5 which was highest for dyes when including study id as a random effect mean effects were diminished due to reduced degrees of freedom and large within versus across study variance however trends were similar table 1 this variance highlights the need for testing cpn performance across labs using standardized protocols see section 3 6 improving confidence in results within the field is essential for honing the design and technological adoption of novel materials 3 2 5 pollutant functional group interactions according to our survey cpns adsorb pollutants through several types of functional groups and participate in numerous chemical interactions for example charged carboxylate and cationic amines can form electrostatic and ion exchange interactions this is useful for targeting heavy metals oxyanions and polar moieties in organic pollutants el dessouky et al 2018 gardi and mishael 2018 lozano morales et al 2018 polymer aromatic rings and aliphatic chains can interact with organic pollutants through hydrophobic and pi pi interactions cao et al 2009 kohay et al 2015 amine and amide polymer functional groups can complex heavy metals cho et al 2012 kumararaja et al 2018 and polymer hydroxyls can form h bonds with various pollutant molecules potential mechanisms involved in pollutant adsorption by cpns has been recently summarized mukhopadhyay et al 2020 here we used stepwise multiple linear regression mlr to evaluate whether specific pollutant functional group interactions can explain the variance in qmax and kl across pollutant class and charge we focus on heavy metals and cationic dyes because they have enough observations for robust analysis we did not include a formal analysis of oxyanions and micropollutants due to low samples size n 17 and n 23 respectively 3 2 5 1 heavy metals qmax values for heavy metals were best explained with a model specification including six explanatory variables adjusted r2 0 77 p 0 0001 table 2 and s5 qmax values were strongly negatively correlated with adsorption fabrication method but positively correlated with in situ polymerization cation exchange and amide functional groups pollutant molecular weight and cpns based on smectite significantly improved aic scores but the coefficients were not statistically significant and small in magnitude kl values were positively correlated with in situ polymerization but negatively related to the molecular weight of heavy metals as well as cation exchange and amide functional groups adjusted r2 0 21 p 0 01 table 2 and s5 the effect of fabrication mode and polymer functional groups on qmax is in line with pca and anova results figs 3 5 and table 1 which suggest that in situ polymerization may be the most advantageous fabrication approach for heavy metal removal considering the higher polymer content often achieved by this fabrication method we suggest qmax values should be normalized to polymer content mass pollutant per mass polymer to identify whether in situ polymerization increases the number or accessibility of adsorption sites shabtai and mishael 2018 compared with cpns fabricated by polymer adsorption pca plots revealed that heavy metal studies clustered around amine functional groups or carboxyl and cation exchange groups suggesting heavy metals are targeted through complexation and electrostatic ion exchange mechanisms anirudhan et al 2012 respectively mlr results also suggest cation exchange and amide functional groups which also form complexes with heavy metals boyd et al 1979 were associated with high heavy metal qmax but amide functional groups were also linked to low kl values this implies that cpns with ion exchange electrostatic and complexing capabilities such as amide and carboxyl containing polymers have excellent potential for heavy metal removal but require more in depth investigation ilgin et al 2015 3 2 5 2 cationic dyes variation in the adsorption capacity of cpns for cationic dyes was best explained by including four variables adjusted r2 0 3 p 0 001 table 2 and s5 in this model qmax was positively correlated with polymer hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups and negatively correlated with in situ polymerization fabrication pollutant mw was also included in the best fit model but the coefficient was small we could not identify a best fit model to explain variation in kl values of cationic dyes based on the tested cpn and pollutant properties adjusted r2 0 08 p 0 07 table 2 and s5 the mlr and pca results fig 3 table s2 and table 2 and s5 both indicate a positive association exists between cationic dyes and carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups indicating electrostatic ion exchange h bonding and other non specific interactions in contrast to heavy metals in situ polymerization was strongly negatively correlated with qmax suggesting this fabrication method reduces the accessibility of adsorption sites for dye pollutants this could be the result of the large molecular size of dyes shabtai and mishael 2016 e g 17 å methylene blue greathouse et al 2015 vs 4 19 å for cu2 asthagiri et al 2004 and the thick polymeric phase produced by in situ polymerization shaheen et al 2016 to investigate adsorption site accessibility a molar calculation of adsorbed dyes per adsorption sites assuming the composition and stoichiometry of the adsorption sites are known is required shabtai and mishael 2018 however this is seldom reported in the literature 3 2 5 3 oxyanions oxyanions were strongly associated with cationic amine groups which is indicative of an electrostatic adsorption mechanism fig 3 and table s2 the above average kl values indicate that cpns are an excellent sorbent for oxyanion removal gardi and mishael 2018 however lower than average qmax values and low number of observations highlight the need for future research in this direction fig 6a and b perhaps focusing on cpns fabricated via in situ polymerization 3 2 5 4 micropollutants based on pca results neutral micropollutants were targeted via pi pi interactions with aromatic functional groups cao et al 2009 keiluweit and kleber 2009 while negatively charged micropollutants could also be targeted via cationic amine functional groups ateia et al 2019 kohay et al 2015 the low qmax of micropollutants fig 6a could suggest cpns have been better tailored for targeting charged pollutants which were primarily tested in this meta analysis and are less effective for uncharged micropollutants however this could also be an underestimation due to having only one observation of micropollutant removal by a cpn fabricated using in situ polymerization guo et al 2011 which has been shown to correlate with high qmax the total number of studies on micropollutants is small n 23 necessitating further research to optimize cpns for their removal a potentially useful approach may be functionalizing clays with aromatic polymers kong et al 2019 and carbonaceous materials darder et al 2018 diagboya et al 2020 premarathna et al 2019 that are capable of interacting with micropollutants containing aromatic functional groups finally the reviewed studies individually highlight the key role of chemical interactions between polymer functional groups and pollutants indeed the results of this meta analysis based on those studies and applying multiple statistical approaches validate this conclusion across a broad and diverse selection of cpns and pollutant classes and confirm its generality however most of the reviewed studies investigated a simplified system in equilibrium containing deionized water and a single pollutant fig 7 the role of such chemical interactions may be less pronounced upon pollutant removal from real water i e higher ionic strength competing pollutants dissolved organics etc via adsorption columns non equilibrium 3 3 cpn testing and benchmarking to translate optimistic results from lab scale experiments to technological applications cpns must be tested under realistic conditions encountered in water treatment industries and benchmarked against existing commercial sorbents the adsorption performance of novel cpns should also be compared to other reported cpns such as the data compiled here this can serve as a first step in evaluating their technological potential fig 7 summarizes the type and prevalence of experiments used to characterize test and benchmark designed cpn sorbents we found that 85 of the observations investigated how solution chemistry ph and ionic strength affects adsorption n 134 these experiments are useful for understanding adsorption mechanisms and evaluating adsorption under different operating conditions more than half of the observations included adsorption kinetic experiments n 98 to obtain a kinetic coefficient and tested adsorption at different temperatures to determine the enthalpy of the reaction n 92 approximately one third of the observations n 54 extracted thermodynamic parameters while these experiments yield rich mechanistic and operational information they do not address four key issues of cpn applicability in water treatment facilities 1 adsorption of pollutants at relevant concentrations from real water matrices 2 regeneration potential of spent cpn 3 cpn granulation and performance in columns or slurry if relevant and 4 side by side comparisons of pollutant removal efficiency and cost relative to commercially available sorbents at realistic operational conditions e g flow rate contact time based on our survey of review articles we conclude that this knowledge gap is common across other fields of sorbent design bhatnagar and anastopoulos 2017 gerente et al 2007 gupta et al 2013 wang and giammar 2019 and as such our following recommendations may be pertinent to a broad research area beyond that of cpns 4 future perspectives 4 1 technological application in addition to thorough investigation of cpn properties and interactions with the targeted pollutants cpn applicability most also be evaluated in realistic conditions 1 pollutant adsorption from real water is often lower relative to deionized water due to the presence of background solutes that can compete for adsorption sites zietzschmann et al 2014 block adsorptive pores quinlivan et al 2005 and form complexes with pollutants in solution ruiz et al 2013 adsorption from real water was only tested in 41 of the observations n 64 and its effect i e percent reduction in pollutant removal was seldom quantified we strongly encourage future studies test how effective sorbents are at removing pollutants from real water e g municipal or industrial wastewater at environmentally relevant concentrations and study pollutants that reflect current water treatment needs ray et al 2019 with that said real water can vary from place to place and while it is useful for evaluating cpn performance for a specific situation the use of standardized challenge water andrew 2002 and even standardized experimentation protocols ali and gupta 2007 can streamline comparison of novel sorbents 2 handling spent sorbents is an inherent challenge in adsorption technology spent sorbents can be disposed of as solid waste or regenerated and reused for example spent activated carbon is removed from its column and thermally regenerated which is a major expense demonstrating the feasibility of cpn regeneration increases their economic competitiveness and reduces their environmental impact in situ regeneration in the column further establishes the potential of cpns shabtai and mishael 2018 2017 sorbent regeneration was studied in 58 of the observations n 98 chemical regeneration desorption induced by acid base organic solvent or electrolyte solution was by far the most common approach investigated in the studies included here often reaching almost complete desorption thermal biological and catalytic regeneration of clay based sorbents have also been probed unuabonah and taubert 2014 zhu et al 2009 regeneration experiments should determine the efficiency of chemical regeneration i e what percentage is desorbed whether adsorption is compromised by repeated adsorption regeneration cycles the kinetics of desorption and the volume of regenerating solution needed chemical regeneration also throws light on the adsorption mechanisms at play is it ph dependent electrostatic hydrophobic and is therefore a valuable tool moving forward efficient degradation of the regenerant pollutant solution should be investigated as it is a key component of the adsorption regeneration approach 3 commercial sorbents are most often applied in fixed bed adsorption columns because separation regeneration and reuse of the spent sorbent are technically easier in column than in batch mode accordingly cpns should also be tested in columns especially since sorbent capacity is often lower in column than batch mode ray et al 2019 shabtai and mishael 2018 however only 13 of the observations n 19 tested cpn performance in columns of which only two tested the cpn as a bead or granule a major hurdle to applying cpns and many other novel sorbents in fixed bed columns is their small particle size nm to µm size range and swelling properties which limit water flow rate through the column cpn granulation can potentially overcome this challenge although the effect of granulation technique and adsorption kinetics must be carefully investigated du et al 2017 ouellet plamondon et al 2012 for example we recently reported a granulated cpn which was employed in adsorption columns for removal of dissolved organic matter from surface water the mechanically stable granules enabled a high flow rate and the columns were in situ regenerated and re used zusman et al 2020 4 finally since cpns are proposed as alternative sorbents they must be experimentally compared to conventionally used sorbents e g ion exchangers activated carbons or granular ferric oxides despite that we found that only 13 of the observations n 20 performed side by side comparisons which should ideally investigate the effect of background organic matter on column performance kohay et al 2015 ling et al 2017 while activated carbons often have very high qmax values our work has shown that cpns are advantageous in real water scenarios because unlike activated carbon their performance is less compromised in the presence of background organic matter kohay et al 2015 zadaka et al 2009 cpns can be designed to specifically remove background organic matter shabtai and mishael 2016 even simultaneously with micropollutants shabtai and mishael 2018 2016 employing cpns in tandem with commercial sorbents could enhance the removal of pollutant mixtures since sorbents can have different affinities for different pollutants this has been shown to optimize adsorption efficiency du et al 2017 zusman et al 2020 and maintain column hydraulic conductivity while utilizing existing infrastructure for operating columns with commercial sorbents while beyond the scope of this analysis we acknowledge that the environmental and economic performance of new materials and technologies n 4 observations dictates their acceptance in the market and requires rigorous assessment alhashimi and aktas 2017 kumar et al 2019 4 2 scientific investigation although most of the research on cpn adsorbents focuses on the chemical parameters ph temperature etc that influence pollutant adsorption fig 7 we suggest that future research must also consider the overlooked aspect of polymer conformation on the clay mineral surface and its influence on cpn adsorption performance polymer adsorption on a clay mineral often transitions from a flat conformation as monomer trains to an extended conformation as monomer loops and tails when 1 polymer loading increases kohay et al 2015 2 polymer charge density decreases levy et al 2019 and 3 ionic strength increases shabtai and mishael 2016 this transition from a trains to a loops and tails conformation does not only occur on the clay s external surfaces but usually induces intercalation between the clay platelets and may even induce platelet exfoliation poly 4 vinylpyridine pvp is one of the few polymers that have been investigated for the effects of its conformation on the performance of pvp based cpns the nitrogen atom in the pyridine monomers can be protonated pka 3 55 hpvp gardi et al 2015 yielding ph dependent polycations and functionalized with a methyl group qpvp kohay et al 2015 or an ethanol group ohpvp levy et al 2019 resulting in constant charge polycations with tunable charge densities accordingly we studied the interactions of pvp based cpns with micropollutants that can be targeted through pi pi interactions hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions gardi et al 2015 kohay et al 2015 levy et al 2019 radian and mishael 2012 we used x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis to characterize polymer conformation and show that it plays a pivotal role in cpn performance along with polymer chemistry we found that a loops and tails conformation created a nanostructure that increased the qmax and kl of qpvp cpn and ohpvp cpn for anionic micropollutants such as gemfibrozil diclofenac and ibuprofen levy et al 2019 shabtai and mishael 2016 in contrast lozano morales et al found that a cpn bearing a highly charged polycation in a trains conformation adsorbed the anionic micropollutants sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac better than a cpn bearing a low charge polycation in a loops and tails conformation lozano morales et al 2018 loops and tails extending into solution may offer more diverse monomer pollutant orientations kohay et al 2019 while uncharged monomers in loops and tails segments may promote hydrophobic interactions with apolar pollutants lozano morales et al 2018 furthermore adsorption sites in loops and tails were found to be inaccessible by larger dissolved organic matter compounds shabtai and mishael 2016 these few studies show the important but understudied role of polymer conformation on pollutant removal 5 conclusions design of novel and exciting cpns even if their initial performance requires tuning is at the heart of scientific research in this field such pioneering studies can focus on selective pollutant adsorption and facile regeneration perhaps using computer aided design polymer loading chemistry and conformation on the clay surface should be thoroughly characterized in future studies and the effects of these physicochemical properties on adsorption performance should be tested to optimize cpns future research can also probe understudied minerals polymers and fabrication techniques to design cpn with new properties more applicable studies should rigorously evaluate and benchmark these novel cpns for the removal of emerging pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations and in realistic operational conditions community wide adoption of standardized adsorption protocols challenge waters and reporting conventions will enable effective comparison of sorbent performance finally our database can be used as a searchable repository of adsorption data aimed at supporting transdisciplinary comparisons and benchmarking that drives data based discoveries for the material research and environmental remediation communities

17395,clay polymer nanocomposites cpns have been studied for two decades as sorbents for water pollutants but their applicability remains limited our aim in this review is to present the latest progress in cpn research using a meta analysis approach and identify key steps necessary to bridge the gap between basic research and cpn application based on results extracted from 99 research articles on cpns and 8 review articles on other widely studies sorbents cpns had higher adsorption capacities for several inorganic and organic pollutant classes including heavy metals oxyanions and dyes n 308 observations we applied principal component analysis analysis of variance and multiple linear regressions to test how cpn and pollutant properties correlated with langmuir adsorption model coefficients while adsorption was surprisingly not influenced by mineral properties it was influenced by cpn fabrication method polymer functional groups and pollutant properties for example among the pollutant classes heavy metals had the highest adsorption capacity but the lowest adsorption affinity on the other hand dyes had high adsorption affinities as reflected by the linear correlation between adsorption affinity and pollutant molecular weight scaling from basic research to technological application requires testing cpn performance in real water application in columns comparison to commercial sorbents regeneration and cost evaluation however our survey indicates that of the 158 observations only 20 compared the cpn s performance to that of a commercial sorbent we anticipate that this review will promote the design of smart and functional cpns which can then evolve into an effective water treatment technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords clay polymer nanocomposites adsorption water treatment meta analysis 1 introduction water resources often contain an array of pollutants that pose public health and environmental concerns schwarzenbach et al 2010 removing organic and inorganic pollutants from water is often achieved by adsorbing them to activated carbon ion exchange resins and oxides driehaus et al 1998 fu and wang 2011 kumar et al 2019 worch 2012 however each of these sorbents has various critical shortcomings such as reduced effectiveness in the presence of background electrolytes and organic matter dixit et al 2018 quinlivan et al 2005 low pollutant specificity ling et al 2017 high operating costs alhashimi and aktas 2017 and energy intensive regeneration foo and hameed 2012 therefore in recent decades there has been enormous interest in tailoring sorbents to provide efficient inexpensive and pollutant specific alternatives to conventional sorbents kyzas and matis 2015 clay polymer nanocomposites cpns are a broad group of materials designed using many combinations of clay minerals and polymers originally clay minerals were dispersed into individual layers and incorporated into the polymer phase typically at less than 5 wt to enhance polymer properties chen et al 2008 clay minerals such as smectites have layers that are approximately 1 nm thick and a diameter of up to several microns the young s modulus in the layer direction is 50 to 400 times higher than that of a typical polymer thus the composite material has improved properties such as young s modulus tensile strength fire retardancy barrier resistance and ion conductivity chen et al 2008 clay minerals often bare a negative charge resulting from isomorphous substitution and have the capacity to adsorb positively charged pollutants such as heavy metals and cationic dyes via exchange of their counter cation more recently cpns have been studied as materials for pollutant removal from water in membrane flocculation oxidation and adsorption processes by combining the valuable properties of the mineral component low cost low toxicity mechanical stability and large surface area with those of the polymeric components high adsorption efficiencies diverse functional group chemistry enhanced swelling and surface area cpns can be tailored to target specific pollutants with enhanced adsorption performance compared to bare clay minerals the field has rapidly evolved since breen and watson first reported a cpn sorbent composed of a polycation adsorbed to a smectite mineral breen and watson 1998 recent studies have reported smart multi component composite sorbents based on multiple polymers and modifiers that are characterized using advanced techniques gardi and mishael 2018 hatami et al 2020 lv et al 2020 ma et al 2017 rethinasabapathy et al 2018 sarkar et al 2018 and employed for the removal of an array of pollutants ray et al 2019 recent literature reviews on cpns have qualitatively discussed cpn building blocks clays and polymers fabrication methods and properties e g surface area and charge compiled adsorption results from relevant studies and suggested future challenges and research directions han et al 2019 kar et al 2019 mukhopadhyay et al 2020 srinivasan 2011 unuabonah and taubert 2014 such literature reviews are instrumental for summarizing recent progress in a given discipline but they cannot quantitatively synthesize and interpret large scale datasets and results across studies in contrast meta analyses are aimed at determining overall trends by statistically analyzing data from several independent studies of the same subject meta analyses are adept at summarizing and synthesizing diverse studies meng et al 2016 meyer et al 2019 wolfram et al 2018 a key benefit of analyzing numerous studies is the aggregation of information that leads to a higher statistical power and more robust estimates than are possible from any individual study meta analyses have been implemented to identify universal trends in topics central to water research such as phosphorous removal from lake waters spears et al 2016 decay rates of viruses and coliphages in surface waters beohm et al 2019 and contaminant removal by conventional and emerging media for urban stormwater treatment okaikue woodi et al 2020 however only a handful of meta analyses have been performed on sorbents in general alhashimi and aktas 2017 benstoem et al 2017 mejias carpio et al 2018 and none have been performed on clay based sorbents here we present a quantitative meta analysis of the data published on cpns in the last decade from a basic science perspective it is important to identify how cpn and pollutant properties influence adsorption performance kar et al 2019 but a meta analysis can reveal more general trends based on numerous observations translating cpn laboratory based data into technology based processes is complex mukhopadhyay et al 2020 and seldom addressed gardi et al 2015 kumar et al 2012 ray et al 2019 this review highlights the key steps necessary to bridge cpn laboratory scale performance to technological applicability which is a crucial stage towards commercialization of cpns or any other sorbent accordingly we collected sorbent pollutant and adsorption data from 397 observations published in 99 original research articles and 8 review articles we analyzed the adsorption performance of cpns for different pollutants using principal component analysis pca analysis of variance anova and stepwise multiple linear regression mlr the aims of this review were to 1 compile a database consisting of information from cpn studies of the past decade to quantify the number of studies reporting different clays and polymers modes of cpn fabrication pollutants and adsorption models 2 analyze the linkages between cpn properties pollutant chemistry and adsorption performance 3 highlight the necessary steps to benchmark novel cpns in realistic water treatment scenarios and 4 identify underexplored research opportunities 2 methods the workflow and methodology of this review is depicted in fig 1 2 1 literature review we identified potentially relevant studies n 548 using the search string clay or clay mineral and polymer or composite or nanocomposite and water or wastewater and adsorption or sorption or removal and pollutant or contaminant occurring in the title abstract and or keywords of articles published in the years 2008 2019 using the web of science core collection and google scholar our search cutoff date was 14 9 2019 and our selection criteria below yielded 99 articles and 158 experimental observations fig s1 we verified that each article reported original quantitative data for pollutant adsorption from an aqueous matrix to a composite material consisting of at the least a clay mineral or iron fe oxide functionalized with a synthetic or natural polymer studies on cpns based on an unidentified mixture of clay minerals were excluded only studies that reported langmuir adsorption capacity qmax and affinity kl or freundlich model coefficients n and kf see below based on replicated adsorption isotherms were included separately google scholar was searched for review articles on widely studied sorbents that compiled published data of pollutant adsorption we chose commonly studied pollutants for which we could extract n 10 observations from at least four additional sorbents and extracted their qmax values kl values were often not reported in these reviews and therefore not included while we acknowledge that a few sorbents included in our meta analysis may not meet the accepted definition of a nanomaterial the vast majority of them do we chose to classify all sorbents reviewed here as cpns to continue the terminology used in recent reviews and papers kar et al 2019 mukhopadhyay et al 2020 unuabonah and taubert 2014 2 2 data extraction information about the cpn the targeted pollutant adsorption metrics and other information were extracted from every experimental observation in each study 33 of the 99 studies contained more than one experimental observation e g one cpn tested for more than one pollutant cpn information included clay mineral and polymer type and cpn fabrication method adsorption cross linking in situ polymerization or grafting montmorillonite and bentonite were collectively classified as smectites while attapulgite sepiolite and palygorskite were classified as palygorskites active adsorption sites termed functional groups were inferred from a priori knowledge about polymer chemistry experimental results e g effect of solution chemistry on adsorption evidence of cation or anion exchange or spectroscopic findings and based on the discussion in each study where relevant the ph of the adsorption system was used to help assign functional groups for example carboxyl groups were assigned as a cpn functional group when the ph was higher than its typical pka 4 5 we recorded where available cpn surface charge n 68 observations inferred from electrophoretic mobility zadaka et al 2010 or potentiometric titration pereira et al 2017 measurements and bet surface area n 62 observations dogan et al 2006 we recorded where available cpn polymer or organic component content n 50 observations cpn polymer content was mostly determined using thermogravimetric or elemental analysis of the solid phase or in the case of cpn fabrication using direct polymer adsorption by measuring the non adsorbed polymer concentration however thermogravimetric analysis results were only included if they accounted for mass loss from cpn dehydration and other structural decomposition of the clay mineral as described by ray et al ray et al 2019 organic and inorganic pollutants were binned into four classes dyes n 53 micropollutants n 23 heavy metals n 65 and oxyanions n 17 studies on the adsorption of other inorganic ions including fluoride n 4 cesium n 1 and ammonium n 1 were excluded due to insufficient sample size pollutant information included molecular weight mw and charge negative neutral or positive at the ph value of the adsorption experiment we excluded studies on substances lacking a definitive mw such as dissolved organic matter cpn adsorption performance was evaluated by analyzing adsorption isotherm coefficients an adsorption isotherm is a curve describing the retention of a substance at equilibrium on a solid particle data from adsorption isotherms are typically fit to langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir isotherm equation was developed to model homogenous monolayer adsorption of gas to a solid surface foo and hameed 2010 but is the most widely used model to interpret adsorption from aqueous media the langmuir adsorption capacity qmax reflects the maximum amount of adsorbed pollutants per unit mass sorbent and the langmuir adsorption coefficient kl quantifies the affinity of a pollutant to the sorbent surface across the entire database cpns had median qmax and kl values of 0 55 mmol g and 29 64 l mmol respectively the freundlich isotherm equation is a power function while lacking a thermodynamic basis it is often used to fit adsorption data to heterogenous adsorption sites foo and hameed 2010 freundlich coefficients include the dimensionless n and the freundlich constant kf which relays information on the extent of adsorption though it does not predict adsorption capacity foo and hameed 2010 in cases where langmuir and freundlich models were applied to the same adsorption isotherm we extracted the coefficients that provided a better fit for the data adsorption coefficients were converted to molar basis using pollutant mw as necessary we used the reported ph in the adsorption experiment to determine the mw of oxyanions which varies with ph thermodynamic parameters δg⁰ δh⁰ and δs⁰ which can be calculated from adsorption isotherms measured at several temperatures and the pseudo second order kinetic model coefficient calculated from adsorption kinetic experiments tran et al 2017 were also extracted to assess whether cpns were benchmarked and tested for water treatment applications we recorded whether the following experiments were performed in addition to those described above i pollutant adsorption from varying solution chemistry ph and ionic strength ii pollutant adsorption from real water wastewater natural water or synthetic real water i e deionized water containing multiple pollutants and background solutes iii regeneration of spent cpns iv adsorption experiments in fixed bed columns v experimental comparison of cpns to commercially used sorbents and vi cost evaluation the complete database and references for the articles used in this meta analysis are included in the supplementary material 2 3 statistical analyses 2 3 1 principal component analysis pca we tested for an association between minerals functional groups pollutant properties class charge cpn fabrication methods and langmuir coefficients using principal components analysis pca pca results were computed after scaling using factominer an r package for multivariate analysis lê et al 2008 and visualized using statistical tools for high throughput data analysis kassambara 2017 confidence ellipses were used to visualize whether categorical groups were significantly different from each other and defined as regions containing 95 of all samples that can be drawn from the underlying gaussian distribution variables with n 10 observations or p values 0 05 were excluded 2 3 2 one way analysis of variance anova we used one way anova models to identify the main effects of mineral pollutant properties class charge and cpn fabrication method on our dependent variable of interest qmax and kl we compared anova results with those from linear mixed effect models lmer using the lme4 package bates et al 2007 lmer models were constructed as above but included study id as a categorical random effect to account for the nonindependence of observations originating from the same study for all models qmax and kl values were transformed to fit assumptions of normality using the log10 scale normal distributions were evaluated using shapiro wilk tests and qq plots estimated marginal means were computed using the emmeans package lenth et al 2018 and coefficients b i b j were back transformed in the manuscript for ease of interpretation lane 2002 p values were calculated using tukey s hsd method for comparing a family of estimates 2 3 3 multiple linear regression mlr we constructed multiple linear regression models using cpn and pollutant properties as covariates for predicting variation in qmax and kl dummy variables were made from categorical variables excluding those with fewer than 10 observations we used exhaustive forwards and backwards stepwise aic akaike information criterion selected linear regression models to identify relationships between our dependent variable of interest qmax or kl and potential predictor variables for two common pollutant classes heavy metals and cationic dyes we analyzed subsets of the database so mutually exclusive variables were not included in the same model for example heavy metals which are always positively charged and oxyanions which are always negatively charged stepwise multiple linear regressions were conducted following reported procedure lynch et al 2019 using the stats package in r team 2013 we normalized dependent variables using the boxcox power transformation to yield normally distributed errors assessed using shapiro wilk tests of the residuals q q plots studentized residuals and non constant variance scores best fit model results aic scores and boxcox λ values are reported in the supplementary material table s5 3 results 3 1 dataset our literature search yielded 158 experimental observations from 99 published papers for comparison similar meta analyses of adsorption systems consisted of n 44 n 195 and n 63 observations benstoem et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 mejias carpio et al 2018 for each of the observations we compiled information and the following data were included in statistical analyses clay and polymer type cpn fabrication method and pollutant class charge and molecular weight data on cpn surface area surface charge and polymer content potentially important variables describing cpn properties were available for a limited number of observations and therefore not included in the formal meta analysis principal component analyses examining freundlich n 46 and pseudo second order kinetic n 98 model coefficients and thermodynamic parameters n 54 as adsorption metrics were constrained by few observations and reported in the supplementary material figures s2 s4 we ultimately restricted our pca anova and mlr analyses to langmuir model coefficients qmax and kl n 141 due to the low number of observations of the adsorption metrics to assess the percentage of observations that report cpn benchmarking and application testing we recorded if the following experiments were performed pollutant adsorption from real water regeneration of spent cpns adsorption in fixed bed columns experimental comparison of cpns to commercially used sorbents and cost evaluation 3 2 synthesis of data on cpn adsorption performance 3 2 1 pollutant adsorption by cpns versus common sorbents our survey indicates the langmuir adsorption capacities qmax of cpns for several commonly studied organic dyes and inorganic heavy metals and oxyanions pollutant classes exceeded or equaled those of other sorbents including biochar activated carbon and modified chitosan fig 2 and table s1 kl values were often not reported for these sorbents and therefore not included although variation in solution chemistry and experimental conditions affects adsorption coefficients wang and giammar 2019 we observed significant differences in qmax among sorbents p 0 0001 and significant interactions between sorbent and pollutant class p 0 01 across this large dataset which encompassed multiple experimental conditions n 308 observations while some sorbents have a high qmax because they are chemically compatible with one specific pollutant class for example activated carbons for dyes mezohegyi et al 2012 yagub et al 2014 or graphene oxides for heavy metals peng et al 2017 the high qmax of cpns for each pollutant class stems from their tunability or chemically compatibility with a wide range of pollutants cpns are also superior sorbents than their clay mineral building blocks the qmax of cpns averaged over all three pollutant classes is 1 72 mmol g and the kl is 201 45 l mmol for comparison the qmax of smectite for cu2 and methylene blue the most widely studied mineral heavy metal and cationic dye in our survey is 0 45 mmol g and 0 9 mmol g respectively while the kl is 1 9 l mmol and 3 2 l mmol respectively almeida et al 2009 bhattacharyya and gupta 2006 the advantage of positive cpns over bare smectite which bears a negative surface charge would likely be more pronounced for the adsorption of anionic pollutants 3 2 2 visualizing relationships among variables to identify parameters driving the high qmax of cpns we used principal component analysis pca to assess relationships between cpn properties pollutant properties and langmuir model coefficients within ordination space dimensions 1 and 2 together explained 25 of the variance fig 3 and table s2 based on 95 confidence intervals visualized as shaded ellipses dyes and heavy metals were significantly different from each other and from micropollutants and oxyanions micropollutants and oxyanions were not significantly different qmax loaded in the opposite direction from oxyanions and micropollutants suggesting adsorption capacity for these classes was lower though qmax values accounted for only 5 of the variability across the first two dimensions in contrast kl values accounted for 10 of the variability along dimension 2 alone suggesting the affinity of dyes and high mw pollutants for the tested cpns especially those based on smectites were higher than average the positive correlation between mw and kl p 0 0001 figure s5 supports established evidence that adsorption affinities increase with mw breen 1999 this trend may be related to the energy gain of high mw pollutants dehydrating and forming multiple interactions with the sorbent surface fabrication methods influence the chemical and structural properties of cpns thereby influencing their adsorption performance see section 3 3 3 fabrication using the in situ polymerization approach was positively correlated with dimension 2 0 55 and explained 14 of the variance loading with qmax and sulfonate and cation exchange functional groups fig 3 and table s2 in contrast adsorption fabrication methods were negatively correlated with dimension 2 0 67 and explained an additional 20 of the variance along with cross linking fabrication methods explained 38 of the variance indicating their crucial role in cpn adsorption performance oxyanions were strongly related to cpns bearing cationic amine functional groups which accounted for 15 of the variability across dimension 1 while micropollutants were associated with aromatic functional groups accounting for 10 of variance explained across the first two dimensions table s2 in contrast heavy metals were associated with amine carboxyl and cation exchange functional groups which together accounted for 17 of the variability across dimension 1 together these results reveal that observations are separated across pollutant class and charge polymer functional group and fabrication method demonstrating that cpns can be rationally designed to maximize chemical interactions between the polymer and targeted pollutant 3 2 3 cpn building blocks at their simplest form cpns consist of a clay mineral functionalized with a polymer we present these cpn building blocks and discuss how various fabrication methods shape the structure and properties of cpns we then assess their contribution to adsorption performance using one way anova table 1 and table s4 and stepwise multiple linear regressions table 2 and s5 3 2 3 1 cpn building blocks clay minerals clay minerals are well known sorbents with exhaustively characterized adsorption sites gaines and thomas 1953 ikhsan et al 1999 our survey shows that most cpns were designed using six different mineral classes fig 4 a smectites phyllosilicates based on si tetrahedra and al octahedra 2 1 were the most commonly used mineral 63 of observations likely because they easily disperse in water and polar organic solvents gardi and mishael 2018 herrera et al 2004 and possess a large total surface area 710 m2 g and cation exchange capacity 0 85 meq g borden and giese 2001 these traits are well suited for the adsorption of cationic and neutral polymers deng et al 2006 and the exchange sites serve as additional adsorption sites for cationic pollutants such as heavy metals barbier et al 2000 other clay minerals included palygorskite 10 zeolite 6 layered double hydroxide ldh 6 fe oxide 5 halloysite 5 kaolinite 3 and k feldspar 2 while fe oxides are not clay minerals they are mineralogically related and widely reported as useful sorbents for water treatment xu et al 2012 although smectites were the most prevalent clay building block several interesting studies selected less explored clay minerals including zeolites ldhs and palygorskites zeolites are aluminosilicates based on al and si tetrahedra that form microporous negatively charged frameworks containing exchangeable metal cations zeolite pores can serve as adsorption sites that target a specific pollutant or a broad mixture of pollutants based on the uniformity of their structure rossner et al 2009 in contrast to most clay minerals synthetic ldhs possess a positive surface charge because of partial substitution of trivalent for divalent cations in the brucite like layers goh et al 2008 this allows for facile functionalization of ldhs with anionic bio polymers such as alginate and fulvic acids and subsequent removal of cationic pollutants li et al 2018 palygorskites are fibrous clay minerals with high porosity 0 38 0 58 cm3 g high specific surface area 173 m2 g dogan et al 2006 and abundant surface si oh groups that can be hydrolyzed to obtain ph dependent charged groups liu et al 2015 or grafted with organo silanes as a first step for surface initiated polymerization chen et al 2009 xue et al 2011 due to small sample sizes n 5 k feldspar and kaolinite were excluded from anova models despite large differences in their structure surface area and exchange capacity table s3 qmax values did not differ across mineral classes in the standard p 0 5 or random mixed effects p 0 9 model table 1 and figure s6 kl values varied across mineral class p 0 02 but all pairwise comparisons were insignificant similar cpn adsorption performances across clay building blocks is likely caused by the dominating influence of polymer functional group chemistry ray et al 2019 cpn surface charge shabtai and mishael 2016 and cpn structure levy et al 2019 shabtai and mishael 2018 in addition the paucity of experimental evidence for clay minerals other than smectite limits insight on the advantages of alternate mineral building blocks 3 2 3 2 cpn building blocks polymers the polymer building block of cpns constitutes the driving force behind pollutant adsorption as it contains numerous and often diverse adsorption sites in addition to those on the mineral surface functionalization of clay minerals with a polymer is often associated with desorption of water and ions from the mineral surface significantly changing its surface chemistry the polymer can change the mineral s surface charge seyrek et al 2011 influencing the attraction and repulsion of charged pollutants chen et al 2013 l li et al 2018 m li et al 2018 polymers can also alter the mineral s crystal structure and surface morphology by intercalating between clay layers exfoliating them or agglomerating them into larger particles chen et al 2008 shaikh et al 2017 these processes result from complex mineral polymer interactions that can induce conformational changes of polymer chains on the mineral surface kohay et al 2015 implications for adsorption performance shabtai and mishael 2018 2016 are discussed below section 4 2 because these parameters are difficult to compare and often unreported we focus instead on polymer functional group chemistry as a proxy for cpn pollutant compatibility our survey identified 39 polymer types fig 4b the most frequently studied were chitosan 23 polyacrylamide 11 and polyacrylic acid 10 chitosan is a water soluble at low ph biocompatible biopolymer with amino and hydroxyl functional groups polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid are water soluble easily cross linked synthetic polymers that contain amide and carboxylic functional groups respectively accordingly the most common functional groups in cpns are hydroxyl carboxylic amine and cationic amine along with aromatic aliphatic amide and cation exchange groups fig 4c because cpns contain combinations of two or more functional groups we tested the effect of polymer functional group on adsorption metrics using stepwise multiple linear regressions section 3 5 3 2 3 3 cpn fabrication method building with the blocks we identified four principal approaches to functionalizing clay minerals with polymers adsorption in situ polymerization cross linking and grafting figure s7 most of the cpns 40 of observations were fabricated using direct polymer adsorption onto the clay surface by mixing a polymer solution with a clay dispersion this method utilizes attractive electrostatic and non specific van der waals interactions van de steeg et al 1992 between polymers and clay mineral surfaces polymer adsorption is often driven by entropic gains associated with dehydration of large polymer chains as they adsorb on the mineral and desorption of mineral bound water chen and evans 2004 lee and ruckenstein 1988 the in situ polymerization method 34 of observations begins with mixing monomers or polymer precursors with dispersed clay followed by the addition of a polymerization initiator e g azobisisobutyronitrile or ammonium persulfate zhu and wilkie 2000 the cross linking method 10 of observations consists of reacting a clay or clay polymer mixture with a cross linking compound e g alginate or epichlorohydrin that forms bonds between adsorbed polymer chains polymer chains and clay or that self polymerizes and as a result reinforces the cpn structure tirtom et al 2012 cross linked cpns are often capable of swelling and adsorbing large amounts of water hydrogels which facilitates rapid pollutant transport to adsorption sites massaro et al 2017 the grafting method 9 of observations consists of covalently bonding a polymer to the mineral surface or rarely by grafting an initiator to the surface followed by in situ polymerization liu 2007 the grafting approach achieves a chemically stable nanocomposite due to the covalent bonding of mineral and polymer building blocks an additional 6 of observations used other fabrication methods such as electrospinning melt mixing calcination and gamma radiation figure s7 which may offer new pathways to cpn development but were excluded from anova models due to low sample size n 5 qmax values were significantly different across cpn fabrication methods p 0 0001 where the mean effect of in situ polymerization was significantly higher than adsorption cross linking and grafting fig 5 a table 1 in both the linear and linear mixed effects models the mean effect of in situ polymerization was 4 8 times that of adsorption p 0 0001 and associated with observations of positively charge pollutants fig 5a and table s4 to account for the fact that mostly positively charged pollutants were tested by in situ polymerized cpns we also tested the interaction between cpn fabrication method and pollutant charge on qmax qmax was significantly affected by the interaction between fabrication method and pollutant classes p 0 01 this could suggest that polymers employed for this type of cpn such as polyacrylic acid and polyacrylamide were especially suited for the adsorption of positively charged pollutants we suggest that future studies investigate designing in situ polymerized cpns for removal of anionic pollutants as well including study id as a random effect reduced differences in estimated means p 0 002 such that only in situ polymerization and adsorption methods differed from each other table s4 the higher qmax associated with in situ polymerization is likely due to the high polymer loading achievable relative to other fabrication methods gardi and mishael 2018 normalizing pollutant adsorption to polymer loading on the mineral mass pollutant per mass polymer would enable a direct comparison of cpn efficiency in contrast kl is expected to be more influenced by polymer pollutant interactions than polymer loading levy et al 2019 kl values were also significantly influenced by cpn fabrication method p 0 05 here the mean effect of adsorption was 3 times greater than in situ polymerization p 0 05 and associated with negatively charged pollutants fig 5b tables 1 and s4 difference in means did not remain significant when study id was included as a random effect while higher qmax values indicates a cpn can adsorb more pollutant molecules higher kl values are related to the nature of the interaction we previously found that cpns with higher kl performed better in fixed bed columns than cpns or activated carbons with lower kl but higher qmax kohay et al 2015 shabtai and mishael 2018 a sorbent with high kl is also likely to remove pollutants at low concentrations more efficiently than a sorbent with a similar qmax but a lower kl as a result one must consider qmax and kl in tandem when testing a sorbent for water treatment wang and giammar 2019 for example cnps fabricated via in situ polymerization may be appropriate in applications that require the removal of pollutants present at high concentrations wang et al 2011 in contrast cpns fabricated via the adsorption method may be better suited for the rapid and complete removal of pollutants at trace concentrations guillossou et al 2019 3 2 4 pollutant class and charge surveyed studies tested the adsorption of 58 different organic and inorganic pollutants figure s8 which were binned into four classes dyes micropollutants heavy metals and oxyanions dyes n 53 are high molecular weight organic compounds that have pi electron systems that can be excited by visible light and often exhibit ph dependent charge micropollutants n 23 are organic compounds such as agrochemicals pharmaceuticals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons which have a lower molecular weight are mostly non charged or negatively charged in this study and often have pi electron systems inorganic pollutants include heavy metals ali and khan 2018 n 65 and oxyanions n 17 the most frequently studied pollutants were the heavy metals cu2 n 16 pb2 n 15 and cd2 n 12 the oxyanion cr vi n 10 the dye methylene blue n 19 and the micropollutant bisphenol a n 4 these heavy metals oxyanions and micropollutants are all epa regulated water pollutants or included in contaminant candidate lists ccls and their removal from water warrants the development of novel sorbents however methylene blue is neither regulated nor included in ccls but receives disproportionate focus in the field of novel water remediation technologies bielska and szymanowski 2006 houas et al 2001 rafatullah et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 perhaps due to the ease with which it can be quantified and to the vast existing literature that allows easy comparison of results we strongly suggest future research limits its focus on methylene blue and instead focus on persistent emerging micropollutants bai et al 2018 tran et al 2018 qmax values were significantly influenced by pollutant class and charge p 0 001 fig 6 a and c table 1 micropollutants had significantly lower qmax values than dyes p 0 03 and heavy metals p 0 0001 accordingly qmax values were higher for positively than neutral p 0 003 or negatively p 0 02 charged pollutants with estimated mean effect sizes of 4 2 and 2 4 respectively table s4 kl values were also significantly influenced by pollutant class p 0 001 and charge p 0 01 fig 6b and d table 1 the mean effect of dyes was 6 5 times higher than heavy metals p 0 001 table s4 kl values were significantly higher for negatively than positively charged pollutants p 0 01 fig 6c table 1 though post hoc tests did not reveal significant pairwise comparisons suggesting negatively charged dyes and oxyanions drive high kl values these results correspond well to the pca plot which showed that kl was associated with negatively charged dyes fig 3 and to the regression between kl and pollutant mw fig s5 which was highest for dyes when including study id as a random effect mean effects were diminished due to reduced degrees of freedom and large within versus across study variance however trends were similar table 1 this variance highlights the need for testing cpn performance across labs using standardized protocols see section 3 6 improving confidence in results within the field is essential for honing the design and technological adoption of novel materials 3 2 5 pollutant functional group interactions according to our survey cpns adsorb pollutants through several types of functional groups and participate in numerous chemical interactions for example charged carboxylate and cationic amines can form electrostatic and ion exchange interactions this is useful for targeting heavy metals oxyanions and polar moieties in organic pollutants el dessouky et al 2018 gardi and mishael 2018 lozano morales et al 2018 polymer aromatic rings and aliphatic chains can interact with organic pollutants through hydrophobic and pi pi interactions cao et al 2009 kohay et al 2015 amine and amide polymer functional groups can complex heavy metals cho et al 2012 kumararaja et al 2018 and polymer hydroxyls can form h bonds with various pollutant molecules potential mechanisms involved in pollutant adsorption by cpns has been recently summarized mukhopadhyay et al 2020 here we used stepwise multiple linear regression mlr to evaluate whether specific pollutant functional group interactions can explain the variance in qmax and kl across pollutant class and charge we focus on heavy metals and cationic dyes because they have enough observations for robust analysis we did not include a formal analysis of oxyanions and micropollutants due to low samples size n 17 and n 23 respectively 3 2 5 1 heavy metals qmax values for heavy metals were best explained with a model specification including six explanatory variables adjusted r2 0 77 p 0 0001 table 2 and s5 qmax values were strongly negatively correlated with adsorption fabrication method but positively correlated with in situ polymerization cation exchange and amide functional groups pollutant molecular weight and cpns based on smectite significantly improved aic scores but the coefficients were not statistically significant and small in magnitude kl values were positively correlated with in situ polymerization but negatively related to the molecular weight of heavy metals as well as cation exchange and amide functional groups adjusted r2 0 21 p 0 01 table 2 and s5 the effect of fabrication mode and polymer functional groups on qmax is in line with pca and anova results figs 3 5 and table 1 which suggest that in situ polymerization may be the most advantageous fabrication approach for heavy metal removal considering the higher polymer content often achieved by this fabrication method we suggest qmax values should be normalized to polymer content mass pollutant per mass polymer to identify whether in situ polymerization increases the number or accessibility of adsorption sites shabtai and mishael 2018 compared with cpns fabricated by polymer adsorption pca plots revealed that heavy metal studies clustered around amine functional groups or carboxyl and cation exchange groups suggesting heavy metals are targeted through complexation and electrostatic ion exchange mechanisms anirudhan et al 2012 respectively mlr results also suggest cation exchange and amide functional groups which also form complexes with heavy metals boyd et al 1979 were associated with high heavy metal qmax but amide functional groups were also linked to low kl values this implies that cpns with ion exchange electrostatic and complexing capabilities such as amide and carboxyl containing polymers have excellent potential for heavy metal removal but require more in depth investigation ilgin et al 2015 3 2 5 2 cationic dyes variation in the adsorption capacity of cpns for cationic dyes was best explained by including four variables adjusted r2 0 3 p 0 001 table 2 and s5 in this model qmax was positively correlated with polymer hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups and negatively correlated with in situ polymerization fabrication pollutant mw was also included in the best fit model but the coefficient was small we could not identify a best fit model to explain variation in kl values of cationic dyes based on the tested cpn and pollutant properties adjusted r2 0 08 p 0 07 table 2 and s5 the mlr and pca results fig 3 table s2 and table 2 and s5 both indicate a positive association exists between cationic dyes and carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups indicating electrostatic ion exchange h bonding and other non specific interactions in contrast to heavy metals in situ polymerization was strongly negatively correlated with qmax suggesting this fabrication method reduces the accessibility of adsorption sites for dye pollutants this could be the result of the large molecular size of dyes shabtai and mishael 2016 e g 17 å methylene blue greathouse et al 2015 vs 4 19 å for cu2 asthagiri et al 2004 and the thick polymeric phase produced by in situ polymerization shaheen et al 2016 to investigate adsorption site accessibility a molar calculation of adsorbed dyes per adsorption sites assuming the composition and stoichiometry of the adsorption sites are known is required shabtai and mishael 2018 however this is seldom reported in the literature 3 2 5 3 oxyanions oxyanions were strongly associated with cationic amine groups which is indicative of an electrostatic adsorption mechanism fig 3 and table s2 the above average kl values indicate that cpns are an excellent sorbent for oxyanion removal gardi and mishael 2018 however lower than average qmax values and low number of observations highlight the need for future research in this direction fig 6a and b perhaps focusing on cpns fabricated via in situ polymerization 3 2 5 4 micropollutants based on pca results neutral micropollutants were targeted via pi pi interactions with aromatic functional groups cao et al 2009 keiluweit and kleber 2009 while negatively charged micropollutants could also be targeted via cationic amine functional groups ateia et al 2019 kohay et al 2015 the low qmax of micropollutants fig 6a could suggest cpns have been better tailored for targeting charged pollutants which were primarily tested in this meta analysis and are less effective for uncharged micropollutants however this could also be an underestimation due to having only one observation of micropollutant removal by a cpn fabricated using in situ polymerization guo et al 2011 which has been shown to correlate with high qmax the total number of studies on micropollutants is small n 23 necessitating further research to optimize cpns for their removal a potentially useful approach may be functionalizing clays with aromatic polymers kong et al 2019 and carbonaceous materials darder et al 2018 diagboya et al 2020 premarathna et al 2019 that are capable of interacting with micropollutants containing aromatic functional groups finally the reviewed studies individually highlight the key role of chemical interactions between polymer functional groups and pollutants indeed the results of this meta analysis based on those studies and applying multiple statistical approaches validate this conclusion across a broad and diverse selection of cpns and pollutant classes and confirm its generality however most of the reviewed studies investigated a simplified system in equilibrium containing deionized water and a single pollutant fig 7 the role of such chemical interactions may be less pronounced upon pollutant removal from real water i e higher ionic strength competing pollutants dissolved organics etc via adsorption columns non equilibrium 3 3 cpn testing and benchmarking to translate optimistic results from lab scale experiments to technological applications cpns must be tested under realistic conditions encountered in water treatment industries and benchmarked against existing commercial sorbents the adsorption performance of novel cpns should also be compared to other reported cpns such as the data compiled here this can serve as a first step in evaluating their technological potential fig 7 summarizes the type and prevalence of experiments used to characterize test and benchmark designed cpn sorbents we found that 85 of the observations investigated how solution chemistry ph and ionic strength affects adsorption n 134 these experiments are useful for understanding adsorption mechanisms and evaluating adsorption under different operating conditions more than half of the observations included adsorption kinetic experiments n 98 to obtain a kinetic coefficient and tested adsorption at different temperatures to determine the enthalpy of the reaction n 92 approximately one third of the observations n 54 extracted thermodynamic parameters while these experiments yield rich mechanistic and operational information they do not address four key issues of cpn applicability in water treatment facilities 1 adsorption of pollutants at relevant concentrations from real water matrices 2 regeneration potential of spent cpn 3 cpn granulation and performance in columns or slurry if relevant and 4 side by side comparisons of pollutant removal efficiency and cost relative to commercially available sorbents at realistic operational conditions e g flow rate contact time based on our survey of review articles we conclude that this knowledge gap is common across other fields of sorbent design bhatnagar and anastopoulos 2017 gerente et al 2007 gupta et al 2013 wang and giammar 2019 and as such our following recommendations may be pertinent to a broad research area beyond that of cpns 4 future perspectives 4 1 technological application in addition to thorough investigation of cpn properties and interactions with the targeted pollutants cpn applicability most also be evaluated in realistic conditions 1 pollutant adsorption from real water is often lower relative to deionized water due to the presence of background solutes that can compete for adsorption sites zietzschmann et al 2014 block adsorptive pores quinlivan et al 2005 and form complexes with pollutants in solution ruiz et al 2013 adsorption from real water was only tested in 41 of the observations n 64 and its effect i e percent reduction in pollutant removal was seldom quantified we strongly encourage future studies test how effective sorbents are at removing pollutants from real water e g municipal or industrial wastewater at environmentally relevant concentrations and study pollutants that reflect current water treatment needs ray et al 2019 with that said real water can vary from place to place and while it is useful for evaluating cpn performance for a specific situation the use of standardized challenge water andrew 2002 and even standardized experimentation protocols ali and gupta 2007 can streamline comparison of novel sorbents 2 handling spent sorbents is an inherent challenge in adsorption technology spent sorbents can be disposed of as solid waste or regenerated and reused for example spent activated carbon is removed from its column and thermally regenerated which is a major expense demonstrating the feasibility of cpn regeneration increases their economic competitiveness and reduces their environmental impact in situ regeneration in the column further establishes the potential of cpns shabtai and mishael 2018 2017 sorbent regeneration was studied in 58 of the observations n 98 chemical regeneration desorption induced by acid base organic solvent or electrolyte solution was by far the most common approach investigated in the studies included here often reaching almost complete desorption thermal biological and catalytic regeneration of clay based sorbents have also been probed unuabonah and taubert 2014 zhu et al 2009 regeneration experiments should determine the efficiency of chemical regeneration i e what percentage is desorbed whether adsorption is compromised by repeated adsorption regeneration cycles the kinetics of desorption and the volume of regenerating solution needed chemical regeneration also throws light on the adsorption mechanisms at play is it ph dependent electrostatic hydrophobic and is therefore a valuable tool moving forward efficient degradation of the regenerant pollutant solution should be investigated as it is a key component of the adsorption regeneration approach 3 commercial sorbents are most often applied in fixed bed adsorption columns because separation regeneration and reuse of the spent sorbent are technically easier in column than in batch mode accordingly cpns should also be tested in columns especially since sorbent capacity is often lower in column than batch mode ray et al 2019 shabtai and mishael 2018 however only 13 of the observations n 19 tested cpn performance in columns of which only two tested the cpn as a bead or granule a major hurdle to applying cpns and many other novel sorbents in fixed bed columns is their small particle size nm to µm size range and swelling properties which limit water flow rate through the column cpn granulation can potentially overcome this challenge although the effect of granulation technique and adsorption kinetics must be carefully investigated du et al 2017 ouellet plamondon et al 2012 for example we recently reported a granulated cpn which was employed in adsorption columns for removal of dissolved organic matter from surface water the mechanically stable granules enabled a high flow rate and the columns were in situ regenerated and re used zusman et al 2020 4 finally since cpns are proposed as alternative sorbents they must be experimentally compared to conventionally used sorbents e g ion exchangers activated carbons or granular ferric oxides despite that we found that only 13 of the observations n 20 performed side by side comparisons which should ideally investigate the effect of background organic matter on column performance kohay et al 2015 ling et al 2017 while activated carbons often have very high qmax values our work has shown that cpns are advantageous in real water scenarios because unlike activated carbon their performance is less compromised in the presence of background organic matter kohay et al 2015 zadaka et al 2009 cpns can be designed to specifically remove background organic matter shabtai and mishael 2016 even simultaneously with micropollutants shabtai and mishael 2018 2016 employing cpns in tandem with commercial sorbents could enhance the removal of pollutant mixtures since sorbents can have different affinities for different pollutants this has been shown to optimize adsorption efficiency du et al 2017 zusman et al 2020 and maintain column hydraulic conductivity while utilizing existing infrastructure for operating columns with commercial sorbents while beyond the scope of this analysis we acknowledge that the environmental and economic performance of new materials and technologies n 4 observations dictates their acceptance in the market and requires rigorous assessment alhashimi and aktas 2017 kumar et al 2019 4 2 scientific investigation although most of the research on cpn adsorbents focuses on the chemical parameters ph temperature etc that influence pollutant adsorption fig 7 we suggest that future research must also consider the overlooked aspect of polymer conformation on the clay mineral surface and its influence on cpn adsorption performance polymer adsorption on a clay mineral often transitions from a flat conformation as monomer trains to an extended conformation as monomer loops and tails when 1 polymer loading increases kohay et al 2015 2 polymer charge density decreases levy et al 2019 and 3 ionic strength increases shabtai and mishael 2016 this transition from a trains to a loops and tails conformation does not only occur on the clay s external surfaces but usually induces intercalation between the clay platelets and may even induce platelet exfoliation poly 4 vinylpyridine pvp is one of the few polymers that have been investigated for the effects of its conformation on the performance of pvp based cpns the nitrogen atom in the pyridine monomers can be protonated pka 3 55 hpvp gardi et al 2015 yielding ph dependent polycations and functionalized with a methyl group qpvp kohay et al 2015 or an ethanol group ohpvp levy et al 2019 resulting in constant charge polycations with tunable charge densities accordingly we studied the interactions of pvp based cpns with micropollutants that can be targeted through pi pi interactions hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions gardi et al 2015 kohay et al 2015 levy et al 2019 radian and mishael 2012 we used x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis to characterize polymer conformation and show that it plays a pivotal role in cpn performance along with polymer chemistry we found that a loops and tails conformation created a nanostructure that increased the qmax and kl of qpvp cpn and ohpvp cpn for anionic micropollutants such as gemfibrozil diclofenac and ibuprofen levy et al 2019 shabtai and mishael 2016 in contrast lozano morales et al found that a cpn bearing a highly charged polycation in a trains conformation adsorbed the anionic micropollutants sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac better than a cpn bearing a low charge polycation in a loops and tails conformation lozano morales et al 2018 loops and tails extending into solution may offer more diverse monomer pollutant orientations kohay et al 2019 while uncharged monomers in loops and tails segments may promote hydrophobic interactions with apolar pollutants lozano morales et al 2018 furthermore adsorption sites in loops and tails were found to be inaccessible by larger dissolved organic matter compounds shabtai and mishael 2016 these few studies show the important but understudied role of polymer conformation on pollutant removal 5 conclusions design of novel and exciting cpns even if their initial performance requires tuning is at the heart of scientific research in this field such pioneering studies can focus on selective pollutant adsorption and facile regeneration perhaps using computer aided design polymer loading chemistry and conformation on the clay surface should be thoroughly characterized in future studies and the effects of these physicochemical properties on adsorption performance should be tested to optimize cpns future research can also probe understudied minerals polymers and fabrication techniques to design cpn with new properties more applicable studies should rigorously evaluate and benchmark these novel cpns for the removal of emerging pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations and in realistic operational conditions community wide adoption of standardized adsorption protocols challenge waters and reporting conventions will enable effective comparison of sorbent performance finally our database can be used as a searchable repository of adsorption data aimed at supporting transdisciplinary comparisons and benchmarking that drives data based discoveries for the material research and environmental remediation communities

17396,the polarity and molecular weight of dissolved organic matter dom is an important factor determining the treatability of water for domestic supply dom in surface water and groundwater is comprised of a mixture of carbon with varying molecular weight ranges with its composition driven by dom sources and processing here we present the largest dataset of chromatographic dom in surface and groundwater samples n 246 using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lcocd our data represents four categories surface water hyporheic zone water local groundwater and regional groundwater from five different sites across australia in all environments high molecular weight hydrophilic dom such as biopolymers bp and humic substances hs are present in surface waters and are processed out of groundwater as it moves from surface water and hyporheic zones into shallow local groundwater and deeper regional groundwaters this results in a higher percentage of low molecular weight neutrals lmwn and hydrophobic organic carbon hoc in deeper regional groundwaters our findings indicate that the presence of sedimentary organic matter strongly influence the character of surface and groundwater dom resulting in groundwater with higher hs aromaticity and molecular weight and reduced percentage of lmwns we also observe highly variable hydrophilic hoc ratios in groundwater at all sites with 9 60 and 25 64 of samples at sites containing sedimentary peat layers and non sedimentary peat sites respectively containing only hydrophilic dissolved organic carbon doc we identify average hydrophilic hoc ratios of 4 35 3 76 and 7 53 5 32 at sites containing sedimentary peat layers and non sedimentary peat sites respectively where both hydrophilic doc and hoc are present overall our results suggest that fractured rock and alluvial aquifers in sedimentary organic carbon poor environments may contain doc which is better suited to ozonation biologically activated carbon filtration powdered activated carbon suspended ion exchange treatment or magnetic ion exchange resin since doc is more hydrophilic and of lower molecular weight and lower aromaticity aquifers located near sedimentary organic matter layers may benefit from pre treatment by coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration which have high removal efficiency for high molecular weight and polar compounds 1 introduction groundwater is the world s largest active source of fresh water and is heavily relied on for agricultural irrigation industrial uses and drinking water supply currently 98 5 of the total domestic self supplied fresh water in the united states is obtained from groundwater with some states including hawaii florida idaho and mississippi relying on groundwater for 87 95 of their total public water supply dieter et al 2018 understanding dissolved organic matter dom concentration and character in groundwater is important as this ultimately determines its treatability for domestic water supply regan et al 2017 dom is comprised of a complex mixture of high and low molecular weight fractions the relative proportions of these fractions in natural waters is determined by both its source and the type and extent of processing it has undergone amon and benner 1996 presently there are minimal studies regarding the character of dom in natural groundwater systems in various environmental settings these are vital to understand if we are to optimise the use of groundwater for domestic water supply processes including sorption photodegradation and microbial processing amon and benner 1996 chapelle et al 2013 shen et al 2015 singh et al 2016 fractionate dom of different molecular weights and polarity altering the composition of dom remaining in

with biopolymer and hs fractions preferentially removed adding pac to the coagulation flocculation sedimentation process greatly improved the removal of all dom fractions identified by lcocd we hypothesise that sample depth will play a role in determining the character of doc due to processing mechanisms in the subsurface with high molecular weight dom likely processed as it moves through groundwater systems and into deeper regional groundwaters we also hypothesise that the presence of sedimentary peat layers in the subsurface in some locations may also impact groundwater dom character

predominately between 2016 and 2019 with earlier trips for both anna bay and rottnest island details of the sampling trips are given in table 1 during each trip sampling was performed to collect for doc and lcocd analysis this dataset represents 246 samples in total representing 131 unique locations with 8 surface water bodies 45 hyporheic 71 local groundwater and 7 regional groundwater locations

analysed using a doc labour lcocd size exclusion chromatography system and a total organic carbon toc analyser aurora 1030 wet oxidation toc analyser oi analytical college station texas united states respectively at university of new south wales sydney unsw lcocd utilizes a size exclusion chromatography technique to determine dom concentration and assign dom into major fractions based on molecular weight huber et al 2011 lcocd is based on the principle that different sizes of organic matter molecules have different retention times on lcocd column material larger molecules have shorter elution times as they are unable to diffuse into column material whilst smaller molecules diffuse leading to longer retention times the result of a lcocd analysis is a chromatogram of peaks based on retention time and signal intensity which the user must then manually process in order to quantify and distinguish between different dom molecular size fractions the international humic substance society ihss suwannee river humic and fulvic acid standards are regularly used every 3 4 months to provide the basis of the retention times that are used as part of this process according to huber et al 2011 the fractions are referenced as biopolymers bp molecular weight 20 000 da humic substances hs 500 da molecular weight 10 000 da building blocks bb 300 da molecular weight 500 da low molecular weight acids lmwa molecular weight 350 da low molecular weight neutrals lmwn 350 da and hydrophobic organic carbon hoc which is classified as the material which does not leave the column the sum of the bp hs bb lmwn and lmwa fractions represent the hydrophilic organic carbon cdoc these fractions are labelled throughout this manuscript to remain consistent with the fractions defined by huber et al 2011 we do however note that each fraction is defined only by the molecular weight and hydrophobicity of the molecules therefore no information on the molecular composition or origin of the molecule should be inferred by these groupings for example molecules defined as hs may therefore not necessarily represent a humic origin and thus caution should be taken with the interpretation of these data due to high doc concentrations some samples were diluted with ultra pure water prior to analysis with a maximum dilution factor of 6 2 3 statistical analysis one way anova and tukey s post hoc test in rstudio was used to test if there were significant differences for the different lcocd fractions between the sites in addition to differences due to sample class surface water hyporheic zone and local and regional groundwater to test which fractions displayed differences between the sites the local groundwater samples from each site were used for the anova analysis as this was the only sample class present across all sites for the depth comparison anova was performed separately for each individual site for the fractions that were shown to have significant differences between the sites while for the other fractions anova was performed on the whole dataset redundancy analysis rda was used as a constrained ordination approach to compare the presence of sedimentary organic matter and sample depth categories with lcocd fractions rda was conducted using the vegan package in rstudio v 1 1 456 with lcocd fractions scaled to their unit variances 3 results the total doc for the majority of the samples were analysed by two techniques the aurora toc analyser and lcocd the linear equation for the comparison between the toc analyser and lcocd for total doc for samples analysed by both techniques has a slope of 0 99 an intercept of 0 22 and an r2 of 0 95 figure s1 3 1 site comparison of doc and lc ocd fractions the average concentration of doc in groundwater and surface water for all samples was 4 29 mg l 4 83 1 σ and 10 78 mg l 15 89 1 σ respectively the average concentration in the hyporheic zone depths of 0 m 3 m bgs local groundwater depths of 3 m bgs and regional groundwater was 5 66 mg l 5 24 3 02 mg l 3 90 and 0 51 mg l 0 12 respectively the average concentration for each sample type at each site is given in table 2 the thirlmere lakes surface water and hyporheic samples contained significantly higher concentration of total doc and individual fractions the doc concentration was lower for the groundwater samples compared to the surface and hyporheic samples for three out of the five sites with the exceptions of anna bay due to peat being present from 5 m below ground level and rottnest island lmwa were only detected in rottnest island and thirlmere lakes samples all sites include local groundwater samples a comparison of the average composition based on the percentage of each fraction of the local groundwater samples at each site is shown in fig 2 and the anova results in table 3 for all sites except thirlmere lakes the hs fraction was dominant with bp the least abundant the relative abundance of hoc hs and lmw n fractions were significantly different between the sites whilst bp and bb were similar 3 2 changes in groundwater doc with depth and the presence of peat layers the anova results table 3 and fig 2 indicate that the presence of sedimentary peat layers plays a part in the local groundwater differences between the sites in terms of the fractions the sites that contained sedimentary peat layers i e anna bay and thirlmere lakes were higher in hoc significant at thirlmere lakes compared to the alluvium and karst sites i e maules creek wellington and rottnest island of the alluvium and karst sites maules creek has the highest amount of hoc which we hypothesise is due to the presence of aged organics at depth at this site mcdonough et al 2020b while for hs thirlmere lakes was significantly lower than the other sites and with lmwn anna bay was significantly lower than the other sites overall the two sites with sedimentary peat layers contained a higher average concentration of all lcocd fractions for the equivalent depth than the other sites table 2 all sites over the course of sampling appeared to have surface water systems infiltrating the aquifers i e losing conditions see supplementary material for details which allows us to infer changes in doc composition along a flow path by looking at the changes in proportion the relative abundance of each fraction expressed as percentage of total doc of the different fractions from surface water to hyporheic to local groundwater to regional groundwater fig 3 the anova results for this depth comparison are given in table 4 moving along this inferred flow path hoc showed an increase significant at all sites except for rottnest island and the hs showed a decrease significant at the maules and thirlmere sites the lmwn fraction also had significant differences between the different depths for all sites with general increase with depth for all sites the percent of bp are significantly higher in the surface water samples than the subsurface samples fig 3 shows that the bp fraction is almost entirely removed at all sites from surface to hyporheic zone water in general there is a decline the concentration of the various fractions from surface water through to hyporheic zone to local and regional groundwater surface water hs molecular weight and aromaticity show very similar average values for both sedimentary peat and non sedimentary peat sites fig 3 however the presence of peat layers in the subsurface appears to result in an increase in hs molecular weight and aromaticity in the local groundwater samples rda analysis of the dataset also show that doc concentration and composition differs for peat and non peat sites fig 4 a the first axis in fig 4a rda1 describes the presence or absence of sedimentary peat layers non sedimentary peat sites have negative values on rda1 whilst sites with sedimentary peat layers have the positive value on rda1 positive values on rda1 represent high hs high hs aromaticity high doc concentrations and high hs molecular weight whilst negative values on rda1 represent high lmwn and bb though the abundance of bb fractions are very low and hence would have little influence the second axis rda2 on fig 4a indicates that doc hydrophobicity is related to water depth categories with higher cdoc in surface waters and higher hoc in local and regional gw a comparison of sample depth categories at the non sedimentary peat and peat sites are shown separately in fig 4b and fig 4c respectively at the non sedimentary peat sites there is a transition in doc characteristics on rda1 from surface and hyporheic zone water which contain higher bp cdoc hs hs aromaticity and molecular weight and doc concentrations to local and regional gw which contain higher lmwn bb and hoc at sites that contain peat layers the change in doc character with sample depth is less clear with regional gw and surface waters containing higher lmwn and bp than local groundwater which appears to contain higher hs hs molecular weight and aromaticity we propose the reason for this difference is less processed organic matter inputs likely from the peat layers are impacting local gw doc at these sites overall this suggests that overall groundwater doc composition is less controlled by processing with depth at the peat sites a conclusion which is supported by a higher variation explained by the first and second constrained components for non peat sites 19 6 and 6 5 respectively compared to the peat sites 11 7 and 6 2 respectively as shown in figure s2 in the supplementary material 4 discussion we have presented what is to our knowledge the largest dataset of groundwater doc character using lcocd our samples come from multiple sites and over several years of sampling seasonal variation such as changes in evaporation rainfall and soil moisture could lead to changes in groundwater doc concentration and composition particularly in surface waters and hyporheic samples which are more influenced by this shorter term variability groundwater samples will tend to display less seasonal variability in doc concentration and character compared to surface waters and hyporheic samples due to the relative stability over time of the environmental conditions that drive changes in doc groundwater doc experiences constant darkness little change in temperature more evolved and stable water chemistry further discussion of seasonal variability in samples from the same sites is available in the supplementary material of mcdonough et al 2020b in this study at anna bay we observe a significantly lower median value for doc hoc hydrophilic hs bb and lmwn concentrations in the hyporheic samples in the autumn samples compared to the summer samples using one tailed wilcoxon rank sum tests all p 0 005 however due to the sampling locations not being consistent between the different trips for example the summer dataset at anna bay contained more local groundwater samples while the autumn dataset contained more hyporheic samples it is difficult to observe any seasonal trends in the data we note however that the data represents a range of seasons and sampling dates at each site and thus this seasonal variability would be captured in the analyses presented for the full dataset and the sedimentary peat layers and non sedimentary peat subgroups overall the differences between the sites and with depth are larger than these seasonal differences in all environments with the exception of rottnest island there is a decline in the higher molecular weight fractions as water flows through the subsurface i e hyporheic to local and regional groundwater such as bp and hs which is suggestive of organic matter processing hs have been shown to preferentially sorb compared to the other lcocd fractions on various aquifer materials oudone et al 2019 the decrease in hs in both concentration and relative abundance therefore indicate sorption of organic matter as water flows through the subsurface at all sites this is also supported by the work by chapelle et al 2016 who proposed sorption as one of the mechanisms for the removal of dissolved organic matter along flowpaths in aquifers bp are predominately present in the surface water samples and not in the groundwater samples we hypothesise this is due to the organic matter that is produced through microbial activity by a range of algae and bacteria present in surface water khan et al 2019 li et al 2015 villacorte et al 2015 zheng et al 2009 at rottnest island some of the samples are influenced by saltwater intrusion see supplementary material for details at this site we see an increase in doc and hs concentrations along the flowpath of fresh local gw to old seawater samples table 2 in comparison to the regional groundwater samples at the other sites the old seawater samples at rottnest island have lower relative abundances of hoc and lmwn with a higher relative abundance of hs fig 2 the composition of the local groundwater samples that have interacted with sedimentary peat layers thirlmere lakes and anna bay are similar with high relative abundance and concentration of hoc compared to the other sites however there are differences in the abundance of the hs and lmwn fractions the hyporheic samples at both sites have similar relative abundances which suggests that these differences are not due to any surface processes such as photodegradation instead we hypothesise that there is an additional source in the groundwater at thirlmere lakes which has not interacted with the peat layers and has undergone more dom processing resulting in lower hs and higher lwmn abundances mcdonough et al 2020b hydrophilic hoc ratios are important in determining the treatability of water with lower values suggesting easier treatability due to higher concentrations of non polar hoc median hydrophilic hoc ratios for united kingdom and united states surface waters has been estimated at approximately 1 22 ghernaout 2014 our lcocd results show highly variable hydrophilic hoc ratios in groundwater at all sites with 9 6 and 25 6 of samples at sedimentary peat layers and non sedimentary peat sites respectively containing only hydrophilic doc we identify average hydrophilic hoc ratios of 4 35 3 76 and 7 53 5 32 at peat and non sedimentary peat sites respectively where both hydrophilic doc and hoc are present p 0 0021 the results show that the presence of sedimentary organic matter is the main control on groundwater doc composition as demonstrated by rda1 on fig 4a with a secondary control by sample depth at the non sedimentary peat sites dom at sites containing sedimentary peat layers has a higher abundance of hoc hs of higher molecular weight and overall doc concentrations being between 2 and 15 times higher than fractured rock and alluvial environments for the equivalent depth pre treatment by coagulation flocculation sedimentation or sand filtration which have high removal efficiency for hoc ghernaout 2014 krzeminski et al 2019 sharp et al 2006 may be more suitable treatment methods for these dom characteristics the presence of aged organics at depth can also lead to a higher abundance of hoc such as at maules creek however the overall hoc concentration is significantly lower than at sites containing sedimentary peat layers and hence is unlikely to require pre treatment in fractured rock and alluvial groundwater environments doc is lower in concentration and has a higher proportion of lmwn and hs of lower molecular weight than hs in environments containing peat layers doc in these groundwaters may therefore be more efficiently removed by ozonation biologically activated carbon bac filtration pac six or magnetic ion exchange resin which can remove lower molecular weight and hydrophilic fractions andersson et al 2020 krzeminski et al 2019 mergen et al 2009 shutova et al 2020 5 conclusions this study represents the largest dataset of chromatographic dom in surface and groundwater samples n 239 using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lcocd our data represents four depth categories surface water hyporheic zone water local groundwater and regional groundwater from five different sites in australia our findings suggest that dom composition can be highly variable and highlight the complexity and variability of dom inputs and processing mechanisms of various size fractions in different environments while we observe higher percentages of difficult to treat hydrophilic organic carbon in groundwater from non sedimentary peat environments the doc concentrations tend to be lower our findings indicate that the presence of sedimentary organic matter strongly influence the character of groundwater dom resulting in different requirements for removal of doc from these environments depth also affects groundwater doc concentration and composition with sedimentary organic carbon inputs in peatland environments resulting in inputs of higher molecular weight higher aromaticity dom in shallow groundwater in all environments doc concentration and high molecular weight fractions such as bps decline with groundwater depth due

17396,the polarity and molecular weight of dissolved organic matter dom is an important factor determining the treatability of water for domestic supply dom in surface water and groundwater is comprised of a mixture of carbon with varying molecular weight ranges with its composition driven by dom sources and processing here we present the largest dataset of chromatographic dom in surface and groundwater samples n 246 using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lcocd our data represents four categories surface water hyporheic zone water local groundwater and regional groundwater from five different sites across australia in all environments high molecular weight hydrophilic dom such as biopolymers bp and humic substances hs are present in surface waters and are processed out of groundwater as it moves from surface water and hyporheic zones into shallow local groundwater and deeper regional groundwaters this results in a higher percentage of low molecular weight neutrals lmwn and hydrophobic organic carbon hoc in deeper regional groundwaters our findings indicate that the presence of sedimentary organic matter strongly influence the character of surface and groundwater dom resulting in groundwater with higher hs aromaticity and molecular weight and reduced percentage of lmwns we also observe highly variable hydrophilic hoc ratios in groundwater at all sites with 9 60 and 25 64 of samples at sites containing sedimentary peat layers and non sedimentary peat sites respectively containing only hydrophilic dissolved organic carbon doc we identify average hydrophilic hoc ratios of 4 35 3 76 and 7 53 5 32 at sites containing sedimentary peat layers and non sedimentary peat sites respectively where both hydrophilic doc and hoc are present overall our results suggest that fractured rock and alluvial aquifers in sedimentary organic carbon poor environments may contain doc which is better suited to ozonation biologically activated carbon filtration powdered activated carbon suspended ion exchange treatment or magnetic ion exchange resin since doc is more hydrophilic and of lower molecular weight and lower aromaticity aquifers located near sedimentary organic matter layers may benefit from pre treatment by coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration which have high removal efficiency for high molecular weight and polar compounds 1 introduction groundwater is the world s largest active source of fresh water and is heavily relied on for agricultural irrigation industrial uses and drinking water supply currently 98 5 of the total domestic self supplied fresh water in the united states is obtained from groundwater with some states including hawaii florida idaho and mississippi relying on groundwater for 87 95 of their total public water supply dieter et al 2018 understanding dissolved organic matter dom concentration and character in groundwater is important as this ultimately determines its treatability for domestic water supply regan et al 2017 dom is comprised of a complex mixture of high and low molecular weight fractions the relative proportions of these fractions in natural waters is determined by both its source and the type and extent of processing it has undergone amon and benner 1996 presently there are minimal studies regarding the character of dom in natural groundwater systems in various environmental settings these are vital to understand if we are to optimise the use of groundwater for domestic water supply processes including sorption photodegradation and microbial processing amon and benner 1996 chapelle et al 2013 shen et al 2015 singh et al 2016 fractionate dom of different molecular weights and polarity altering the composition of dom remaining in

times as they are unable to diffuse into column material whilst smaller molecules diffuse leading to longer retention times the result of a lcocd analysis is a chromatogram of peaks based on retention time and signal intensity which the user must then manually process in order to quantify and distinguish between different dom molecular size fractions the international humic substance society ihss suwannee river humic and fulvic acid standards are regularly used every 3 4 months to provide the basis of the retention times that are used as part of this process according to huber et al 2011 the fractions are referenced as biopolymers bp molecular weight 20 000 da humic substances hs 500 da molecular weight 10 000 da building blocks bb 300 da molecular weight 500 da low molecular weight acids lmwa molecular weight 350 da low molecular weight neutrals lmwn 350 da and hydrophobic organic carbon hoc which is classified as the material which does not leave the column the sum of the bp hs bb lmwn and lmwa fractions represent the hydrophilic organic carbon cdoc these fractions are labelled throughout this manuscript to remain consistent with the fractions defined by huber et al 2011 we do however note that each fraction is defined only by the molecular weight and hydrophobicity of the molecules therefore no information on the molecular composition or origin of the molecule should be inferred by these groupings for example molecules defined as hs may therefore not necessarily represent a humic origin and thus caution should be taken with the interpretation of these data due to high doc concentrations some samples were diluted with ultra pure water prior to analysis with a maximum dilution factor of 6 2 3 statistical analysis one way anova and tukey s post hoc test in rstudio was used to test if there were significant differences for the different lcocd fractions between the sites in addition to differences due to sample class surface water hyporheic zone and local and regional groundwater to test which fractions displayed differences between the sites the local groundwater samples from each site were used for the anova analysis as this was the only sample class present across all sites for the depth comparison anova was performed separately for each individual site for the fractions that were shown to have significant differences between the sites while for the other fractions anova was performed on the whole dataset redundancy analysis rda was used as a constrained ordination approach to compare the presence of sedimentary organic matter and sample depth categories with lcocd fractions rda was conducted using the vegan package in rstudio v 1 1 456 with lcocd fractions scaled to their unit variances 3 results the total doc for the majority of the samples were analysed by two techniques the aurora toc analyser and lcocd the linear equation for the comparison between the toc analyser and lcocd for total doc for samples analysed by both techniques has a slope of 0 99 an intercept of 0 22 and an r2 of 0 95 figure s1 3 1 site comparison of doc and lc ocd fractions the average concentration of doc in groundwater and surface water for all samples was 4 29 mg l 4 83 1 σ and 10 78 mg l 15 89 1 σ respectively the average concentration in the hyporheic zone depths of 0 m 3 m bgs local groundwater depths of 3 m bgs and regional groundwater was 5 66 mg l 5 24 3 02 mg l 3 90 and 0 51 mg l 0 12 respectively the average concentration for each sample type at each site is given in table 2 the thirlmere lakes surface water and hyporheic samples contained significantly higher concentration of total doc and individual fractions the doc concentration was lower for the groundwater samples compared to the surface and hyporheic samples for three out of the five sites with the exceptions of anna bay due to peat being present from 5 m below ground level and rottnest island lmwa were only detected in rottnest island and thirlmere lakes samples all sites include local groundwater samples a comparison of the average composition based on the percentage of each fraction of the local groundwater samples at each site is shown in fig 2 and the anova results in table 3 for all sites except thirlmere lakes the hs fraction was dominant with bp the least abundant the relative abundance of hoc hs and lmw n fractions were significantly different between the sites whilst bp and bb were similar 3 2 changes in groundwater doc with depth and the presence of peat layers the anova results table 3 and fig 2 indicate that the presence of sedimentary peat layers plays a part in the local groundwater differences between the sites in terms of the fractions the sites that contained sedimentary peat layers i e anna bay and thirlmere lakes were higher in hoc significant at thirlmere lakes compared to the alluvium and karst sites i e maules creek wellington and rottnest island of the alluvium and karst sites maules creek has the highest amount of hoc which we hypothesise is due to the presence of aged organics at depth at this site mcdonough et al 2020b while for hs thirlmere lakes was significantly lower than the other sites and with lmwn anna bay was significantly lower than the other sites overall the two sites with sedimentary peat layers contained a higher average concentration of all lcocd fractions for the equivalent depth than the other sites table 2 all sites over the course of sampling appeared to have surface water systems infiltrating the aquifers i e losing conditions see supplementary material for details which allows us to infer changes in doc composition along a flow path by looking at the changes in proportion the relative abundance of each fraction expressed as percentage of total doc of the different fractions from surface water to hyporheic to local groundwater to regional groundwater fig 3 the anova results for this depth comparison are given in table 4 moving along this inferred flow path hoc showed an increase significant at all sites except for rottnest island and the hs showed a decrease significant at the maules and thirlmere sites the lmwn fraction also had significant differences between the different depths for all sites with general increase with depth for all sites the percent of bp are significantly higher in the surface water samples than the subsurface samples fig 3 shows that the bp fraction is almost entirely removed at all sites from surface to hyporheic zone water in general there is a decline the concentration of the various fractions from surface water through to hyporheic zone to local and regional groundwater surface water hs molecular weight and aromaticity show very similar average values for both sedimentary peat and non sedimentary peat sites fig 3 however the presence of peat layers in the subsurface appears to result in an increase in hs molecular weight and aromaticity in the local groundwater samples rda analysis of the dataset also show that doc concentration and composition differs for peat and non peat sites fig 4 a the first axis in fig 4a rda1 describes the presence or absence of sedimentary peat layers non sedimentary peat sites have negative values on rda1 whilst sites with sedimentary peat layers have the positive value on rda1 positive values on rda1 represent high hs high hs aromaticity high doc concentrations and high hs molecular weight whilst negative values on rda1 represent high lmwn and bb though the abundance of bb fractions are very low and hence would have little influence the second axis rda2 on fig 4a indicates that doc hydrophobicity is related to water depth categories with higher cdoc in surface waters and higher hoc in local and regional gw a comparison of sample depth categories at the non sedimentary peat and peat sites are shown separately in fig 4b and fig 4c respectively at the non sedimentary peat sites there is a transition in doc characteristics on rda1 from surface and hyporheic zone water which contain higher bp cdoc hs hs aromaticity and molecular weight and doc concentrations to local and regional gw which contain higher lmwn bb and hoc at sites that contain peat layers the change in doc character with sample depth is less clear with regional gw and surface waters containing higher lmwn and bp than local groundwater which appears to contain higher hs hs molecular weight and aromaticity we propose the reason for this difference is less processed organic matter inputs likely from the peat layers are impacting local gw doc at these sites overall this suggests that overall groundwater doc composition is less controlled by processing with depth at the peat sites a conclusion which is supported by a higher variation explained by the first and second constrained components for non peat sites 19 6 and 6 5 respectively compared to the peat sites 11 7 and 6 2 respectively as shown in figure s2 in the supplementary material 4 discussion we have presented what is to our knowledge the largest dataset of groundwater doc character using lcocd our samples come from multiple sites and over several years of sampling seasonal variation such as changes in evaporation rainfall and soil moisture could lead to changes in groundwater doc concentration and composition particularly in surface waters and hyporheic samples which are more influenced by this shorter term variability groundwater samples will tend to display less seasonal variability in doc concentration and character compared to surface waters and hyporheic samples due to the relative stability over time of the environmental conditions that drive changes in doc groundwater doc experiences constant darkness little change in temperature more evolved and stable water chemistry further discussion of seasonal variability in samples from the same sites is available in the supplementary material of mcdonough et al 2020b in this study at anna bay we observe a significantly lower median value for doc hoc hydrophilic hs bb and lmwn concentrations in the hyporheic samples in the autumn samples compared to the summer samples using one tailed wilcoxon rank sum tests all p 0 005 however due to the sampling locations not being consistent between the different trips for example the summer dataset at anna bay contained more local groundwater samples while the autumn dataset contained more hyporheic samples it is difficult to observe any seasonal trends in the data we note however that the data represents a range of seasons and sampling dates at each site and thus this seasonal variability would be captured in the analyses presented for the full dataset and the sedimentary peat layers and non sedimentary peat subgroups overall the differences between the sites and with depth are larger than these seasonal differences in all environments with the exception of rottnest island there is a decline in the higher molecular weight fractions as water flows through the subsurface i e hyporheic to local and regional groundwater such as bp and hs which is suggestive of organic matter processing hs have been shown to preferentially sorb compared to the other lcocd fractions on various aquifer materials oudone et al 2019 the decrease in hs in both concentration and relative abundance therefore indicate sorption of organic matter as water flows through the subsurface at all sites this is also supported by the work by chapelle et al 2016 who proposed sorption as one of the mechanisms for the removal of dissolved organic matter along flowpaths in aquifers bp are predominately present in the surface water samples and not in the groundwater samples we hypothesise this is due to the organic matter that is produced through microbial activity by a range of algae and bacteria present in surface water khan et al 2019 li et al 2015 villacorte et al 2015 zheng et al 2009 at rottnest island some of the samples are influenced by saltwater intrusion see supplementary material for details at this site we see an increase in doc and hs concentrations along the flowpath of fresh local gw to old seawater samples table 2 in comparison to the regional groundwater samples at the other sites the old seawater samples at rottnest island have lower relative abundances of hoc and lmwn with a higher relative abundance of hs fig 2 the composition of the local groundwater samples that have interacted with sedimentary peat layers thirlmere lakes and anna bay are similar with high relative abundance and concentration of hoc compared to the other sites however there are differences in the abundance of the hs and lmwn fractions the hyporheic samples at both sites have similar relative abundances which suggests that these differences are not due to any surface processes such as photodegradation instead we hypothesise that there is an additional source in the groundwater at thirlmere lakes which has not interacted with the peat layers and has undergone more dom processing resulting in lower hs and higher lwmn abundances mcdonough et al 2020b hydrophilic hoc ratios are important in determining the treatability of water with lower values suggesting easier treatability due to higher concentrations of non polar hoc median hydrophilic hoc ratios for united kingdom and united states surface waters has been estimated at approximately 1 22 ghernaout 2014 our lcocd results show highly variable hydrophilic hoc ratios in groundwater at all sites with 9 6 and 25 6 of samples at sedimentary peat layers and non sedimentary peat sites respectively containing only hydrophilic doc we identify average hydrophilic hoc ratios of 4 35 3 76 and 7 53 5 32 at peat and non sedimentary peat sites respectively where both hydrophilic doc and hoc are present p 0 0021 the results show that the presence of sedimentary organic matter is the main control on groundwater doc composition as demonstrated by rda1 on fig 4a with a secondary control by sample depth at the non sedimentary peat sites dom at sites containing sedimentary peat layers has a higher abundance of hoc hs of higher molecular weight and overall doc concentrations being between 2 and 15 times higher than fractured rock and alluvial environments for the equivalent depth pre treatment by coagulation flocculation sedimentation or sand filtration which have high removal efficiency for hoc ghernaout 2014 krzeminski et al 2019 sharp et al 2006 may be more suitable treatment methods for these dom characteristics the presence of aged organics at depth can also lead to a higher abundance of hoc such as at maules creek however the overall hoc concentration is significantly lower than at sites containing sedimentary peat layers and hence is unlikely to require pre treatment in fractured rock and alluvial groundwater environments doc is lower in concentration and has a higher proportion of lmwn and hs of lower molecular weight than hs in environments containing peat layers doc in these groundwaters may therefore be more efficiently removed by ozonation biologically activated carbon bac filtration pac six or magnetic ion exchange resin which can remove lower molecular weight and hydrophilic fractions andersson et al 2020 krzeminski et al 2019 mergen et al 2009 shutova et al 2020 5 conclusions this study represents the largest dataset of chromatographic dom in surface and groundwater samples n 239 using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lcocd our data represents four depth categories surface water hyporheic zone water local groundwater and regional groundwater from five different sites in australia our findings suggest that dom composition can be highly variable and highlight the complexity and variability of dom inputs and processing mechanisms of various size fractions in different environments while we observe higher percentages of difficult to treat hydrophilic organic carbon in groundwater from non sedimentary peat environments the doc concentrations tend to be lower our findings indicate that the presence of sedimentary organic matter strongly influence the character of groundwater dom resulting in different requirements for removal of doc from these environments depth also affects groundwater doc concentration and composition with sedimentary organic carbon inputs in peatland environments resulting in inputs of higher molecular weight higher aromaticity dom in shallow groundwater in all environments doc concentration and high molecular weight fractions such as bps decline with groundwater depth due

17397,continuous development of industry and civilization has led to changes in composition texture and toxicity of waste water due to the wide range of pollutants being present considering that the conventional wastewater treatment methods are insufficient for removing micropollutants and nutrients to a high level other alternative treatment methods should be used to polish wastewater treatment plant effluents in this study we developed an alternative polishing concept for removal of ammonium and micropollutants that could potentially be incorporated in existing wastewater treatment plants we demonstrated a method to use high silica mor zeolite granules as an adsorbent for simultaneous removal of the micropollutant sulfamethoxazole smx and ammonium nh4 ions from aqueous solutions at an initial nh4 concentration of 10 mg l the high silica zeolite mordenite mor granules removed 0 42 mg g of nh4 similar to the removal obtained by commonly used natural zeolite zeolita 0 44 mg g however at higher nh4 concentrations the zeolita performed better in addition the langmuir isotherm model showed a higher maximum adsorption capacity of zeolita qmax 4 08 mg g which was about two times higher than that of mor 2 11 the adsorption capacity of mor towards smx at both low 2 µg l and high 50 mg l initial concentrations was high and even increased in the presence of nh4 ions the used adsorbent could be regenerated with ozone and reused in consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles with marginal decrease in the total adsorption capacity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high silica zeolites ammonium removal sulfamethoxazole ozone regeneration 1 introduction the presence of organic micropollutants in industrial and municipal wastewater has become a major concern rogowska et al 2019 kamaz et al 2019 these emerging pollutants include pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals pesticides fire retardants etc the increasing concentration of these compounds in wastewater requires that wastewater treatment facilities introduce an additional removal technology although discharge guidelines for many of these compounds do not exist various studies have shown the presence of these pollutants in effluents from sewage treatment up to 10 µg l and in surface water with average values up to 1 µg l and maximum values up to 10 µg l sathiskumar et al 2020 liwarska bizukojc et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 given that most existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed for removal of these compounds they end up in wwtp effluent while in practice water authorities aim at reducing or eliminating the adverse effects of trace organic compounds on the aquatic environment and on human health loos et al 2013 guillossou et al 2019 additionally ammonium is a key component in most domestic wwtps anticipated new treatment targets to avoid water pollution require a large number of wwtps to meet discharge consents between 1 and 3 mg nh4 l who 1996 milieurecht 2017 the conventional process for ammonium removal consists of aerobic nitrification and anoxic denitrification consuming high amounts of energy van der hoek et al 2018 a possible solution to move towards energy consumption reduction and efficient ammonium removal could lie in ion exchange amini 2017 a variety of materials can be used in such an ion exchange process including polymeric ion exchange resins as well as natural and synthetic zeolites especially natural zeolites including clinoptilolite mor and chabazite with clinoptilolite being the most commonly used tend to be effective in ammonium removal langwaldt 2008 widiastuti et al 2011 wang et al 2010 the purity chemical composition crystal size porosity and pore diameter of these zeolites vary which influences their efficacy for wastewater treatment in terms of their capacity and selectivity towards ammonium moshoeshoe et al 2017 on the other hand in recent years synthetic high silica zeolites have been evaluated as alternative adsorbents for activated carbon for organic micropollutant removal from water a synthetic zeolite is made by modification of clay and other aluminium bearing minerals and shows promising operating efficiencies comparable to the natural zeolites ham et al 2018 the capacity and selectivity of the various zeolites are influenced by a combination of the internal pore sizes of the lattice structure the ratio of si al and the distribution of al within the lattice frame jiang et al 2018 mor was selected as a high silica zeolite amongst others due to its commercial availability and proven removal of wide range of different organic micropollutants jiang 2019 the removal of micropollutants in this case pharmaceuticals on mor might benefit from the wide range of pores sizes i e 2 6 å 7 0 å from two types of channels with opening sizes 2 6 å 5 7 å and 6 5 å 7 0 å jiang 2019 in addition mor has been next to clinoptilolite reported as a zeolite for ammonium removal chen et al 2018 the possibility of regenerating mor zeolite by ozone is reported wang 2020 therefore mor could have potential adsorption characteristics for micropollutants rather than clinoptilolite with a simultaneous decrease of ammonium concentrations in water the above mentioned processes are in principle reversible so that after the zeolite has been exhausted it could be regenerated by treating the zeolite with e g an advanced oxidation technology such as ozonation zhang et al 2014 being economically and environmentally competitive when compared to the large amounts of salts required for the conventional regeneration of exhausted zeolites deng et al 2014 additionally regeneration is done on site making it more attractive than granular activated carbon gac for which reactivation plants are normally used clements et al 2004 due to the co existence of multiple contaminants in water sources including ammonium and micropollutants as indicated above technologies for their simultaneous removal are desirable the rationale behind promoting simultaneous removal of micropollutants and ammonium is to promote so called one step treatment methods replacing complex and multi step methods of already existing conventional processes mentioned in the paragraph above in the current study we developed an innovative and sustainable polishing concept that can remove multiple contaminants in a single process and could potentially be incorporated in existing wastewater treatment plants we demonstrated the potential of this treatment strategy using laboratory scale experiments the innovation thus lies in 1 simultaneous removal of organic micropollutants and ammonium from water by zeolite granules and 2 regeneration of granules with ozone accordingly the current paper provides the comparison of a synthetic mor and natural zeolite zeolita in a series of batch experiments in ultra pure water to evaluate the performance and assess the impact of initial ammonium concentration on ammonium and sulfamethoxazole smx removal efficacy sulphonamide antibiotic smx was chosen as a model compound nowadays the sulfonamide group is present in many drugs as antibiotics antimalarics diuretics hypoglycemics antiinflammatories antihypertensives antitumor compounds antithyroid compounds etc making smx good representative drug for broad range of antibiotics zhou et al 2018 thiebault 2020 additionally smx was chosen as a model compound due to its resistance to remediation and natural attenuation and due to its extensive use in both human and veterinary medicines jiang 2019 bueno et al 2012 loos et al 2013 this antibiotic has been classified as emerging contaminant and has been found in water resources at concentration levels from ng l to μg l bueno et al 2012 al aukidy et al 2012 loos et al 2013 smx has been detected in the concentration range from 1 to 150 ng l in wwtp effluents and along dutch rivers zhou et al 2018 sabri et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 zeolite materials and zeolite characterisation for the experiments two zeolites were used a natural clinoptilolite nz zeolita spain and a synthetic mordenite mor 690 hoa si al 240 tosoh corporation tokyo japan mor powder zeolite had a surface area bet around 450 m2 g with a crystal size of 0 1 0 5 µm jiang 2019 the number in parentheses refers to the si al ratio of the zeolite preliminary tests on smx removal by four different types of synthetic zeolites mor fau bea and mfi indicated that the best ammonium removal was achieved by mor zeolite jiang et al 2018 and therefore mor was used during the experiments both granular and powdered zeolites can be used in liquid phase applications jiang et al 2018 however in this study the granular form was chosen since it can be used in continuous processes and can be regenerated whereas the powdered form is generally used in batch processes without regeneration additionally the granulation process transforms the fine powders into dust free granules that are easy to compress the granules had a spherical shape for content uniformity and an adequate moisture and hardness to prevent breaking determined previously by elshof 2019 dust formation during process and loss of material zeolite granules were made using zeolite powders combined with bentonite honeywell fluka usa which functions as a binder in the percentage ratio of 85 15 zeolite bentonite pre treatment of the zeolites was done by washing it with mili q water afterwards the samples were dried for a day in an oven at 105 c to remove moisture finally the granules were calcinated in the oven for 3 h at 600 c for nz and for mor at 850 c in order to compare the crystal structure and the mineralogy of the zeolite x ray xrd bruker axs d5005 diffractometer using filtered cu κα radiation with accelerating voltage 45 kv current 30 ma and scanned at 2θ from 4 to 50 diffraction analyses were performed the chemical composition of the zeolite samples was determined by using x ray fluorescence xrf using a panalytical axios max wd xrf spectrometer and data evaluation was done with superq5 0i omnian software boatemaa et al 2018 2 2 batch study for smx and ammonium removal using zeolita and mor equilibrium adsorption was determined in batch experiments using 1 l flasks for each of the zeolites experiments were conducted in demineralised water rios reverse osmosis system various studies have shown the presence of smx in effluents from sewage treatment up to 10 µg l and in surface water with average values up to 1 µg l and maximum values up to 10 µg l sathiskumar et al 2020 liwarska bizukojc et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 in the smx adsorption experiments the initial concentrations of smx were 2 µg l and 50 mg l the latter was chosen to study the changes in competitive adsorption jiang et al 2018 the mor concentration was varied between 0 01 g l and 1 g l obtained from previous research jiang et al 2018 a blank measurement 0 mg l adsorbent dose was included in each of the isotherm series the solutions with granules were mixed using a magnetic stirrer after 10 d for the 50 mg l initial concentration and after 4 weeks for 2 µg l samples were filtered through a 0 20 µm membrane filter and analysed moreover to study the effect of initial ammonium concentration and adsorption isotherm batch experiments were conducted by varying the initial ammonium of 10 100 mg l with zeolita liquid ratio 2 g 100 ml at 72 h contact time and at a temperature of 20 c ammonium containing water was prepared from ammonium chloride sigma aldrich to determine the above contact times to reach equilibrium kinetic studies of ammonium and smx removal by zeolita and mor from aqueous solution were carried out by agitating 1 l of ammonium or smx solution of known initial concentration with 1 g of mor and zeolita for smx and 20 g of zeolita or mor for ammonium at room temperature 20 c a quantity of 1 ml of uniform dispersion was pipetted out using a 5 ml syringe at different time intervals the collected samples were then filtered 0 2 µm syringe filter whatman spartan and the concentration in the solution was analysed the ph of all solutions was measured by using a ph metre inolab multi 9420 ids wtw germany and was adjusted by using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m nacl solutions to get ph 7 the ammonium concentration was determined by cell

switzerland and measured with a flowrate of 0 9 ml min for smx analyses 1 ml of sample was acquired from the sample bottle smx in water samples of the experiments with initial concentration of 50 mg l

the aqueous solution was expressed as equilibrium loading per mass of the zeolite qe 1 q e c 0 c e v m where co is the initial pollutant concentration mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l v is the batch volume l and m is the zeolite mass equilibrium data for each of the zeolites was then compared to freundlich and langmuir isotherm models ayawei et al 2017 in the langmuir model it is assumed that adsorption is monolayer and that adsorption energy is constant the langmuir adsorption isotherm can be expressed as 2 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e where qe mg g is the amount of compound adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of the compound qmax mg g and kl l mg are langmuir constants related to adsorption capacity and rate of adsorption ayawei

adsorption isotherm is shown as 3 q e k f c e n where kf mg g l mg 1 n is the adsorption capacity the n value 0 1 is factor that indicates adsorption intensity ayawei et al 2017 a typical isotherm of the obtained experimental data consists of 5 10 points performed in triplicates al ghouti et al 2020 maksin et al 2012 2 4 zeolite regeneration oxidation by ozone was found to be robust scalable and cost effective ateia et al 2018 for the regeneration of zeolites ma et al 2019 already studied the effective adsorption and regeneration of smx loaded high silica zeolites therefore the specific objectives of regeneration in this study were a optimal ph by regeneration of granules loaded with ammonium by ozone b evaluation of regenerated zeolites over several adsorption regeneration cycles a oxidation of ammonium by ozone to perceive under which conditions zeolite granules saturated with ammonium can be regenerated experiments were conducted by dissolving ammonium in buffers with different ph values 7 8 and 9 and subsequently oxidizing the dissolved ammonium by ozone boric acid sodium borate mixtures were employed to maintain a constant ph before the ozonation test the initial ph was measured using a ph metre inolab multi 9420 ids wtw germany the reaction solution was sampled every 5 min to analyse the changes in ph values and concentrations of ammonium concentrations of ammonium were measured by spectrophotometry methods and ion chromatography ic 883 basic ic plus metrohm switzerland a adsorption regeneration cycles adsorption regeneration cycles were conducted to examine the regeneration efficiency of the zeolite granules after use the adsorption cycle consisted of loading the zeolite granules with ammonium adsorption in a batch reactor was followed by a regeneration cycle after regeneration another loading cycle was executed therefore granules loaded with ammonium were added into the 200 ml glass reactor after the adjustment of ph for the regeneration process then ozone was introduced in the solution through the glass diffuser the zeolite granules were stirred by a magnetic stirrer ozonation was performed for 2 h whereas ozone concentration in the gas phase was 90 g m3 with flow rate of 0 7 l min o3 concentration in water 25 mg l ozone was produced from pure oxygen with an ozone generator and measured with analysers ozone analyzer bmt 964c model rmg messtechnik gmbh berlin germany installed before and after the reactor moreover removal of the compound during ozonation can be attributed to either oxidation by ozone and or formed hydroxyl radicals oh however here oh radical contribution to the regeneration of the granules at ph 9 is assumed to be very small since it was found that oh formation accelerates at ph 10 zhang et al 2015 elovitz et al 2008 the regeneration process was followed by rinsing the granules with demineralised water and drying them in an oven at 60 c then the regenerated zeolites were again exposed to batch adsorption in a fresh ammonium solution the procedure was repeated three times 3 cycles for different initial ammonium concentrations after each regeneration cycle the adsorption capacity of the regenerated granules was measured all adsorption and regeneration experiments were conducted in duplicates an air stripping experiment was set as a blank experiment to exclude the stripping removal of ammonia by ozone the removal efficiency r was calculated by eq 2 as follows 4 r c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration of ammonia mg l and c is the concentration mg l at reaction time t min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of natural and synthetic zeolite chemical characteristics of the natural zeolita and the synthetic zeolite mor were analysed using xrd and xrf and are presented in table 1 showing that both zeolita and mor mainly consist of silica and alumina however the hydrophilic hydrophobic features controlled by varying the si al ratio can influence the behaviour of zeolites towards polar non polar reactants and products in adsorption processes sarti et al 2017 this is confirmed by the observation that mor with si al 240 was an effective adsorbent for the removal of smx figs 4 and 5 table 1 also reveals that both zeolites contain exchangeable cations such as fe3 ca2 mg2 k and na potentially being able to be exchanged with other cations in the solution such as in this case ammonium the zeolites were additionally characterised by xrd to determine the mineral structure and the results are given in fig 1 it was revealed that zeolita comprised besides clinoptilolite muscovite and nontronite fig 1a and the mor of mordenite fig 1b which was to be expected in case of natural zeolites used in other research the xrd analyses have shown that the dominant mineral component is clinoptilolite langwaldt 2008 however the content of clinoptilolite in zeolitic material can differ from 25 to 70 75 franus et al 2011 besides clinoptilolite in natural zeolites small amount of opal quartz montmorillonite or heulandite can be found langwaldt 2008 when comparing mor zolites in general the overall x ray investigation of natural or modified mor zeolite samples in the literature mainly consist of mordenite which agrees with the findings in fig 1b sakizci et al 2015 hussain et al 2019 3 2 ammonium and smx removal using zeolites 3 2 1 ammonium removal by zeolita and mor zeolita and mor table 2 and fig 2 were tested on ion exchange capacity focusing on ammonium removal the ammonium adsorption was found to increase with increasing initial ammonium concentration from 10 100 mg l at a constant zeolite amount of 20 g l based on fig 2 it can be observed that ammonium adsorption capacity on zeolita was between 0 5 3 mg g and on mor between 0 4 2 mg g the adsorption process was evaluated by fitting the data to two adsorption isotherms the langmuir and freundlich the isotherm eqs 2 and 3 and the experimental adsorption equilibrium data were used to determine the langmuir and freundlich parameters for ammonium both for zeolita and mor and for smx only for mor both the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models equally best fitted the experimental adsorption data with high coefficient of determination r2 the langmuir parameters kl and qmax and freundlich parameters kf and 1 n for the adsorption isotherms are given in table 2 however in view of the higher r2 value listed in table 2 the freundlich model showed to be the best fitting model for mor the conformity to the freundlich model is a result of the heterogeneous nature of the zeolite surface and supports the earlier multi linear nature of ammonium adsorption wasielewski et al 2018 kotoulas et al 2019 on the other hand it was found that the langmuir model yielded a better fit to the data compared to the freundlich when using zeolita in this case it is assumed that adsorption happened at specific homogeneous sites within the zeolite and that there was no interaction between adsorbate molecules langmuir parameters with other natural zeolites from various origins widiastuti et al 2011 has reported that a qmax value of 6 032 mg g at initial ammonium concentration of 5 120 mg l using an australian zeolite however qmax values of 0 608 6 mg g at initial ammonium concentration of 10 80 mg l demir et al 2002 and 6 65 mg g rahmani et al 2004 have also been reported in our case the maximum achieved adsorption capacity of 4 081 mg g was less compared to australian zeolite lower adsorption capacity can be attributed to the variation in their mineralogical compositions and morphology selvam et al 2018 widiastuti et al 2011 although the results show a large variation with regard to the maximum ammonium adsorption capacity at the varied concentrations it can nevertheless be found in the literature that in the range from 10 to 80 mg l maximum removal efficiency of zeolite can be achieved while increasing the initial ammonium concentration decreased its removal percentage wasielewski et al 2018 kotoulas et al 2019 for the freundlich model similar values of kf and 1 n ranged from 0 522 to 0 607 have been reported for ammonium removal using natural zeolites demir et al 2002 widiastuti et al 2011 for all initial ammonium concentrations the 1 n parameter ranges from 0 to 1 on this basis it can be assumed that adsorption conditions of ammonium on zeolites were favourable the adsorption capacities of ammonium by mor were similar to those of zeolita at low initial ammonium concentration 10 40 mg l the measured data showed a larger difference in adsorption efficiencies when higher initial ammonium concentrations were present 60 100 mg l similar outcome was found when comparing romanian zeolite tuff and synthetic zeolites 5a and 13x wang et al 2010 3 2 2 smx removal adsorption of smx onto the selected zeolite granules has been carried out at room temperature 20 c under different initial smx concentrations about 50 mg l and 2 µg l respectively and with and without the presence of nh4 ions 40 mg l however no measurable reduction in smx concentration in the presence of the natural zeolite clinoptilolite has been reported in literature farías et al 2003 or observed experimentally data not shown figs 3 and 4 illustrate the adsorption isotherms of smx on the mor granules the adsorption capacity increased with increasing the equilibrium concentration as expected jiang et al 2020 removal of smx by initial smx concentration of 50 mg l by mor zeolite 1 g l in the absence of nh4 ions was 71 6 from initial 56 59 mg l of smx 40 52 mg l was removed from the solution by adsorbent in agreement with prior work braschi et al 2010 from the results in table 2 it can be concluded that the experimental data are found to be best fitted by freundlich equation therefore adsorption isotherms were fitted by the freundlich isotherms in fig 3 and 4 similar behaviour was obtained by de sousa 2018 showing that stronger binding sites on the surface are occupied first and that the binding strength decreases with the increasing degree of site occupancy additionally he presented a smx adsorption isotherm as a characteristic profile of type s curves indicative of vertical orientation of adsorbed molecules at the surface de sousa et al 2018 in addition isotherms comparison of single smx adsorption on mor and adsorption of smx in the presence of ammonium on mor are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 increased smx adsorption on mor occurred in presence of nh4 ions at concentration of 40 mg l where in this case the adsorbed amount was 78 3 of the initial amount present in the solution this rise in adsorption efficiency of smx probably reflects that the process was assisted by surface complexation amongst smx nh4 and mor as suggested by bajusz et al 1998 who studied the adsorption of n2 o2 mixtures at different p n 2 p o 2 ratios on a series of nacax zeolites with different degrees of na replacement it was shown that for single adsorbates the adsorption increased when na cations were replaced by ca2 cations an exchange causes an increase in adsorption suggesting that na is replaced at the sites which are accessible to the molecules sato et al 2003 gave an additional explanation on this behaviour through the observation of structural changes of zeolites during ion exchange in this research experiments on structural changes of zeolite were conducted xrd and xrf analysis with clean and loaded zeolite however no changes could be detected data not shown in the manuscript therefore we hypothesize that structural changes of the zeolite occur during the ion exchange and we support it with literature findings and measurements done by sato et al 2003 price et al 2017 munthali et al 2014 azambre et al 2020 they found that the zeolitic framework structure deteriorated as evidenced by decreases in the crystallinity and micropore surface area amongst three zeolites one of them showed the most prominent dealumination and mesopore formation price et al 2017 confirmed the same structural changes occurrence on another type of zeolite after partially exchanging the extra framework na ions with monovalent li k rb and nh4 and divalent ca2 cations the results that she obtained from the nmr and ft ir spectra indicated that the local framework environment was affected and that a loss of some aluminium from the framework had occurred dealuminated zeolites contain less al which corresponds to a higher si al molar ratio the increased smx adsorption in the presence of nh4 ions could thus be explained by structural changes of mor during ion exchange with nh4 leading to a zeolite with a more favourable si al ratio and mesoporosity enhancing the accessibility of active sites for smx adsorption as observed in similar studies munthali et al 2014 azambre et al 2020 however the presence of nh4 at the surface might also have resulted in a higher positive surface charge which could have increased the adsorption capacity of smx which at higher ph values is negatively charged liu et al 2018 the isotherm model shown in fig 4 and fitted for the data for the removal of smx 2 µg l in the presence of nh4 ions describes an appropriate fit to the adsorption of adsorbate at relatively low concentrations apart from the effect that the presence of ammonium ions had on the adsorption of smx by the zeolite granules the adsorption of ammonium initial concentration of 40 mg l in the same mixture was tested from table 3 it can be seen that there was hardly any effect of smx on ammonium adsorption even at high concentrations about 50 mg l of smx accordingly it is assumed that the effect of smx at a concentration of 2 µg l on ammonium removal is absent and therefore was not further tested 3 3 regeneration to study the effect of initial ph on ammonia removal by ozone oxidation a series of experiments were conducted with different initial ph values 7 8 and 9 at an ozone flow rate of 0 7 l min and an ozone concentration in the gas phase of 90 g m3 the results are shown in figs 5 a and 5 b the decrease in the concentration of ammonium in fig 5a indicates that ammonium was oxidized by ozone at ph 9 according to the reaction singer et al 1975 khuntia et al 2012 4 n h 4 2 o 2 n o 3 h 2 o 2 h this is in accordance with the alkaline ph range reported to be the most effective for the ozone oxidation of ammonia singer et al 1975 khuntia et al 2012 almost no removal of ammonium at initial ph 8 8 removal was observed while the removal efficiency reached 96 at ph 9 after 120 min it is observed from fig 5b that the ph value of the solution reduced with reaction time the decrease in ph was mainly due to continuous production of h ions during the oxidation reaction eq 4 luo et al 2015 observed the same trend in ph decrease while they studied the effect of initial ph on ammonia removal by ozone oxidation they also found that the higher the ph value is the larger the ammonium removal efficiency in order to avoid interference of air stripping of nh3 mohammed nour et al 2019 with the removal of ammonium by oxidation with ozone the stripping process was tested the pka value for ammonia 9 25 indicates that it can be predicted that some electrically neutral ammonia would exist at ph 9 danutė vaičiukynienė et al 2020 at ph 9 it was found that no nh3 was transferred to the atmosphere this was in accordance with findings from literature where at the higher ph range ph 10 ph 12 greater proportions of nitrogen in form of gaseous nh3 are present and a larger percentage of nh3 could be stripped guštin et al 2011 campos et al 2013 when adsorption equilibrium by mor granules with nh4 was obtained at various initial concentrations as shown in fig 6 its regeneration was conducted by oxidation using an ozonated water fig 6 shows the results of adsorption oxidation cycles performed over the ammonium loaded mor granules as can be noticed after the first regeneration cycle the adsorption capacity dropped for each initial ammonium concentration the initial adsorption capacity for low initial ammonium concentration 10 mg l of 0 4235 mg g was decreased after three regeneration cycles by 0 057 mg g at the high initial ammonium concentrations e g 100 mg l the decrease after first regeneration cycle was higher from 1 92 mg g to 1 22 mg g however the adsorption capacity after the second and third regeneration cycle recuperated and reached 70 of the initial adsorption capacity this drop in the adsorption capacity could be related to slow diffusion of ozonated water to inner adsorption sites of the granules resulting in incomplete regeneration this is in a good agreement with the study of zhang et al 2014 who concluded that ozone dosages must be sufficiently high to lead to surface modification of zeolites making the adsorption sites more approachable and available for regeneration and consequently adsorption 4 conclusions in recent years efforts have been made towards advanced removal of organic micro pollutants and nutrients from wastewater in this study it was demonstrated that nh4 adsorption by zeolita and mor zeolites as well as simultaneous adsorption of nh4 and smx by mor offers an alternative opening ways to simultaneous removal of nh4 ions and smx and potentially other micropollutants from wastewater using synthetic zeolites based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn ammonium adsorption capacity on zeolita granules was found to be between 2 3 3 mg g whereas mor manifested similar adsorption performance at low initial ammonium concentrations 10 40 mg l and lower at high ammonium concentrations 60 100 mg l presence of ammonium ions enhances smx adsorption by mor possibly due to the local structure changes in the zeolite framework upon ion exchange with ammonium hardly any effect of smx on ammonium adsorption by mor was observed even at high concentrations 50 mg l of smx the adsorption capacity of ammonium drastically decreased after the first regeneration cycle by ozonation probably due to incomplete regeneration however after the second and third regeneration cycle adsorption capacity was restored to 86 of the initial capacity at low 10 mg l ammonium concentration and to 70 at high 100 mg l ammonium

17397,continuous development of industry and civilization has led to changes in composition texture and toxicity of waste water due to the wide range of pollutants being present considering that the conventional wastewater treatment methods are insufficient for removing micropollutants and nutrients to a high level other alternative treatment methods should be used to polish wastewater treatment plant effluents in this study we developed an alternative polishing concept for removal of ammonium and micropollutants that could potentially be incorporated in existing wastewater treatment plants we demonstrated a method to use high silica mor zeolite granules as an adsorbent for simultaneous removal of the micropollutant sulfamethoxazole smx and ammonium nh4 ions from aqueous solutions at an initial nh4 concentration of 10 mg l the high silica zeolite mordenite mor granules removed 0 42 mg g of nh4 similar to the removal obtained by commonly used natural zeolite zeolita 0 44 mg g however at higher nh4 concentrations the zeolita performed better in addition the langmuir isotherm model showed a higher maximum adsorption capacity of zeolita qmax 4 08 mg g which was about two times higher than that of mor 2 11 the adsorption capacity of mor towards smx at both low 2 µg l and high 50 mg l initial concentrations was high and even increased in the presence of nh4 ions the used adsorbent could be regenerated with ozone and reused in consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles with marginal decrease in the total adsorption capacity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high silica zeolites ammonium removal sulfamethoxazole ozone regeneration 1 introduction the presence of organic micropollutants in industrial and municipal wastewater has become a major concern rogowska et al 2019 kamaz et al 2019 these emerging pollutants include pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals pesticides fire retardants etc the increasing concentration of these compounds in wastewater requires that wastewater treatment facilities introduce an additional removal technology although discharge guidelines for many of these compounds do not exist various studies have shown the presence of these pollutants in effluents from sewage treatment up to 10 µg l and in surface water with average values up to 1 µg l and maximum values up to 10 µg l sathiskumar et al 2020 liwarska bizukojc et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 given that most existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed for removal of these compounds they end up in wwtp effluent while in practice water authorities aim at reducing or eliminating the adverse effects of trace organic compounds on the aquatic environment and on human health loos et al 2013 guillossou et al 2019 additionally ammonium is a key component in most domestic wwtps anticipated new treatment targets to avoid water pollution require a large number of wwtps to meet discharge consents between 1 and 3 mg nh4 l who 1996 milieurecht 2017 the conventional process for ammonium removal consists of aerobic nitrification and anoxic denitrification consuming high amounts of energy van der hoek et al 2018 a possible solution to move towards energy consumption reduction and efficient ammonium removal could lie in ion exchange amini 2017 a variety of materials can be used in such an ion exchange process including polymeric ion exchange resins as well as natural and synthetic zeolites especially natural zeolites including clinoptilolite mor and chabazite with clinoptilolite being the most commonly used tend to be effective in ammonium removal langwaldt 2008 widiastuti et al 2011 wang et al 2010 the purity chemical composition crystal size porosity and pore diameter of these zeolites vary which influences their efficacy for wastewater treatment in terms of their capacity and selectivity towards ammonium moshoeshoe et al 2017 on the other hand in recent years synthetic high silica zeolites have been evaluated as alternative adsorbents for activated carbon for organic micropollutant removal from water a synthetic zeolite is made by modification of clay and other aluminium bearing minerals and shows promising operating efficiencies comparable to the natural zeolites ham et al 2018 the capacity and selectivity of the various zeolites are influenced by a combination of the internal pore sizes of the lattice structure the ratio of si al and the distribution of al within the lattice frame jiang et al 2018 mor was selected as a high silica zeolite amongst others due to its commercial availability and proven removal of wide range of different organic micropollutants jiang 2019 the removal of micropollutants in this case pharmaceuticals on mor might benefit from the wide range of pores sizes i e 2 6 å 7 0 å from two types of channels with opening sizes 2 6 å 5 7 å and 6 5 å 7 0 å jiang 2019 in addition mor has been next to clinoptilolite reported as a zeolite for ammonium removal chen et al 2018 the possibility of regenerating mor zeolite by ozone is reported wang 2020 therefore mor could have potential adsorption characteristics for micropollutants rather than clinoptilolite with a simultaneous decrease of ammonium concentrations in water the above mentioned processes are in principle reversible so that after the zeolite has been exhausted it could be regenerated by treating the zeolite with e g an advanced oxidation technology such as ozonation zhang et al 2014 being economically and environmentally competitive when compared to the large amounts of salts required for the conventional regeneration of exhausted zeolites deng et al 2014 additionally regeneration is done on site making it more attractive than granular activated carbon gac for which reactivation plants are normally used clements et al 2004 due to the co existence of multiple contaminants in water sources including ammonium and micropollutants as indicated above technologies for their simultaneous removal are desirable the rationale behind promoting simultaneous removal of micropollutants and ammonium is to promote so called one step treatment methods replacing complex and multi step methods of already existing conventional processes mentioned in the paragraph above in the current study we developed an innovative and sustainable polishing concept that can remove multiple contaminants in a single process and could potentially be incorporated in existing wastewater treatment plants we demonstrated the potential of this treatment strategy using laboratory scale experiments the innovation thus lies in 1 simultaneous removal of organic micropollutants and ammonium from water by zeolite granules and 2 regeneration of granules with ozone accordingly the current paper provides the comparison of a synthetic mor and natural zeolite zeolita in a series of batch experiments in ultra pure water to evaluate the performance and assess the impact of initial ammonium concentration on ammonium and sulfamethoxazole smx removal efficacy sulphonamide antibiotic smx was chosen as a model compound nowadays the sulfonamide group is present in many drugs as antibiotics antimalarics diuretics hypoglycemics antiinflammatories antihypertensives antitumor compounds antithyroid compounds etc making smx good representative drug for broad range of antibiotics zhou et al 2018 thiebault 2020 additionally smx was chosen as a model compound due to its resistance to remediation and natural attenuation and due to its extensive use in both human and veterinary medicines jiang 2019 bueno et al 2012 loos et al 2013 this antibiotic has been classified as emerging contaminant and has been found in water resources at concentration levels from ng l to μg l bueno et al 2012 al aukidy et al 2012 loos et al 2013 smx has been detected in the concentration range from 1 to 150 ng l in wwtp effluents and along dutch rivers zhou et al 2018 sabri et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 zeolite materials and zeolite characterisation for the experiments two zeolites were used a natural clinoptilolite nz zeolita spain and a synthetic mordenite mor 690 hoa si al 240 tosoh corporation tokyo japan mor powder zeolite had a surface area bet around 450 m2 g with a crystal size of 0 1 0 5 µm jiang 2019 the number in parentheses refers to the si al ratio of the zeolite preliminary tests on smx removal by four different types of synthetic zeolites mor fau bea and mfi indicated that the best ammonium removal was achieved by mor zeolite jiang et al 2018 and therefore mor was used during the experiments both granular and powdered zeolites can be used in liquid phase applications jiang et al 2018 however in this study the granular form was chosen since it can be used in continuous processes and can be regenerated whereas the powdered form is generally used in batch processes without regeneration additionally the granulation process transforms the fine powders into dust free granules that are easy to compress the granules had a spherical shape for content uniformity and an adequate moisture and hardness to prevent breaking determined previously by elshof 2019 dust formation during process and loss of material zeolite granules were made using zeolite powders combined with bentonite honeywell fluka usa which functions as a binder in the percentage ratio of 85 15 zeolite bentonite pre treatment of the zeolites was done by washing it with mili q water afterwards the samples were dried for a day in an oven at 105 c to remove moisture finally the granules were calcinated in the oven for 3 h at 600 c for nz and for mor at 850 c in order to compare the crystal structure and the mineralogy of the zeolite x ray xrd bruker axs d5005 diffractometer

and ammonium removal using zeolita and mor equilibrium adsorption was determined in batch experiments using 1 l flasks for each of the zeolites experiments were conducted in demineralised water rios reverse osmosis system various studies have shown the presence of smx in effluents from sewage treatment up to 10 µg l and in surface water with average values up to 1 µg l and maximum values up to 10 µg l sathiskumar et al 2020 liwarska bizukojc et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 in the smx adsorption experiments the initial concentrations of smx were 2 µg l and 50 mg l the latter was chosen to study the changes in competitive adsorption jiang et al 2018 the mor concentration was varied between 0 01 g l and 1 g l obtained from previous research jiang et al 2018 a blank measurement 0 mg l adsorbent dose was included in each of the isotherm series the solutions with granules were mixed using a magnetic stirrer after 10 d for the 50 mg l initial concentration and after 4 weeks for 2 µg l samples were filtered through a 0 20 µm membrane filter and analysed moreover to study the effect of initial ammonium concentration and adsorption isotherm batch experiments were conducted by varying the initial ammonium of 10 100 mg l with zeolita liquid ratio 2 g 100 ml at 72 h contact time and at a temperature of 20 c ammonium containing water was prepared from ammonium chloride sigma aldrich to determine the above contact times to reach equilibrium kinetic studies of ammonium and smx removal by zeolita and mor from aqueous solution were carried out by agitating 1 l of ammonium or smx solution of known initial concentration with 1 g of mor and zeolita for smx and 20 g of zeolita or mor for ammonium at room temperature 20 c a quantity of 1 ml of uniform dispersion was pipetted out using a 5 ml syringe at different time intervals the collected samples were then filtered 0 2 µm syringe filter whatman spartan and the concentration in the solution was analysed the ph of all

the aqueous solution was expressed as equilibrium loading per mass of the zeolite qe 1 q e c 0 c e v m where co is the initial pollutant concentration mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l v is the batch volume l and m is the zeolite mass equilibrium data for each of the zeolites was then compared to freundlich and langmuir isotherm models ayawei et al 2017 in the langmuir model it is assumed that adsorption is monolayer and that adsorption energy is constant the langmuir adsorption isotherm can be expressed as 2 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e where qe mg g is the amount of compound adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of the compound qmax mg g and kl l mg are langmuir constants related to adsorption capacity and rate of adsorption ayawei

adsorption isotherm is shown as 3 q e k f c e n where kf mg g l mg 1 n is the adsorption capacity the n value 0 1 is factor that indicates adsorption intensity ayawei et al 2017 a typical isotherm of the obtained experimental data consists of 5 10 points performed in triplicates al ghouti et al 2020 maksin et al 2012 2 4 zeolite regeneration oxidation by ozone was found to be robust scalable and cost effective ateia et al 2018 for the regeneration of zeolites ma et al 2019 already studied the effective adsorption and regeneration of smx loaded high silica zeolites therefore the specific objectives of regeneration in this study were a optimal ph by regeneration of granules loaded with ammonium by ozone b evaluation of regenerated zeolites over several adsorption regeneration cycles a oxidation of ammonium by ozone to perceive under which conditions zeolite granules saturated with ammonium can be regenerated experiments were conducted by dissolving ammonium in buffers with different ph values 7 8 and 9 and subsequently oxidizing the dissolved ammonium by ozone boric acid sodium borate mixtures were employed to maintain a constant ph before the ozonation test the initial ph was measured using a ph metre inolab multi 9420 ids wtw germany the reaction solution was sampled every 5 min to analyse the changes in ph values and concentrations of ammonium concentrations of ammonium were measured by spectrophotometry methods and ion chromatography ic 883 basic ic plus metrohm switzerland a adsorption regeneration cycles adsorption regeneration cycles were conducted to examine the regeneration efficiency of the zeolite granules after use the adsorption cycle consisted of loading the zeolite granules with ammonium adsorption in a batch reactor was followed by a regeneration cycle after regeneration another loading cycle was executed therefore granules loaded with ammonium were added into the 200 ml glass reactor after the adjustment of ph for the regeneration process then ozone was introduced in the solution through the glass diffuser the zeolite granules were stirred by a magnetic stirrer ozonation was performed for 2 h whereas ozone concentration in the gas phase was 90 g m3 with flow rate of 0 7 l min o3 concentration in water 25 mg l ozone was produced from pure oxygen with an ozone generator and measured with analysers ozone analyzer bmt 964c model rmg messtechnik gmbh berlin germany installed before and after the reactor moreover removal of the compound during ozonation can be attributed to either oxidation by ozone and or formed hydroxyl radicals oh however here oh radical contribution to the regeneration of the granules at ph 9 is assumed to be very small since it was found that oh formation accelerates at ph 10 zhang et al 2015 elovitz et al 2008 the regeneration process was followed by rinsing the granules with demineralised water and drying them in an oven at 60 c then the regenerated zeolites were again exposed to batch adsorption in a fresh ammonium solution the procedure was repeated three times 3 cycles for different initial ammonium concentrations after each regeneration cycle the adsorption capacity of the regenerated granules was measured all adsorption and regeneration experiments were conducted in duplicates an air stripping experiment was set as a blank experiment to exclude the stripping removal of ammonia by ozone the removal efficiency r was calculated by eq 2 as follows 4 r c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration of ammonia mg l and c is the concentration mg l at reaction time t min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of natural and synthetic zeolite chemical characteristics of the natural zeolita and the synthetic zeolite mor were analysed using xrd and xrf and are presented in table 1 showing that both zeolita and mor mainly consist of silica and alumina however the hydrophilic hydrophobic features controlled by varying the si al ratio can influence the behaviour of zeolites towards polar non polar reactants and products in adsorption processes sarti et al 2017 this is confirmed by the observation that mor with si al 240 was an effective adsorbent for the removal of smx figs 4 and 5 table 1 also reveals that both zeolites contain exchangeable cations such as fe3 ca2 mg2 k and na potentially being able to be exchanged with other cations in the solution such as in this case ammonium the zeolites were additionally characterised by xrd to determine the mineral structure and the results are given in fig 1 it was revealed that zeolita comprised besides clinoptilolite muscovite and nontronite fig 1a and the mor of mordenite fig 1b which was to be expected in case of natural zeolites used in other research the xrd analyses have shown that the dominant mineral component is clinoptilolite langwaldt 2008 however the content of clinoptilolite in zeolitic material can differ from 25 to 70 75 franus et al 2011 besides clinoptilolite in natural zeolites small amount of opal quartz montmorillonite or heulandite can be found langwaldt 2008 when comparing mor zolites in general the overall x ray investigation of natural or modified mor zeolite samples in the literature mainly consist of mordenite which agrees with the findings in fig 1b sakizci et al 2015 hussain et al 2019 3 2 ammonium and smx removal using zeolites 3 2 1 ammonium removal by zeolita and mor zeolita and mor table 2 and fig 2 were tested on ion exchange capacity focusing on ammonium removal the ammonium adsorption was found to increase with increasing initial ammonium concentration from 10 100 mg l at a constant zeolite amount of 20 g l based on fig 2 it can be observed that ammonium adsorption capacity on zeolita was between 0 5 3 mg g and on mor between 0 4 2 mg g the adsorption process was evaluated by fitting the data to two adsorption isotherms the langmuir and freundlich the isotherm eqs 2 and 3 and the experimental adsorption equilibrium data were used to determine the langmuir and freundlich parameters for ammonium both for zeolita and mor and for smx only for mor both the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models equally best fitted the experimental adsorption data with high coefficient of determination r2 the langmuir parameters kl and qmax and freundlich parameters kf and 1 n for the adsorption isotherms are given in table 2 however in view of the higher r2 value listed in table 2 the freundlich model showed to be the best fitting model for mor the conformity to the freundlich model is a result of the heterogeneous nature of the zeolite surface and supports the earlier multi linear nature of ammonium adsorption wasielewski et al 2018 kotoulas et al 2019 on the other hand it was found that the langmuir model yielded a better fit to the data compared to the freundlich when using zeolita in this case it is assumed that adsorption happened at specific homogeneous sites within the zeolite and that there was no interaction between adsorbate molecules langmuir parameters with other natural zeolites from various origins widiastuti et al 2011 has reported that a qmax value of 6 032 mg g at initial ammonium concentration of 5 120 mg l using an australian zeolite however qmax values of 0 608 6 mg g at initial ammonium concentration of 10 80 mg l demir et al 2002 and 6 65 mg g rahmani et al 2004 have also been reported in our case the maximum achieved adsorption capacity of 4 081 mg g was less compared to australian zeolite lower adsorption capacity can be attributed to the variation in their mineralogical compositions and morphology selvam et al 2018 widiastuti et al 2011 although the results show a large variation with regard to the maximum ammonium adsorption capacity at the varied concentrations it can nevertheless be found in the literature that in the range from 10 to 80 mg l maximum removal efficiency of zeolite can be achieved while increasing the initial ammonium concentration decreased its removal percentage wasielewski et al 2018 kotoulas et al 2019 for the freundlich model similar values of kf and 1 n ranged from 0 522 to 0 607 have been reported for ammonium removal using natural zeolites demir et al 2002 widiastuti et al 2011 for all initial ammonium concentrations the 1 n parameter ranges from 0 to 1 on this basis it can be assumed that adsorption conditions of ammonium on zeolites were favourable the adsorption capacities of ammonium by mor were similar to those of zeolita at low initial ammonium concentration 10 40 mg l the measured data showed a larger difference in adsorption efficiencies when higher initial ammonium concentrations were present 60 100 mg l similar outcome was found when comparing romanian zeolite tuff and synthetic zeolites 5a and 13x wang et al 2010 3 2 2 smx removal adsorption of smx onto the selected zeolite granules has been carried out at room temperature 20 c under different initial smx concentrations about 50 mg l and 2 µg l respectively and with and without the presence of nh4 ions 40 mg l however no measurable reduction in smx concentration in the presence of the natural zeolite clinoptilolite has been reported in literature farías et al 2003 or observed experimentally data not shown figs 3 and 4 illustrate the adsorption isotherms of smx on the mor granules the adsorption capacity increased with increasing the equilibrium concentration as expected jiang et al 2020 removal of smx by initial smx concentration of 50 mg l by mor zeolite 1 g l in the absence of nh4 ions was 71 6 from initial 56 59 mg l of smx 40 52 mg l was removed from the solution by adsorbent in agreement with prior work braschi et al 2010 from the results in table 2 it can be concluded that the experimental data are found to be best fitted by freundlich equation therefore adsorption isotherms were fitted by the freundlich isotherms in fig 3 and 4 similar behaviour was obtained by de sousa 2018 showing that stronger binding sites on the surface are occupied first and that the binding strength decreases with the increasing degree of site occupancy additionally he presented a smx adsorption isotherm as a characteristic profile of type s curves indicative of vertical orientation of adsorbed molecules at the surface de sousa et al 2018 in addition isotherms comparison of single smx adsorption on mor and adsorption of smx in the presence of ammonium on mor are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 increased smx adsorption on mor occurred in presence of nh4 ions at concentration of 40 mg l where in this case the adsorbed amount was 78 3 of the initial amount present in the solution this rise in adsorption efficiency of smx probably reflects that the process was assisted by surface complexation amongst smx nh4 and mor as suggested by bajusz et al 1998 who studied the adsorption of n2 o2 mixtures at different p n 2 p o 2 ratios on a series of nacax zeolites with different degrees of na replacement it was shown that for single adsorbates the adsorption increased when na cations were replaced by ca2 cations an exchange causes an increase in adsorption suggesting that na is replaced at the sites which are accessible to the molecules sato et al 2003 gave an additional explanation on this behaviour through the observation of structural changes of zeolites during ion exchange in this research experiments on structural changes of zeolite were conducted xrd and xrf analysis with clean and loaded zeolite however no changes could be detected data not shown in the manuscript therefore we hypothesize that structural changes of the zeolite occur during the ion exchange and we support it with literature findings and measurements done by sato et al 2003 price et al 2017 munthali et al 2014 azambre et al 2020 they found that the zeolitic framework structure deteriorated as evidenced by decreases in the crystallinity and micropore surface area amongst three zeolites one of them showed the most prominent dealumination and mesopore formation price et al 2017 confirmed the same structural changes occurrence on another type of zeolite after partially exchanging the extra framework na ions with monovalent li k rb and nh4 and divalent ca2 cations the results that she obtained from the nmr and ft ir spectra indicated that the local framework environment was affected and that a loss of some aluminium from the framework had occurred dealuminated zeolites contain less al which corresponds to a higher si al molar ratio the increased smx adsorption in the presence of nh4 ions could thus be explained by structural changes of mor during ion exchange with nh4 leading to a zeolite with a more favourable si al ratio and mesoporosity enhancing the accessibility of active sites for smx adsorption as observed in similar studies munthali et al 2014 azambre et al 2020 however the presence of nh4 at the surface might also have resulted in a higher positive surface charge which could have increased the adsorption capacity of smx which at higher ph values is negatively charged liu et al 2018 the isotherm model shown in fig 4 and fitted for the data for the removal of smx 2 µg l in the presence of nh4 ions describes an appropriate fit to the adsorption of adsorbate at relatively low concentrations apart from the effect that the presence of ammonium ions had on the adsorption of smx by the zeolite granules the adsorption of ammonium initial concentration of 40 mg l in the same mixture was tested from table 3 it can be seen that there was hardly any effect of smx on ammonium adsorption even at high concentrations about 50 mg l of smx accordingly it is assumed that the effect of smx at a concentration of 2 µg l on ammonium removal is absent and therefore was not further tested 3 3 regeneration to study the effect of initial ph on ammonia removal by ozone oxidation a series of experiments were conducted with different initial ph values 7 8 and 9 at an ozone flow rate of 0 7 l min and an ozone concentration in the gas phase of 90 g m3 the results are shown in figs 5 a and 5 b the decrease in the concentration of ammonium in fig 5a indicates that ammonium was oxidized by ozone at ph 9 according to the reaction singer et al 1975 khuntia et al 2012 4 n h 4 2 o 2 n o 3 h 2 o 2 h this is in accordance with the alkaline ph range reported to be the most effective for the ozone oxidation of ammonia singer et al 1975 khuntia et al 2012 almost no removal of ammonium at initial ph 8 8 removal was observed while the removal efficiency reached 96 at ph 9 after 120 min it is observed from fig 5b that the ph value of the solution reduced with reaction time the decrease in ph was mainly due to continuous production of h ions during the oxidation reaction eq 4 luo et al 2015 observed the same trend in ph decrease while they studied the effect of initial ph on ammonia removal by ozone oxidation they also found that the higher the ph value is the larger the ammonium removal efficiency in order to avoid interference of air stripping of nh3 mohammed nour et al 2019 with the removal of ammonium by oxidation with ozone the stripping process was tested the pka value for ammonia 9 25 indicates that it can be predicted that some electrically neutral ammonia would exist at ph 9 danutė vaičiukynienė et al 2020 at ph 9 it was found that no nh3 was transferred to the atmosphere this was in accordance with findings from literature where at the higher ph range ph 10 ph 12 greater proportions of nitrogen in form of gaseous nh3 are present and a larger percentage of nh3 could be stripped guštin et al 2011 campos et al 2013 when adsorption equilibrium by mor granules with nh4 was obtained at various initial concentrations as shown in fig 6 its regeneration was conducted by oxidation using an ozonated water fig 6 shows the results of adsorption oxidation cycles performed over the ammonium loaded mor granules as can be noticed after the first regeneration cycle the adsorption capacity dropped for each initial ammonium concentration the initial adsorption capacity for low initial ammonium concentration 10 mg l of 0 4235 mg g was decreased after three regeneration cycles by 0 057 mg g at the high initial ammonium concentrations e g 100 mg l the decrease after first regeneration cycle was higher from 1 92 mg g to 1 22 mg g however the adsorption capacity after the second and third regeneration cycle recuperated and reached 70 of the initial adsorption capacity this drop in the adsorption capacity could be related to slow diffusion of ozonated water to inner adsorption sites of the granules resulting in incomplete regeneration this is in a good agreement with the study of zhang et al 2014 who concluded that ozone dosages must be sufficiently high to lead to surface modification of zeolites making the adsorption sites more approachable and available for regeneration and consequently adsorption 4 conclusions in recent years efforts have been made towards advanced removal of organic micro pollutants and nutrients from wastewater in this study it was demonstrated that nh4 adsorption by zeolita and mor zeolites as well as simultaneous adsorption of nh4 and smx by mor offers an alternative opening ways to simultaneous removal of nh4 ions and smx and potentially other micropollutants from wastewater using synthetic zeolites based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn ammonium adsorption capacity on zeolita granules was found to be between 2 3 3 mg g whereas mor manifested similar adsorption performance at low initial ammonium concentrations 10 40 mg l and lower at high ammonium concentrations 60 100 mg l presence of ammonium ions enhances smx adsorption by mor possibly due to the local structure changes in the zeolite framework upon ion exchange with ammonium hardly any effect of smx on ammonium adsorption by mor was observed even at high concentrations 50 mg l of smx the adsorption capacity of ammonium drastically decreased after the first regeneration cycle by ozonation probably due to incomplete regeneration however after the second and third regeneration cycle adsorption capacity was restored to 86 of the initial capacity at low 10 mg l ammonium concentration and to 70 at high 100 mg l ammonium

17398,the carbon nitrogen ratio c n is a key parameter that affects the performance of anaerobic digestion ad recent ad research has focused on optimizing the c n of feedstock the so called inhibited steady state refers to a special state of ammonia inhibition of ad that often occurs at low c n below 25 when degradable nitrogen rich substrates such as livestock manure are used as feedstock however the mechanism behind the inhibited steady state is still unknown in the current study co digestion and recirculation were used to create a c n gradient in the influent to explore the relationship between substrates metabolites and microorganisms in the inhibited steady state data were collected at the macro microbial and genetic levels three cstrs were successfully made run into the inhibited steady state using influent c ns of 10 12 digestion performance levels of r10 r12 were low and stable transitioning from an aceticlastic methane producing pathway to a hydrogenotrophic pathway as the c n gradually decreased as the abundance of the hydrogenophilic methanogens increased the abundance of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob also increased the succession between populations of methanosaeta and methanosarcina may be used as a microbiological indicator of ammonia inhibition under high c ns cooperation among bacteria was high while under low c ns competition among bacteria was high these results clarify the processes underlying the inhibited steady state which is a condition often faced in actual large scale biogas facilities that use degradable nitrogen rich substrates

anaerobic digestion ad is widely used in many countries around the world as an effective way to reduce organic waste and produce clean energy lin et al 2018 ad can successfully treat wet waste containing less than 40 dry matter and offers significant advantages over other forms of livestock manure treatment ward et al 2008 however a bottleneck of livestock manure ad lies in this material s high nitrogen content derived mainly from urea uric acid and protein and low carbon to nitrogen c n ratios peng et al 2018 ammonia is the final product of the breakdown of nitrogen rich substrates and it tends to accumulate when there is a continuous inflow of degradable nitrogen rich feedstock and insufficient utilization by microorganisms mahdy et al 2020 excess ammonia is a well known inhibitor of ad leading to instability and inefficiency in the ad process capson tojo et al 2020 ammonia inhibition often causes the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas sun et al 2016 however the high concentration of ammonia also enhances the buffering capacity of the system thus resulting in a neutral ph even as vfas accumulate peng et al 2018 for this reason the ad system reaches an inhibited steady state where the reactor performance is low but stable therefore the inhibited steady state is the result of a slight degree of ammonia inhibition in this state both vfas and ammonia accumulate partially disturbing microbial metabolism li et al 2015 traditionally measurements of total ammonia nitrogen tan or free ammonia nitrogen fan have been used to predict ammonia inhibition dong et al 2019 however the toxicity of ammonia may vary widely making it difficult to rely on the absolute level of ammonia nitrogen as the sole determinant of ammonia inhibition for example yang et al 2018 reported that reactor performance decreases when the tan reaches 2 g l in contrast sun et al 2016 showed that ammonia inhibition does not occur when the tan concentration is less than 7 g l a more precise evaluation of ammonia inhibition may be obtained by collecting microbiological data for example methanogenic archaea are very sensitive to ammonia chen et al 2018 therefore it should be useful to investigate methanogenic archaea to aid in the evaluation of ammonia inhibition some methods can change the c n in the actual ad projects for example the co digestion of livestock manure with a carbon rich substrate such as agricultural residue has been used as a primary method to adjust c n ning et al 2019 recirculation is commonly practiced in china to reduce the volume of liquid discharge from biogas projects this practice also provides a means to change the influent c n because recirculation returns soluble carbon and nitrogen metabolites along with the liquid pezzolla et al 2017 generally maximum outputs of biogas and methane can be achieved when the c n is around 25 piatek et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the c n of livestock manure ranges from 9 to 16 as shown in fig s1 in supplementary materials and the inhibited steady state occurs in the range of 10 25 several articles have reported about the effects of c n on ad systems however these studies have often focused on the impacts of c n on biogas production and microbial community structure dai et al 2016 piątek et al 2016 ning et al 2019 little research has focused on the inhibited steady state which occupies a relatively narrow range in the c n scale especially lacking is information on how the various environmental factors mainly ammonia vfas ph and alkalinity and the microorganisms mainly bacteria and archaea in the ad system reach an equilibrium state compared to complete ammonia inhibition the inhibited steady state occurs more frequently in actual biogas projects thus clarifying the characteristics of this state will provide useful information for biogas plant operators such information will also lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of ammonia inhibition leading to the development of strategies to alleviate this problem second generation gene sequencing technology has allowed researchers to better describe microbial community structure in complex systems huo et al 2017 cai et al 2017 moreover new analytical tools and various sequence databases have facilitated the mining of large microbiome datasets for knowledge with specific biological significance for

microbial community huo et al 2017 song et al 2019 in this study the aforementioned bioinformatic tools were used to analyze the mechanism behind the inhibited steady state to reproduce the inhibited steady state the influent c n were adjusted from 10 to 50 by varying the co digestion and recirculation conditions in ten continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs reactor performance metabolites and microbial characteristics under different c ns were investigated to determine the microbial basis of the inhibited steady state the aims of this study are 1 to explore the relationships between c n intermediate metabolites and reactor performance during the inhibited steady state and 2 to analyze the structure of microbial communities during the inhibited steady state and relate this to reactor performance using bioinformatic tools 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum pig manure pm was collected from a farm at the china agricultural university cau located in zhuozhou china pm

2015 and the uniprot database http www uniprot org uniprot 3 results and discussion this section is organized as follows firstly the macro level data from the reactors fermentation parameters and metabolites are analyzed to investigate the characteristics that lead to the formation of the inhibited steady state secondly the microbial level data are summarized and discussed to investigate the microbial community structure in the inhibited steady state thirdly the correlation network and lefse analysis are combined to reveal the relationship between microbes and metabolites finally the genes of functional enzymes at different stages of anaerobic digestion are predicted to reveal the metabolic pathway of the inhibited steady state for each section data from well performing reactors were compared to those of reactors operating at an inhibited steady state 3 1 reactor performance and metabolite analysis in low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors ten cstrs were run with different influent c n which were adjusted by varying the straw to manure ratio and with without recirculation these reactors varied in their performance and included reactors performing at inhibited steady and well performing states the formation process and characteristics of the inhibited steady state were investigated by analyzing data of fermentation parameters and intermediates of the reactors and finding the statistical relationships between them 3 1 1 producing the inhibited steady state two independent variables consisting of substrate cs pm ratio and liquid digestate recirculation were used to produce the inhibited steady state pearson correlation analysis and ancova show that both the cs pm ratio and recirculation have significant impacts p 0 05 on influent c n different cs pm ratios result in different influent c n meanwhile recirculation may be considered as a form of co digestion using liquid digestate with substrates it changes the influent c n by returning soluble metabolites such as ammonia nitrogen source and vfas carbon source correlation analysis indicates that influent c n is more highly correlated to metabolites than substrate c n r and p values are in supplementary material table s1 therefore the influent c n which is the result of both cs pm and recirculation is more directly related to reactor performance for this reason the influent c n is considered the independent variable in the following discussion and the reactors names begin with r followed by influent c n for example the reactor named r10 means the influent c n is 10 in addition the cs pm ratio and recirculation status are added after the reactor name in the figures and tables or in their captions methane yield trends during the 70 days of reactor operation are shown in fig 1 among the ten cstrs seven produced methane consistently during all three hrts in reactors with relatively low influent c n r10 r11 and r12 the methane yield decreased gradually from the first to the third hrt and then maintained a low yield level without reaching zero therefore r10 r12 are considered as reactors that successfully reflect the inhibited steady state for reactors with relatively high influent c n r17 r22 and r25 the methane yield did not differ significantly p 0 05 throughout the hrts which means that these reactors were operating normally the methane yields of r09 r47 and r51 dropped to nearly zero within two htr indicating that the production of methane in these reactors was strongly inhibited for these three cstrs data other than methane yield are not presented in this paper 3 1 2 reactor performance and metabolite analysis the average concentrations of formic acid acetic acid propionic acid lactic acid butyric acid scod tan and fan within the cstrs at the third hrt are presented in fig 2 a alkalinity and ph are also presented because these parameters affect biological activities jantsch et al 2003 as the influent c n increased from 10 to 25 methane yield increased 6 0 fold from 35 8 3 4 ml gvs r10 to 213 4 9 3 ml gvs average of r17 r22 and r25 at the same time all organic acid and scod concentrations decreased the levels of acetic acid and butyric acid increased in r10 r11 r12 and r14 indicating that energy in the system is fixed in these reaction intermediates the incomplete conversion of intermediates and the inefficient production of methane in low c n reactors may be the result of the relatively high concentrations of tan which increase along with the increase in influent c n it has been reported that high tan concentration can block acetate metabolism which causes feedback inhibition of acetate generation ruiz sanchez et al 2019 as a result the upstream substances of acetate butyric acid and scod accumulated due to the decrease in acetate metabolism under high ammonia concentration the total acid concentrations of the low and high c n reactors differed by a factor of more than ten however the ph of all reactors ranged from 7 2 7 6 which is an appropriate range for methanogenic archaeal growth zhai et al 2015 the reason for the relatively stable ph is the synchronous change in alkalinity and tan which can buffer and neutralize acids the conversion of fan to nh4 thus lowering fan concentration was caused by the neutralization of tan and acids however fig 2a shows that the change in fan is not consistent with that of tan it has been reported that fan is more toxic than nh4 because fan can penetrate cell membranes and interfere with intracellular enzyme activity yang et al 2018 therefore two opposing actions occur simultaneously one is the increasing levels of tan and acids that aggravate the ammonia inhibition effect while the other is the neutralization of acids by tan which alleviates the ammonia inhibition effect the balance between these two actions explains the maintenance of a steady state in reactor performance rather than a continuous decline however stability in this case is not synonymous to good performance the inhibited steady state has often been mistaken as part of the normal operation in ad thus hindering the development of steps to improve reactor performance 3 1 3 correlation network of metabolites the correlation network between c n ratios metabolic intermediates and methane yield is presented in fig 2b the influent c n was determined by adjusting the cs pm ratio and recirculation the changes in the influent c n were significantly correlated with changes in tan r 0 924 p 0 05 and butyric acid levels r 0 903 p 0 05 however they were not significantly correlated to the changes in methane yield there were significant correlations between each of the five types of intermediates and between intermediates and methane yield r and p values are in supplementary materials the correlation network indicates that substrate composition produces different methane yields by changing the amounts and types of metabolic intermediates reactor ph and fan concentration were correlated with other parameters in a non linear manner thus the non linear changes in ph and fan can potentially warn against the development of the inhibited steady state in practice 3 2 microbial community structure in low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors 3 2 1 characteristics of bacteria and archaea at the genus level the 16s rrna genes of the microbial communities in the seven reactors operating at the third hrt were sequenced by high throughput sequencing resulting in a total of 414 386 useful sequences the sequences consisted of 813 bacterial and 63 archaeal otus of the bacterial otus 42 and 29 to firmicutes and bacteroidetes respectively and 88 of the archaeal otus belonged to euryarchaeota table 3 shows the abundance levels of bacteria and archaea in the low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors twenty one genera of bacteria and six genera of archaea were identified most of the bacteria belong to firmicutes and bacteroidetes which are the dominant taxa in most anaerobic digesters gu et al 2019 during the ad process bacteria are responsible for hydrolysis and acidification clostridium romboutsia ruminofilibacter ignatzschineria turicibacter ruminiclostridium and acholeplasma were the most abundant genera in this study clostridium romboutsia and ruminiclostridium are the member of the order clostridium previous research has identified certain clostridia as typical syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob zheng et al 2019 this means that some clostridia have a synergistic relationship with hydrogenotrophic methanogen by providing them with substrates h2 and co2 for methanogenesis furthermore some clostridia compete against methanosaeta for substrate therefore in the high c n reactors the abundance of clostridium decreases with increasing abundance of methanosaeta dong et al 2019 reported that ruminofilibacter is an important cellulose degrader in this study high c n treatments resulted in high proportions of ruminofilibacter and high methane yields which suggests that cellulose was efficiently degraded in the high c n reactors acholeplasma is another bacterium commonly found in various anaerobic reactors fischer et al 2019 reported that the abundance of acholeplasma increased as ammonia concentration increased at the same time its abundance positively correlated with the syntrophic acetate oxidation pathway ignatzschineria functions in the degradation of organic matter zhou et al 2013 however the abundance of ignatzschineria did not positively correlate with reactor performance in this study the methanogenic archaeal genera methanosaeta methanobacterium methanoculleus methanosphaera methanobrevibacter and methanosarcina had abundance levels greater than 1 methanosaeta is a typical aceticlastic methanogenic archaeon that generally dominates when digestion conditions are appropriate and there is no toxic stress tian et al 2018 in r14 r17 r22 and r25 methanosaeta comprised more than 50 of the archaea moreover these reactors also tended to produce more methane methanosarcina can utilize multiple substrates including h2 co2 acetic acid and other c1 compounds he et al 2019 the dominant methane producing pathway used by this archaeon mainly depends on the environmental conditions including toxic substance concentrations peng et al 2018 reported that methanosarcina has a limited capacity to utilize acetic acid under high tan concentrations although the influent c n of the r12 and r14 differ by only 1 2 the abundance of methanosarcina differs by a factor of 5 indicating that methanosarcina has high sensitivity and resistance to tan tan has often been used as an essential indicator for ammonia inhibition for example tan ranging from 1 to 12 g l may cause ammonia toxicity capson tojo et al 2020 however this range is too broad to be useful in practice instead of relying on tan concentration methanosarcina may be a potentially useful biological indicator for evaluating ammonia inhibition the succession from methanosaeta to methanosarcina under high ammonia nitrogen conditions was also reported by bonk et al 2018 methanobacterium methanoculleus and methanobrevibacter are hydrogenotrophic methanogens their relative abundance levels also increased as the influent c n decreased tan increased although they constituted a relatively small proportion of the community they were highly resistant to the toxicity of ammonia nitrogen similar to methanosarcina however these methanogens cannot serve as biological indicators of ammonia stress because they share similar functions and features their ability to resist high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen may stem from two properties first unlike the spherical methanosaeta the cells of hydrogenotrophic methanogen and methanosarcina are generally rod shaped or form chains and the resulting lower contact surface area tends to be more resistant to environmental stress second the cells of hydrogenotrophic methanogen sometimes form clusters that tend to protect the cells within the clusters from toxic substances 3 2 2 bacteria community composition and variation fig 3 shows that the phyla that constitute more than 5 of the bacteria in the reactors include firmicutes bacteroidetes cloacimonetes proteobacteria spirochaetes and acidobacteria similar phyla were reported in a previous study yang et al 2020 as the influent c n increased bacteroidetes gradually replaced firmicutes as the dominated phylum a similar trend was reported previously when different ammonium concentrations 7 3 and 0 g nh4 n l were imposed in a swine manure digester zhang et al 2018 the gradually shift from firmicutes to bacteroidetes may thus be attributed to the higher ammonia tolerance of firmicutes compared to bacteroidetes regardless of dominance both firmicutes and bacteroidetes perform the major work of degrading macromolecules into vfas and other soluble monomers during ad ma et al 2021 it is possible that the competition for substrates may determine which of the two phyla becomes dominant in high c n reactors bacteroidetes accounted for about 40 of the bacteria which is far lower than the 60 abundance of firmicutes in the low c n reactors among the bacteria with abundance levels of less than 5 increasing the influent c n also increased their total levels from 6 to 18 this means that at favorable c n values the richness of the bacterial community tends to be higher based on the alpha diversity indexes fig 3b the seven reactors can be divided into three groups namely the low c n group r10 r11 and r12 the high c n group r17 r25 and the transitional group r14 the chao shannon and simpson evenness indexes show that the richness diversity and evenness of the bacterial communities in the low c n group were significantly lower than those in the high c n group by combining alpha diversity data with those on reactor performance it can be seen that the bacterial community with the higher abundance diversity and uniformity contributes to more efficient methane production cai et al 2017 also highlighted this point in their previous paper based on beta diversity analysis fig 3c the low c n r10 r11 and r12 and high c n r17 r22 and r25 groups form the same clusters based on sequence analysis the bacterial community structure of the transitional group r14 is clustered with the low c n treatments meanwhile pcoa shows that coordinate 1 and coordinate 2 explain 64 63 and 17 97 of bacterial community variation respectively as the c n increases the bacterial community s value in the direction of the abscissa gradually decreases the low c n group has a positive value the transitional treatment r14 has a value of 0 and the high c n group has a negative value this means that the low and high c n groups differ markedly in their bacterial communities the differing bacterial community structures are probably the result of different influent compositions influencing the communities to evolve in entirely different directions combined with findings on the different reactor performances between high and low c n reactors the overall results indicate that the effect of influent composition on bacterial communities is caused by interactions among microbes intermediate metabolites and the micro environment 3 2 3 archaea community composition and variation euryarchaeota was the dominant archaea in each digestion system fig 4 three other phyla of archaea were also detected namely crenarchaeota nanoarchaeaeota and diapherotrites as well as 0 8 of unclassified archaea interestingly although the methanogenic archaea generally belong to the euryarchaeota the abundance of the euryarchaeota in the high c n group with higher methane yield is lower than that in the high c n group with suppressed methanogenesis as the c n increased the abundance levels of crenarchaeota and nanoarchaeaeota increased accounting for 34 and 36 of the archaeal communities in r22 and r25 respectively the alpha diversity indexes chao and shannon of archaeal communities are usually much lower than those of bacterial communities indicating that the richness and diversity of archaeal communities are lower than those of bacterial communities chen et al 2020 in this study the chao and shannon indexes of the archaeal community of the low and high c n treatments did not differ significantly the shannon index of r17 the reactor with the highest methane yield is the lowest indicating that the diversity of the archaeal community in r17 is the lowest this may be due to the high degree of redundancy in the methanogenic function among archaea enabling one group to replace another therefore low archaeal diversity has better methane production performance the range of values for the archaeal simpsoneven index is similar to that of bacterial communities fig 4c however the trend is opposite to that of bacteria the simpsoneven index of the archaeal community in the high c n group is significantly lower than that in the low c n group indicating that the uniformity of the archaeal community increases as the c n decreases beta diversity analysis grouped the archaeal communities of the high and low c n groups into two clusters however unlike the bacterial community r14 is clustered with the high c n group which means that methanogenic archaea are the first to responds to gradually increasing ammonia concentrations thus methanogenic archaea may be more sensitive to ammonia than bacteria chen et al 2018 luo et al 2020 this implies that members of the methanogenic archaea have the potential to be biological indicators of ammonia inhibition chen et al 2018 the transitional state of the microbial community of r14 combining a less diverse bacterial community with ammonia inhibition and a diverse archaeal community without ammonia inhibition reflects the metabolites present in the reactor that is high concentrations of acetic acid and butyric acid and a relatively high methane yield pcoa shows that the first coordinate axis accounts for 82 02 of the archaeal community variation the data points for the high and low c n treatments are located on the positive and negative sides of the axis origin indicating that the difference between the two groups is considerable 3 3 microbial correlation network in low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors 3 3 1 combination of correlation network analysis and lefse analysis in recent years network analysis has been widely used for microbial sequencing data kuypers et al 2018 martin et al 2020 the microbial data from seven reactors were integrated then pearson correlation analysis was performed at the genus level the relationship network between bacteria and archaea was constructed based on the absolute value of r pearson correlation coefficient when the absolute value of r is greater than 0 9 and the p value is less than 0 05 between two genera then the relationship appears in the network supplementary material fig s2 when the r value is greater than 0 9 the color of the connecting line is red indicating that the two genera are positively correlated based on abundance and are likely to have a synergistic relationship miao et al 2019 when the r value is less than 0 9 the line is green indicating a negative correlation between the two connected genera which may have a competitive relationship linear discriminant analysis lda is a tool that used to compare the microbial gene abundance levels in the low and high c n groups the tool finds microbial taxa at each level of the evolutionary branch that differ enough to be used as markers lefse supplementary material fig s3 the evolutionary branch diagram shows distinct successions of bacteria and archaea in the different treatments significant differences were found at the phylum level firmicutes is a marker phylum at low c n bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi spirochaetes and synergistetes are the marker bacterial phyla at high c n among the archaea euryarchaeota is marker taxon under low c n while methanosaeta and methanoregula are marker taxa in the high c n group crenarchaeota and nanoarchaeaeota which are non methanogenic are also marker taxa of the high c n group fig 5 was draw by combining figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material the gray shading shows the modules formed by gephi software s modular analysis of the correlation network the modules are named m1 m9 based on their size the iconic microbial community found in the lefse analysis is marked by blue for low c n marker taxa and red for high c n marker taxa and the numbers in the network diagram are used to mark the microbial marker taxa in the lefse evolution branch diagram the marker taxa in the high c n group mainly appear in m1 and m3 while the marker taxa in the low c n group mostly appear in m2 and m4 this shows that modules m1 and m3 and modules m2 and m4 consist mainly of microbial groups that play roles under high and low c n respectively m1 and m3 contain the most types and numbers of microorganisms that form a network of closely related bacteria bacteroidetes fibrobacteria chloroflexi synergistetes spirochaetes and actinobacteria and archaea crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota m2 contains only firmicutes cloacimonetes and euryarchaeota within the firmicutes clostridium sensu stricto 1 which is a member of the genus clostridium is the most connected taxon in the entire network herman et al 2017 reported that clostridium produces amylase and is highly resistant to stress methanosarcina which is the most connected archaeon is also in m2 its spherical cells are highly resistant to stress and thus it adapts to a variety of complex digestion conditions li et al 2015 in addition to clostridium and methanosarcina olsenella in m1 is also well connected to other microorganisms olsenella can utilize lactic acid and it participates in acidogenesis during ad orive et al 2016 the connections in m4 is chain shaped the microorganisms in this module are related only to the neighboring microorganisms including the three methanogenic archaea methanobacterium methanoculleus obligate h2 utilizing methanogen and rumen m2 methyl compound utilizing methanogen although the connections in module m4 are not as tight as in modules m1 and m3 the module contains a variety of methane producing pathways importantly the microbial community in the low c n reactor tends to have few types of hydrolytic and acidifying bacteria while the stress resistant groups are enriched in addition these reactors have multiple methanogenic pathways that function simultaneously at low c n multiple competitive relationships are the main driving factors that inhibit reactor performance in contrast the high c n treatments tend to support numerous types of hydrolytic and acidifying bacteria bacteria in these reactors tend to have cooperative relationships furthermore non methanogenic archaea occupy an essential position in the microbial communities of these reactors 3 3 2 relationship between metabolites and microorganisms belonging to different network modules fig 6 shows the relationship between the types and numbers of microorganisms in each module and environmental factors bacteria in the same phylum do not necessarily respond to environmental factors in the same way for example in the bacteroidetes ruminofilibacter and rikenellaceae rc9 gut group are enriched in the low c n group while dmer64 bacteroides and roseimarinus are enriched in the high c n group it should be noted that both of rikenellaceae rc9 gut group and dmer64 belong to the rikenellaceae similarly within the firmicutes ruminiclostridium terrisporobacter and romboutsia are more abundant in the low c n group while christensenellaceae and syntrophomonas are more abundant in the high c n group genetically related bacteria may become adapted to very different environmental conditions which explains the observations above furthermore different substrates will enrich for different groups of bacteria the archaea are also subject to the same type of environmental effect for example both methanosarcina and methanosaeta belong to the methanosarcinales but their abundance levels are considerably different in the low and high c n experimental groups the results of lefse analysis show that certain microbial marker taxa are not dominant there are nine marker taxa in the low c n treatments among the six bacterial genera that make up these marker taxa fig 6a 2 1 w27 2 2 romboutsia 2 3 ruminiclostridium 2 7 clostridium 4 3 acholeplasma 4 5ignatzschineria clostridium sensu stricto 1 account for 19 2 25 1 of the bacteria in this group and is the dominant taxon meanwhile the minor taxa ruminiclostridium and acholeplasma account for only 3 6 and 2 0 respectively of the bacteria in this group the remaining three marker taxa are archaeal genera fig 6b 2 4 methanosphaera 2 5 methanobrevibacter and 2 6 methanosarcina methanosarcina the dominant methanogen accounts for 32 1 49 7 of the archaea in the low c n group while methanobrevibacter accounts for only 3 4 in the high c n group there are a total of twelve marker taxa among the eight bacterial genera fig 6a 1 1 olsenella 1 2 bacteroidetes 1 5 prolixibacteraceae 3 1 dmer64 3 2 synergistaceae 3 5 treponema 2 3 7 lnr a2 18 and 7 2 smithella dmer64 a member of the rikenellaceae accounts for 11 5 of total bacteria the relative abundance levels of the remaining seven bacterial genera account for less than 5 of the bacteria the remaining marker taxa are four archaeal genera fig 6b 1 6 methanoregula 1 9 bathyarchaeia 3 8 aenigmarchae and 9 1 methanosaeta methanosaeta accounts for 51 8 83 4 of the total archaea is by far the most dominant archaeon meanwhile methanoregula accounts for less than 1 of the archaea these results demonstrate that some microbial marker taxa are not abundant and therefore may be easily overlooked however the succession of marker taxa within microbial communities is an indicator of the reactor s status information on such taxa will enable operators to make timely reactor interventions however more research on those marker taxa which tend to be sensitive to environmental changes is needed the modules m1 m9 formed from the correlation network are also related to specific environmental factors microorganisms in the same module tend to have similar responses to environmental factors for example among the eleven genera in m1 eight are significantly positively correlated with the c n indicating that influent composition is the most critical factor affecting the abundances of these genera in m1 m1 contains bacteroidetes vadinha17 and prolixibacteraceae of the bacteroidales which are known to degrade organic macromolecules and it also contains olsenella which uses carbohydrates to produce organic acids m1 also includes two methanogenic archaea belonging to the methanomicrobiales which are known to produce methane by metabolizing h2 co2 formate and alcohol demirel and scherer 2008 of the eight genera in m2 only w27 is related to c n while five of the genera are significantly related to the concentrations of butyric acid and ammonia two genera ruminiclostridium and clostridium belong to clostridiales and are significantly positively correlated with five intermediate metabolites scod ammonia acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid these genera are known to decompose carbohydrates to butyric acid produce spores and are generally highly resistant to stress including high tan concentration m2 includes romboutsia and ruminiclostridium which can degrade xylan clostridium which can produce amylase and terrisporobacter which can metabolize glucose into acetic acid m2 also includes methanosphaera methanobrevibacter and methanosarcina the former two of which metabolize h2 co2 and c1 compounds demirel and scherer 2008 while the latter can use a variety of substrates for methanogenesis among the nine genera in m3 four are significantly negatively correlated to butyric acid among the nine genera in m4 none are significantly correlated to c n status although they are related to acetic acid and propionic acid m5 m6 and m7 showed no sensitivity to environmental factors christensenellaceae r 7 group the predominant microorganism in m8 and known to produce acetic acid and butyric acid is negatively correlated to propionic acid and ammonia m9 consists mostly of methanosaeta which utilizes acetic acid to produce methane karakashev et al 2005 and is inversely related to scod although m8 and m9 each contain only a single member of the community they are positively correlated with methane yield indicating that they are groups that are functionally relevant to methane production 3 4 genes encoding enzymes and methanogenic pathway in low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors fig 7 shows the abundance of genes encoding enzyme associated with ad hydrolysis and acidification are the two vital stages in ad carried out primarily by bacteria fang et al 2015 sixteen critical bacterial enzymes that related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism were selected seven of which are related to the hydrolysis stage among the seven endoglucanase and xylanase levels are higher in the low c n group than in the high c n group which indicates that lignocellulose degrading bacteria are more resistant to ammonia in the environment lignocellulose degrading bacteria generally belong to clostridium and romboutsia which were highly abundant in low c n group r10 r12 in table 3 the starch phosphorylase beta galactosidase and alpha glucosidase are more abundant in the high c n group in the sugar degradation pathway the level of transketolase the key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway washburn et al 2019 is higher in the high c n group meanwhile the level of pyruvate kinase an enzyme of the glycolysis pathway angiari et al 2020 is higher in the low c n treatments formate acetyltransferase is involved in formate production while acetaldehyde dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetate kinase are involved in the production and activation of acetic acid fang et al 2015 the levels of genes encoding these enzymes are higher in the low c n group compared to the high c n groups similarly the level of acetyl coa reductase which synthesizes butyric acid is also high in the low c n treatments suggesting that more butyric acid is produced in the low c n group the high abundance levels of the five aforementioned enzyme genes under low c n conditions means that the bacteria responsible for acidification are highly resistant to ammonia mahdy et al 2020 the abundance levels of carbamoyl phosphate synthase and glutamine synthetase which are related to ammonia consumption are lower in the low c n group indicating that the ammonia consumption in the low c n group was reduced methanogenesis the last stage of ad is carried out by archaea fang et al 2015 the h2 co2 and aceticlastic pathways are the main methane producing pathways the gene for the beta subunit of coenzyme f420 hydrogenase of the h2 co2 methanogenesis pathway is more abundant in the low c n group which means the h2 co2 methanogenesis pathway is the dominant methane producing pathway in the low c n group ferredoxin and methyltransferase are involved in both methane producing pathways and are highly abundant in the high c n group which is reflected by the total methane production in the high c n group acetyl coa is a specific enzyme of the aceticlastic pathways and the gene encoding this enzyme is more abundant in the high c n group this means that the aceticlastic pathway is the main methane producing pathway in high c n groups 4 conclusion the inhibited steady state was successfully reproduced by changing the substrate composition and recirculation regime to adjust the influent c n within the range of 10 14 there was a clear transition between methanosaeta and methanosarcina as the influent c n changed and this succession may be used as a biological indicator of ammonia inhibition the results suggest that as the influent c n gradually decreases the aceticlastic pathway is gradually replaced by the hydrogenotrophic pathway simultaneously the levels of saob such as clostridium increases along with that of hydrogenophilic methanogens meanwhile as the increasing c n causes the abundance diversity and uniformity of bacteria to increase while the uniformity of archaea decreases well performing high c n and inhibited steady state low c n reactors are characterized by different marker taxa furthermore the degree of cooperation among microorganism is high in the well performing reactors while the degree of competition is high in the reactors under inhibited steady state the new information about the inhibited steady state will be helpful because it provides an early warning of ammonia inhibition thus allowing operators to develop strategies for mitigating ammonia inhibition

17398,the carbon nitrogen ratio c n is a key parameter that affects the performance of anaerobic digestion ad recent ad research has focused on optimizing the c n of feedstock the so called inhibited steady state refers to a special state of ammonia inhibition of ad that often occurs at low c n below 25 when degradable nitrogen rich substrates such as livestock manure are used as feedstock however the mechanism behind the inhibited steady state is still unknown in the current study co digestion and recirculation were used to create a c n gradient in the influent to explore the relationship between substrates metabolites and microorganisms in the inhibited steady state data were collected at the macro microbial and genetic levels three cstrs were successfully made run into the inhibited steady state using influent c ns of 10 12 digestion performance levels of r10 r12 were low and stable transitioning from an aceticlastic methane producing pathway to a hydrogenotrophic pathway as the c n gradually decreased as the abundance of the hydrogenophilic methanogens increased the abundance of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob also increased the succession between populations of methanosaeta and methanosarcina may be used as a microbiological indicator of ammonia inhibition under high c ns cooperation among bacteria was high while under low c ns competition among bacteria was high these results clarify the processes underlying the inhibited steady state which is a condition often faced in actual large scale biogas facilities that use degradable nitrogen rich substrates

anaerobic digestion ad is widely used in many countries around the world as an effective way to reduce organic waste and produce clean energy lin et al 2018 ad can successfully treat wet waste containing less than 40 dry matter and offers significant advantages over other forms of livestock manure treatment ward et al 2008 however a bottleneck of livestock manure ad lies in this material s high nitrogen content derived mainly from urea uric acid and protein and low carbon to nitrogen c n ratios peng et al 2018 ammonia is the final product of the breakdown of nitrogen rich substrates and it tends to accumulate when there is a continuous inflow of degradable nitrogen rich feedstock and insufficient utilization by microorganisms mahdy et al 2020 excess ammonia is a well known inhibitor of ad leading to instability and inefficiency in the ad process capson tojo et al 2020 ammonia inhibition often causes the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas sun et al 2016 however the high concentration of ammonia also enhances the buffering capacity of the system thus resulting in a neutral ph even as vfas accumulate peng et al 2018 for this reason the ad system reaches an inhibited steady state where the reactor performance is low but stable therefore the inhibited steady state is the result of a slight degree of ammonia inhibition in this state both vfas and ammonia accumulate partially disturbing microbial metabolism li et al 2015 traditionally measurements of total ammonia nitrogen tan or free ammonia nitrogen fan have been used to predict ammonia inhibition dong et al 2019 however the toxicity of ammonia may vary widely making it difficult to rely on the absolute level of ammonia nitrogen as the sole determinant of ammonia inhibition for example yang et al 2018 reported that reactor performance decreases when the tan reaches 2 g l in contrast sun et al 2016 showed that ammonia inhibition does not occur when the tan concentration is less than 7 g l a more precise evaluation of ammonia inhibition may be obtained by collecting microbiological data for example methanogenic archaea are very sensitive to ammonia chen et al 2018 therefore it should be useful to investigate methanogenic archaea to aid in the evaluation of ammonia inhibition some methods can change the c n in the actual ad projects for example the co digestion of livestock manure with a carbon rich substrate such as agricultural residue has been used as a primary method to adjust c n ning et al 2019 recirculation is commonly practiced in china to reduce the volume of liquid discharge from biogas projects this practice also provides a means to change the influent c n because recirculation returns soluble carbon and nitrogen metabolites along with the liquid pezzolla et al 2017 generally maximum outputs of biogas and methane can be achieved when the c n is around 25 piatek et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the c n of livestock manure ranges from 9 to 16 as shown in fig s1 in supplementary materials and the inhibited steady state occurs in the range of 10 25 several articles have reported about the effects of c n on ad systems however these studies have often focused on the impacts of c n on biogas production and microbial community structure dai et al 2016 piątek et al 2016 ning et al 2019 little research has focused on the inhibited steady state which occupies a relatively narrow range in the c n scale especially lacking is information on how the various environmental factors mainly ammonia vfas ph and alkalinity and the microorganisms mainly bacteria and archaea in the ad system reach an equilibrium state compared to complete ammonia inhibition the inhibited steady state occurs more frequently in actual biogas projects thus clarifying the characteristics of this state will provide useful information for biogas plant operators such information will also lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of ammonia inhibition leading to the development of strategies to alleviate this problem second generation gene sequencing technology has allowed researchers to better describe microbial community structure in complex systems huo et al 2017 cai et al 2017 moreover new analytical tools and various sequence databases have facilitated the mining of large microbiome datasets for knowledge with specific biological significance for example linear discriminant analysis lda can identify microorganisms with significantly different levels of abundance zhou et al 2019 lda effect size lefse analysis can identify potential biomarkers that can differentiate between different groups microbial network analysis uses co occurrence or correlation to connect between microorganisms within a network to show the relationships between species and identify keystone taxa that drive community composition and function banerjee et al 2018 gu et al 2019 the tax4fun software package can predict the functional pathways and critical enzymes of a system using functional annotation based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway databases this tool analyzes the metabolic diversity of a system without looking at the microbial community huo et al 2017 song et al 2019 in this study the aforementioned bioinformatic tools were used to analyze the mechanism behind the inhibited steady state to reproduce the inhibited steady state the influent c n were adjusted from 10 to 50 by varying the co digestion and recirculation conditions in ten continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs reactor performance metabolites and microbial characteristics under different c ns were investigated to determine the microbial basis of the inhibited steady state the aims of this study are 1 to explore the relationships between c n intermediate metabolites and reactor performance during the inhibited steady state and 2 to analyze the structure of microbial communities during the inhibited steady state and relate this to reactor performance using bioinformatic tools 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum pig manure pm was collected from a farm at the china agricultural university cau located in zhuozhou china pm was stored in a sealed 30 l barrel at room temperature 20 25 c the pm was completely stirred before it was fed to the cstrs every day corn stover cs was collected from a cau experimental station located in shangzhuang beijing the cs was ground using a high speed pulverizer fw100 taisite tianjin china and then stored at room temperature 20 25 c the inoculum for the experimental reactors originated from the digestate of a 65 l cstr that had been operating using rice straw and cow manure at 37 c for more than two months the characteristics of the pm cs and inoculum are listed in table 1 2 2 reactor setup and sampling ten cstrs with a 5 0 l working volume were operated in a walk in thermostatic incubation room at 37 c reactors were started up by adding 5 0 l of inoculum and then discharged and fed once a day the different digestion conditions established in each of the ten cstrs are shown in table 2 the influent c ns ranging from 9 4 to 50 7 were designed to simultaneously run and compare the inhibited steady state to well performing reactors the influent c n was adjusted using different substrate cs pm ratios 0 4 1 3 1 1 3 1 and 4 0 vs basis and with without liquid digestate recirculation recirculation refers to the use of the liquid fraction of the effluent in place of dilution water in the influent the effluent solids were separated by centrifugation for 5 min

measuring the gas volume and composition reactors with biogas production levels of less than 100 ml for three consecutive days were considered as failed and terminated after 50 days of operation 10 ml

were collected to extract dna and other microbiological analysis day 60 was chosen because 1 this was the mid point of the time period for collecting data of physical and chemical parameters and 2 most of reactors were in a steady state of methane production thus the microbial community structure at this time was considered representative 2 3 physical and chemical analyses the biogas volume was

lefse uses lda to measure the effect of the abundance of microbial taxa at different taxonomic levels and to determine the taxa that differ significantly in abundance p value 0 05 between high and low c n groups 2 5 4 genetic function analysis functional pathways and critical enzymes were predicted from 16s rrna gene sequences using tax4fun software package that provides functional annotations based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway databases asshauer et al 2015 information on enzymes that are most relevant at different digestion stages was derived from fang et al 2015 and the uniprot database http www uniprot org uniprot 3 results and discussion this section is organized as follows firstly the macro level data from the reactors fermentation parameters and metabolites are analyzed to investigate the characteristics that lead to the formation of the inhibited steady state secondly the microbial level data are summarized and discussed to investigate the microbial community structure in the inhibited steady state thirdly the correlation network and lefse analysis are combined to reveal the relationship between microbes and metabolites finally the genes of functional enzymes at different stages of anaerobic digestion are predicted to reveal the metabolic pathway of the inhibited steady state for each section data from well performing reactors were compared to those of reactors operating at an inhibited steady state 3 1 reactor performance and metabolite analysis in low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors ten cstrs were run with different influent c n which were adjusted by varying the straw to manure ratio and with without recirculation these reactors varied in their performance and included reactors performing at inhibited steady and well performing states the formation process and characteristics of the inhibited steady state were investigated by analyzing data of fermentation parameters and intermediates of the reactors and finding the statistical relationships between them 3 1 1 producing the inhibited steady state two independent variables consisting of substrate cs pm ratio and liquid digestate recirculation were used to produce the inhibited steady state pearson correlation analysis and ancova show that both the cs pm ratio and recirculation have significant impacts p 0 05 on influent c n different cs pm ratios result in different influent c n meanwhile recirculation may be considered as a form of co digestion using liquid digestate with substrates it changes the influent c n by returning soluble metabolites such as ammonia nitrogen source and vfas carbon source correlation analysis indicates that influent c n is more highly correlated to metabolites than substrate c n r and p values are in supplementary material table s1 therefore the influent c n which is the result of both cs pm and recirculation is more directly related to reactor performance for this reason the influent c n is considered the independent variable in the following discussion and the reactors names begin with r followed by influent c n for example the reactor named r10 means the influent c n is 10 in addition the cs pm ratio and recirculation status are added after the reactor name in the figures and tables or in their captions methane yield trends during the 70 days of reactor operation are shown in fig 1 among the ten cstrs seven produced methane consistently during all three hrts in reactors with relatively low influent c n r10 r11 and r12 the methane yield decreased gradually from the first to the third hrt and then maintained a low yield level without reaching zero therefore r10 r12 are considered as reactors that successfully reflect the inhibited steady state for reactors with relatively high influent c n r17 r22 and r25 the methane yield did not differ significantly p 0 05 throughout the hrts which means that these reactors were operating normally the methane yields of r09 r47 and r51 dropped to nearly zero within two htr indicating that the production of methane in these reactors was strongly inhibited for these three cstrs data other than methane yield are not presented in this paper 3 1 2 reactor performance and metabolite analysis the average concentrations of formic acid acetic acid propionic acid lactic acid butyric acid scod tan and fan within the cstrs at the third hrt are presented in fig 2 a alkalinity and ph are also presented because these parameters affect biological activities jantsch et al 2003 as the influent c n increased from 10 to 25 methane yield increased 6 0 fold from 35 8 3 4 ml gvs r10 to 213 4 9 3 ml gvs average of r17 r22 and r25 at the same time all organic acid and scod concentrations decreased the levels of acetic acid and butyric acid increased in r10 r11 r12 and r14 indicating that energy in the system is fixed in these reaction intermediates the incomplete conversion of intermediates and the inefficient production of methane in low c n reactors may be the result of the relatively high concentrations of tan which increase along with the increase in influent c n it has been reported that high tan concentration can block acetate metabolism which causes feedback inhibition of acetate generation ruiz sanchez et al 2019 as a result the upstream substances of acetate butyric acid and scod accumulated due to the decrease in acetate metabolism under high ammonia concentration the total acid concentrations of the low and high c n reactors differed by a factor of more than ten however the ph of all reactors ranged from 7 2 7 6 which is an appropriate range for methanogenic archaeal growth zhai et al 2015 the reason for the relatively stable ph is the synchronous change in alkalinity and tan which can buffer and neutralize acids the conversion of fan to nh4 thus lowering fan concentration was caused by the neutralization of tan and acids however fig 2a shows that the change in fan is not consistent with that of tan it has been reported that fan is more toxic than nh4 because fan can penetrate cell membranes and interfere with intracellular enzyme activity yang et al 2018 therefore two opposing actions occur simultaneously one is the increasing levels of tan and acids that aggravate the ammonia inhibition effect while the other is the neutralization of acids by tan which alleviates the ammonia inhibition effect the balance between these two actions explains the maintenance of a steady state in reactor performance rather than a continuous decline however stability in this case is not synonymous to good performance the inhibited steady state has often been mistaken as part of the normal operation in ad thus hindering the development of steps to improve reactor performance 3 1 3 correlation network of metabolites the correlation network between c n ratios metabolic intermediates and methane yield is presented in fig 2b the influent c n was determined by adjusting the cs pm ratio and recirculation the changes in the influent c n were significantly correlated with changes in tan r 0 924 p 0 05 and butyric acid levels r 0 903 p 0 05 however they were not significantly correlated to the changes in methane yield there were significant correlations between each of the five types of intermediates and between intermediates and methane yield r and p values are in supplementary materials the correlation network indicates that substrate composition produces different methane yields by changing the amounts and types of metabolic intermediates reactor ph and fan concentration were correlated with other parameters in a non linear manner thus the non linear changes in ph and fan can potentially warn against the development of the inhibited steady state in practice 3 2 microbial community structure in low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors 3 2 1 characteristics of bacteria and archaea at the genus level the 16s rrna genes of the microbial communities in the seven reactors operating at the third hrt were sequenced by high throughput sequencing resulting in a total of 414 386 useful sequences the sequences consisted of 813 bacterial and 63 archaeal otus of the bacterial otus 42 and 29 to firmicutes and bacteroidetes respectively and 88 of the archaeal otus belonged to euryarchaeota table 3 shows the abundance levels of bacteria and archaea in the low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors twenty one genera of bacteria and six genera of archaea were identified most of the bacteria belong to firmicutes and bacteroidetes which are the dominant taxa in most anaerobic digesters gu et al 2019 during the ad process bacteria are responsible for hydrolysis and acidification clostridium romboutsia ruminofilibacter ignatzschineria turicibacter ruminiclostridium and acholeplasma were the most abundant genera in this study clostridium romboutsia and ruminiclostridium are the member of the order clostridium previous research has identified certain clostridia as typical syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob zheng et al 2019 this means that some clostridia have a synergistic relationship with hydrogenotrophic methanogen by providing them with substrates h2 and co2 for methanogenesis furthermore some clostridia compete against methanosaeta for substrate therefore in the high c n reactors the abundance of clostridium decreases with increasing abundance of methanosaeta dong et al 2019 reported that ruminofilibacter is an important cellulose degrader in this study high c n treatments resulted in high proportions of ruminofilibacter and high methane yields which suggests that cellulose was efficiently degraded in the high c n reactors acholeplasma is another bacterium commonly found in various anaerobic reactors fischer et al 2019 reported that the abundance of acholeplasma increased as ammonia concentration increased at the same time its abundance positively correlated with the syntrophic acetate oxidation pathway ignatzschineria functions in the degradation of organic matter zhou et al 2013 however the abundance of ignatzschineria did not positively correlate with reactor performance in this study the methanogenic archaeal genera methanosaeta methanobacterium methanoculleus methanosphaera methanobrevibacter and methanosarcina had abundance levels greater than 1 methanosaeta is a typical aceticlastic methanogenic archaeon that generally dominates when digestion conditions are appropriate and there is no toxic stress tian et al 2018 in r14 r17 r22 and r25 methanosaeta comprised more than 50 of the archaea moreover these reactors also tended to produce more methane methanosarcina can utilize multiple substrates including h2 co2 acetic acid and other c1 compounds he et al 2019 the dominant methane producing pathway used by this archaeon mainly depends on the environmental conditions including toxic substance concentrations peng et al 2018 reported that methanosarcina has a limited capacity to utilize acetic acid under high tan concentrations although the influent c n of the r12 and r14 differ by only 1 2 the abundance of methanosarcina differs by a factor of 5 indicating that methanosarcina has high sensitivity and resistance to tan tan has often been used as an essential indicator for ammonia inhibition for example tan ranging from 1 to 12 g l may cause ammonia toxicity capson tojo et al 2020 however this range is too broad to be useful in practice instead of relying on tan concentration methanosarcina may be a potentially useful biological indicator for evaluating ammonia inhibition the succession from methanosaeta to methanosarcina under high ammonia nitrogen conditions was also reported by bonk et al 2018 methanobacterium methanoculleus and methanobrevibacter are hydrogenotrophic methanogens their relative abundance levels also increased as the influent c n decreased tan increased although they constituted a relatively small proportion of the community they were highly resistant to the toxicity of ammonia nitrogen similar to methanosarcina however these methanogens cannot serve as biological indicators of ammonia stress because they share similar functions and features their ability to resist high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen may stem from two properties first unlike the spherical methanosaeta the cells of hydrogenotrophic methanogen and methanosarcina are generally rod shaped or form chains and the resulting lower contact surface area tends to be more resistant to environmental stress second the cells of hydrogenotrophic methanogen sometimes form clusters that tend to protect the cells within the clusters from toxic substances 3 2 2 bacteria community composition and variation fig 3 shows that the phyla that constitute more than 5 of the bacteria in the reactors include firmicutes bacteroidetes cloacimonetes proteobacteria spirochaetes and acidobacteria similar phyla were reported in a previous study yang et al 2020 as the influent c n increased bacteroidetes gradually replaced firmicutes as the dominated phylum a similar trend was reported previously when different ammonium concentrations 7 3 and 0 g nh4 n l were imposed in a swine manure digester zhang et al 2018 the gradually shift from firmicutes to bacteroidetes may thus be attributed to the higher ammonia tolerance of firmicutes compared to bacteroidetes regardless of dominance both firmicutes and bacteroidetes perform the major work of degrading macromolecules into vfas and other soluble monomers during ad ma et al 2021 it is possible that the competition for substrates may determine which of the two phyla becomes dominant in high c n reactors bacteroidetes accounted for about 40 of the bacteria which is far lower than the 60 abundance of firmicutes in the low c n reactors among the bacteria with abundance levels of less than 5 increasing the influent c n also increased their total levels from 6 to 18 this means that at favorable c n values the richness of the bacterial community tends to be higher based on the alpha diversity indexes fig 3b the seven reactors can be divided into three groups namely the low c n group r10 r11 and r12 the high c n group r17 r25 and the transitional group r14 the chao shannon and simpson evenness indexes show that the richness diversity and evenness of the bacterial communities in the low c n group were significantly lower than those in the high c n group by combining alpha diversity data with those on reactor performance it can be seen that the bacterial community with the higher abundance diversity and uniformity contributes to more efficient methane production cai et al 2017 also highlighted this point in their previous paper based on beta diversity analysis fig 3c the low c n r10 r11 and r12 and high c n r17 r22 and r25 groups form the same clusters based on sequence analysis the bacterial community structure of the transitional group r14 is clustered with the low c n treatments meanwhile pcoa shows that coordinate 1 and coordinate 2 explain 64 63 and 17 97 of bacterial community variation respectively as the c n increases the bacterial community s value in the direction of the abscissa gradually decreases the low c n group has a positive value the transitional treatment r14 has a value of 0 and the high c n group has a negative value this means that the low and high c n groups differ markedly in their bacterial communities the differing bacterial community structures are probably the result of different influent compositions influencing the communities to evolve in entirely different directions combined with findings on the different reactor performances between high and low c n reactors the overall results indicate that the effect of influent composition on bacterial communities is caused by interactions among microbes intermediate metabolites and the micro environment 3 2 3 archaea community composition and variation euryarchaeota was the dominant archaea in each digestion system fig 4 three other phyla of archaea were also detected namely crenarchaeota nanoarchaeaeota and diapherotrites as well as 0 8 of unclassified archaea interestingly although the methanogenic archaea generally belong to the euryarchaeota the abundance of the euryarchaeota in the high c n group with higher methane yield is lower than that in the high c n group with suppressed methanogenesis as the c n increased the abundance levels of crenarchaeota and nanoarchaeaeota increased accounting for 34 and 36 of the archaeal communities in r22 and r25 respectively the alpha diversity indexes chao and shannon of archaeal communities are usually much lower than those of bacterial communities indicating that the richness and diversity of archaeal communities are lower than those of bacterial communities chen et al 2020 in this study the chao and shannon indexes of the archaeal community of the low and high c n treatments did not differ significantly the shannon index of r17 the reactor with the highest methane yield is the lowest indicating that the diversity of the archaeal community in r17 is the lowest this may be due to the high degree of redundancy in the methanogenic function among archaea enabling one group to replace another therefore low archaeal diversity has better methane production performance the range of values for the archaeal simpsoneven index is similar to that of bacterial communities fig 4c however the trend is opposite to that of bacteria the simpsoneven index of the archaeal community in the high c n group is significantly lower than that in the low c n group indicating that the uniformity of the archaeal community increases as the c n decreases beta diversity analysis grouped the archaeal communities of the high and low c n groups into two clusters however unlike the bacterial community r14 is clustered with the high c n group which means that methanogenic archaea are the first to responds to gradually increasing ammonia concentrations thus methanogenic archaea may be more sensitive to ammonia than bacteria chen et al 2018 luo et al 2020 this implies that members of the methanogenic archaea have the potential to be biological indicators of ammonia inhibition chen et al 2018 the transitional state of the microbial community of r14 combining a less diverse bacterial community with ammonia inhibition and a diverse archaeal community without ammonia inhibition reflects the metabolites present in the reactor that is high concentrations of acetic acid and butyric acid and a relatively high methane yield pcoa shows that the first coordinate axis accounts for 82 02 of the archaeal community variation the data points for the high and low c n treatments are located on the positive and negative sides of the axis origin indicating that the difference between the two groups is considerable 3 3 microbial correlation network in low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors 3 3 1 combination of correlation network analysis and lefse analysis in recent years network analysis has been widely used for microbial sequencing data kuypers et al 2018 martin et al 2020 the microbial data from seven reactors were integrated then pearson correlation analysis was performed at the genus level the relationship network between bacteria and archaea was constructed based on the absolute value of r pearson correlation coefficient when the absolute value of r is greater than 0 9 and the p value is less than 0 05 between two genera then the relationship appears in the network supplementary material fig s2 when the r value is greater than 0 9 the color of the connecting line is red indicating that the two genera are positively correlated based on abundance and are likely to have a synergistic relationship miao et al 2019 when the r value is less than 0 9 the line is green indicating a negative correlation between the two connected genera which may have a competitive relationship linear discriminant analysis lda is a tool that used to compare the microbial gene abundance levels in the low and high c n groups the tool finds microbial taxa at each level of the evolutionary branch that differ enough to be used as markers lefse supplementary material fig s3 the evolutionary branch diagram shows distinct successions of bacteria and archaea in the different treatments significant differences were found at the phylum level firmicutes is a marker phylum at low c n bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi spirochaetes and synergistetes are the marker bacterial phyla at high c n among the archaea euryarchaeota is marker taxon under low c n while methanosaeta and methanoregula are marker taxa in the high c n group crenarchaeota and nanoarchaeaeota which are non methanogenic are also marker taxa of the high c n group fig 5 was draw by combining figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material the gray shading shows the modules formed by gephi software s modular analysis of the correlation network the modules are named m1 m9 based on their size the iconic microbial community found in the lefse analysis is marked by blue for low c n marker taxa and red for high c n marker taxa and the numbers in the network diagram are used to mark the microbial marker taxa in the lefse evolution branch diagram the marker taxa in the high c n group mainly appear in m1 and m3 while the marker taxa in the low c n group mostly appear in m2 and m4 this shows that modules m1 and m3 and modules m2 and m4 consist mainly of microbial groups that play roles under high and low c n respectively m1 and m3 contain the most types and numbers of microorganisms that form a network of closely related bacteria bacteroidetes fibrobacteria chloroflexi synergistetes spirochaetes and actinobacteria and archaea crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota m2 contains only firmicutes cloacimonetes and euryarchaeota within the firmicutes clostridium sensu stricto 1 which is a member of the genus clostridium is the most connected taxon in the entire network herman et al 2017 reported that clostridium produces amylase and is highly resistant to stress methanosarcina which is the most connected archaeon is also in m2 its spherical cells are highly resistant to stress and thus it adapts to a variety of complex digestion conditions li et al 2015 in addition to clostridium and methanosarcina olsenella in m1 is also well connected to other microorganisms olsenella can utilize lactic acid and it participates in acidogenesis during ad orive et al 2016 the connections in m4 is chain shaped the microorganisms in this module are related only to the neighboring microorganisms including the three methanogenic archaea methanobacterium methanoculleus obligate h2 utilizing methanogen and rumen m2 methyl compound utilizing methanogen although the connections in module m4 are not as tight as in modules m1 and m3 the module contains a variety of methane producing pathways importantly the microbial community in the low c n reactor tends to have few types of hydrolytic and acidifying bacteria while the stress resistant groups are enriched in addition these reactors have multiple methanogenic pathways that function simultaneously at low c n multiple competitive relationships are the main driving factors that inhibit reactor performance in contrast the high c n treatments tend to support numerous types of hydrolytic and acidifying bacteria bacteria in these reactors tend to have cooperative relationships furthermore non methanogenic archaea occupy an essential position in the microbial communities of these reactors 3 3 2 relationship between metabolites and microorganisms belonging to different network modules fig 6 shows the relationship between the types and numbers of microorganisms in each module and environmental factors bacteria in the same phylum do not necessarily respond to environmental factors in the same way for example in the bacteroidetes ruminofilibacter and rikenellaceae rc9 gut group are enriched in the low c n group while dmer64 bacteroides and roseimarinus are enriched in the high c n group it should be noted that both of rikenellaceae rc9 gut group and dmer64 belong to the rikenellaceae similarly within the firmicutes ruminiclostridium terrisporobacter and romboutsia are more abundant in the low c n group while christensenellaceae and syntrophomonas are more abundant in the high c n group genetically related bacteria may become adapted to very different environmental conditions which explains the observations above furthermore different substrates will enrich for different groups of bacteria the archaea are also subject to the same type of environmental effect for example both methanosarcina and methanosaeta belong to the methanosarcinales but their abundance levels are considerably different in the low and high c n experimental groups the results of lefse analysis show that certain microbial marker taxa are not dominant there are nine marker taxa in the low c n treatments among the six bacterial genera that make up these marker taxa fig 6a 2 1 w27 2 2 romboutsia 2 3 ruminiclostridium 2 7 clostridium 4 3 acholeplasma 4 5ignatzschineria clostridium sensu stricto 1 account for 19 2 25 1 of the bacteria in this group and is the dominant taxon meanwhile the minor taxa ruminiclostridium and acholeplasma account for only 3 6 and 2 0 respectively of the bacteria in this group the remaining three marker taxa are archaeal genera fig 6b 2 4 methanosphaera 2 5 methanobrevibacter and 2 6 methanosarcina methanosarcina the dominant methanogen accounts for 32 1 49 7 of the archaea in the low c n group while methanobrevibacter accounts for only 3 4 in the high c n group there are a total of twelve marker taxa among the eight bacterial genera fig 6a 1 1 olsenella 1 2 bacteroidetes 1 5 prolixibacteraceae 3 1 dmer64 3 2 synergistaceae 3 5 treponema 2 3 7 lnr a2 18 and 7 2 smithella dmer64 a member of the rikenellaceae accounts for 11 5 of total bacteria the relative abundance levels of the remaining seven bacterial genera account for less than 5 of the bacteria the remaining marker taxa are four archaeal genera fig 6b 1 6 methanoregula 1 9 bathyarchaeia 3 8 aenigmarchae and 9 1 methanosaeta methanosaeta accounts for 51 8 83 4 of the total archaea is by far the most dominant archaeon meanwhile methanoregula accounts for less than 1 of the archaea these results demonstrate that some microbial marker taxa are not abundant and therefore may be easily overlooked however the succession of marker taxa within microbial communities is an indicator of the reactor s status information on such taxa will enable operators to make timely reactor interventions however more research on those marker taxa which tend to be sensitive to environmental changes is needed the modules m1 m9 formed from the correlation network are also related to specific environmental factors microorganisms in the same module tend to have similar responses to environmental factors for example among the eleven genera in m1 eight are significantly positively correlated with the c n indicating that influent composition is the most critical factor affecting the abundances of these genera in m1 m1 contains bacteroidetes vadinha17 and prolixibacteraceae of the bacteroidales which are known to degrade organic macromolecules and it also contains olsenella which uses carbohydrates to produce organic acids m1 also includes two methanogenic archaea belonging to the methanomicrobiales which are known to produce methane by metabolizing h2 co2 formate and alcohol demirel and scherer 2008 of the eight genera in m2 only w27 is related to c n while five of the genera are significantly related to the concentrations of butyric acid and ammonia two genera ruminiclostridium and clostridium belong to clostridiales and are significantly positively correlated with five intermediate metabolites scod ammonia acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid these genera are known to decompose carbohydrates to butyric acid produce spores and are generally highly resistant to stress including high tan concentration m2 includes romboutsia and ruminiclostridium which can degrade xylan clostridium which can produce amylase and terrisporobacter which can metabolize glucose into acetic acid m2 also includes methanosphaera methanobrevibacter and methanosarcina the former two of which metabolize h2 co2 and c1 compounds demirel and scherer 2008 while the latter can use a variety of substrates for methanogenesis among the nine genera in m3 four are significantly negatively correlated to butyric acid among the nine genera in m4 none are significantly correlated to c n status although they are related to acetic acid and propionic acid m5 m6 and m7 showed no sensitivity to environmental factors christensenellaceae r 7 group the predominant microorganism in m8 and known to produce acetic acid and butyric acid is negatively correlated to propionic acid and ammonia m9 consists mostly of methanosaeta which utilizes acetic acid to produce methane karakashev et al 2005 and is inversely related to scod although m8 and m9 each contain only a single member of the community they are positively correlated with methane yield indicating that they are groups that are functionally relevant to methane production 3 4 genes encoding enzymes and methanogenic pathway in low c n inhibited steady state and high c n reactors fig 7 shows the abundance of genes encoding enzyme associated with ad hydrolysis and acidification are the two vital stages in ad carried out primarily by bacteria fang et al 2015 sixteen critical bacterial enzymes that related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism were selected seven of which are related to the hydrolysis stage among the seven endoglucanase and xylanase levels are higher in the low c n group than in the high c n group which indicates that lignocellulose degrading bacteria are more resistant to ammonia in the environment lignocellulose degrading bacteria generally belong to clostridium and romboutsia which were highly abundant in low c n group r10 r12 in table 3 the starch phosphorylase beta galactosidase and alpha glucosidase are more abundant in the high c n group in the sugar degradation pathway the level of transketolase the key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway washburn et al 2019 is higher in the high c n group meanwhile the level of pyruvate kinase an enzyme of the glycolysis pathway angiari et al 2020 is higher in the low c n treatments formate acetyltransferase is involved in formate production while acetaldehyde dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetate kinase are involved in the production and activation of acetic acid fang et al 2015 the levels of genes encoding these enzymes are higher in the low c n group compared to the high c n groups similarly the level of acetyl coa reductase which synthesizes butyric acid is also high in the low c n treatments suggesting that more butyric acid is produced in the low c n group the high abundance levels of the five aforementioned enzyme genes under low c n conditions means that the bacteria responsible for acidification are highly resistant to ammonia mahdy et al 2020 the abundance levels of carbamoyl phosphate synthase and glutamine synthetase which are related to ammonia consumption are lower in the low c n group indicating that the ammonia consumption in the low c n group was reduced methanogenesis the last stage of ad is carried out by archaea fang et al 2015 the h2 co2 and aceticlastic pathways are the main methane producing pathways the gene for the beta subunit of coenzyme f420 hydrogenase of the h2 co2 methanogenesis pathway is more abundant in the low c n group which means the h2 co2 methanogenesis pathway is the dominant methane producing pathway in the low c n group ferredoxin and methyltransferase are involved in both methane producing pathways and are highly abundant in the high c n group which is reflected by the total methane production in the high c n group acetyl coa is a specific enzyme of the aceticlastic pathways and the gene encoding this enzyme is more abundant in the high c n group this means that the aceticlastic pathway is the main methane producing pathway in high c n groups 4 conclusion the inhibited steady state was successfully reproduced by changing the substrate composition and recirculation regime to adjust the influent c n within the range of 10 14 there was a clear transition between methanosaeta and methanosarcina as the influent c n changed and this succession may be used as a biological indicator of ammonia inhibition the results suggest that as the influent c n gradually decreases the aceticlastic pathway is gradually replaced by the hydrogenotrophic pathway simultaneously the levels of saob such as clostridium increases along with that of hydrogenophilic methanogens meanwhile as the increasing c n causes the abundance diversity and uniformity of bacteria to increase while the uniformity of archaea decreases well performing high c n and inhibited steady state low c n reactors are characterized by different marker taxa furthermore the degree of cooperation among microorganism is high in the well performing reactors while the degree of competition is high in the reactors under inhibited steady state the new information about the inhibited steady state will be helpful because it provides an early warning of ammonia inhibition thus allowing operators to develop strategies for mitigating ammonia inhibition

17399,chlorinated organophosphate esters cl opes e g tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep tris 2 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp and tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcpp are widely used as additive flame retardants in commercial and building products they have potential persistent organic pollutant properties and are frequently detected in various waters especially in wastewaters nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi based method is an efficient reductive technology for treating waters polluted by halogenated organic pollutants hocs cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab is a ubiquitous surfactant in wastewaters and can favorably affect the interaction between hocs and nzvi however its effect on the cl opes removal by nzvi based materials still remains unknown herein the adsorption and degradation efficiencies of cl opes by nzvi and sulfidated nzvi s nzvi in the presence or absence of ctab were quantified based on the decreasing concentrations of cl opes in reaction systems our results showed that tdcpp and tcpp were adsorbed onto the nzvi or s nzvi surface and subsequently degraded in contrast tcep was just adsorbed onto the particle surface without further degradation the addition of ctab significantly enhanced the hydrophobic adsorption between cl opes and nzvi or s nzvi leading to increased degradation of cl opes especially tcep ctab adsorption isotherms indicated that s nzvi had a higher adsorption capacity for ctab than nzvi the s nzvi ctab composite exhibited a better performance than nzvi ctab composite when s nzvi was combined with 100 0 mg l 1 ctab 100 of tdcpp tcpp and tcep was degraded within 3 hours 5 and 14 days respectively as the concentration of ctab was increased up to 335 0 mg l 1 tcep could be completely degraded within 3 days by s nzvi five degradation products of tcep were identified of which o o di 2 chloroethyl o ethyl phosphate dceep and ethane were reported for the first time we propose that tcep is dechlorinated by nzvi or s nzvi

chloroethyl phosphate tcep tris 2 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp and tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcpp are widely used as flame retardants in polyurethane foam plastics polyester resins and textiles dodson et al 2012 due to their extensive use cl opes have been frequently detected in various aqueous environments especially wastewaters and sewage slurries kim and kannan 2018 kim et al 2017 pang et al 2016 schreder and la guardia 2014 the concentrations of cl opes could be as high as 616 µg l 1 and 2100 µg kg 1 dry weight in laundry wastewaters and sewage slurries respectively marklund et al 2005 schreder and la guardia 2014 the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been considered as an important source of cl opes in aquatic environments pantelaki and voutsa 2019 because cl opes are resistant to conventional wastewater treatment technology such as adsorption biodegradation and chlorine or ozone based oxidation kim et al 2017 lee et al 2013 liang and liu 2016 toxicity tests show that cl opes have neurotoxicity cytotoxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity for animals and possess endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms and even human cell lines van der veen and de boer 2012 wang et al 2020 furthermore tcep and tdcpp have been classified into carcinogenic category 2 by european commission 2014 hence it is thus necessary to develop efficient technologies for the removal of cl opes from wastewaters or polluted waters in order to reduce its risks to environmental and human health many studies have reported that some non conventional oxidant based treatments such as ultraviolet h2o2 ultraviolet titanium dioxide and ultraviolet persulfate are able to remove cl opes from aquatic matrices effectively liu et al 2018 ye et al 2017 yu et al 2019 however few reductive technologies are available for the degradation of cl opes under anoxic conditions only two previous studies addressed the relevant topic saint hilaire et al 2013 reported the reductive degradation of three cl opes by reduced sulfur species under alkaline condition and li et al 2020 found that 93 of initial tcep was reductively degraded by fes with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab in 14 days note however that nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi especially sulfidated nzvi is a well known reductant for the degradation of recalcitrant halogenated organic contaminants hocs such as trichloroethylene tce tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa hexabromocyclododecane hbcd fan et al 2017 fu et al 2014 li et al 2016 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b moreover this kind of reductant has proven to be effective in remediating hocs contaminated wastewaters and polluted groundwater especially when modificated with polymers polyelectrolytes or surfactants to promote its reactivity stability and mobility phenrat and kumloet 2016 phenrat et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 hence one may reasonably hypothesize that nzvi based particles have the potential to reductively degrade cl opes nonetheless differences exist in chemical properties of hocs and cl opes which likely lead to a possibility that nzvi based particles degrade cl opes by a mechanism clearly distinct from that for hocs the reductive degradation of hocs by nzvi based materials is a surface mediated process in which hocs firstly reach the particle surfaces and subsequently react with active sites of the surfaces alessi and li 2001 zhu et al 2008 the availability of hocs to the surfaces of nzvi depends on the hydrophobicity of the solid liquid interfaces petersen et al 2012 in contrast tcep tcpp and tdcpp are water soluble compounds and their logk ow values range from 1 44 to 3 65 being lower than those of highly hydrophobic hocs such as tbbpa and hbcd with logk ow 4 50 the unique functional groups of cl opes including one hydrophilic phosphoric acid ester group and three hydrophobic alkyl halide groups reemtsma et al 2008 van der veen and de boer 2012 may also result in a scenario that their interfacial interactions with nzvi based materials are different from those for hocs which deserves further investigation surfactants are amphiphilic compounds which consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups rosen and kunjappu 2012 they can change the interfacial interactions between nzvi based materials and hocs and impact the degradation of hocs by nzvi based materials which are highly dependent on the adsorption behavior of surfactants alessi and li 2001 lin et al 2015 shin et al 2008 tian et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 compared to anionic and nonionic surfactants cationic surfactants are adsorbed more strongly on the surfaces of nzvi based materials carrying negative charges alessi and li 2001 shin et al 2008 zhu et al 2008 and therefore increase the interactions between hocs and the particle surfaces lin et al 2015 tian et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 among cationic surfactants ctab is found to be the most effective one for improving the reactivity of zvi towards hocs alessi and li 2001 shin et al 2008 zhu et al 2008 in addition ctab is extensively distributed in wastewater systems because ctab is a fundamental substance daily used in domestic and industrial field rosen and kunjappu 2012 and is a common chemical additive for sludge dewatering and settling in wwtps with a dosage up to 2000 mg l 1 wang et al 2014 given the possibility of the co existence of cl opes and ctab in wastewaters and sewage sludges margot et al 2015 the effects of ctab on the reactivity of nzvi towards cl opes need to be examined therefore this study aims to i investigate the reactivity of nzvi and s nzvi towards three cl opes i e tdcpp tcpp and tcep in the presence or absence of ctab ii explore the adsorption capacity of ctab on the surface of nzvi or s nzvi iii quantify the effects of particle dosage tcep dosage and solution ph on the degradation rates of tcep by nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab and iv investigate the degradation products and pathways of tcep by nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab our results provide new insights into the synergistic effects of ctab on dehalogenation of cl opes by nzvi based materials and have important implications for the potential use of nzvi based materials in the treatment of cl opes polluted waters under anoxic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials details on the chemical reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 of the supporting information si all experiments were conducted at 25 0 5 0 c in an anaerobic glovebox super 1220 750 mikrouna co ltd shanghai china filled with high purity nitrogen 99 999 the detailed synthesis procedures of nzvi and s nzvi at a s fe molar ratio of 0 51 were described elsewhere li et al 2016 li et al 2017a 2 2 ctab adsorption experiments and surface analysis batch ctab adsorption experiments were performed in 100 0 ml brown glass bottles capped with ptfe lined silicone septa pristine nzvi or s nzvi 0 050 g was suspended in 50 0 ml of solutions with ctab concentrations ranging from 0 0 to 1000 0 mg l 1 3 fold higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc of ctab 335 0 mg l 1 such a concentration range of ctab could be found in wwtps due to its extensive use in domestic and industrial products zhang et al 2015a the suspensions were mixed with a teflon coated magnetic stirring bar for 2 0 hours to achieve equilibrium and were then filtered via 0 22 µm ptfe filters 25 mm 0 45 µm xiboshi tianjin china to remove the particles the resultant supernatants were analyzed with a total organic carbon toc analyzer liqui toc elementer germany to determine the dissolved amounts of ctab in aqueous phases the toc contents of ctab dissolved in supernatants were determined to calculate the exact concentration of ctab in the solution in which 0 62 mg l 1 toc corresponds to 1 0 mg l 1 mass concentration of ctab the amounts of ctab adsorbed on the nzvi or s nzvi surfaces were calculated by the differences between the initial ctab amounts and the dissolved ctab amounts in aqueous phases the effects of ctab on the surface properties of nzvi and s nzvi were investigated by the measurements of zeta potential particle size h2 evolution surface morphological change the synthetic nzvi and s nzvi materials were suspended in ultrapure water or ctab contained solutions unless otherwise specified the initial concentrations of solids and ctab in the solutions were 1 0 g l 1 and 100 0 mg l 1 respectively the resulting solids solutions were stirred for 2 0 hours to achieve equilibrium before used for characterization the zeta potentials of solids in the absence and presence of ctab were determined as a function of initial ph ranging from 5 0 to 9 0 the initial ph of all suspensions was adjusted with dilute naoh or hno3 the h2 productions in ultrapure water and ctab contained systems were measured by analyzing headspace samples using a gas chromatograph thermal conductivity detector gc tcd agilent technologies 6890n usa the microscopic structures of solids in the absence or presence of ctab were examined by an fei talos f200s tem thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and a su 800 sem hitachi ltd tokyo japan the zeta potentials of solids were measured as a function of ctab concentrations ranging from 0 0 to 1000 0 mg l 1 by using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd worcs uk the particle sizes of solids under different ctab concentration 0 0 1000 0 mg l 1 were measured by the dynamic light scattering dls methods with a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd worcs uk 2 3 reactivity experiments batch experiments were conducted in 100 0 ml brown glass bottles capped with ptfe lined silicone septa to compare the reactivities of nzvi and s nzvi towards three cl opes i e tcep tcpp and tdcpp in the presence or absence of ctab typically 0 050 g of nzvi or s nzvi particles was added into 50 0 ml of aqueous solutions with or without 100 0 mg l 1 of ctab a typical concentration of ctab commonly found in wwtps zhang et al 2015a and stirred for 2 0 hours to obtain the nzvi or s nzvi suspensions with or without ctab then a certain amount of cl opes stock solutions was injected into the bottles through the septum to obtain an initial concentration of cl opes of 1 0 mg l 1 and initiate the reactions immediately the bottles were placed on magnetic stirrers at 800 0 rpm to maximize the exposure of particle surfaces to the surrounding solution and reduce the aggregation of the particles the solution ph was initially set at 7 0 and increased greater than 9 7 after 14 days of reaction at a given sampling time an aliquot of 1 0 ml of each reaction suspension was sampled and immediately filtered via 0 22 µm ptfe filters to remove the solids another aliquot of 1 0 ml of suspension was sampled and digested using concentrated hno3 15 0 m to dissolve the solids for releasing cl opes adsorbed onto the solid surface into aqueous phase the degradation percentage designated as ed of cl opes was calculated based on the decreasing concentration of cl opes in the aqueous solutions after acid digestion following the eq 1 the adsorption percentage designated as ep of cl opes onto the surface of the solids nzvi s nzvi nzvi ctab composite and s nzvi ctab composite was calculated by the difference between the concentrations of cl opes in the aqueous solution after acid digestion and filtration following the eq 2 1 e d c 0 c a c 0 100 2 e p c a c f c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration of cl opes in the reaction solution cf and ca are the aqueous concentrations of cl opes after filtration and acid digestion respectively the aqueous concentrations of cl opes after filtration or acid digestion were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer hplc ms as described below control experiments without particles were conducted in which their subsequent sample handling was the same as those of the reactivity experiments no loss of cl opes was observed in the control experiments indicating that the sample handling including acid digestion and filtration have no measureable impact on the concentration of cl opes additional batch experiments investigating the effects of s nzvi or nzvi particle dosage 0 50 1 0 and 2 0 g l 1 ctab concentration 20 0 50 0 100 0 335 0 and 1000 0 mg l 1 tcep concentration 0 50 1 0 and 2 0 mg l 1 and initial solution ph 5 0 7 0 9 0 on the degradation of tcep were conducted the initial ph of reaction solutions was regulated by hno3 or naoh solution instead of buffers as buffers can affect the reactions between target compounds and the particles qin et al 2018 the other experimental conditions and sampling procedures were the same as those described above 2 4 degradation product analyses to identify tcep degradation products a larger reaction system a 250 0 ml brown capped glass bottle containing 100 0 ml of reaction solution and higher initial concentrations of reactants 100 0 mg l 1 tcep and 5 0 g l 1 nzvi or s nzvi were used the other experimental conditions were kept the same as those of the reactivity experiments mentioned above at predetermined time intervals 1 0 ml of gaseous sample and 4 0 ml of reaction suspension were sampled from each bottle for analyses of volatile and non volatile degradation products respectively each gaseous sample was diluted with high purity n2 at a ratio of 1 2000 a 100 0 ml of the diluted gaseous sample was collected and analyzed by a gas chromatography mass selective detector flame ionization detector gc msd fid each reaction suspension sample was divided into two parts one part 1 0 ml was mixed with a certain amount of concentrated hno3 to dissolve solids and the resultant solutions were used for analyses of the residual concentrations of tcep and degradation products by hplc ms the other part 3 0 ml was centrifuged at 10000 0 rpm for 10 0 min and the solids obtained after centrifugation were rinsed three times with 5 0 ml of 0 10 m hno3 solution to desorb chloride ion cl the resultant hno3 eluents were then combined with the supernatants and filtered through 0 22 µm ptfe filters 25 mm 0 45 µm xiboshi tianjin china onguard ic c18 cartridges 100 mg xiboshi tianjin china and onguard ic h cartridges 100 mg xiboshi tianjin china to remove solids organics and metal ions respectively and finally injected into an ion chromatography ic for the quantification of cl 2 5 instrumental and statistical analyses cl opes and degradation products of tcep in solutions were analyzed using a thermo accela 1250 hplc and a thermo tsq vantage triple quadrupole ms according to the method reported by wang et al 2011 with minor adjustments gaseous samples were analyzed using a model 7100 preconcentrator entech instruments inc california usa equipped with an agilent 5973n gas chromatography mass selective detector flame ionization detector gc msd fid agilent technologies usa according to the methods described elsewhere zhang et al 2015b the quantification of cl was accomplished by a dionex ics900 ic dionex sunnyvale ca usa coupled with a rfic ionpacas19 analytical column 250 mm 4 mm id a rfic ionpacas19 guard column 50 mm 4 mm id and a conductivity detector details on the instrument analyses and the quality assurance quality control procedures are presented in texts s2 and s3 of the si one way analysis of variance anova with the rstudio statistical software was used to evaluate the differences between the treatments in parameters from surface characterization and reactivity tests the significance level was set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface characterization the surface morphologies of nzvi and s nzvi particles were characterized by tem and sem fig 1 it can be seen that nzvi displayed chain like structures and s nzvi was predominantly presented as incompact core structures with flake like shell and acicular particles these results are in agreement with the surface morphologies results of nzvi and s nzvi reported by previous study using the same particle synthesis method su et al 2015 the zeta potentials of nzvi and s nzvi are shown in fig 2 a the isoelectric points of nzvi and s nzvi particles were estimated to be 8 3 and 6 1 respectively the lower isoelectric point of s nzvi than nzvi suggests that s nzvi carries more negative surface charges than nzvi which may be favorable to adsorb positively charged substances such as ctab in addition s nzvi had a smaller average particle size than nzvi fig 2b 631 6 10 1 nm for s nzvi 795 4 17 7 nm for nzvi anova p 0 05 indicating that sulfidation can decrease the aggregation of nzvi and increase the specific surface area of nzvi the hydrogen h2 evolutions from nzvi and s nzvi systems are shown in fig 2c the level of h2 generated in the s nzvi system was much lower than that of nzvi anova p 0 05 providing direct evidence that the corrosion rate of s nzvi surfaces is slower than that of nzvi the effects of ctab on surface properties of the nzvi and s nzvi were investigated tem analyses showed that nzvi and s nzvi particles were less aggregated in the presence of ctab and more amorphous and disperse shapes were formed on the surfaces of nzvi and s nzvi particles with smaller portion of core structures fig 1a 1d sem analyses revealed that in the presence of ctab the chain like structures of nzvi became shorter and smaller and the core shell clusters of s nzvi were much looser and larger porous figs 1e 1h the adsorbed ctab on the surfaces of nzvi and s nzvi increases the electrostatic repulsion between particles as shown in fig 2a the presence of ctab increased the absolute values of zeta potentials of nzvi and s nzvi particles and shifted the isoelectric points of nzvi and s nzvi particles to higher values leading to an increase of the electrostatic repulsion between nzvi and s nzvi particles the average particle sizes of both the nzvi and s nzvi were found to decrease with the increasing amount of ctab adsorbed on their surfaces fig 2b which is in line with the results of tem and sem analyses that ctab can effectively reduce particle aggregation the quantities of hydrogen h2 produced after 14 days of reaction in the s nzvi and nzvi systems without ctab were 1 3 and 1 1 times greater than those in the s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems respectively fig 2c however the statistical analysis indicates that the presence of ctab is not likely to obviously impact the h2 evolution in nzvi and s nzvi systems anova p 0 05 3 2 ctab adsorption on the surface of nzvi and s nzvi the adsorption isotherms of ctab on nzvi and s nzvi surfaces are presented in fig 2d which can be interpreted by a typical four region adsorption model zhu et al 2008 briefly the adsorption of ctab was firstly driven by the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged particle surfaces and positively charged ctab head groups leading to the ctab tails protruding into solution after the neutralisation of the surface charges the adsorption of ctab was mainly driven by hydrophobic interaction between ctab tails above the cmc of ctab the ctab adsorption by particles reached a plateau and formed admicelles and hemimicelles on the surfaces of particles both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption behavior of ctab on the surfaces of nzvi or s nzvi details on these two adsorption isotherm models are available in text s4 of the si as shown in fig s1 the ctab adsorptions on the surfaces of nzvi or s nzvi followed more closely to the langmuir isotherm model than the freundlich model indicating that ctab adsorption on the nzvi or s nzvi surfaces is likely to be monolayer the maximum monolayer adsorption capacities for nzvi and s nzvi were calculated to be 171 6 10 9 and 1007 3 52 4 mg g 1 respectively anova p 0 05 the rl values less than one suggest that the adsorptions of ctab by nzvi and s nzvi are favorable these results indicate that s nzvi exhibits higher adsorption capacity of ctab than nzvi which may be due to the more negative surface charges on s nzvi fig 2a details on the fitting results for ctab adsorption isotherms are shown in table s1 of the si 3 3 cl opes adsorption and degradation by nzvi and s nzvi as shown in figs 3 a and 3c the adsorption percentages of tdcpp and tcpp by nzvi and s nzvi increased to reach peak values 23 9 38 7 within 1 day and then rapidly decreased to 0 0 5 7 after 14 days of reaction with a decrease in adsorption percentages the degradation percentages of tdcpp and tcpp by nzvi gradually increased up to 100 and 32 1 after 14 days fig 3b and 3d the pseudo first order rate constants k obs of tdcpp and tcpp by nzvi were 0 34 0 026 and 0 01 0 008 d 1 respectively as for s nzvi system tdcpp was completely degraded within 2 days and over 80 of tcpp was degraded after 14 days of reaction fig 3d the respective k obs of tdcpp and tcpp by s nzvi were 0 82 0 08 and 0 11 0 01 d 1 respectively in contrast the adsorption percentages of tcep by nzvi and s nzvi gradually increased up to 34 2 and 39 1 after 14 days of reaction respectively no degradation occurred in either nzvi or s nzvi system anvoa p 0 05 such discrepancy in the adsorption and reduction of cl opes may be attributed to different functional groups of cl opes adsorbed onto the nzvi and s nzvi particle surfaces the structures of cl opes contain one hydrophilic phosphoric acid ester group and three hydrophobic alkyl halide groups and there may be two ways for cl opes to be adsorbed onto nzvi and s nzvi surfaces one is that hydrophilic phosphoric acid ester groups are adsorbed onto particle surfaces fang et al 2018 the other is that hydrophobic alkyl halide groups of cl opes are adsorbed onto particle surfaces the latter are proposed to be the major way to trigger the reduction of cl opes i e breakdown and dechlorination of alkyl halide groups by nzvi and s nzvi particles based on the degradation products of cl opes identified in section 3 5 the logk ow values of tdcpp tcpp and tcep are 3 65 2 59 and 1 44 respectively reemtsma et al 2008 van der veen and de boer 2012 the orders of the degradation percentages of the three cl opes tdcpp tcpp tcep observed in nzvi and s nzvi systems are in agreement with those of their logk ow values figs 3b and 3d indicating that cl opes with higher hydrophobicity are degraded to a larger extent this phenomenon may be attributed to a scenario that more hydrophobic alkyl halide groups of cl opes are adsorbed onto particle surfaces no reduction of hydrophilic tcep by nzvi or s nzvi may be resulted from its phosphoric acid ester group rather than its alkyl halide group that is mainly adsorbed onto particle surfaces s nzvi displayed a higher reactivity towards tdcpp and tcpp compared to nzvi anvoa p 0 05 which is consistent with those results of the prior studies showing that some other halogenated organic pollutants e g tce tbbpa are degraded faster by s nzvi than by nzvi bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 kim et al 2011 li et al 2016 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b the higher reactivity of s nzvi than nzvi is mainly ascribed to its higher selectivity for the reduction of pollutants over water fan et al 2017 li et al 2017b the corrosion of nzvi surfaces by water involves direct electron transfer on the particle surfaces to produce iron oxides and h2 bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 liu and lowry 2006 which is believed to compete for electrons with cl opes and thus decrease the degradation rate of cl opes the less corrosion of s nzvi by water as evidenced by the lower level of h2 produced in the s nzvi system fig 2c lead to an increase in the reactivity of s nzvi towards cl opes furthermore the smaller average particle size of s nzvi may provide more reactive sites for the degradation of cl opes fig 2b more importantly s nzvi has more hydrophobic surfaces bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 kim et al 2011 which may be favorable for the access of the hydrophobic alkyl halides groups of cl opes onto its surfaces and thereby enhances their degradation 3 4 cl opes adsorption and degradation by nzvi and s nzvi in the presence of ctab as depicted in figs 3e and 3f the presence of ctab did not significantly increase the adsorption percentages of cl opes on the nzvi surface anvoa p 0 05 but greatly increased the degradation efficiency of cl opes especially tcep by nzvi the nzvi with 100 0 mg l 1 ctab achieved 100 degradation of tdcpp and tcpp after 5 and 7 days of reactions with the k obs of 0 53 0 09 and 0 47 0 05 d 1 respectively and 45 of the initial tcep within 14 days with the k obs of 0 033 0 003 d 1 fig 3f as to s nzvi ctab system the maximum adsorption percentages of tdcpp and tcpp were lower than those in s nzvi system figs 3c and 3g this situation is a reflection of the fast degradation of cl opes adsorbed onto the s nzvi surface in the presence of ctab fig 3h tdcpp tcpp and tcep were completely degraded within 3 hours 5 and 14 days by s nzvi with 100 0 mg l 1 ctab respectively fig 3h their respective k obs values were 38 4 8 3 h 1 0 61 0 05 d 1 and 0 31 0 04 d 1 the degradation percentages of the three cl opes still followed the orders of tdcpp tcpp tcep the removal efficiencies calculated as the sum of adsorption and degradation percentages of cl opes in the nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab systems were greater than those of the controls without ctab fig s2 to our knowledge this is the first report that nzvi based materials especially s nzvi can effectively remove cl opes in the presence of ctab ctab is composed of a quaternary ammonium head group and a hydrophobic carbon chain generally ctab can modify the hydrophilic nzvi to increase the partition of hydrophobic hocs on the nzvi surface leading to elevated degradation rates of hocs alessi and li 2001 zhu et al 2008 for hydrophilic cl opes ctab may strongly interact with hydrophobic alkyl halide groups of cl opes and facilitate the adsorption of alkyl halide groups onto the particle surfaces to improve the degradation of cl opes by nzvi and s nzvi in addition surface characterization results showed that the presence of ctab could reduce the average particle sizes of nzvi and s nzvi fig 2b it was found that the degradation efficiency of tcep increased with decreasing particle size of nzvi or s nzvi fig s3 the reduced particle size may be another reason for the dramatic increases in cl opes degradation in the presence of ctab as shown in figs 4 a and 4b the degradation rate of tcep increased with an increase in ctab dosage the k obs of tcep degradation by both nzvi and s nzvi is listed in table 1 which was positively related to the ctab dosage until its cmc 335 0 mg l 1 fig 4c the k obs of tcep by nzvi or s nzvi with ctab at cmc was 0 076 0 017 and 1 09 0 19 d 1 respectively table 1 similarly shin et al 2008 showed that a cationic surfactant at concentrations below its cmc could significantly accelerate the dechlorination rate of tce by zvi in addition ctab enhanced the degradation efficiency of cl opes by s nzvi to a larger extent than that by nzvi anvoa p 0 05 a major reason is that s nzvi can adsorb more ctab onto its surface than nzvi fig 2d nevertheless the k obs of tcep degradation declined from 1 09 0 19 to 1 00 0 19 d 1 in the s nzvi system and from 0 076 0 017 to 0 044 0 007 d 1 in the nzvi system as ctab dosage increased from 1 0 cmc to 3 0 cmc fig 4c such inhibitory effects of ctab are likely attributed to a scenario that an excess amount of ctab can lead to the formation of admicelles and hemimicelles of ctab on the surfaces of nzvi and s nzvi particles fig 2d which is thought to block the access of tcep to the reactive sites on the surfaces of the particles lin et al 2015 phenrat et al 2009 zhu et al 2008 3 5 reaction mechanism given the most recalcitrant nature of tcep in both s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems tcep was selected for further studying the reaction mechanism underlying the degradation of cl opes by s nzvi ctab or nzvi ctab in both systems five dechlorinated intermediates of tcep including bcep o o di 2 chloroethyl o ethyl phosphate dceep chloride ethene c2h4 and ethane c2h6 were identified see table s2 and text s5 for more details on the identification due to the fact that no mono and non chlorinated intermediates containing the phosphoric center were detected in this study it is likely that tcep was only dechlorinated by s nzvi ctab or nzvi ctab into di chlorinated degradation products i e bcep and dceep the authentic standard of dceep is currently unavailable which limits our ability to determine accurately the concentration of dceep note however that the peak areas of dceep in the s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems were small fig s4 in contrast the concentrations of bcep in the two systems increased gradually with the degradation of tcep and reached a relatively high level approximately 20 µmol figs 5 a and 5b therefore we hypothesized that bcep was a main degradation product of tcep in the two systems during the 14 day experiment period to test this hypothesis a mass balance calculation between tcep and bcep was conducted in which the fraction of the sum of molar concentrations of the remaining tcep and the generated bcep to the initial molar concentration of tcep in the reaction solution was calculated it was found that the mass balances in the s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems over the period of the 14 day of reaction were greater than 93 and 84 respectively figs 5a and 5b supporting our hypothesis the small mass losses in the two systems could be attributed at least partly to the degradation of tcep into dceep which was not included in the mass balance calculation in the degradation process of tcep into bcep approximately one mole of cl atom is expected to be eliminated as one mole of tcep is degraded this expectation is supported by the fact that the molar ratios of released cl during the degradation of tcep by s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab were nearly equal to those of the removed tcep figs 5c and 5d high levels of c2h4 were detected in the two systems and they tended to increase as the degradation proceeded figs 5c and 5d moreover the molar ratio of the c2h4 to bcep generated after 1 day of reaction was close to one in both systems suggesting that c2h4 is generated from the degradation of tcep into bcep fig s5 note however that the molar ratio decreased to 0 65 and 0 61 in the s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems after 14 day of reaction respectively fig s5 such decreases may be related to the possible gas leakage resulted from multiple samplings and or the hydrogenation of c2h4 into c2h6 in fact c2h6 was detected at a low level in the nzvi ctab system but not in the s nzvi ctab system fig s6 this discrepancy is likely due to a scenario that the rapid passivation of the nzvi by water can generate a large amount of hydrogen gas while sulfidation can decrease the passivation of the nzvi by water fig 2c based on the identified degradation products and the mass balance analysis the tentative pathways of the tcep degradation by s nzvi and nzvi in the presence of ctab are proposed fig 6 in brief a single electron produced by the corrosion of the s nzvi or nzvi attack at the carbon of tcep adjacent to chlorine atom to yield a cl and a deprotonated dceep radical ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po the ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po species is subsequently reduced by either a hydrogen atom a by product of the corrosion of the s nzvi or nzvi to form a molecular dceep or a second one electron to yield a deprotonated dceep carbanion ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po the carbanionic ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po species can directly collide with a proton h to form a molecular dceep however the carbanionic ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po species likely prefer to undergo an intermolecular rearrangement rather than a direct collision with a proton h and finally is transformed to a c2h4 and a molecular bcep due to the high speed feature of intermolecular rearrangements compared to bimolecular collisions song and carraway 2005 this may be a major reason for the low yields of dceep during the reactions of tcep with s nzvi and nzvi in the presence of ctab besides a small part of the released c2h4 can further transform into c2h6 via hydrogenation reaction in the nzvi system note however that the degradation products of tcep in the s nzvi and nzvi systems were quite different from those in a fes system reported in our prior study li et al 2020 indicating the distinct pathways of tcep degradation in s nzvi or nzvi and fes reaction systems in fes system tcep is likely to undergo a two electron reduction and subsequently received a proton h from water to form bcep cl ion and c2h4 li et al 2020 3 6 effects of initial ph tcep and nanoparticle dosages on the degradation of tcep to optimize reaction conditions for the degradation of tcep by s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab the effects of dosages of tcep and nanoparticle and initial solution ph on the degradation of tcep were investigated it was found that the degradation percentages of tcep and the associated k obs increased with increasing nanoparticle dosage 0 50 to 2 0 g l 1 figs 7 a and 7b and table 1 this is likely due to the increased availability of active sites on the particle surfaces resulted from the increasing amount of nanoparticles in the reaction solutions similar phenomenon has been reported recently for the degradation of a variety of halogenated pollutants by nzvi based materials li et al 2016 li et al 2017a lin et al 2012 tso and shih 2014 the k obs values of tcep degradation in the two systems increased as the initial tcep concentration increased from 0 50 to 1 0 mg l 1 whilst it decreased as the initial tcep concentration increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mg l 1 figs 7c and 7d and table 1 the inhibitory effect of excess tcep can be explained by a scenario that the over intense competition among tcep molecules for surface active sites of the particles results in lower degradation rate of tcep li et al 2016 luo et al 2010 as shown in figs 7e and 7f and table 1 the highest k obs values of tcep degradation in both s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab were found at the initial solution ph of 5 0 the k obs values of tcep degradation by s nzvi and nzvi decreased slightly as the ph increased to 9 0 which may be due to an increase in the adsorption of oh and the formation of passivation layers of iron oxides on the s nzvi and nzvi surfaces du et al 2016 li et al 2017a su et al 2015 it is apparent that these results indicate the degradation of tcep in the s nzvi ctab or nzvi ctab systems can be further improved by optimizing the reaction conditions 4 conclusions in this study we have found that ctab can accelerate the reductive degradation of cl opes by nzvi and s nzvi which has important implications for development of nzvi based treatment technology for wastewaters co contaminated by cl opes and ctab s nzvi ctab can be an alternative to nzvi ctab for the degradation of cl opes due to its superior reactivity than nzvi ctab the degradation rate of cl opes is in a decreasing order of tdcpp tcpp tcep indicating that tcep is more recalcitrant compared to the other two cl opes nevertheless tcep can be degraded to bcep which has a shorter half life less persistence and likely lower ecological risk than tcep fu et al 2017 on the other hand the two gaseous products i e c2h4 and c2h6 of tcep are known for their usages in agricultural and energy production etana 2018 sholahudin and giannetti 2016 therefore the reduction of tcep toxicity can be achieved by its reaction with s nzvi ctab or nzvi ctab in a word this study suggests an effective method for the reductive degradation of cl opes in wastewaters despite the occurrence of cl opes has been reported in a variety of waters including surface and subsurface waters there are uncertainties to be addressed before expanding the practical application of nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab to subsurface environments a topic of debate is the mobility and stability of nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab in the subsurface environments in fact such a topic may be explored previously or under current investigation for example the combination of nzvi ctab with anionic polymer or emulsifier was reported to be an efficient strategy to improve the mobility and stability of nzvi ctab in subsurface remediation tian et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 which may be attributed to changes in electrostatic interactions between particles caused by anionic polymer or emulsifier babakhani et al 2017 srirattana et al 2017 more efforts should be made in future to improve the mobility and stability of nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab

17399,chlorinated organophosphate esters cl opes e g tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep tris 2 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp and tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcpp are widely used as additive flame retardants in commercial and building products they have potential persistent organic pollutant properties and are frequently detected in various waters especially in wastewaters nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi based method is an efficient reductive technology for treating waters polluted by halogenated organic pollutants hocs cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab is a ubiquitous surfactant in wastewaters and can favorably affect the interaction between hocs and nzvi however its effect on the cl opes removal by nzvi based materials still remains unknown herein the adsorption and degradation efficiencies of cl opes by nzvi and sulfidated nzvi s nzvi in the presence or absence of ctab were quantified based on the decreasing concentrations of cl opes in reaction systems our results showed that tdcpp and tcpp were adsorbed onto the nzvi or s nzvi surface and subsequently degraded in contrast tcep was just adsorbed onto the particle surface without further degradation the addition of ctab significantly enhanced the hydrophobic adsorption between cl opes and nzvi or s nzvi leading to increased degradation of cl opes especially tcep ctab adsorption isotherms indicated that s nzvi had a higher adsorption capacity for ctab than nzvi the s nzvi ctab composite exhibited a better performance than nzvi ctab composite when s nzvi was combined with 100 0 mg l 1 ctab 100 of tdcpp tcpp and tcep was degraded within 3 hours 5 and 14 days respectively as the concentration of ctab was increased up to 335 0 mg l 1 tcep could be completely degraded within 3 days by s nzvi five degradation products of tcep were identified of which o o di 2 chloroethyl o ethyl phosphate dceep and ethane were reported for the first time we propose that tcep is dechlorinated by nzvi or s nzvi through the electron attack at the ethyl chlorine group to form bis 2 chloroethyl phosphate dceep chloride ethene and ethane representing previously unknown degradation pathways graphical abstract

chloroethyl phosphate tcep tris 2 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp and tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcpp are widely used as flame retardants in polyurethane foam plastics polyester resins and textiles dodson et al 2012 due to their extensive use cl opes have been frequently detected in various aqueous environments especially wastewaters and sewage slurries kim and kannan 2018 kim et al 2017 pang et al 2016 schreder and la guardia 2014 the concentrations of cl opes could be as high as 616 µg l 1 and 2100 µg kg 1 dry weight in laundry wastewaters and sewage slurries respectively marklund et al 2005 schreder and la guardia 2014 the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been considered as an important source of cl opes in aquatic environments pantelaki and voutsa 2019 because cl opes are resistant to conventional wastewater treatment technology such as adsorption biodegradation and chlorine or ozone based oxidation kim et al 2017 lee et al 2013 liang and liu 2016 toxicity tests show that cl opes have neurotoxicity cytotoxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity for animals and possess endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms and even human cell lines van der veen and de boer 2012 wang et al 2020 furthermore tcep and tdcpp have been classified into carcinogenic category 2 by european commission 2014 hence it is thus necessary to develop efficient technologies for the removal of cl opes from wastewaters or polluted waters in order to reduce its risks to environmental and human health many studies have reported that some non conventional oxidant based treatments such as ultraviolet h2o2 ultraviolet titanium dioxide and ultraviolet persulfate are able to remove cl opes from aquatic matrices effectively liu et al 2018 ye et al 2017 yu et al 2019 however few reductive technologies are available for the degradation of cl opes under anoxic conditions only two previous studies addressed the relevant topic saint hilaire et al 2013 reported the reductive degradation of three cl opes by reduced sulfur species under alkaline condition and li et al 2020 found that 93 of initial tcep was reductively degraded by fes with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab in 14 days note however that nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi especially sulfidated nzvi is a well known reductant for the degradation of recalcitrant halogenated organic contaminants hocs such as trichloroethylene tce tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa hexabromocyclododecane hbcd fan et al 2017 fu et al 2014 li et al 2016 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b moreover this kind of reductant has proven to be effective in remediating hocs contaminated wastewaters and polluted groundwater especially when modificated with polymers polyelectrolytes or surfactants to promote its reactivity stability and mobility phenrat and kumloet 2016 phenrat et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 hence one may reasonably hypothesize that nzvi based particles have the potential to reductively degrade cl opes nonetheless differences exist in chemical properties of hocs and cl opes which likely lead to a possibility that nzvi based particles degrade cl opes by a mechanism clearly distinct from that for hocs the reductive degradation of hocs by nzvi based materials is a surface mediated process in which hocs firstly reach the particle surfaces and subsequently react with active sites of the surfaces alessi and li 2001 zhu et al 2008 the availability of hocs to the surfaces of nzvi depends on the hydrophobicity of the solid liquid interfaces petersen et al 2012 in contrast tcep tcpp and tdcpp are water soluble compounds and their logk ow values range from 1 44 to 3 65 being lower than those of highly hydrophobic hocs such as tbbpa and hbcd with logk ow 4 50 the unique functional groups of cl opes including one hydrophilic phosphoric acid ester group and three hydrophobic alkyl halide groups reemtsma et al 2008 van der veen and de boer 2012 may also result in a scenario that their interfacial interactions with nzvi based materials are different from those for hocs which deserves further investigation surfactants are amphiphilic compounds which consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups rosen and kunjappu 2012 they can change the interfacial interactions between nzvi based materials and hocs and impact the degradation of hocs by nzvi based materials which are highly dependent on the adsorption behavior of surfactants alessi and li 2001 lin et al 2015 shin et al 2008 tian et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 compared to anionic and nonionic surfactants cationic surfactants are adsorbed more strongly on the surfaces of nzvi based materials carrying negative charges alessi and li 2001 shin et al 2008 zhu et al 2008 and therefore increase the interactions between hocs and the particle surfaces lin et al 2015 tian et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 among cationic surfactants ctab is found to be the most effective one for improving the reactivity of zvi towards hocs alessi and li 2001 shin et al 2008 zhu et al 2008 in addition ctab is extensively distributed in wastewater systems because ctab is a fundamental substance daily used in domestic and industrial field rosen and kunjappu 2012 and is a common chemical additive for sludge dewatering and settling in wwtps with a dosage up to 2000 mg l 1 wang et al 2014 given the possibility of the co existence of cl opes and ctab in wastewaters and sewage sludges margot et al 2015 the effects of ctab on the reactivity of nzvi towards cl opes need to be examined therefore this study aims to i investigate the reactivity of nzvi and s nzvi towards three cl opes i e tdcpp tcpp and tcep in the presence or absence of ctab ii explore the adsorption capacity of ctab on the surface of nzvi or s nzvi iii quantify the effects of particle dosage tcep dosage and solution ph on the degradation rates of tcep by nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab and iv investigate the degradation products and pathways of tcep by nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab our results provide new insights into the synergistic effects of ctab on dehalogenation of cl opes by nzvi based materials and have important implications for the potential use of nzvi based materials in the treatment of cl opes polluted waters under anoxic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials details on the chemical reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 of the supporting information si all experiments were conducted at 25 0 5 0 c in an anaerobic glovebox super 1220 750 mikrouna co ltd shanghai china filled with high purity nitrogen 99 999 the detailed synthesis procedures of nzvi and s nzvi at a s fe molar ratio of 0 51 were described elsewhere li et al 2016 li et al 2017a 2 2 ctab adsorption experiments and surface analysis batch ctab adsorption experiments were performed in 100 0 ml brown glass bottles capped with ptfe lined silicone septa pristine nzvi or s nzvi 0 050 g was suspended in 50 0 ml of solutions with ctab concentrations ranging from 0 0 to 1000 0 mg l 1 3 fold higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc of ctab 335 0 mg l 1 such a concentration range of ctab could be found in wwtps due to its extensive use in domestic and industrial products zhang et al 2015a the suspensions were mixed with a teflon coated magnetic stirring bar for 2 0 hours to achieve equilibrium and were then filtered via 0 22 µm ptfe filters 25 mm 0 45 µm xiboshi tianjin china to remove the particles the resultant supernatants were analyzed with a total organic carbon toc analyzer liqui toc elementer germany to determine the dissolved amounts of ctab in aqueous phases the toc contents of ctab dissolved in supernatants were determined to calculate the exact concentration of ctab in the solution in which 0 62 mg l 1 toc corresponds to 1 0 mg l 1 mass concentration of ctab the amounts of ctab adsorbed on the nzvi or s nzvi surfaces were calculated by the differences between the initial ctab amounts and the dissolved ctab amounts in aqueous phases the effects of ctab on the surface properties of nzvi and s nzvi were investigated by the measurements of zeta potential particle size h2 evolution surface morphological change the synthetic nzvi and s nzvi materials were suspended in ultrapure water or ctab contained solutions unless otherwise specified the initial concentrations of solids and ctab in the solutions were 1 0 g l 1 and 100 0 mg l 1 respectively the resulting solids solutions were stirred for 2 0 hours to achieve equilibrium before used for characterization the zeta potentials of solids in the absence and presence of ctab were determined as a function of initial ph ranging from 5 0 to 9 0 the initial ph of all suspensions was adjusted with dilute naoh or hno3 the h2 productions in ultrapure water and ctab contained systems were measured by analyzing headspace samples using a gas chromatograph thermal conductivity detector gc tcd agilent technologies 6890n usa the microscopic structures of solids in the absence or presence of ctab were examined by an fei talos f200s tem thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and a su 800 sem hitachi ltd tokyo japan the zeta potentials of solids were measured as a function of ctab concentrations ranging from 0 0 to 1000 0 mg l 1 by using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd worcs uk the particle sizes of solids under different ctab concentration 0 0 1000 0 mg l 1 were measured by the dynamic light scattering dls methods with a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd worcs uk 2 3 reactivity experiments batch experiments were conducted in 100 0 ml brown glass bottles capped with ptfe lined silicone septa to compare the reactivities of nzvi and s nzvi towards three cl opes i e tcep tcpp and tdcpp in the presence or absence of ctab typically 0 050 g of nzvi or s nzvi particles was added into 50 0 ml of aqueous solutions with or without 100 0 mg l 1 of ctab a typical concentration of ctab commonly found in wwtps zhang et al 2015a and stirred for 2 0 hours to obtain the nzvi or s nzvi suspensions with or without ctab then a certain amount of cl opes stock solutions was injected into the bottles through the septum to obtain an initial concentration of cl opes of 1 0 mg l 1 and initiate the reactions immediately the bottles were placed on magnetic stirrers at 800 0 rpm to maximize the exposure of particle surfaces to the surrounding solution and reduce the aggregation of the particles the solution ph was initially set at 7 0 and increased greater than 9 7 after 14 days of reaction at a given sampling time an aliquot of 1 0 ml of each reaction suspension was sampled and immediately filtered via 0 22 µm ptfe filters to remove the solids another aliquot of 1 0 ml of suspension was sampled and digested using concentrated hno3 15 0 m to dissolve the solids for releasing cl opes adsorbed onto the solid surface into aqueous phase the degradation percentage designated as ed of cl opes was calculated based on the decreasing concentration of cl opes in the aqueous solutions after acid digestion following the eq 1 the adsorption percentage designated as ep of cl opes onto the surface of the solids nzvi s nzvi nzvi ctab composite and s nzvi ctab composite was calculated by the difference between the concentrations of cl opes in the aqueous solution after acid digestion and filtration following the eq 2 1 e d c 0 c a c 0 100 2 e p c a c f c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration of cl opes in the reaction solution cf and ca are the aqueous concentrations of cl opes after filtration and acid digestion respectively the aqueous concentrations of cl opes after filtration or acid digestion were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer hplc ms as described below control experiments without particles were conducted in which their subsequent sample handling was the same as those of the reactivity experiments no loss of cl opes was observed in the control experiments indicating that the sample handling including acid digestion and filtration have no measureable impact on the concentration of cl opes additional batch experiments investigating the effects of s nzvi or nzvi particle dosage 0 50 1 0 and 2 0 g l 1 ctab concentration 20 0 50 0 100 0 335 0 and 1000 0 mg l 1 tcep concentration 0 50 1 0 and 2 0 mg l 1 and initial solution ph 5 0 7 0 9 0 on the degradation of tcep were conducted the initial ph of reaction solutions was regulated by hno3 or naoh solution instead of buffers as buffers can affect the reactions between target compounds and the particles qin et al 2018 the other experimental conditions and sampling procedures were the same as those described above 2 4 degradation product analyses to identify tcep degradation products a larger reaction system a 250 0 ml brown capped glass bottle containing 100 0 ml of reaction solution and higher initial concentrations of reactants 100 0 mg l 1 tcep and 5 0 g l 1 nzvi or s nzvi were used the other experimental conditions were kept the same as those of the reactivity experiments mentioned above at predetermined time intervals 1 0 ml of gaseous sample and 4 0 ml of reaction suspension were sampled from each bottle for analyses of volatile and non volatile degradation products respectively each gaseous sample was diluted with high purity n2 at a ratio of 1 2000 a 100 0 ml of the diluted gaseous sample was collected and analyzed by a gas chromatography mass selective detector flame ionization detector gc msd fid each reaction suspension sample was divided into two parts one part 1 0 ml was mixed with a certain amount of concentrated hno3 to dissolve solids and the resultant solutions were used for analyses of the residual concentrations of tcep and degradation products by hplc ms the other part 3 0 ml was centrifuged at 10000 0 rpm for 10 0 min and the solids obtained after centrifugation were rinsed three times with 5 0 ml of 0 10 m hno3 solution to desorb chloride ion cl the resultant hno3 eluents were then combined with the supernatants and filtered through 0 22 µm ptfe filters 25 mm 0 45 µm xiboshi tianjin china onguard ic c18 cartridges 100 mg xiboshi tianjin china and onguard ic h cartridges 100 mg xiboshi tianjin china to remove solids organics and metal ions respectively and finally injected into an ion chromatography ic for the quantification of cl 2 5 instrumental and statistical analyses cl opes and degradation products of tcep in solutions were analyzed using a thermo accela 1250 hplc and a thermo tsq vantage triple quadrupole ms according to the method reported by wang et al 2011 with minor adjustments gaseous samples were analyzed using a model 7100 preconcentrator entech instruments inc california usa equipped with an agilent 5973n gas chromatography mass selective detector flame ionization detector gc msd fid agilent technologies usa according to the methods described elsewhere zhang et al 2015b the quantification of cl was accomplished by a dionex ics900 ic dionex sunnyvale ca usa coupled with a rfic ionpacas19 analytical column 250 mm 4 mm id a rfic ionpacas19 guard column 50 mm 4 mm id and a conductivity detector details on the instrument analyses and the quality assurance quality control procedures are presented in texts s2 and s3 of the si one way analysis of variance anova with the rstudio statistical software was used to evaluate the differences between the treatments in parameters from surface characterization and reactivity tests the significance level was set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface characterization the surface morphologies of nzvi and s nzvi particles were characterized by tem and sem fig 1 it can be seen that nzvi displayed chain like structures and s nzvi was predominantly presented as incompact core structures with flake like shell and acicular particles these results are in agreement with the surface morphologies results of nzvi and s nzvi reported by previous study using the same particle synthesis method su et al 2015 the zeta potentials of nzvi and s nzvi are shown in fig 2 a the isoelectric points of nzvi and s nzvi particles were estimated to be 8 3 and 6 1 respectively the lower isoelectric point of s nzvi than nzvi suggests that s nzvi carries more negative surface charges than nzvi which may be favorable to adsorb positively charged substances such as ctab in addition s nzvi had a smaller average particle size than nzvi fig 2b 631 6 10 1 nm for s nzvi 795 4 17 7 nm for nzvi anova p 0 05 indicating that sulfidation can decrease the aggregation of nzvi and increase the specific surface area of nzvi the hydrogen h2 evolutions from nzvi and s nzvi systems are shown in fig 2c the level of h2 generated in the s nzvi system was much lower than that of nzvi anova p 0 05 providing direct evidence that the corrosion rate of s nzvi surfaces is slower than that of nzvi the effects of ctab on surface properties of the nzvi and s nzvi were investigated tem analyses showed that nzvi and s nzvi particles were less aggregated in the presence of ctab and more amorphous and disperse shapes were formed on the surfaces of nzvi and s nzvi particles with smaller portion of core structures fig 1a 1d sem analyses revealed that in the presence of ctab the chain like structures of nzvi became shorter and smaller and the core shell clusters of s nzvi were much looser and larger porous figs 1e 1h the adsorbed ctab on the surfaces of nzvi and s nzvi increases the electrostatic repulsion between particles as shown in fig 2a the presence of ctab increased the absolute values of zeta potentials of nzvi and s nzvi particles and shifted the isoelectric points of nzvi and s nzvi particles to higher values leading to an increase of the electrostatic repulsion between nzvi and s nzvi particles the average particle sizes of both the nzvi and s nzvi were found to decrease with the increasing amount of ctab adsorbed on their surfaces fig 2b which is in line with the results of tem and sem analyses that ctab can effectively reduce particle aggregation the quantities of hydrogen h2 produced after 14 days of reaction in the s nzvi and nzvi systems without ctab were 1 3 and 1 1 times greater than those in the s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems respectively fig 2c however the statistical analysis indicates that the presence of ctab is not likely to obviously impact the h2 evolution in nzvi and s nzvi systems anova p 0 05 3 2 ctab adsorption on the surface of nzvi and s nzvi the adsorption isotherms of ctab on nzvi and s nzvi surfaces are presented in fig 2d which can be interpreted by a typical four region adsorption model zhu et al 2008 briefly the adsorption of ctab was firstly driven by the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged particle surfaces and positively charged ctab head groups leading to the ctab tails protruding into solution after the neutralisation of the surface charges the adsorption of ctab was mainly driven by hydrophobic interaction between ctab tails above the cmc of ctab the ctab adsorption by particles reached a plateau and formed admicelles and hemimicelles on the surfaces of particles both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption behavior of ctab on the surfaces of nzvi or s nzvi details on these two adsorption isotherm models are available in text s4 of the si as shown in fig s1 the ctab adsorptions on the surfaces of nzvi or s nzvi followed more closely to the langmuir isotherm model than the freundlich model indicating that ctab adsorption on the nzvi or s nzvi surfaces is likely to be monolayer the maximum monolayer adsorption capacities for nzvi and s nzvi were calculated to be 171 6 10 9 and 1007 3 52 4 mg g 1 respectively anova p 0 05 the rl values less than one suggest that the adsorptions of ctab by nzvi and s nzvi are favorable these results indicate that s nzvi exhibits higher adsorption capacity of ctab than nzvi which may be due to the more negative surface charges on s nzvi fig 2a details on the fitting results for ctab adsorption isotherms are shown in table s1 of the si 3 3 cl opes adsorption and degradation by nzvi and s nzvi as shown in figs 3 a and 3c the adsorption percentages of tdcpp and tcpp by nzvi and s nzvi increased to reach peak values 23 9 38 7 within 1 day and then rapidly decreased to 0 0 5 7 after 14 days of reaction with a decrease in adsorption percentages the degradation percentages of tdcpp and tcpp by nzvi gradually increased up to 100 and 32 1 after 14 days fig 3b and 3d the pseudo first order rate constants k obs of tdcpp and tcpp by nzvi were 0 34 0 026 and 0 01 0 008 d 1 respectively as for s nzvi system tdcpp was completely degraded within 2 days and over 80 of tcpp was degraded after 14 days of reaction fig 3d the respective k obs of tdcpp and tcpp by s nzvi were 0 82 0 08 and 0 11 0 01 d 1 respectively in contrast the adsorption percentages of tcep by nzvi and s nzvi gradually increased up to 34 2 and 39 1 after 14 days of reaction respectively no degradation occurred in either nzvi or s nzvi system anvoa p 0 05 such discrepancy in the adsorption and reduction of cl opes may be attributed to different functional groups of cl opes adsorbed onto the nzvi and s nzvi particle surfaces the structures of cl opes contain one hydrophilic phosphoric acid ester group and three hydrophobic alkyl halide groups and there may be two ways for cl opes to be adsorbed onto nzvi and s nzvi surfaces one is that hydrophilic phosphoric acid ester groups are adsorbed onto particle surfaces fang et al 2018 the other is that hydrophobic alkyl halide groups of cl opes are adsorbed onto particle surfaces the latter are proposed to be the major way to trigger the reduction of cl opes i e breakdown and dechlorination of alkyl halide groups by nzvi and s nzvi particles based on the degradation products of cl opes identified in section 3 5 the logk ow values of tdcpp tcpp and tcep are 3 65 2 59 and 1 44 respectively reemtsma et al 2008 van der veen and de boer 2012 the orders of the degradation percentages of the three cl opes tdcpp tcpp tcep observed in nzvi and s nzvi systems are in agreement with those of their logk ow values figs 3b and 3d indicating that cl opes with higher hydrophobicity are degraded to a larger extent this phenomenon may be attributed to a scenario that more hydrophobic alkyl halide groups of cl opes are adsorbed onto particle surfaces no reduction of hydrophilic tcep by nzvi or s nzvi may be resulted from its phosphoric acid ester group rather than its alkyl halide group that is mainly adsorbed onto particle surfaces s nzvi displayed a higher reactivity towards tdcpp and tcpp compared to nzvi anvoa p 0 05 which is consistent with those results of the prior studies showing that some other halogenated organic pollutants e g tce tbbpa are degraded faster by s nzvi than by nzvi bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 kim et al 2011 li et al 2016 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b the higher reactivity of s nzvi than nzvi is mainly ascribed to its higher selectivity for the reduction of pollutants over water fan et al 2017 li et al 2017b the corrosion of nzvi surfaces by water involves direct electron transfer on the particle surfaces to produce iron oxides and h2 bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 liu and lowry 2006 which is believed to compete for electrons with cl opes and thus decrease the degradation rate of cl opes the less corrosion of s nzvi by water as evidenced by the lower level of h2 produced in the s nzvi system fig 2c lead to an increase in the reactivity of s nzvi towards cl opes furthermore the smaller average particle size of s nzvi may provide more reactive sites for the degradation of cl opes fig 2b more importantly s nzvi has more hydrophobic surfaces bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 kim et al 2011 which may be favorable for the access of the hydrophobic alkyl halides groups of cl opes onto its surfaces and thereby enhances their degradation 3 4 cl opes adsorption and degradation by nzvi and s nzvi in the presence of ctab as depicted in figs 3e and 3f the presence of ctab did not significantly increase the adsorption percentages of cl opes on the nzvi surface anvoa p 0 05 but greatly increased the degradation efficiency of cl opes especially tcep by nzvi the nzvi with 100 0 mg l 1 ctab achieved 100 degradation of tdcpp and tcpp after 5 and 7 days of reactions with the k obs of 0 53 0 09 and 0 47 0 05 d 1 respectively and 45 of the initial tcep within 14 days with the k obs of 0 033 0 003 d 1 fig 3f as to s nzvi ctab system the maximum adsorption percentages of tdcpp and tcpp were lower than those in s nzvi system figs 3c and 3g this situation is a reflection of the fast degradation of cl opes adsorbed onto the s nzvi surface in the presence of ctab fig 3h tdcpp tcpp and tcep were completely degraded within 3 hours 5 and 14 days by s nzvi with 100 0 mg l 1 ctab respectively fig 3h their respective k obs values were 38 4 8 3 h 1 0 61 0 05 d 1 and 0 31 0 04 d 1 the degradation percentages of the three cl opes still followed the orders of tdcpp tcpp tcep the removal efficiencies calculated as the sum of adsorption and degradation percentages of cl opes in the nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab systems were greater than those of the controls without ctab fig s2 to our knowledge this is the first report that nzvi based materials especially s nzvi can effectively remove cl opes in the presence of ctab ctab is composed of a quaternary ammonium head group and a hydrophobic carbon chain generally ctab can modify the hydrophilic nzvi to increase the partition of hydrophobic hocs on the nzvi surface leading to elevated degradation rates of hocs alessi and li 2001 zhu et al 2008 for hydrophilic cl opes ctab may strongly interact with hydrophobic alkyl halide groups of cl opes and facilitate the adsorption of alkyl halide groups onto the particle surfaces to improve the degradation of cl opes by nzvi and s nzvi in addition surface characterization results showed that the presence of ctab could reduce the average particle sizes of nzvi and s nzvi fig 2b it was found that the degradation efficiency of tcep increased with decreasing particle size of nzvi or s nzvi fig s3 the reduced particle size may be another reason for the dramatic increases in cl opes degradation in the presence of ctab as shown in figs 4 a and 4b the degradation rate of tcep increased with an increase in ctab dosage the k obs of tcep degradation by both nzvi and s nzvi is listed in table 1 which was positively related to the ctab dosage until its cmc 335 0 mg l 1 fig 4c the k obs of tcep by nzvi or s nzvi with ctab at cmc was 0 076 0 017 and 1 09 0 19 d 1 respectively table 1 similarly shin et al 2008 showed that a cationic surfactant at concentrations below its cmc could significantly accelerate the dechlorination rate of tce by zvi in addition ctab enhanced the degradation efficiency of cl opes by s nzvi to a larger extent than that by nzvi anvoa p 0 05 a major reason is that s nzvi can adsorb more ctab onto its surface than nzvi fig 2d nevertheless the k obs of tcep degradation declined from 1 09 0 19 to 1 00 0 19 d 1 in the s nzvi system and from 0 076 0 017 to 0 044 0 007 d 1 in the nzvi system as ctab dosage increased from 1 0 cmc to 3 0 cmc fig 4c such inhibitory effects of ctab are likely attributed to a scenario that an excess amount of ctab can lead to the formation of admicelles and hemimicelles of ctab on the surfaces of nzvi and s nzvi particles fig 2d which is thought to block the access of tcep to the reactive sites on the surfaces of the particles lin et al 2015 phenrat et al 2009 zhu et al 2008 3 5 reaction mechanism given the most recalcitrant nature of tcep in both s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems tcep was selected for further studying the reaction mechanism underlying the degradation of cl opes by s nzvi ctab or nzvi ctab in both systems five dechlorinated intermediates of tcep including bcep o o di 2 chloroethyl o ethyl phosphate dceep chloride ethene c2h4 and ethane c2h6 were identified see table s2 and text s5 for more details on the identification due to the fact that no mono and non chlorinated intermediates containing the phosphoric center were detected in this study it is likely that tcep was only dechlorinated by s nzvi ctab or nzvi ctab into di chlorinated degradation products i e bcep and dceep the authentic standard of dceep is currently unavailable which limits our ability to determine accurately the concentration of dceep note however that the peak areas of dceep in the s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems were small fig s4 in contrast the concentrations of bcep in the two systems increased gradually with the degradation of tcep and reached a relatively high level approximately 20 µmol figs 5 a and 5b therefore we hypothesized that bcep was a main degradation product of tcep in the two systems during the 14 day experiment period to test this hypothesis a mass balance calculation between tcep and bcep was conducted in which the fraction of the sum of molar concentrations of the remaining tcep and the generated bcep to the initial molar concentration of tcep in the reaction solution was calculated it was found that the mass balances in the s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems over the period of the 14 day of reaction were greater than 93 and 84 respectively figs 5a and 5b supporting our hypothesis the small mass losses in the two systems could be attributed at least partly to the degradation of tcep into dceep which was not included in the mass balance calculation in the degradation process of tcep into bcep approximately one mole of cl atom is expected to be eliminated as one mole of tcep is degraded this expectation is supported by the fact that the molar ratios of released cl during the degradation of tcep by s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab were nearly equal to those of the removed tcep figs 5c and 5d high levels of c2h4 were detected in the two systems and they tended to increase as the degradation proceeded figs 5c and 5d moreover the molar ratio of the c2h4 to bcep generated after 1 day of reaction was close to one in both systems suggesting that c2h4 is generated from the degradation of tcep into bcep fig s5 note however that the molar ratio decreased to 0 65 and 0 61 in the s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab systems after 14 day of reaction respectively fig s5 such decreases may be related to the possible gas leakage resulted from multiple samplings and or the hydrogenation of c2h4 into c2h6 in fact c2h6 was detected at a low level in the nzvi ctab system but not in the s nzvi ctab system fig s6 this discrepancy is likely due to a scenario that the rapid passivation of the nzvi by water can generate a large amount of hydrogen gas while sulfidation can decrease the passivation of the nzvi by water fig 2c based on the identified degradation products and the mass balance analysis the tentative pathways of the tcep degradation by s nzvi and nzvi in the presence of ctab are proposed fig 6 in brief a single electron produced by the corrosion of the s nzvi or nzvi attack at the carbon of tcep adjacent to chlorine atom to yield a cl and a deprotonated dceep radical ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po the ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po species is subsequently reduced by either a hydrogen atom a by product of the corrosion of the s nzvi or nzvi to form a molecular dceep or a second one electron to yield a deprotonated dceep carbanion ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po the carbanionic ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po species can directly collide with a proton h to form a molecular dceep however the carbanionic ch2ch2o ch2clch2o 2po species likely prefer to undergo an intermolecular rearrangement rather than a direct collision with a proton h and finally is transformed to a c2h4 and a molecular bcep due to the high speed feature of intermolecular rearrangements compared to bimolecular collisions song and carraway 2005 this may be a major reason for the low yields of dceep during the reactions of tcep with s nzvi and nzvi in the presence of ctab besides a small part of the released c2h4 can further transform into c2h6 via hydrogenation reaction in the nzvi system note however that the degradation products of tcep in the s nzvi and nzvi systems were quite different from those in a fes system reported in our prior study li et al 2020 indicating the distinct pathways of tcep degradation in s nzvi or nzvi and fes reaction systems in fes system tcep is likely to undergo a two electron reduction and subsequently received a proton h from water to form bcep cl ion and c2h4 li et al 2020 3 6 effects of initial ph tcep and nanoparticle dosages on the degradation of tcep to optimize reaction conditions for the degradation of tcep by s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab the effects of dosages of tcep and nanoparticle and initial solution ph on the degradation of tcep were investigated it was found that the degradation percentages of tcep and the associated k obs increased with increasing nanoparticle dosage 0 50 to 2 0 g l 1 figs 7 a and 7b and table 1 this is likely due to the increased availability of active sites on the particle surfaces resulted from the increasing amount of nanoparticles in the reaction solutions similar phenomenon has been reported recently for the degradation of a variety of halogenated pollutants by nzvi based materials li et al 2016 li et al 2017a lin et al 2012 tso and shih 2014 the k obs values of tcep degradation in the two systems increased as the initial tcep concentration increased from 0 50 to 1 0 mg l 1 whilst it decreased as the initial tcep concentration increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mg l 1 figs 7c and 7d and table 1 the inhibitory effect of excess tcep can be explained by a scenario that the over intense competition among tcep molecules for surface active sites of the particles results in lower degradation rate of tcep li et al 2016 luo et al 2010 as shown in figs 7e and 7f and table 1 the highest k obs values of tcep degradation in both s nzvi ctab and nzvi ctab were found at the initial solution ph of 5 0 the k obs values of tcep degradation by s nzvi and nzvi decreased slightly as the ph increased to 9 0 which may be due to an increase in the adsorption of oh and the formation of passivation layers of iron oxides on the s nzvi and nzvi surfaces du et al 2016 li et al 2017a su et al 2015 it is apparent that these results indicate the degradation of tcep in the s nzvi ctab or nzvi ctab systems can be further improved by optimizing the reaction conditions 4 conclusions in this study we have found that ctab can accelerate the reductive degradation of cl opes by nzvi and s nzvi which has important implications for development of nzvi based treatment technology for wastewaters co contaminated by cl opes and ctab s nzvi ctab can be an alternative to nzvi ctab for the degradation of cl opes due to its superior reactivity than nzvi ctab the degradation rate of cl opes is in a decreasing order of tdcpp tcpp tcep indicating that tcep is more recalcitrant compared to the other two cl opes nevertheless tcep can be degraded to bcep which has a shorter half life less persistence and likely lower ecological risk than tcep fu et al 2017 on the other hand the two gaseous products i e c2h4 and c2h6 of tcep are known for their usages in agricultural and energy production etana 2018 sholahudin and giannetti 2016 therefore the reduction of tcep toxicity can be achieved by its reaction with s nzvi ctab or nzvi ctab in a word this study suggests an effective method for the reductive degradation of cl opes in wastewaters despite the occurrence of cl opes has been reported in a variety of waters including surface and subsurface waters there are uncertainties to be addressed before expanding the practical application of nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab to subsurface environments a topic of debate is the mobility and stability of nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab in the subsurface environments in fact such a topic may be explored previously or under current investigation for example the combination of nzvi ctab with anionic polymer or emulsifier was reported to be an efficient strategy to improve the mobility and stability of nzvi ctab in subsurface remediation tian et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 which may be attributed to changes in electrostatic interactions between particles caused by anionic polymer or emulsifier babakhani et al 2017 srirattana et al 2017 more efforts should be made in future to improve the mobility and stability of nzvi ctab and s nzvi ctab
