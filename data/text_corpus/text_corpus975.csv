4875,snow varies widely in space and time over high mountain regions accurately representing the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent swe is critically important for improving our understanding of snow accumulation and melt processes despite its importance in situ observations are lacking in poorly gauged regions such as the headwater region of the yangtze river hryr traditional remotely sensed retrievals are highly uncertain due to the effect of cloudiness e g optical remote sensing derived snow cover area and the coarse spatial resolution e g passive microwave remote sensing derived snow depth hydrological modeling is a powerful way to understand the snow processes but uncertainty still exists due to model deficiency and errors of forcing data assimilating high spatial resolution remotely sensed snow data into a snowmelt model may be potentially valuable for more accurate snow predictions in this study a high spatial resolution remotely sensed snow depth data set 500 m derived by integrating snow cover area land surface temperature and passive microwave brightness temperature products was assimilated into a snowmelt model within a particle filter pf assimilation framework which updates both model state variables and parameters simultaneously after assimilation the time series of basin averaged swe estimation showed an appreciable improvement with respect to the simulation with the traditional calibration tc method in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient increased by 10 20 and root mean square error rmse decreased by 7 18 the pf approach also greatly improved the spatial distribution of swe estimation with rmse decreased by 15 30 the swe estimation from the pf was also comparable or even better than that from another assimilation scheme namely the direct insertion comparison with in situ snowfall data indicated that the simulated snowfall from the pf outperformed the tc with rmse decreased by 15 32 and correlation coefficient increased by 58 83 furthermore the evolution of parameters suggested the applicability of the pf method with spatially variable parameters with spatiotemporally variable parameters in the pf the snow model could perfectly simulate the actual snow distribution particularly over high elevation regions where the average temperature was lower than 0 c while fixed parameters in the tc cannot simulate the variable snow distribution the proposed data assimilation framework has large potential of improving the accuracy of snow prediction across poorly gauged high mountain areas keywords dual state parameter updating scheme particle filter high spatial resolution remotely sensed snow depth snow water equivalent headwaters of the yangtze river 1 introduction seasonal snowpack is an essential resource for a variety of human activities including water supply for domestic use irrigation and hydropower generation particularly in arid or semi arid environments han et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2010 viviroli et al 2007a viviroli 2004 in addition snow is among the most important parts of the cryosphere and it acts as an indispensable link to other components in hydrological processes over cryospheric regions such as the headwaters of china s yangtze river hereafter hryr with seasonal and interannual variations snow responds to atmospheric circulations and climate change for example climate warming often leads to decreases in snowpack and shortening of the snow season in mountainous regions with a reduction in snow cover surface albedo will decrease and hence more solar radiation will be absorbed by the land surface which will further increase global warming rates chen et al 2017a as a result snow has a vital influence and feedback on the surface energy balance hydrological fluxes and the atmospheric cycle accurate snow information from observations or simulations is essential for understanding climate dynamics and climate change in high mountain cryospheric regions despite its importance ground observations cannot capture the spatial and temporal distribution of snowpack in poorly gauged regions bales et al 2006 remote sensing provides an unprecedented opportunity to resolve data scarcity huang et al 2019 2018a 2018b li et al 2019a 2019b li and long 2020 long et al 2019 2020 for instance optical remote sensing can provide the spatial distribution of snow cover at high resolution e g 500 m however optical remote sensing based snow cover is subject to cloud contamination passive microwave pmw sensors onboard satellites have the potential of providing not only snow cover extent but also snow mass observations globally without being impacted by cloudiness and night conditions foster et al 2005 however swe retrievals from pmw remote sensing have large uncertainty controlled by snowpack mass distance to significant open water bodies daytime air temperature forest cover snow class i e snow classification based on typical snow layer sequence thickness density crystal morphology and grain characteristics and topographic roughness and aspect dong et al 2005 in addition swe retrievals from pmw have relatively coarse spatial resolution e g 25 km and therefore cannot reflect detailed variations in snowpack in mountainous regions airborne lidar such as the airborne snow observatory aso mission could provide near real time monitoring of basin wide snow depths at the meter scale but has the limitation of temporal resolution and spatial coverage painter et al 2016 hydrological modeling is another way to understand hydrological processes such as snow accumulation and melt at catchment scales to simulate hydrological processes robustly a well developed hydrological model with proper parameterization calibration and evaluation is required gurtz et al 2003 refsgaard 1997 uhlenbrook and leibundgut 2002 viviroli et al 2007b so far various hydrological models have been developed and applied to simulate snow accumulation and melting processes including temperature index models dewalle et al 2002 he et al 2014 hock 1999 and energy balance models herrero et al 2009 hock and holmgren 2005 kustas et al 1994 energy balance snowmelt models could explicitly describe the complex process such as rain on snow and are independent of relationships based on historical data garen and marks 2005 nevertheless the need for a lot of meteorological observations as model forcing has restricted the application of energy balanced models in poorly gauged regions like the hryr as for temperature index models they may not be able to accurately simulate snowmelt processes under the circumstances where temperatures cannot well surrogate energy input to the snowpack hock 1999 in addition the models may need to be calibrated more than 1000 times before optimization to explore the parameter space caused by the highly parameterized nature of distributed models khakbaz et al 2012 running time for a single simulation which can be affected by many factors like the length of the simulation period model s complexity and the size of study region often ranges from minutes to days mugunthan and shoemaker 2006 zhang et al 2009 the calibration process may therefore result in computational burden which needs to be considered in intensive modeling effort data assimilation has been developed to utilize in situ and or remotely sensed measurements to improve model prediction skill due to the difficulty of accurately estimating snowpack properties ensemble kalman filter enkf is a widely used data assimilation method which estimates the probability density of a system state for every time step evensen 2003 however enkf requires dynamic models with gaussian uncertainties which is limited in cases with non gaussian uncertainties moradkhani et al 2005b sequential monte carlo smc methods namely the particle filter pf are then developed with the potential for nonlinear non gaussian applications moradkhani et al 2005a many studies have been performed to explore the applicability of the pf in snow simulation charrois et al 2016 tested the ability of assimilating optical reflectance data with the crocus model which is a detailed multilayer snowpack model used for avalanche forecasting and hydrological modeling vionnet et al 2012 results showed that the pf improved snow depth and swe simulations with reduced uncertainty dechant and moradkhani 2011 explored the operational potential of assimilating pmw frequencies with the snow 17 model after assimilation with the pf the swe prediction during the winter improved whereas there are large uncertainties in spring estimation leisenring and moradkhani 2011 assimilated swe observations from a snotel station to improve prediction of model states as well as parameters suggesting the potential of the pf in swe prediction smyth et al 2019 assimilated monthly snow depth observations with an energy balanced snowmelt model snobal which is a two layer snowpack model for points marks and dozier 1992 marks et al 1992 they found that assimilating snow depth observations with the pf improved snow density estimation and therefore improved swe prediction there are more studies about the pf in addition to the research listed above but most of them assimilated snow depth observations or remote sensing based swe retrievals only at point based sites or at a coarse spatial resolution given the high spatial variability of snow across mountainous and forested regions basin wide data assimilation at a fine spatial scale using the pf may have large potential margulis et al 2019 adopted snow depths derived from the nasa s airborne snow observatory aso to improve snow simulation the lidar derived snow depths with a high spatial resolution up to 50 m could effectively improve the snow simulation on spatial scales however the airborne lidar observation has limited spatial and temporal coverage relative to satellite based retrievals and cannot be applied to other regions or on larger scales in our study a remotely sensed high spatial resolution snow depth product 500 m was used for assimilation at the spatial resolution of 1 km not only did we validate the snow simulation with in situ observations but also validated the performance of the pf at the basin scale moreover few previous studies updated model parameters one of the most important factors that affect the model performance the dual state parameter updating scheme of the pf proposed in this study provides another way for deriving parameters which is quite different from traditional calibration approaches that often result in static parameter sets parameters in the pf approach are spatiotemporally variable via parameter updating at each time step whereas the parameters in traditional calibration approaches are often fixed for the entire basin throughout the simulation period the overall objective of this study was to examine the applicability of the dual state parameter updating scheme with the pf on the basin scale over the hryr above the zhimenda gauging station a temperature index snowmelt model chen et al 2017b han et al 2019 2020 huang et al 2020 will be applied to assimilate snow depth retrievals from a high spatial resolution remotely sensed snow depth product 500 m to achieve this objective this study involves 1 exploring the improvement in swe estimation from the pf method in terms of spatial temporal variation 2 validating the improvement in estimating other snow related variables acquired from the pf and 3 examining the evolution of parameters in the pf and the benefits of the dual state parameter updating scheme 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the hryr is located in the southwest of qinghai province covering a drainage area of 139 000 km2 above the zhimenda station fig 1 ranging between 90 30 97 18 e and 32 24 35 46 n surrounded by the kunlun mountain in the north and the tanggula mountain in the south the hryr ranges from 3 500 to 6 400 m in elevation with a mean of 4 670 m with high terrain in the west and low in the east the mainstem flows from west to east the glacierized area in the hryr is 1 400 km2 only accounting for 1 of the study area and contributing more than 5 to the total runoff in addition to glacial meltwater snowmelt rainfall and ice meltwater from the frozen ground are also the main sources of runoff in the hryr affecting its interannual variability and long term evolution the hryr belongs to the transition zone between semi arid and semi humid areas the climate is dry and cold with strong solar radiation during 2003 2014 the annual mean air temperature in the study area was between 4 3 and 3 1 c with the highest monthly mean air temperature lower than 10 c the rain and heat are in the same period and precipitation mainly falls in summer under the influence of the monsoon climate from the southwest of the gulf of bangladesh the spatial distribution of precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest during 2003 2014 the annual precipitation in the hryr ranged from 340 to 530 mm with mean annual precipitation of 430 mm based on the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap gauge reanalysis product the study area has a large snow coverage area with the mean annual snow coverage area reaching 10 14 000 km2 and the maximum snow coverage area reaching 75 5 snow coverage area generally increases from october and peaks in february then snow gradually ablates and completely melts in june 2 2 data input forcing data for the snow model are precipitation and temperature the precipitation data were derived from the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap reanalysis gauge version precipitation product ushio et al 2003 the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa produced the gsmap by integrating precipitation products from multiple sensors such as gpm gmi trmm tmi and aqua advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system aqua amsr e kubota et al 2007 the spatial resolution is 0 1 covering the area between 60 n 60 s worldwide and the temporal resolution is 1 day temperature is used to divide the precipitation phase and to calculate the amount of snowmelt two types of temperatures were applied i e land surface temperature lst and near surface air temperature the lst was derived from two lst products mod11a1 and myd11a1 which were retrieved from observations of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensors on both the terra and aqua satellites the average of two sets of daytime and nighttime lsts were calculated as the daily mean lst to reduce random error and represent daily mean temperature the spatial resolution of lst is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 1 day https modis gsfc nasa gov near surface air temperatures were generated by the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn based on observations from surface meteorological stations with a spatial resolution of 0 5 and a temporal resolution of 1 day near surface air temperatures include daily maximum minimum and mean temperatures the daily mean temperature data were applied and downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution using linear regression chen et al 2017b han et al 2019 neteler 2010 swe data are needed for snowmelt model calibration and data assimilation but the swe data cannot be directly obtained from remote sensing we converted snow depth from a remotely sensed high spatial resolution 500 m snow depth product into swe through snow density dai et al 2018 generated the snow depth product by integrating snow cover area sca lst and pmw brightness temperature products the pmw data for this snow depth data set are brightness temperatures derived from amsr e sca and lst data for generating the high spatial resolution snow depth product were provided from the modis sensor the snow depth product has a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 1 day as for the relationship between snow depth and swe we developed a power function using observations of both swe and snow depth obtained from field experiments and meteorological stations across the upper yangtze river basin and its surrounding areas chen et al 2017b han et al 2019 the relationship derived is as follows 1 s w e 0 1794 sd 0 858 where swe is the snow water equivalent and sd is the snow depth from the snow depth product 3 methodology 3 1 snow model description we employed a temperature index snowmelt model to simulate the snowmelt process for the hryr which is a basin wide model that solves the mass balance for snowpack chen et al 2017b and han et al 2019 applied this model to the upper brahmaputra river basin and hryr respectively and described the model in detail in the snowmelt model precipitation is partitioned into rainfall snowfall and their mixture based on the mean temperature of the near surface air temperature and lst time series of basin averaged swe data can be derived after converting remotely sensed snow depth to swe which was used as the calibration reference of the snowmelt model six fixed parameters were determined after calibration table 1 and the calibration method was the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 we then ran the model with the calibrated parameters resulting in traditional calibration tc based output as the benchmark for comparison the temporal resolution of this model can be hourly daily or monthly whereas the spatial resolution depends on the forcing data in this study the model was executed on a daily basis with a spatial resolution of 1 km and six calibrated parameters for tc are shown in table 1 3 2 particle filter the pf is a commonly used data assimilation technique that can handle non linear models and all types of probability distributions the method was developed to estimate a state vector of interest e g swe with its probability distribution function pdf p xk where xk is the true state vector at time step k however xk is typically unobservable and we may only have its inaccurate observation zk and model estimation xi k the bayesian estimation theory is the theoretical basis for the pf in which the state space model of a dynamic system can be described as follows 2 x k f x k 1 θ k 1 u k 1 v k 1 3 z k h x k n k where the f function is the state function and it represents the snowmelt model in this study h is the observation function x is the state variable swe θ is the parameter vector u is the forcing data v and n are process and observation noise and k is the time variable bayesian filtering can be divided into two steps prediction and updating in the prediction step supposing the conditional pdf p xk 1 z 1 k 1 at time k 1 is available the prior pdf of the state at time k can be obtained according to the markov process of order one i e p xk xk 1 z 1 k 1 p xk xk 1 and the state xk at time k is only related to the state xk 1 at time k 1 4 p x k z 1 k 1 p x k x k 1 p x k 1 z 1 k 1 d x k 1 in the updating step the new measurement observation zk at time k is available and can be used to update the prior pdf based on bayes theorem 5 p x k z 1 k p z k x k p x k z 1 k 1 p z k z 1 k 1 the normalizing constant in eq 5 6 p z k z 1 k 1 p z k x k p x k z 1 k 1 d x k is determined by the likelihood function p zk xk defined by the observation function h and observation noise n as shown in the equations above the integral operation is needed in bayesian estimation which is difficult to solve if the posterior pdf is non gaussian based on the monte carlo mc method we assumed that n particles xi k wi k n i 1 can be sampled independently from the state s posterior pdf p xk z 1 k and the posterior pdf at time step k can be approximated by 7 p x k z 1 k i 1 n w k i δ x k x k i where δ is the dirac delta function xi k is the state of particle i at time step k wi k is its weight and the weights are normalized such that σ n i 1wi k 1 and the weight at time step k can be derived according to the weight at time step k 1 8 w k i w k 1 i p z k x k i where p zk xi k is the likelihood function that describes the probability of observation zk given the particle estimate xi k lower if zk and xi k are far apart the state variable can be approximated by 9 x k i 1 n x k i w k i after a couple of iterations the weight of most particles becomes small and only a few particles still have large weights i e degeneracy phenomenon to solve this problem gordon et al 1993 combined a resampling algorithm with aforementioned method and generated the basic algorithm of the particle filter sequential importance resampling sir scheme particles with large weights will be retained or copied whereas particles with small weights will be removed and the particle number should remain unchanged the specific steps are as follows particle weight updating it is assumed that the prior pdf of the state variable at time k 1 can be approximated by n particles xi k 1 1 n n i 1 with equal weight 1 n after obtaining the observation zk 1 at time step k 1 the weight of each particle is recalculated according to eq 8 and then the particle weights are normalized particle resampling the larger the weight the more times the particle replicates and the particles with too small weights will be removed directly in this process the total number of particles remains unchanged after resampling the particle weights are set to 1 n equally state variable prediction at the next moment using the state function f to predict the state of each particle at time k and obtaining the predicted particle set at time k xi k 1 n n i 1 when the observation zk at time step k is obtained the weights of the particles are updated as per step 1 repeat the above steps until the end of data assimilation time updating and resampling of the parameter were also carried out using the importance density form 10 q θ k i θ k 1 i z k p θ k i θ k 1 i the parameters of particles were assigned uniformly from parameter lower bounds to upper bounds at the start after the importance weights are updated as eq 8 the parameters are then updated and resampled using the same weights as state variables however the parameters do not vary with the state function as the state variables do the parameter particles easily get into sample impoverishment during resampling the problem of sample impoverishment can be avoided by adding a gaussian noise to perturb parameters at each assimilation time step moradkhani et al 2005a 11 θ k 1 i θ k r e i ε k i ε k i n 0 var k θ where θi k re is the parameter after resampling at the time step k εi k is a normally distributed random noise with zero mean and variance varθ k varθ k is the variance of parameter particles at time k before resampling varθ k is confined by the upper and lower limits with a minimum variance corresponding to 2 of the initial parameter uncertainty range and a maximum variance corresponding to 16 of the initial parameter uncertainty range the complete procedure of the dual state parameter pf method was conducted as fig 2 3 3 data assimilation setup magnusson et al 2017 suggested that more than 100 particles are needed to stabilize the performance of the pf we also performed a sensitivity analysis of simulation performance to the number of particles indicating that the performance of the pf could stabilize when using more than 100 particles therefore the particle number was set as 100 here the temporal resolution of the snow depth product is 1 day but we selected snow depth data semimonthly to make the assimilation frequency close to the sampling interval of remote sensing and field surveys in addition quality control by removing snow depth maps with no data grid cells is a prerequisite for the good performance of the pf during the data assimilation process each grid cell needs to update parameters and state variables which is different from the tc because only the basin averaged swe was compared with the calibration reference in the tc to account for forcing data measurement errors that are possible sources of model uncertainty we need to perturb precipitation and temperature data with random noise however the probability distributions of precipitation and temperature varied in previous studies table 2 here we perturbed each particle s precipitation with multiplicative random noise from a normal distribution that had a mean of 1 and standard deviation of 0 5 as for temperature we perturbed it by adding a normally distributed random noise with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0 5 the pf requires the uncertainty of snow depth measurements dai et al 2018 reported the uncertainty of the remotely sensed snow depth with a root mean square error of 7 cm we defined the standard deviation of swe retrieval error as 5 mm and nearly the same results were derived when changing the standard deviation value to 2 and 10 mm indicating that the results are not sensitive to this parameter 3 4 performance metrics we defined the pf best estimate of state variables as the mean value of all particles over time as shown in table 3 multiple performance metrics were used in this study to evaluate the time series of swe estimates from the pf and tc we calculated the root mean square error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 pearson correlation coefficient cc and mean relative bias bias apart from rmse and cc mean absolute error mae mean percentage error mpe and mean absolute percentage difference mapd were used to evaluate the spatial distribution of the swe estimation to evaluate the detection performance of simulated snowfall from the tc and pf against gauge based observations probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and the critical success index csi were also used ebert et al 2007 han et al 2019 tang et al 2018 2016 where sim i is the simulated variables from tc or pf obs i is the observed variables sim is the mean of the simulations and obs is the mean of the observations n 11 represents the snowfall detected by gauge and simulation simultaneously n 01 represents snowfall that is not reflected by the simulation but observed by gauge and n 10 represents snowfall reflected by the simulation but not observed by gauge 4 results 4 1 performance of snow water equivalent estimation from the particle filter due to lacking accurate swe observations across large spatial domain we assumed swe retrievals from remote sensing as true swe values and assimilated swe retrievals with added random noise to validate the pf s effectiveness apart from the tc approach we also used the direct insertion di as a stricter benchmark the di used the parameters calibrated by the tc and replaced the swe estimation with swe retrievals on assimilation days therefore the performance of the pf would be as good as the di at best in the short term fig 3 and table 4 show year round time series for basin averaged swe estimation in water year wy 2006 07 wet 2009 10 normal and 2012 13 dry overall the pf improved the swe estimation from the tc in terms of rmse decreased by 7 18 bias decreased by 35 63 nse increased by 10 19 and cc increased by 3 4 at the same time the swe estimation from the pf matched the assumed true value more closely than the tc throughout the snow season though the magnitude of improvement was slightly lower than the results on data assimilation days the year round time series were acceptable considering only two days per month were data assimilation days in the pf approach both pf and di improved the swe estimation and their performance is pretty close the performance metrics of swe estimation from the pf were higher than the di in wy 2006 07 and 2012 13 and slightly lower than the di in wy 2009 10 we used the same calibrated parameters derived from the tc when applying the di approach which actually makes use of information on swe retrievals more than once and the comparison was stricter for the pf than the di however the pf approach achieved almost the same performance as the di indicating the advantages of the pf approach compared with the tc both underestimation and overestimation of the swe estimates were improved by using the pf approach benefiting from perturbing parameters at a relatively large range the swe estimation from the tc was not generally higher or lower throughout the year exhibiting underestimation or overestimation with a small perturbation range for parameters the pf tends to be consistent since the first data assimilation time step for example the pf improved underestimation at the first step and it would show higher values than the tc for the entire period it should be noted that semi month swe retrievals were used in the pf whereas all qualified swe retrievals were used in the tc almost daily however the performance of the pf is comparable or even better than the tc particularly reducing the rmse and bias obviously the pf approach maximizes the value of swe retrievals and the swe values of each grid cell were fully used to update the parameters on the grid cell scale therefore the pf approach substantially improves the utilization of reference data and achieves the goal of simulating snowmelt processes with dynamic parameters indicating large potential of applicability compared to the potential of traditional calibration approaches apart from time series of basin averaged swe estimation spatial distributions of annual mean swe estimation from the pf approach in wy 2006 07 2009 10 and 2012 13 are also shown fig 4 and table 5 in general the pf data assimilation approach improved the spatial distribution of annual mean swe estimation compared with the tc with rmse decreased by 15 30 mae decreased by 23 34 mpe decreased by 39 48 mapd decreased by 29 39 and cc increased by 8 31 in particular in the southwestern and southeastern regions of the hryr the spatial distribution of swe estimation from the pf is highly consistent with the satellite based retrievals whereas the tc shows relatively large deviation i e underestimation in wy 2006 07 and 2009 10 but overestimation in wy 2012 13 in addition the pf approach improved the spatial distribution more obviously than the basin averaged time series which may result from the dynamic parameters updated on the grid cell scale as for comparison with the di performance metrics of swe estimation from the pf were higher than those of the di in wy 2006 07 and 2012 13 but slightly lower than those of the di in wy 2009 10 overall the performance of the pf was comparable or even better than the di indicating the reliability of the pf data assimilation approach lines were found in the spatial distribution of swe estimation from the tc particularly in wy 2006 07 which may be associated with the spatial distribution of meteorological forcing data i e precipitation and temperature fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of annual mean precipitation from gsmap and mean temperature of near surface air and land surface temperatures in wy 2006 07 the temperature is generally higher over low elevation areas such as the middle and southeast parts of the hryr than the fringes the spatial distribution of the temperature is smoother than the precipitation and no stripes were found precipitation decreased from southeast to northwest over the hryr in wy 2006 07 and obvious stripes were found in the spatial distribution of precipitation that is similar to the tc swe estimation in addition the width of stripes is the spatial resolution of the gsmap precipitation product i e 0 1 lines shown in the spatial distribution of swe estimation are therefore attributed to those of the precipitation 4 2 performance of snowfall and snowmelt estimates from the particle filter snowfall in situ measurements were used as an independent data source for validation there are four meteorological stations in the hryr and the performance of the pf was similar in these stations fig 6 shows results at station 52908 demonstrating the improvement of the pf on snowfall estimation as shown in fig 6 there are mainly two peaks for snowfall one is in winter dec feb in the following year and the other is in early summer may jun snowfall in winter was typically small caused by little precipitation as for relatively large snowfall in early summer this is due to high elevation and abundant precipitation in the study area xu 2011 positive values mean overestimation whereas negative values mean underestimation in fig 6 snowfall error i e snowfall estimation minus observation from the pf was smaller than that from the tc specifically the pf mitigated the overestimation in all three hydrological years indicating that the pf improves snowfall estimation more than the tc to a certain degree as for performance metrics table 6 shows that the pf data assimilation approach improved snowfall estimation at station 52908 lowering rmse by 16 32 and far by 10 54 and enhancing cc by 58 83 and csi by 13 29 pod values in the tc and pf scenarios were close implying that the ability of detection was not improved much enhancement of cc was largest among these metrics with values higher than 0 5 in addition far values in the pf scenario generally decreased suggesting the reduced possibility of false detection 4 3 evolution of parameters in the particle filter approach according to the results above state and flux variables i e swe and snowfall were improved by using the pf approach as compared with the tc in this section the parameter values derived from the tc and pf approaches are analyzed we applied a parameter updating scheme in the pf approach which is quite different from the fixed parameter scheme in the tc table 1 and the parameters were therefore spatiotemporally variable the time series of basin average parameters vary throughout the year fig 7 parameters in wy 2009 10 which is a normal year were relatively stable with only parameter4 temperature threshold of rainfall and parameter6 percentage of snow after sublimation varying within a small range parameters in wy 2006 07 and 2012 13 fluctuated obviously particularly in wy 2012 13 which is a dry year therefore parameters tend to be stable over time in average years but tend to vary over time in wet or dry years this may be associated with large changes in forcing data precipitation and temperature during the snow accumulation and ablation seasons in wet or dry years resulting in the change in criteria for snow accumulation and melt over time more specifically both parameter1 and parameter2 i e two degree day factors ddf 6 and ddf 12 increased from winter to summer particularly in the snow ablation season leading to increased snowmelt and consequently decreased swe both parameter3 and parameter4 i e temperature thresholds of rainfall and snowfall were relatively stable with small variability parameter5 snowmelt temperature threshold decreased from winter to summer and therefore swe decreased which is caused by increased snowmelt parameter6 percentage of snow after sublimation decreased during winter and spring indicating that snow sublimation was enhanced leading to decreased swe in conclusion parameters in the pf approach are largely different from the tc varying over time and showing a tendency to increase snowmelt and therefore to reduce swe in addition to the temporal variability of the parameters from the pf approach they also showed some spatial variability spatial distributions of the six parameters were derived after data assimilation and the average deviation from mean annual basin average values was calculated to examine the spatial distribution characteristics fig 8 apparently the parameters deviated from the mean value and all parameters exhibited patch features except two degree day factors parameter1 and parameter2 positive and negative deviations of both parameter1 and parameter2 were alternatively distributed suggesting the need for setting the parameters spatially variable as shown in yellow positive and blue negative color in fig 8 large deviation was mainly distributed over the fringe area of the hryr the elevation of the fringe area is typically high indicating that the parameters showed higher variability over high elevation regions at the same time patterns of the different parameters were similar in wy 2009 10 reflected by yellow southwestern and northeastern parts and blue areas northwestern part for parameter3 6 fig 8 c f in summary parameters in the average year wy 2009 10 tended to show higher spatial stability and consistency than the dry or wet year to examine the spatial distribution of average deviation further fig 9 explicitly shows the relationship between the elevation and average deviation of six parameters parameters in low elevation areas below 4500 m were close to mean annual basin average values with a small range of average deviation the deviation range for areas above 4500 m was large and the area accounts for 86 of the total study area as for regions with elevations above 5500 m only accounting for 1 of the total area the deviation range was even larger overall the deviation range of parameters enlarges with increasing elevations showing an abrupt increase at an elevation of 4300 m and then approaches to be flat above 4500 m the deviation range of parameters seems to be related to basin elevation but the physical mechanism between them is not quite clear therefore many other basin characteristics were tested to analyze parameter variability further basin slope aspect and snowpack showed a weak relationship with parameter variability and then forcing data i e precipitation and temperature were investigated forcing data were perturbed to incorporate possible errors such as the error introduced by data processing and measurement the precipitation was downscaled from 0 1 to 1 km therefore the precipitation data have not only measurement error but also possible error introduced by the downscaling process after perturbation with the multiplicative random noise from a normal distribution precipitation data were able to be corrected to the true value the near surface air temperature downscaled from 0 5 to 1 km was also able to include possible errors by perturbing with the normally distributed additive random noise the precipitation forcing is irrelevant with parameter variability whereas the temperature forcing shows a similar pattern with basin elevation hence fig 10 shows the scatterplot between elevation and multi year average temperature of the near surface air temperature and lst basin elevation and the average temperature showed an obvious linear relationship which can be approximated by the linear function as follows 12 t 0 006572 h 29 14 where h is the basin elevation m and t is the average temperature c of the near surface air temperature and lst the elevation of 4500 m which is the threshold elevation of parameter variability corresponds to the average temperature of 0 c and the calculated temperature with an elevation of 4 500 m by eq 12 is 0 4 c which is close to 0 c therefore it can be stated that the deviation range of parameters enlarges with decreasing temperatures and then approaches to be flat below 2 c snowpack over low elevation regions with average temperatures higher than 0 c could completely melt in a year so that snow model could simulate such a case with small parameter variability however snowpack over high elevation regions with average temperatures lower than 0 c may melt more or less as compared with the case using fixed parameters then only large parameter variability over high elevation regions could well simulate the actual snow distribution given the area above 4500 m accounts for 86 of the total study area parameters in most parts of the hryr should deviate from mean annual basin average values indicating the applicability of the pf approach that results in spatially variable parameters 5 discussion and conclusion limitations still exist in this study for example more validation and snow density simulation are needed due to lacking in situ snow depth swe measurements we could not validate the simulated swe on a point scale however our study verifies the reliability of the pf method by assuming remotely sensed data as the true value and using another independent data source i e snowfall observations from meteorological stations based on these validation results the pf is able to improve the snow simulation compared with the tc and can make full use of the swe retrievals previous studies suggested that variability in swe is largely controlled by snow depth which varies more than snow density in alpine areas elder et al 1991 logan 1973 however variation in snow density should be considered to further improve snow simulation snow density over high mountain regions can vary widely across a basin e g observed snow density ranging from 190 to 500 kg m3 reported in wetlaufer et al 2016 the spatial distribution of density is highly related to elevation and incoming solar radiation which may have an effect on snowmelt and parameter evolution the snowmelt model used in the study does not contain a physically based module for snow density remotely sensed snow depth retrievals were converted into swe based on the relationship between in situ snow depth and swe uncertainty introduced by snow density was therefore not considered and the process of snow density simulation needs to be included in further research overall we examined the potential of assimilating high resolution satellite based swe estimates into a snow model using a dual state parameter particle filter to generate reliable estimates of model parameters and key snow states and fluxes a high spatial resolution remote sensing snow depth product 500 m was converted into swe which was then assimilated into the temperature index snowmelt model using the pf the pf approach improves the performance of swe time series and spatial distribution compared to tc in terms of rmse decreased by 7 18 and 15 30 respectively though the improvement is not that remarkable the pf shows the ability in snow simulation particularly the pf approach alleviates the underestimation or overestimation of the estimated swe time series with perturbed parameters performance of the swe simulation with the pf was comparable or even better than the assimilation by the direct insertion indicating the reliability of the pf approach with another independent validation data source i e snowfall observations the pf is found effective in snowfall estimation with increased cc compared to the tc moreover the time series and spatial distribution of parameters suggest the limitations of fixed parameters in the tc as well as the necessity and reliability of setting parameters variable in the pf approach with spatiotemporally varied parameters in the pf the snow model could well simulate the actual snow distribution particularly over high elevation regions where average temperatures are lower than 0 c while fixed parameters in the tc cannot this study shows the ability of the dual state parameter

4875,snow varies widely in space and time over high mountain regions accurately representing the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent swe is critically important for improving our understanding of snow accumulation and melt processes despite its importance in situ observations are lacking in poorly gauged regions such as the headwater region of the yangtze river hryr traditional remotely sensed retrievals are highly uncertain due to the effect of cloudiness e g optical remote sensing derived snow cover area and the coarse spatial resolution e g passive microwave remote sensing derived snow depth hydrological modeling is a powerful way to understand the snow processes but uncertainty still exists due to model deficiency and errors of forcing data assimilating high spatial resolution remotely sensed snow data into a snowmelt model may be potentially valuable for more accurate snow predictions in this study a high spatial resolution remotely sensed snow depth data set 500 m derived by integrating snow cover area land surface temperature and passive microwave brightness temperature products was assimilated into a snowmelt model within a particle filter pf assimilation framework which updates both model state variables and parameters simultaneously after assimilation the time series of basin averaged swe estimation showed an appreciable improvement with respect to the simulation with the traditional calibration tc method in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient increased by 10 20 and root mean square error rmse decreased by 7 18 the pf approach also greatly improved the spatial distribution of swe estimation with rmse decreased by 15 30 the swe estimation from the pf was also comparable or even better than that from another assimilation scheme namely the direct insertion comparison with in situ snowfall data indicated that the simulated snowfall from the pf outperformed the tc with rmse decreased by 15 32 and correlation coefficient increased by 58 83 furthermore the evolution of parameters suggested the applicability of the pf method with spatially variable parameters with spatiotemporally variable parameters in the pf the snow model could perfectly simulate the actual snow distribution particularly over high elevation regions where the average temperature was lower than 0 c while fixed parameters in the tc cannot simulate the variable snow distribution the proposed data assimilation framework has large potential of improving the accuracy of snow prediction across poorly gauged high mountain areas keywords dual state parameter updating scheme particle filter high spatial resolution remotely sensed snow depth snow water equivalent headwaters of the yangtze river 1 introduction seasonal snowpack is an essential resource for a variety of human activities including water supply for domestic use irrigation and hydropower generation particularly in arid or semi arid environments han et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2010 viviroli et al 2007a viviroli 2004 in addition snow is among the most important parts of the cryosphere and it acts as an indispensable link to other components in hydrological processes over cryospheric regions such as the headwaters of china s yangtze river hereafter hryr with seasonal and interannual variations snow responds to atmospheric circulations and climate change for example climate warming often leads to decreases in snowpack and shortening of the snow season in mountainous regions with a reduction in snow cover surface albedo will decrease and hence more solar radiation will be absorbed by the land surface which will further increase global warming rates chen et al 2017a as a result snow has a vital influence and feedback on the surface energy balance hydrological fluxes and the atmospheric cycle accurate snow information from observations or simulations is essential for understanding climate dynamics and climate change in high mountain cryospheric regions despite its importance ground observations cannot capture the spatial and temporal distribution of snowpack in poorly gauged regions bales et al 2006 remote sensing provides an unprecedented opportunity to resolve data scarcity huang et al 2019 2018a 2018b li et al 2019a 2019b li and long 2020 long et al 2019 2020 for instance optical remote sensing can provide the spatial distribution of snow cover at high resolution e g 500 m however optical remote sensing based snow cover is subject to cloud contamination passive microwave pmw sensors onboard satellites have the potential of providing not only snow cover extent but also snow mass observations globally without being impacted by cloudiness and night conditions foster et al 2005 however swe retrievals from pmw remote sensing have large uncertainty controlled by snowpack mass distance to significant open water bodies daytime air temperature forest cover snow class i e snow classification based on typical snow layer sequence thickness density crystal morphology and grain characteristics and topographic roughness and aspect dong et al 2005 in addition swe retrievals from pmw have relatively coarse spatial resolution e g 25 km and therefore cannot reflect detailed variations in snowpack in mountainous regions airborne lidar such as the airborne snow observatory aso mission could provide near real time monitoring of basin wide snow depths at the meter scale but has the limitation of temporal resolution and spatial coverage painter et al 2016 hydrological modeling is another way to understand hydrological processes such as snow accumulation and melt at catchment scales to simulate hydrological processes robustly a well developed hydrological model with proper parameterization calibration and evaluation is required gurtz et al 2003 refsgaard 1997 uhlenbrook and leibundgut 2002 viviroli et al 2007b so far various hydrological models have been developed and applied to simulate snow accumulation and melting processes including temperature index models dewalle et al 2002 he et al 2014 hock 1999 and energy balance models herrero et al 2009 hock and holmgren 2005 kustas et al 1994 energy balance snowmelt models could explicitly describe the complex process such as rain on snow and are independent of relationships based on historical data garen and marks 2005 nevertheless the need for a lot of meteorological observations as model forcing has restricted the application of energy balanced models in poorly gauged regions like the hryr as for temperature index models they may not be able to accurately simulate snowmelt processes under the circumstances where temperatures cannot well surrogate energy input to the snowpack hock 1999 in addition the models may need to be calibrated more than 1000 times before optimization to explore the parameter space caused by the highly parameterized nature of distributed models khakbaz et al 2012 running time for a single simulation which can be affected by many factors like the length of the simulation period model s complexity and the size of study region often ranges from minutes to days mugunthan and shoemaker 2006 zhang et al 2009 the calibration process may therefore result in computational burden which needs to be considered in intensive modeling effort data assimilation has been developed to utilize in situ and or remotely sensed measurements to improve model prediction skill due to the difficulty of accurately estimating snowpack properties ensemble kalman filter enkf is a widely used data assimilation method which estimates the probability density of a system state for every time step evensen 2003 however enkf requires dynamic models with gaussian uncertainties which is limited in cases with non gaussian uncertainties moradkhani et al 2005b sequential monte carlo smc methods namely the particle filter pf are then developed with the potential for nonlinear non gaussian applications moradkhani et al 2005a many studies have been performed to explore the applicability of the pf in snow simulation charrois et al 2016 tested the ability of assimilating optical reflectance data with the crocus model which is a detailed multilayer snowpack model used for avalanche forecasting and hydrological modeling vionnet et al 2012 results showed that the pf improved snow depth and swe simulations with reduced uncertainty dechant and moradkhani 2011 explored the operational potential of assimilating pmw frequencies with the snow 17 model after assimilation with the pf the swe prediction during the winter improved whereas there are large uncertainties in spring estimation leisenring and moradkhani 2011 assimilated swe observations from a snotel station to improve prediction of model states as well as parameters suggesting the potential of the pf in swe prediction smyth et al 2019 assimilated monthly snow depth observations with an energy balanced snowmelt model snobal which is a two layer snowpack model for points marks and dozier 1992 marks et al 1992 they found that assimilating snow depth observations with the pf improved snow density estimation and therefore improved swe prediction there are more studies about the pf in addition to the research listed above but most of them assimilated snow depth observations or remote sensing based swe retrievals only at point based sites or at a coarse spatial resolution given the high spatial variability of snow across mountainous and forested regions basin wide data assimilation at a fine spatial scale using the pf may have large potential margulis et al 2019 adopted snow depths derived from the nasa s airborne snow observatory aso to improve snow simulation the lidar derived snow depths with a high spatial resolution up to 50 m could effectively improve the snow simulation on spatial scales however the airborne lidar observation has limited spatial and temporal coverage relative to satellite based retrievals and cannot be applied to other regions or on larger scales in our study a remotely sensed high spatial resolution snow depth product 500 m was used for assimilation at the spatial resolution of 1 km not only did we validate the snow simulation with in situ observations but also validated the performance of the pf at the basin scale moreover few previous studies updated model parameters one of the most important factors that affect the model performance the dual state parameter updating scheme of the pf proposed in this study provides another way for deriving parameters which is quite different from traditional calibration approaches that often result in static parameter sets parameters in the pf approach are spatiotemporally variable via parameter updating at each time step whereas the parameters in traditional calibration approaches are often fixed for the entire basin throughout the simulation period the overall objective of this study was to examine the applicability of the dual state parameter updating scheme with the pf on the basin scale over the hryr above the zhimenda gauging station a temperature index snowmelt model chen et al 2017b han et al 2019 2020 huang et al 2020 will be applied to assimilate snow depth retrievals from a high spatial resolution remotely sensed snow depth product 500 m to achieve this objective this study involves 1 exploring the improvement in swe estimation from the pf method in terms of spatial temporal variation 2 validating the improvement in estimating other snow related variables acquired from the pf and 3 examining the evolution of parameters in the pf and the benefits of the dual state parameter updating scheme 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the hryr is located in the southwest of qinghai province covering a drainage area of 139 000 km2 above the zhimenda station fig 1 ranging between 90 30 97 18 e and 32 24 35 46 n surrounded by the kunlun mountain in the north and the tanggula mountain in the south the hryr ranges from 3 500 to 6 400 m in elevation with a mean of 4 670 m with high terrain in the west and low in the east the mainstem flows from west to east the glacierized area in the hryr is 1 400 km2 only accounting for 1 of the study area and contributing more than 5 to the total runoff in addition to glacial meltwater snowmelt rainfall and ice meltwater from the frozen ground are also the main sources of runoff in the hryr affecting its interannual variability and long term evolution the hryr belongs to the transition zone between semi arid and semi humid areas the climate is dry and cold with strong solar radiation during 2003 2014 the annual mean air temperature in the study area was between 4 3 and 3 1 c with the highest monthly mean air temperature lower than 10 c the rain and heat are in the same period and precipitation mainly falls in summer under the influence of the monsoon climate from the southwest of the gulf of bangladesh the spatial distribution of precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest during 2003 2014 the annual precipitation in the hryr ranged from 340 to 530 mm with mean annual precipitation of 430 mm based on the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap gauge reanalysis product the study area has a large snow coverage area with the mean annual snow coverage area reaching 10 14 000 km2 and the maximum snow coverage area reaching 75 5 snow coverage area generally increases from october and peaks in february then snow gradually ablates and completely melts in june 2 2 data input forcing data for the snow model are precipitation and temperature the precipitation data were derived from the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap reanalysis gauge version precipitation product ushio et al 2003 the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa produced the gsmap by integrating precipitation products from multiple sensors such as gpm gmi trmm tmi and aqua advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system aqua amsr e kubota et al 2007 the spatial resolution is 0 1 covering the area between 60 n 60 s worldwide and the temporal resolution is 1 day temperature is used to divide the precipitation phase and to calculate the amount of snowmelt two types of temperatures were applied i e land surface temperature lst and near surface air temperature the lst was derived from two lst products mod11a1 and myd11a1 which were retrieved from observations of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensors on both the terra and aqua satellites the average of two sets of daytime and nighttime lsts were calculated as the daily mean lst to reduce random error and represent daily mean temperature the spatial resolution of lst is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 1 day https modis gsfc nasa gov near surface air temperatures were generated by the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn based on observations from surface meteorological stations with a spatial resolution of 0 5 and a temporal resolution of 1 day near surface air temperatures include daily maximum minimum and mean temperatures the daily mean temperature data were applied and downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution using linear regression chen et al 2017b han et al 2019 neteler 2010 swe data are needed for snowmelt model calibration and data assimilation but the swe data cannot be directly obtained from remote sensing we converted snow depth from a remotely sensed high spatial resolution 500 m snow depth product into swe through snow density dai et al 2018 generated the snow depth product by integrating snow cover area sca lst and pmw brightness temperature products the pmw data for this snow depth data set are brightness temperatures derived from amsr e sca and lst data for generating the high spatial resolution snow depth product were provided from the modis sensor the snow depth product has a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 1 day as for the relationship between snow depth and swe we developed a power function using observations of both swe and snow depth obtained from field experiments and meteorological stations across the upper yangtze river basin and its surrounding areas chen et al 2017b han et al 2019 the relationship derived is as follows 1 s w e 0 1794 sd 0 858 where swe is the snow water equivalent and sd is the snow depth from the snow depth product 3 methodology 3 1 snow model description we employed a temperature index snowmelt model to simulate the snowmelt process for the hryr which is a basin wide model that solves the mass balance for snowpack chen et al 2017b and han et al 2019 applied this model to the upper brahmaputra river basin and hryr respectively and described the model in detail in the snowmelt model precipitation is partitioned into rainfall snowfall and their mixture based on the mean temperature of the near surface air temperature and lst time series of basin averaged swe data can be derived after converting remotely sensed snow depth to swe which was used as the calibration reference of the snowmelt model six fixed parameters were determined after calibration table 1 and the calibration method was the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 we then ran the model with the calibrated parameters resulting in traditional calibration tc based output as the benchmark for comparison the temporal resolution of this model can be hourly daily or monthly whereas the spatial resolution depends on the forcing data in this study the model was executed on a daily basis with a spatial resolution of 1 km and six calibrated parameters for tc are shown in table 1 3 2 particle filter the pf is a commonly used data assimilation technique that can handle non linear models and all types of probability distributions the method was developed to estimate a state vector of interest e g swe with its probability distribution function pdf p xk where xk is the true state vector at time step k however xk is typically unobservable and we may only have its inaccurate observation zk and model estimation xi k the bayesian estimation theory is the theoretical basis for the pf in which the state space model of a dynamic system can be described as follows 2 x k f x k 1 θ k 1 u k 1 v k 1 3 z k h x k n k where the f function is the state function and it represents the snowmelt model in this study h is the observation function x is the state variable swe θ is the parameter vector u is the forcing data v and n are process and observation noise and k is the time variable bayesian filtering can be divided into two steps prediction and updating in the prediction step supposing the conditional pdf p xk 1 z 1 k 1 at time k 1 is available the prior pdf of the state at time k can be obtained according to the markov process of order one i e p xk xk 1 z 1 k 1 p xk xk 1 and the state xk at time k is only related to the state xk 1 at time k 1 4 p x k z 1 k 1 p x k x k 1 p x k 1 z 1 k 1 d x k 1 in the updating step the new measurement observation zk at time k is available and can be used to update the prior pdf based on bayes theorem 5 p x k z 1 k p z k x k p x k z 1 k 1 p z k z 1 k 1 the normalizing constant in eq 5 6 p z k z 1 k 1 p z k x k p x k z 1 k 1 d x k is determined by the likelihood function p zk xk defined by the observation function h and observation noise n as shown in the equations above the integral operation is needed in bayesian estimation which is difficult to solve if the posterior pdf is non gaussian based on the monte carlo mc method we assumed that n particles xi k wi k n i 1 can be sampled independently from the state s posterior pdf p xk z 1 k and the posterior pdf at time step k can be approximated by 7 p x k z 1 k i 1 n w k i δ x k x k i where δ is the dirac delta function xi k is the state of particle i at time step k wi k is its weight and the weights are normalized such that σ n i 1wi k 1 and the weight at time step k can be derived according to the weight at time step k 1 8 w k i w k 1 i p z k x k i where p zk xi k is the likelihood function that describes the probability of observation zk given the particle estimate xi k lower if zk and xi k are far apart the state variable can be approximated by 9 x k i 1 n x k i w k i after a couple of iterations the weight of most particles becomes small and only a few particles still have large weights i e degeneracy phenomenon to solve this problem gordon et al 1993 combined a resampling algorithm with aforementioned method and generated the basic algorithm of the particle filter sequential importance resampling sir scheme particles with large weights will be retained or copied whereas particles with small weights will be removed and the particle number should remain unchanged the specific steps are as follows particle weight updating it is assumed that the prior pdf of the state variable at time k 1 can be approximated by n particles xi k 1 1 n n i 1 with equal weight 1 n after obtaining the observation zk 1 at time step k 1 the weight of each particle is recalculated according to eq 8 and then the particle weights are normalized particle resampling the larger the weight the more times the particle replicates and the particles with too small weights will be removed directly in this process the total number of particles remains unchanged after resampling the particle weights are set to 1 n equally state variable prediction at the next moment using the state function f to predict the state of each particle at time k and obtaining the predicted particle set at time k xi k 1 n n i 1 when the observation zk at time step k is obtained the weights of the particles are updated as per step 1 repeat the above steps until the end of data assimilation time updating and resampling of the parameter were also carried out using the importance density form 10 q θ k i θ k 1 i z k p θ k i θ k 1 i the parameters of particles were assigned uniformly from parameter lower bounds to upper bounds at the start after the importance weights are updated as eq 8 the parameters are then updated and resampled using the same weights as state variables however the parameters do not vary with the state function as the state variables do the parameter particles easily get into sample impoverishment during resampling the problem of sample impoverishment can be avoided by adding a gaussian noise to perturb parameters at each assimilation time step moradkhani et al 2005a 11 θ k 1 i θ k r e i ε k i ε k i n 0 var k θ where θi k re is the parameter after resampling at the time step k εi k is a normally distributed random noise with zero mean and variance varθ k varθ k is the variance of parameter particles at time k before resampling varθ k is confined by the upper and lower limits with a minimum variance corresponding to 2 of the initial parameter uncertainty range and a maximum variance corresponding to 16 of the initial parameter uncertainty range the complete procedure of the dual state parameter pf method was conducted as fig 2 3 3 data assimilation setup magnusson et al 2017 suggested that more than 100 particles are needed to stabilize the performance of the pf we also performed a sensitivity analysis of simulation performance to the number of particles indicating that the performance of the pf could stabilize when using more than 100 particles therefore the particle number was set as 100 here the temporal resolution of the snow depth product is 1 day but we selected snow depth data semimonthly to make the assimilation frequency close to the sampling interval of remote sensing and field surveys in addition quality control by removing snow depth maps with no data grid cells is a prerequisite for the good performance of the pf during the data assimilation process each grid cell needs to update parameters and state variables which is different from the tc because only the basin averaged swe was compared with the calibration reference in the tc to account for forcing data measurement errors that are possible sources of model uncertainty we need to perturb precipitation and temperature data with random noise however the probability distributions of precipitation and temperature varied in previous studies table 2 here we perturbed each particle s precipitation with multiplicative random noise from a normal distribution that had a mean of 1 and standard deviation of 0 5 as for temperature we perturbed it by adding a normally distributed random noise with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0 5 the pf requires the uncertainty of snow depth measurements dai et al 2018 reported the uncertainty of the remotely sensed snow depth with a root mean square error of 7 cm we defined the standard deviation of swe retrieval error as 5 mm and nearly the same results were derived when changing the standard deviation value to 2 and 10 mm indicating that the results are not sensitive to this parameter 3 4 performance metrics we defined the pf best estimate of state variables as the mean value of all particles over time as shown in table 3 multiple performance metrics were used in this study to evaluate the time series of swe estimates from the pf and tc we calculated the root mean square error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 pearson correlation coefficient cc and mean relative bias bias apart from rmse and cc mean absolute error mae mean percentage error mpe and mean absolute percentage difference mapd were used to evaluate the spatial distribution of the swe estimation to evaluate the detection performance of simulated snowfall from the tc and pf against gauge based observations probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and the critical success index csi were also used ebert et al 2007 han et al 2019 tang et al 2018 2016 where sim i is the simulated variables from tc or pf obs i is the observed variables sim is the mean of the simulations and obs is the mean of the observations n 11 represents the snowfall detected by gauge and simulation simultaneously n 01 represents snowfall that is not reflected by the simulation but observed by gauge and n 10 represents snowfall reflected by the simulation but not observed by gauge 4 results 4 1 performance of snow water equivalent estimation from the particle filter due to lacking accurate swe observations across large spatial domain we assumed swe retrievals from remote sensing as true swe values and assimilated swe retrievals with added random noise to validate the pf s effectiveness apart from the tc approach we also used the direct insertion di as a stricter benchmark the di used the parameters calibrated by the tc and replaced the swe estimation with swe retrievals on assimilation days therefore the performance of the pf would be as good as the di at best in the short term fig 3 and table 4 show year round time series for basin averaged swe estimation in water year wy 2006 07 wet 2009 10 normal and 2012 13 dry overall the pf improved the swe estimation from the tc in terms of rmse decreased by 7 18 bias decreased by 35 63 nse increased by 10 19 and cc increased by 3 4 at the same time the swe estimation from the pf matched the assumed true value more closely than the tc throughout the snow season though the magnitude of improvement was slightly lower than the results on data assimilation days the year round time series were acceptable considering only two days per month were data assimilation days in the pf approach both pf and di improved the swe estimation and their performance is pretty close the performance metrics of swe estimation from the pf were higher than the di in wy 2006 07 and 2012 13 and slightly lower than the di in wy 2009 10 we used the same calibrated parameters derived from the tc when applying the di approach which actually makes use of information on swe retrievals more than once and the comparison was stricter for the pf than the di however the pf approach achieved almost the same performance as the di indicating the advantages of the pf approach compared with the tc both underestimation and overestimation of the swe estimates were improved by using the pf approach benefiting from perturbing parameters at a relatively large range the swe estimation from the tc was not generally higher or lower throughout the year exhibiting underestimation or overestimation with a small perturbation range for parameters the pf tends to be consistent since the first data assimilation time step for example the pf improved underestimation at the first step and it would show higher values than the tc for the entire period it should be noted that semi month swe retrievals were used in the pf whereas all qualified swe retrievals were used in the tc almost daily however the performance of the pf is comparable or even better than the tc particularly reducing the rmse and bias obviously the pf approach maximizes the value of swe retrievals and the swe values of each grid cell were fully used to update the parameters on the grid cell scale therefore the pf approach substantially improves the utilization of reference data and achieves the goal of simulating snowmelt processes with dynamic parameters indicating large potential of applicability compared to the potential of traditional calibration approaches apart from time series of basin averaged swe estimation spatial distributions of annual mean swe estimation from the pf approach in wy 2006 07 2009 10 and 2012 13 are also shown fig 4 and table 5 in general the pf data assimilation approach improved the spatial distribution of annual mean swe estimation compared with the tc with rmse decreased by 15 30 mae decreased by 23 34 mpe decreased by 39 48 mapd decreased by 29 39 and cc increased by 8 31 in particular in the southwestern and southeastern regions of the hryr the spatial distribution of swe estimation from the pf is highly consistent with the satellite based retrievals whereas the tc shows relatively large deviation i e underestimation in wy 2006 07 and 2009 10 but overestimation in wy 2012 13 in addition the pf approach improved the spatial distribution more obviously than the basin averaged time series which may result from the dynamic parameters updated on the grid cell scale as for comparison with the di performance metrics of swe estimation from the pf were higher than those of the di in wy 2006 07 and 2012 13 but slightly lower than those of the di in wy 2009 10 overall the performance of the pf was comparable or even better than the di indicating the reliability of the pf data assimilation approach lines were found in the spatial distribution of swe estimation from the tc particularly in wy 2006 07 which may be associated with the spatial distribution of meteorological forcing data i e precipitation and temperature fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of annual mean precipitation from gsmap and mean temperature of near surface air and land surface temperatures in wy 2006 07 the temperature is generally higher over low elevation areas such as the middle and southeast parts of the hryr than the fringes the spatial distribution of the temperature is smoother than the precipitation and no stripes were found precipitation decreased from southeast to northwest over the hryr in wy 2006 07 and obvious stripes were found in the spatial distribution of precipitation that is similar to the tc swe estimation in addition the width of stripes is the spatial resolution of the gsmap precipitation product i e 0 1 lines shown in the spatial distribution of swe estimation are therefore attributed to those of the precipitation 4 2 performance of snowfall and snowmelt estimates from the particle filter snowfall in situ measurements were used as an independent data source for validation there are four meteorological stations in the hryr and the performance of the pf was similar in these stations fig 6 shows results at station 52908 demonstrating the improvement of the pf on snowfall estimation as shown in fig 6 there are mainly two peaks for snowfall one is in winter dec feb in the following year and the other is in early summer may jun snowfall in winter was typically small caused by little precipitation as for relatively large snowfall in early summer this is due to high elevation and abundant precipitation in the study area xu 2011 positive values mean overestimation whereas negative values mean underestimation in fig 6 snowfall error i e snowfall estimation minus observation from the pf was smaller than that from the tc specifically the pf mitigated the overestimation in all three hydrological years indicating that the pf improves snowfall estimation more than the tc to a certain degree as for performance metrics table 6 shows that the pf data assimilation approach improved snowfall estimation at station 52908 lowering rmse by 16 32 and far by 10 54 and enhancing cc by 58 83 and csi by 13 29 pod values in the tc and pf scenarios were close implying that the ability of detection was not improved much enhancement of cc was largest among these metrics with values higher than 0 5 in addition far values in the pf scenario generally decreased suggesting the reduced possibility of false detection 4 3 evolution of parameters in the particle filter approach according to the results above state and flux variables i e swe and snowfall were improved by using the pf approach as compared with the tc in this section the parameter values derived from the tc and pf approaches are analyzed we applied a parameter updating scheme in the pf approach which is quite different from the fixed parameter scheme in the tc table 1 and the parameters were therefore spatiotemporally variable the time series of basin average parameters vary throughout the year fig 7 parameters in wy 2009 10 which is a normal year were relatively stable with only parameter4 temperature threshold of rainfall and parameter6 percentage of snow after sublimation varying within a small range parameters in wy 2006 07 and 2012 13 fluctuated obviously particularly in wy 2012 13 which is a dry year therefore parameters tend to be stable over time in average years but tend to vary over time in wet or dry years this may be associated with large changes in forcing data precipitation and temperature during the snow accumulation and ablation seasons in wet or dry years resulting in the change in criteria for snow accumulation and melt over time more specifically both parameter1 and parameter2 i e two degree day factors ddf 6 and ddf 12 increased from winter to summer particularly in the snow ablation season leading to increased snowmelt and consequently decreased swe both parameter3 and parameter4 i e temperature thresholds of rainfall and snowfall were relatively stable with small variability parameter5 snowmelt temperature threshold decreased from winter to summer and therefore swe decreased which is caused by increased snowmelt parameter6 percentage of snow after sublimation decreased during winter and spring indicating that snow sublimation was enhanced leading to decreased swe in conclusion parameters in the pf approach are largely different from the tc varying over time and showing a tendency to increase snowmelt and therefore to reduce swe in addition to the temporal variability of the parameters from the pf approach they also showed some spatial variability spatial distributions of the six parameters were derived after data assimilation and the average deviation from mean annual basin average values was calculated to examine the spatial distribution characteristics fig 8 apparently the parameters deviated from the mean value and all parameters exhibited patch features except two degree day factors parameter1 and parameter2 positive and negative deviations of both parameter1 and parameter2 were alternatively distributed suggesting the need for setting the parameters spatially variable as shown in yellow positive and blue negative color in fig 8 large deviation was mainly distributed over the fringe area of the hryr the elevation of the fringe area is typically high indicating that the parameters showed higher variability over high elevation regions at the same time patterns of the different parameters were similar in wy 2009 10 reflected by yellow southwestern and northeastern parts and blue areas northwestern part for parameter3 6 fig 8 c f in summary parameters in the average year wy 2009 10 tended to show higher spatial stability and consistency than the dry or wet year to examine the spatial distribution of average deviation further fig 9 explicitly shows the relationship between the elevation and average deviation of six parameters parameters in low elevation areas below 4500 m were close to mean annual basin average values with a small range of average deviation the deviation range for areas above 4500 m was large and the area accounts for 86 of the total study area as for regions with elevations above 5500 m only accounting for 1 of the total area the deviation range was even larger overall the deviation range of parameters enlarges with increasing elevations showing an abrupt increase at an elevation of 4300 m and then approaches to be flat above 4500 m the deviation range of parameters seems to be related to basin elevation but the physical mechanism between them is not quite clear therefore many other basin characteristics were tested to analyze parameter variability further basin slope aspect and snowpack showed a weak relationship with parameter variability and then forcing data i e precipitation and temperature were investigated forcing data were perturbed to incorporate possible errors such as the error introduced by data processing and measurement the precipitation was downscaled from 0 1 to 1 km therefore the precipitation data have not only measurement error but also possible error introduced by the downscaling process after perturbation with the multiplicative random noise from a normal distribution precipitation data were able to be corrected to the true value the near surface air temperature downscaled from 0 5 to 1 km was also able to include possible errors by perturbing with the normally distributed additive random noise the precipitation forcing is irrelevant with parameter variability whereas the temperature forcing shows a similar pattern with basin elevation hence fig 10 shows the scatterplot between elevation and multi year average temperature of the near surface air temperature and lst basin elevation and the average temperature showed an obvious linear relationship which can be approximated by the linear function as follows 12 t 0 006572 h 29 14 where h is the basin elevation m and t is the average temperature c of the near surface air temperature and lst the elevation of 4500 m which is the threshold elevation of parameter variability corresponds to the average temperature of 0 c and the calculated temperature with an elevation of 4 500 m by eq 12 is 0 4 c which is close to 0 c therefore it can be stated that the deviation range of parameters enlarges with decreasing temperatures and then approaches to be flat below 2 c snowpack over low elevation regions with average temperatures higher than 0 c could completely melt in a year so that snow model could simulate such a case with small parameter variability however snowpack over high elevation regions with average temperatures lower than 0 c may melt more or less as compared with the case using fixed parameters then only large parameter variability over high elevation regions could well simulate the actual snow distribution given the area above 4500 m accounts for 86 of the total study area parameters in most parts of the hryr should deviate from mean annual basin average values indicating the applicability of the pf approach that results in spatially variable parameters 5 discussion and conclusion limitations still exist in this study for example more validation and snow density simulation are needed due to lacking in situ snow depth swe measurements we could not validate the simulated swe on a point scale however our study verifies the reliability of the pf method by assuming remotely sensed data as the true value and using another independent data source i e snowfall observations from meteorological stations based on these validation results the pf is able to improve the snow simulation compared with the tc and can make full use of the swe retrievals previous studies suggested that variability in swe is largely controlled by snow depth which varies more than snow density in alpine areas elder et al 1991 logan 1973 however variation in snow density should be considered to further improve snow simulation snow density over high mountain regions can vary widely across a basin e g observed snow density ranging from 190 to 500 kg m3 reported in wetlaufer et al 2016 the spatial distribution of density is highly related to elevation and incoming solar radiation which may have an effect on snowmelt and parameter evolution the snowmelt model used in the study does not contain a physically based module for snow density remotely sensed snow depth retrievals were converted into swe based on the relationship between in situ snow depth and swe uncertainty introduced by snow density was therefore not considered and the process of snow density simulation needs to be included in further research overall we examined the potential of assimilating high resolution satellite based swe estimates into a snow model using a dual state parameter particle filter to generate reliable estimates of model parameters and key snow states and fluxes a high spatial resolution remote sensing snow depth product 500 m was converted into swe which was then assimilated into the temperature index snowmelt model using the pf the pf approach improves the performance of swe time series and spatial distribution compared to tc in terms of rmse decreased by 7 18 and 15 30 respectively though the improvement is not that remarkable the pf shows the ability in snow simulation particularly the pf approach alleviates the underestimation or overestimation of the estimated swe time series with perturbed parameters performance of the swe simulation with the pf was comparable or even better than the assimilation by the direct insertion indicating the reliability of the pf approach with another independent validation data source i e snowfall observations the pf is found effective in snowfall estimation with increased cc compared to the tc moreover the time series and spatial distribution of parameters suggest the limitations of fixed parameters in the tc as well as the necessity and reliability of setting parameters variable in the pf approach with spatiotemporally varied parameters in the pf the snow model could well simulate the actual snow distribution particularly over high elevation regions where average temperatures are lower than 0 c while fixed parameters in the tc cannot this study shows the ability of the dual state parameter updating pf scheme in assimilating high resolution snow depth swe data in a snow model over the headwater regions of the yangtze river and could serve as a basis for pf applications across large and

4876,a variety of hydrogeologic conditions and parameters play roles in obtaining analytical solutions for groundwater flow in aquifers changes of these influencing conditions typically require finding a new solution therefore it is very useful if a general approach and solution can be provided to conveniently construct the solutions corresponding to the condition changes in this study two

describing flow mechanisms in various subsurface media despite their simplified conceptualizations regarding fluid and media properties and hydrogeologic conditions analytical solutions are important particularly in early project phases of preliminary design with insufficient aquifer characterization for estimating hydrogeologic parameters drawing flownet serving as benchmark cases for verifying numerical simulation models and estimating the scope of advective contaminant transport batu 1998 in general hydrogeologic conditions must be simplified and assumptions must be specified for deriving analytical solutions these include flow state steady or transient space dimension one two or three dimensional source sink geometry and position point line areal or volumetric vertical or horizontal partially or fully penetrating pumping modes instantaneous continuous or short period initial distribution of hydraulic head drawdown constant or following a known function aquifer thickness horizontal extent and confining state finite semi infinite or infinite confined or unconfined medium heterogeneity and anisotropy homogeneous or heterogeneous isotropic or anisotropic leakage from adjacent aquifers and precipitation recharge and evaporation changes in any of these influencing conditions and assumptions may result in different analytical solutions thus it would be very helpful if a generalized approach or solution can be developed to account for a variety of hydrogeologic conditions and assumptions batu 2015 sources sinks such as pumping wells are the most important components in groundwater flow systems a typical assumption for obtaining analytical solutions of well flow in large aquifers is that the well diameter is infinitely small i e the wellbore storage effect is neglected so that the well can be considered as a line source sink this zero radius assumption was originally proposed by theis 1935 and used extensively in groundwater hydrology for analyzing well tests e g hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1964 bear 1972 neuman 1975 zhan et al 2001 luo and kitanidis 2004 batu 2012 chen et al 2012 the wellbore storage effect was later considered for large diameter wells e g papadopulos and cooper 1967 moench 1985 hou and luo 2019 classic solutions and investigations indicated that the wellbore storage effect may be important or the zero radius approximation may not be valid near the pumping wells mueller and witherspoon 1965 this is also the case for the possible non darcian flow near the well e g qian et al 2005 wen et al 2006 in general if one is interested in the flow pattern over a large domain and the prediction of drawdowns in the pumping wells is not the goal the assumption of zero radius wells is valid and darcy s law is typically adopted for the entire domain based on these assumptions flow to vertical wells has been widely studied for many decades since the theis solution e g hantush 1961 1966 1967 neuman 1975 batu 1998 flow to horizontal and inclined wells has also been analytically described for their technical advantages over vertical wells in certain circumstances e g zhan 1999 kawecki 2000 zhan and zlotnik 2002 zhan and park 2003 kawecki and al subaikhy 2005 huang et al 2011 williams 2013 sureshjani and clarkson 2015 except for the widely studied line sink vertical or horizontal solutions and some point sink solutions solutions for groundwater flow to areal and volumetric sources sinks are rarely investigated in practice many hydraulic facilities can be simulated as areal or volumetric sources sinks for example a thin drainage ditch that cuts into the aquifer can be conceptualized as an areal sink and a block of densely distributed wells can be approximated as a volumetric source sink therefore it is also important for studying the flow to areal and volumetric sources sinks in aquifers in addition to point and linear sources sinks the pumping mode for the majority of published analytical solutions of groundwater flow is continuous extraction or injection with a constant flow rate for linear flow systems the solutions of instantaneous pumping can be readily obtained through numerical differentiation of the solutions for constant continuous pumping however explicit closed forms of instantaneous solutions are more useful as the transfer function to evaluate the solutions corresponding to arbitrary pumping schedules chen et al 2012 a typical application of instantaneous solutions is slug test which is an effective way to estimate local scale hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficients e g hyder and butler 1995 frink et al 1997 zurbuchen et al 2002 audouin and bodin 2008 brauchler 2010 fan and wang 2014 in this study we use green s function method gfm to derive general analytical solutions for groundwater flow in a homogeneous confined aquifer with infinite semi infinite or finite domains we consider one two and three dimensional groundwater flow toward point line areal and volumetric sources sinks two general solutions are derived one for instantaneous sources sinks and the other continuous sources sinks with or without leakage from adjacent aquifers and distributed precipitation recharge these two solutions in combination with the directional solutions for various conditions can be used to conveniently construct a library of analytical solutions for problems with specific hydrogeologic conditions some typical solutions for one two and three dimensional flow in confined aquifers are provided 2 methodology the steps to present the approach for constructing the general analytical solutions are as follows 1 the method for solutions of an instantaneous source sink in an infinite domain 2 solutions of continuous injection extraction in an infinite domain and 3 solutions in the semi infinite and finite domains 2 1 instantaneous solutions 2 1 1 general instantaneous solution in an infinite aquifer we consider an instantaneous water extraction from a point sink in an infinite homogeneous aquifer with leakage the mathematical model of hydraulic drawdown is 1a s s s t k x 2 s x 2 k y 2 s y 2 k z 2 s z 2 k s v δ t δ x y z x y z δ t 0 1b s x y z t t 0 0 x y z 1c s x y z t x y z 0 t 0 where s is the drawdown of the hydraulic head l s h 0 h h is the hydraulic head l h 0 is the initial head l k is the leakage coefficient and is defined as the volume of water that is released from or taken into storage per unit time per unit aquifer volume per unit head difference hantush 1961 t 1l 1 v is the water volume instantaneously extracted from the point sink l3 kx ky and kz are the principal hydraulic conductivity in the x y and z directions respectively lt 1 s s is the specific storage l 1 x y and z are the cartesian coordinates l t is the elapsed time since pumping started t δ t is the dirac delta function for time δ t 1 for t 0 δ t 0 for t 0 t 1 and δ x y z is the dirac delta function for position δ x y z 1 for x y z 0 δ x y z 0 otherwise l 3 it should be pointed out that there are no infinite aquifers in reality specially in z direction as most aquifers distribute in layers with finite thicknesses model 1 is just a mathematical treatment preparing basic solutions for further derivations with respect to more realistic conditions although an infinitely thick aquifer is practically impossible to receive the leaky recharge from adjacent aquifers the leakage term presented in the form firstly introduced by hantush 1961 is still retained in the model for the case in finitely thick aquifers the limitation of the assumption implied in this expression is discussed in section 3 k k b b where b is the aquifer thickness l b and k are the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard leaky confining layer respectively this model can be solved by using gfm leij et al 2000 the solution of this model can be generally expressed as wang and wu 2009 2 s v s s g k t g x x t g y y t g z z t where gk is the green function for the leakage term and is called leakage solution gx gy and gz are the directional green functions for the x y and z directions respectively and they are called directional solutions eq 2 indicates that the drawdown is the product of instantaneously pumped water volume multiplied by the leakage and directional solutions divided by specific storage differential eq 1a is simplified to d s d t ks s s if only the leakage term is retained at the right side obviously its solution has an exponential form thus the leakage solution is expressed as 3 g k t exp kt s s 2 1 2 directional solutions for a point directional length the length of a sink in a direction can be either infinitely small point or finite if the length is point in a direction the sink has a point directional length pdl if the length is finite the sink has a finite directional length fdl here we will first discuss the directional solutions for pdls and then for fdls the corresponding 1d model of eqs 1 at the x direction is 4 s s s t k x 2 s x 2 v a δ t δ x s t 0 0 s x 0 where v a is the water volume instantaneously pumped by a point sink per unit area normal to flow in the x direction l the solution to this definite problem is 5 s x t v a 2 s s π k x t s s exp s s x 2 4 k x t comparing this equation with eq 2 we can define the x directional solution for pdl in this direction as 6 g x x t 1 2 π k x t s s exp s s x 2 4 k x t similarly we can define the y and z directional solutions for pdls as 7 g y y t 1 2 π k y t s s exp s s y 2 4 k y t 8 g z z τ 1 2 π k z t s s exp s s z 2 4 k z t where gx gy and gz have the dimension of length l 1 for pdls 2 1 3 directional solutions for a finite directional length it is known that a linear sink can be represented by the superposition of continuous point sinks along the line bear 1972 suppose that the sink length in the x direction is finite fdl and its length is l from x 0 to x 0 l the x directional solution for a fdl instantaneous sink can be expressed as 9 g x x t 1 2 erfc x x 0 l 2 k x t s s erfc x x 0 2 k x t s s similarly we can obtain the y and z directional solutions for fdls as 10 g y y τ 1 2 erfc y y 0 w 2 k y t s s erfc y y 0 2 k y t s s 11 g z z τ 1 2 erfc z z 0 b 2 k z t s s erfc z z 0 2 k z t s s where x 0 y 0 z 0 are the starting positions of the sink l l w and b are the sink length in the x direction width in the y direction and height in the z direction respectively gx gy and gz are dimensionless for fdls eqs 3 6 8 and 9 11 in combination with eq 2 can be used to construct solutions for instantaneous sources sinks in an infinite aquifer 2 2 continuous solutions 2 2 1 general continuous solution in an infinite aquifer as aforementioned a line sink can be represented by the continuous superposition of point sinks similarly a continuous sink can be considered as a continuous superposition of instantaneous sinks hence the solutions for a continuous sink can be obtained by convoluting the solution of the instantaneous sink with the extraction schedule integrating eq 2 over time from 0 to t we obtain 12 s 1 s s 0 t q t τ g k τ g x x τ g y y τ g z z τ d τ where τ is the temporal integration variable t q t is the strength of the continuous sink which is constant or a known function of time the integral in the equation can be evaluated numerically by the methods of numerical integration such as the gaussian quadrature method 2 2 2 directional solutions in a semi infinite or finite aquifer if a confined aquifer is vertically semi infinite or finite with a constant thickness b or horizontally semi infinite or finite with a constant length l or width w the method of images is applied to account for the impermeable aquifer boundaries by replacing them with hydraulic entities that allow the application of the solutions describing flow in an infinite aquifer we use the point sink in a finite thick aquifer as an example the sink and the upper and lower boundaries are imaged for an infinite number of times in the z direction accordingly the boundary value problem can be simulated by a vertically infinite problem with an infinite number of image sinks and the original sink thus the z directional solution for a pdl in a finite thick aquifer is 13 g z z t 1 b 1 2 n 1 cos n π z 0 b cos n π z b exp n 2 π 2 k z s s b 2 t similarly we can obtain all directional solutions for point and finite directional sink lengths in a vertically or horizontally semi infinite or finite aquifer as shown in table 1 and fig 1 2 3 solutions of distributed recharge precipitation and evaporation are the common types of distributed source and sink their recharge discharge rates can be assumed to be constant in the analytical models the governing equations for flow with a distributed source can be expressed as 32a s s s t k x 2 s x 2 k y 2 s y 2 k z 2 s z 2 k s w h q δ x y z 32b s t 0 0 32c s x i x y z 0 where w h is the recharge strength water volume received per unit aquifer volume per unit time t 1 this model can easily be split into two sub models one for flow in the aquifer with constant discharge strength q 33a s s s 1 t k x 2 s 1 x 2 k y 2 s 1 y 2 k z 2 s 1 z 2 k s 1 q v δ x y z 33b s 1 t 0 0 33c s 1 x i x y z 0 where s 1 is the drawdown without the distributed source and one for distributed source only 34a s s d s 0 d t k s 0 w h t 0 34b s 0 t 0 0 where s 0 is the drawdown in a leaky confined aquifer that receives only the recharge from uniformly distributed precipitation it can be testified that s s 1 s 0 is the solution of the original model eqs 32a and 32c if s 1 and s 0 is the solutions of the two sub models respectively clearly the solution to the second sub model is 35 s 0 w h exp kt s s 1 k the drawdown for a non leaky aquifer is 36 s 0 w h t s s for 2d plane flow w h should be replaced by w w h b if storage coefficient s is used in the place of s s 3 solution library the aforementioned solution method provides a useful tool to construct analytical solutions of groundwater flow toward and from sources sinks in a confined aquifer with or without leakage and distributed recharge by superimposing the extra drawdown s 0 as given in eqs 35 and 36 into eq 2 we can obtain the general instantaneous solution as 37 s x y z t v s s g k t g x x t g y y t g z z t s 0 analogically the general continuous solution with reference to eq 12 is 38 s x y z t 1 s s 0 t q t τ g k τ g x x τ g y y τ g z z τ d τ s 0 where v is the water volume instantaneously extracted per unit sink size v v p the water volume l3 for a point sink v v l the water volume per unit sink length l2 for a line sink v v a the water volume per unit sink area l for an areal sink and v v v the water volume per unit sink volume dimensionless for a volumetric sink the strength of the continuous sink q t is defined as the water volume per unit sink size per unit time q q p the water volume per unit time l3t 1 for a point sink q q l the water volume per unit sink length per unit time l2t 1 for a line sink q q a the water volume per unit sink area per unit time lt 1 for an areal sink and q q v the water volume per unit sink volume per unit time t 1 for a volumetric sink s 0 is the extra drawdown caused by the distributed recharge discharge as shown in eqs 35 and 36 and s 0 0 if they are neglected gk is the leakage solution shown in eq 3 and g k t 1 for a non leaky aquifer gx gy and gz are the directional solutions for the x y and z directions respectively as listed in table 1 g y g z 1 for 1d flow along the x direction and g z 1 for horizontal 2d flow along the xy plane table 1 summarizes the directional solutions for point and finite directional source sink lengths in horizontally or vertically infinite semi infinite and finite aquifers by substituting gk the directional solutions in table 1 and s0 into eqs 37 and 38 we can easily construct a few analytical solutions for the flow in a confined aquifer these solutions constitute a library we summarize the hydrogeologic conditions applications and limitations for the practical use of the solutions in the library 1 aquifer the aquifer can be infinite semi infinite or finite both vertically and horizontally in the x y and z directions the aquifer is homogeneous and anisotropic or isotropic if the aquifer is semi infinite or finite either vertically or horizontally the boundaries of the aquifer must be impermeable 2 water release assumption water in the aquifer is instantaneously released from storage upon the decline of the hydraulic head this assumption which is widely used in many published solutions theis 1935 hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1961 zhan et al 2001 is applicable for flow toward a small storage negligible pumping well in a confined aquifer however this assumption may not be valid near large diameter wells where the wellbore storage effect cannot be neglected papadopulos and cooper 1967 neuman 1975 mishra and neuman 2011 mishra et al 2012 similarly the solutions of areal and volumetric sources sinks have the same limitation for neglecting the water storage in extracting injecting facilities 3 source sink geometry and operation the source sink in the aquifer can be point line along the x y or z direction areal along the xy xz or yz plane or volumetric the operation such as extraction of the source sink can be instantaneous or continuous with a constant or time variable schedule the wellbore storage effect is neglected 4 initial condition the initial drawdown in the aquifer is assumed to be zero 5 leakage the aquifer can have leaky recharges from overlain underlain adjacent aquifers such as an overlain unconfined aquifer through the aquitard in between the leakage term ks in eq 1a is obtained based on the simplification initially proposed by hantush 1961 in which the flow passing through the boundary from the vertical leaky across the aquitard is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the thickness of a leaky aquifer however the exact leaky acts as a distributed boundary flux on the top or and bottom side of the working aquifer not an interior source sink the error caused by this simplification is generally small as we assume an instantaneous aquifer water release or storage on recharge or discharge the head in the recharge aquifer is initially the same as that in the working aquifer and is constant during the operation hantush 1961 the aquitard does not release water from storage indicating that the hydraulic gradients in the aquitard change instantaneously in accordance with the head change in the working aquifer this assumption ignores the actual flow process from the recharge aquifer through the aquitard to the working aquifer which also causes solution errors especially when the aquitard is thick 6 distributed recharge the working aquifer can be recharged from precipitation or discharged through evaporation this recharge discharge is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the aquifer notably a confined aquifer is theoretically impossible to have direct precipitation recharge or direct evaporation discharge as it is overlain by an aquitard or aquifuge the reason to include distributed recharge is that the solutions for confined aquifers may be occasionally applied to unconfined aquifers for example if the drawdown in monitoring wells is less than 10 of the initial thickness of the unconfined aquifers the solutions for the confined aquifers can be directly applied without adjustments because the error introduced by using these solutions is small jacob 1963 when the drawdown is between 10 and 25 the solutions can still be used if a certain correction to the measured values is made such as using the approach suggested by jacob 1963 in these cases precipitation recharge or evaporation discharge has to be considered if they exist it should be noted that the assumption of recharge discharge uniformly distributed along the thickness of the working aquifer may cause some errors because actual precipitation recharge and evaporation discharge take place only at the phreatic table of an unconfined aquifer similar to the leakage issue the error of this assumption is related to the aquifer response on recharge or discharge in addition extra drawdown s0 as expressed by eqs 35 and 36 cannot be used for steady state flow calibration because eq 34a is not valid for steady flow in general steady state flow cannot be reached if an aquifer obtains continuously the recharge without an equal discharge 4 validation and applications 4 1 validation many of the previously published solutions for fluid flow toward a well in a confined aquifer are the specific cases of the library presented in this study two of the published solutions are reproduced to verify the validity of the proposed method the first one is the solution proposed by hantush 1964 for a constant rate pumping from a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer the confined aquifer is horizontally infinite and vertically finite with a constant thickness of b homogeneous and anisotropic fig 2 constant rate q pumping from a partially penetrating well means that the line sink well has the pdls in the x and y directions as shown in eqs 14 and 20 and a fdl of b in the z direction as shown in eq 31 with continuous strength of q q b the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard are b and k respectively setting the coordinate origin at the location of the well x 0 0 y 0 0 and substituting eqs 3 14 20 and 31 into the general continuous solution eq

geometries point vertical line vertical areal in the yz plane and volumetric by using eqs 59 60 62 and 66 respectively with leakage and distributed discharge the confined aquifer is horizontally infinite and vertically finite with a constant thickness the computation parameters are shown in table 2 the sink geometries affect the drawdown distribution significantly where the computation points are located adjacent to the sinks however this effect decreases with the increase of the radial distance for point and vertical line sinks the drawdown difference is negligibly small 0 5 if the radial distance from the sinks is larger than 1 5b this result is in agreement with the finding of hantush 1961 however this case is not true for areal or volumetric sinks the drawdown difference increases with the increase of the horizontal sink size accordingly the radial distance beyond which the drawdown difference is negligibly small among different sink types is larger 4 3 case study in this case study groundwater drainage is discussed for the purpose of polluted site remediation the site is polluted by a former chemical factory the results of site geological survey are shown in table 3 the top 3 5 m thick silt clay layer is heavily polluted by dichloroethane as well as chloroethylene and chloroform thus this layer needs to be remediated by using the thermal desorption process the polluted site covers an area of 1512 m2 as shown in fig 8 the initial head of both upper and lower aquifers is the same h 0 191 m which is 3 7 m above the top surface of the upper confined aquifer well pumping test results show that the average hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer is k 11 6 m d and the specific storage is s s 1 98 10 3 m 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard between the two aquifers is k 0 04 m d for the safety and convenience of the remediation operation 1 the piezometric head of the upper aquifer must be lowered inside the top clay layer that is about 2 1 m minimum drawdown and 2 the drainage facilities have to be along the site boundaries not inside the remediation area two water drainage plans are designed fig 8 plan a uses 25 equally distributed pumping wells 0 1 m radius each with a pumping rate of 90 m3 d and plan b uses 6 drainage slots 0 2 m wide along the site boundaries 332 m long with a drainage strength of 6 7771 m3 d m the total discharge rate is 2250 m3 d for both plans the total drawdown of 25 wells or 6 slots in the aquifer is the algebraic sum of their individual drawdowns as shown in eq 46 for a single well and eqs 62 and 63 for a single vertical slot in the yz plane and xz plane respectively the contour maps of computed drawdown caused by the two plans after 2 5 days of pumping are presented in fig 9 the contour maps show that both plans can make the piezometric head drawdown in the remediation site lower than 2 1 m the ranges of the head drawdown within the site are 2 44 4 16 m for plan a with the maximum value at the well located at x 34 m y 62 m and 2 39 3 25 m for plan b with the maximum at x 40 m y 62 m plan b performs better than plan a in two aspects 1 plan a generates 25 rounded zones centered at each individual well where the drawdown exceeds the 3 7 m piezometric height of the upper aquifer resulting in the head being declined inside the aquifer in these zones unconfined state this means that gravity water in the upper aquifer has to be partially pumped out to reach the objective of making the head drawdown in the site lowered inside the top clay layer plan b does not suffer from this problem because the drawdown along the slots distributes evenly and the aquifer is maintained in its confining state during the drainage 2 the results of computational experiments show that the depth of the slot cutting into the aquifer does not have a great influence over the drawdown distribution this means that plan b can conduct shallower cutting into the aquifer and less interrupting to the aquifer than plan a can this case study indicates that slot drainage can be a practical alternative to well pumping in lowering the groundwater level in engineering applications if the aquifer being drained is shallowly buried 5 conclusions a general approach based on gfm has been developed to construct analytical solutions for groundwater flow in a homogeneous confined aquifer with or without evenly distributed recharge or leakage from adjacent aquifers a library is constructed based on two general solutions for instantaneous and continuous sources sinks and can be a useful tool to analyze the groundwater flow in porous media the leakage solution and directional solutions are presented for pdls and fdls in an aquifer that is horizontally or vertically infinite semi infinite or finite homogeneous and anisotropic or isotropic the presented solutions can be used to construct solutions for problems with specified hydrogeologic and geometric conditions the geometries of the sources sinks may be point line areal or volumetric the approach presented for the construction of analytical solutions is validated by the well known solutions of hantush 1964 and zhan et al 2001 a series of typical solutions are provided for one two and three dimensional flow toward point line areal and volumetric sinks as references for interested readers a computational example is provided to compare the drawdown distributions caused by point vertical line vertical areal and volumetric sinks one notable observation is that the radial distance beyond which the drawdown difference is negligible among different sink geometries increases with the horizontal sink sizes an application case study for the drawdown computation at a groundwater contaminated site by using the line and areal solutions

4876,a variety of hydrogeologic conditions and parameters play roles in obtaining analytical solutions for groundwater flow in aquifers changes of these influencing conditions typically require

describing flow mechanisms in various subsurface media despite their simplified conceptualizations regarding fluid and media properties and hydrogeologic conditions analytical solutions are important particularly in early project phases of preliminary design with insufficient aquifer characterization for estimating hydrogeologic parameters drawing flownet serving as benchmark cases for verifying numerical simulation models and estimating the scope of advective contaminant transport batu 1998 in general hydrogeologic conditions must be simplified and assumptions must be specified for deriving analytical solutions these include flow state steady or transient space dimension one two or three dimensional source sink geometry and position point line areal or volumetric vertical or horizontal partially or fully penetrating pumping modes instantaneous continuous or short period initial distribution of hydraulic head drawdown constant or following a known function aquifer thickness horizontal extent and confining state finite semi infinite or infinite confined or unconfined medium heterogeneity and anisotropy homogeneous or heterogeneous isotropic or anisotropic leakage from adjacent aquifers and precipitation recharge and evaporation changes in any of these influencing conditions and assumptions may result in different analytical solutions thus it would be very helpful if a generalized approach or solution can be developed to account for a variety of hydrogeologic conditions and assumptions batu 2015 sources sinks such as pumping wells are the most important components in groundwater flow systems a typical assumption for obtaining analytical solutions of well flow in large aquifers is that the well diameter is infinitely small i e the wellbore storage effect is neglected so that the well can be considered as a line source sink this zero radius assumption was originally proposed by theis 1935 and used extensively in groundwater hydrology for analyzing well tests e g hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1964 bear 1972 neuman 1975 zhan et al 2001 luo and kitanidis 2004 batu 2012 chen et al 2012 the wellbore storage effect was later considered for large diameter wells e g papadopulos and cooper 1967 moench 1985 hou and luo 2019 classic solutions and investigations indicated that the wellbore storage effect may be important or the zero radius approximation may not be valid near the pumping wells mueller and witherspoon 1965 this is also the case for the possible non darcian flow near the well e g qian et al 2005 wen et al 2006 in general if one is interested in the flow pattern over a large domain and the prediction of drawdowns in the pumping wells is not the goal the assumption of zero radius wells is valid and darcy s law is typically adopted for the entire domain based on these assumptions flow to vertical wells has been widely studied for many decades since the theis solution e g hantush 1961 1966 1967 neuman 1975 batu 1998 flow to horizontal and inclined wells has also been analytically described for their technical advantages over vertical wells in certain circumstances e g zhan 1999 kawecki 2000 zhan and zlotnik 2002 zhan and park 2003 kawecki and al subaikhy 2005 huang et al 2011 williams 2013 sureshjani and clarkson 2015 except for the widely studied line sink vertical or horizontal solutions and some point sink solutions solutions for groundwater flow to areal and volumetric sources sinks are rarely investigated in practice many hydraulic facilities can be simulated as areal or volumetric sources sinks for example a thin drainage ditch that cuts into the aquifer can be conceptualized as an areal sink and a block of densely distributed wells can be approximated as a volumetric source sink therefore it is also important for studying the flow to areal and volumetric sources sinks in aquifers in addition to point and linear sources sinks the pumping mode for the majority of published analytical solutions of groundwater flow is continuous extraction or injection with a constant flow rate for linear flow systems the solutions of instantaneous pumping can be readily obtained through numerical differentiation of the solutions for constant continuous pumping however explicit closed forms of instantaneous solutions are more useful as the transfer function to evaluate the solutions corresponding to arbitrary pumping schedules chen et al 2012 a typical application of instantaneous solutions is slug test which is an effective way to estimate local scale hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficients e g hyder and butler 1995 frink et al 1997 zurbuchen et al 2002 audouin and bodin 2008 brauchler 2010 fan and wang 2014 in this study we use green s function method gfm to derive general analytical solutions for groundwater flow in a homogeneous confined aquifer with infinite semi infinite or finite domains we consider one two and three dimensional groundwater flow toward point line areal and volumetric sources sinks two general solutions are derived one for instantaneous sources sinks and the other continuous sources sinks with or without leakage from adjacent aquifers and distributed precipitation recharge these two solutions in combination with the directional solutions for various conditions can be used to conveniently construct a library of analytical solutions for problems with specific hydrogeologic conditions some typical solutions for one two and three dimensional flow in confined aquifers are provided 2 methodology the steps to present the approach for constructing the general analytical solutions are as follows 1 the method for solutions of an instantaneous source sink in an infinite domain 2 solutions of continuous injection extraction in an infinite domain and 3 solutions in the semi infinite and finite domains 2 1 instantaneous solutions 2 1 1 general instantaneous solution in an infinite aquifer we consider an instantaneous water extraction from a point sink in an infinite homogeneous aquifer with leakage the mathematical model of hydraulic drawdown is 1a s s s t k x 2 s x 2 k y 2 s y 2 k z 2 s z 2 k s v δ t δ x y z x y z δ t 0 1b s x y z t t 0 0 x y z 1c s x y z t x y z 0 t 0 where s is the drawdown of the hydraulic head l s h 0 h h is the hydraulic head l h 0 is the initial head l k is the leakage coefficient and is defined as the volume of water that is released from or taken into storage per unit time per unit aquifer volume per unit head difference hantush 1961 t 1l 1 v is the water volume instantaneously extracted from the point sink l3 kx ky and kz are the principal hydraulic conductivity in the x y and z directions respectively lt 1 s s is the specific storage l 1 x y and z are the cartesian coordinates l t is the elapsed time since pumping started t δ t is the dirac delta function for time δ t 1 for t 0 δ t 0 for t 0 t 1 and δ x y z is the dirac delta function for position δ x y z 1 for x y z 0 δ x y z 0 otherwise l 3 it should be pointed out that there are no infinite aquifers in reality specially in z direction as most aquifers distribute in layers with finite thicknesses model 1 is just a mathematical treatment preparing basic solutions for further derivations with respect to more realistic conditions although an infinitely thick aquifer is practically impossible to receive the leaky recharge from adjacent aquifers the leakage term presented in the form firstly introduced by hantush 1961 is still retained in the model for the case in finitely thick aquifers the limitation of the assumption implied in this expression is discussed in section 3 k k b b where b is the aquifer thickness l b and k are the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard leaky confining layer respectively this model can be solved by using gfm leij et al 2000 the solution of this model can be generally expressed as wang and wu 2009 2 s v s s g k t g x x t g y y t g z z t where gk is the green function for the leakage term and is called leakage solution gx gy and gz are the directional green functions for the x y and z directions respectively and they are called directional solutions eq 2 indicates that the drawdown is the product of instantaneously pumped water volume multiplied by the leakage and directional solutions divided by specific storage differential eq 1a is simplified to d s d t ks s s if only the leakage term is retained at the right side obviously its solution has an exponential form thus the leakage solution is expressed as 3 g k t exp kt s s 2 1 2 directional solutions for a point directional length the length of a sink in a direction can be either infinitely small point or finite if the length is point in a direction the sink has a point directional length pdl if the length is finite the sink has a finite directional length fdl here we will first discuss the directional solutions for pdls and then for fdls the corresponding 1d model of eqs 1 at the x direction is 4 s s s t k x 2 s x 2 v a δ t δ x s t 0 0 s x 0 where v a is the water volume instantaneously pumped by a point sink per unit area normal to flow in the x direction l the solution to this definite problem is 5 s x t v a 2 s s π k x t s s exp s s x 2 4 k x t comparing this equation with eq 2 we can define the x directional solution for pdl in this direction as 6 g x x t 1 2 π k x t s s exp s s x 2 4 k x t similarly we can define the y and z directional solutions for pdls as 7 g y y t 1 2 π k y t s s exp s s y 2 4 k y t 8 g z z τ 1 2 π k z t s s exp s s z 2 4 k z t where gx gy and gz have the dimension of length l 1 for pdls 2 1 3 directional solutions for a finite directional length it is known that a linear sink can be represented by the superposition of continuous point sinks along the line bear 1972 suppose that the sink length in the x direction is finite fdl and its length is l from x 0 to x 0 l the x directional solution for a fdl instantaneous sink can be expressed as 9 g x x t 1 2 erfc x x 0 l 2 k x t s s erfc x x 0 2 k x t s s similarly we can obtain the y and z directional solutions for fdls as 10 g y y τ 1 2 erfc y y 0 w 2 k y t s s erfc y y 0 2 k y t s s 11 g z z τ 1 2 erfc z z 0 b 2 k z t s s erfc z z 0 2 k z t s s where x 0 y 0 z 0 are the starting positions of the sink l l w and b are the sink length in the x direction width in the y direction and height in the z direction respectively gx gy and gz are dimensionless for fdls eqs 3 6 8 and 9 11 in combination with eq 2 can be used to construct solutions for instantaneous sources sinks in an infinite aquifer 2 2 continuous solutions 2 2 1 general continuous solution in an infinite aquifer as aforementioned a line sink can be represented by the continuous superposition of point sinks similarly a continuous sink can be considered as a continuous superposition of instantaneous sinks hence the solutions for a continuous sink can be obtained by convoluting the solution of the instantaneous sink with the extraction schedule integrating eq 2 over time from 0 to t we obtain 12 s 1 s s 0 t q t τ g k τ g x x τ g y y τ g z z τ d τ where τ is the temporal integration variable t q t is the strength of the continuous sink which is constant or a known function of time the integral in the equation can be evaluated numerically by the methods of numerical integration such as the gaussian quadrature method 2 2 2 directional solutions in a semi infinite or finite aquifer if a confined aquifer is vertically semi infinite or finite with a constant thickness b or horizontally semi infinite or finite with a constant length l or width w the method of images is applied to account for the impermeable aquifer boundaries by replacing them with hydraulic entities that allow the application of the solutions describing flow in an infinite aquifer we use the point sink in a finite thick aquifer as an example the sink and the upper and lower boundaries are imaged for an infinite number of times in the z direction accordingly the boundary value problem can be simulated by a vertically infinite problem with an infinite number of image sinks and the original sink thus the z directional solution for a pdl in a finite thick aquifer is 13 g z z t 1 b 1 2 n 1 cos n π z 0 b cos n π z b exp n 2 π 2 k z s s b 2 t similarly we can obtain all directional solutions for point and finite directional sink lengths in a vertically or horizontally semi infinite or finite aquifer as shown in table 1 and fig 1 2 3 solutions of distributed recharge precipitation and evaporation are the common types of distributed source and sink their recharge discharge rates can be assumed to be constant in the analytical models the governing equations for flow with a distributed source can be expressed as 32a s s s t k x 2 s x 2 k y 2 s y 2 k z 2 s z 2 k s w h q δ x y z 32b s t 0 0 32c s x i x y z 0 where w h is the recharge strength water volume received per unit aquifer volume per unit time t 1 this model can easily be split into two sub models one for flow in the aquifer with constant discharge strength q 33a s s s 1 t k x 2 s 1 x 2 k y 2 s 1 y 2 k z 2 s 1 z 2 k s 1 q v δ x y z 33b s 1 t 0 0 33c s 1 x i x y z 0 where s 1 is the drawdown without the distributed source and one for distributed source only 34a s s d s 0 d t k s 0 w h t 0 34b s 0 t 0 0 where s 0 is the drawdown in a leaky confined aquifer that receives only the recharge from uniformly distributed precipitation it can be testified that s s 1 s 0 is the solution of the original model eqs 32a and 32c if s 1 and s 0 is the solutions of the two sub models respectively clearly the solution to the second sub model is 35 s 0 w h exp kt s s 1 k the drawdown for a non leaky aquifer is 36 s 0 w h t s s for 2d plane flow w h should be replaced by w w h b if storage coefficient s is used in the place of s s 3 solution library the aforementioned solution method provides a useful tool to construct analytical solutions of groundwater flow toward and from sources sinks in a confined aquifer with or without leakage and distributed recharge by superimposing the extra drawdown s 0 as given in eqs 35 and 36 into eq 2 we can obtain the general instantaneous solution as 37 s x y z t v s s g k t g x x t g y y t g z z t s 0 analogically the general continuous solution with reference

for a non leaky aquifer gx gy and gz are the directional solutions for the x y and z directions respectively as listed in table 1 g y g z 1 for 1d flow along the x direction and g z 1 for horizontal 2d flow along the xy plane table 1 summarizes the directional solutions for point and finite directional source sink lengths in horizontally or vertically infinite semi infinite and finite aquifers by substituting gk the directional solutions in table 1 and s0 into eqs 37 and 38 we can easily construct a few analytical solutions for the flow in a confined aquifer these solutions constitute a library we summarize the hydrogeologic conditions applications and limitations for the practical use of the solutions in the library 1 aquifer the aquifer can be infinite semi infinite or finite both vertically and horizontally in the x y and z directions the aquifer is homogeneous and anisotropic or isotropic if the aquifer is semi infinite or finite either vertically or horizontally the boundaries of the aquifer must be impermeable 2 water release assumption water in the aquifer is instantaneously released from storage upon the decline of the hydraulic head this assumption which is widely used in many published solutions theis 1935 hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1961 zhan et al 2001 is applicable for flow toward a small storage negligible pumping well in a confined aquifer however this assumption may not be valid near large diameter wells where the wellbore storage effect cannot be neglected papadopulos and cooper 1967 neuman 1975 mishra and neuman 2011 mishra et al 2012 similarly the solutions of areal and volumetric sources sinks have the same limitation for neglecting the water storage in extracting injecting facilities 3 source sink geometry and operation the source sink in the aquifer can be point line along the x y or z direction areal along the xy xz or yz plane or volumetric the operation such as extraction of the source sink can be instantaneous or continuous with a constant or time variable schedule the wellbore storage effect is neglected 4 initial condition the initial drawdown in the aquifer is assumed to be zero 5 leakage the aquifer can have leaky recharges from overlain underlain adjacent aquifers such as an overlain unconfined aquifer through the aquitard in between the leakage term ks in eq 1a is obtained based on the simplification initially proposed by hantush 1961 in which the flow passing through the boundary from the vertical leaky across the aquitard is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the thickness of a leaky aquifer however the exact leaky acts as a distributed boundary flux on the top or and bottom side of the working aquifer not an interior source sink the error caused by this simplification is generally small as we assume an instantaneous aquifer water release or storage on recharge or discharge the head in the recharge aquifer is initially the same as that in the working aquifer and is constant during the operation hantush 1961 the aquitard does not release water from storage indicating that the hydraulic gradients in the aquitard change instantaneously in accordance with the head change in the working aquifer this assumption ignores the actual flow process from the recharge aquifer through the aquitard to the working aquifer which also causes solution errors especially when the aquitard is thick 6 distributed recharge the working aquifer can be recharged from precipitation or discharged through evaporation this recharge discharge is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the aquifer notably a confined aquifer is theoretically impossible to have direct precipitation recharge or direct evaporation discharge as it is overlain by an aquitard or aquifuge the reason to include distributed recharge is that the solutions for confined aquifers may be occasionally applied to unconfined aquifers for example if the drawdown in monitoring wells is less than 10 of the initial thickness of the unconfined aquifers the solutions for the confined aquifers can be directly applied without adjustments because the error introduced by using these solutions is small jacob 1963 when the drawdown is between 10 and 25 the solutions can still be used if a certain correction to the measured values is made such as using the approach suggested by jacob 1963 in these cases precipitation recharge or evaporation discharge has to be considered if they exist it should be noted that the assumption of recharge discharge uniformly distributed along the thickness of the working aquifer may cause some errors because actual precipitation recharge and evaporation discharge take place only at the phreatic table of an unconfined aquifer similar to the leakage issue the error of this assumption is related to the aquifer response on recharge or discharge in addition extra drawdown s0 as expressed by eqs 35 and 36 cannot be used for steady state flow calibration because eq 34a is not valid for steady flow in general steady state flow cannot be reached if an aquifer obtains continuously the recharge without an equal discharge 4 validation and applications 4 1 validation many of the previously published solutions for fluid flow toward a well in a confined aquifer are the specific cases of the library presented in this study two of the published solutions are reproduced to verify the validity of the proposed method the first one is the solution proposed by hantush 1964 for a constant rate pumping from a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer the confined aquifer is horizontally infinite and vertically finite with a constant thickness of b homogeneous and anisotropic fig 2 constant rate q pumping from a partially penetrating well means that the line sink well has the pdls in the x and y directions as shown in eqs 14 and 20 and a fdl of b in the z direction as shown in eq 31 with continuous strength of q q b the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard are b and k respectively setting the coordinate origin at the location of the well x 0 0 y 0 0 and substituting eqs 3 14 20 and 31 into the general continuous solution eq

some typical solutions are presented in this section as references here only the continuous solutions are discussed because the instantaneous solutions can be easily obtained by comparing eq 37 with eq 38 if the corresponding continuous solutions are known 4 2 1 one dimensional flow we consider the case of 1d flow to a long drainage ditch that has fully penetrated the aquifer of horizontally

2 τ d τ s 0 67 as a computation example of the aforementioned three dimensional flow equations fig 7 compares the drawdown distributions along the x direction among four different types of sink geometries point vertical line vertical areal in the yz plane and volumetric by using eqs 59 60 62 and 66 respectively with leakage and distributed discharge the confined aquifer is horizontally infinite and vertically finite with a constant thickness the computation parameters are shown in table 2 the sink geometries affect the drawdown distribution significantly where the computation points are located adjacent to the sinks however this effect decreases with the increase of the radial distance for point and vertical line sinks the drawdown difference is negligibly small 0 5 if the radial distance from the sinks is larger than 1 5b this result is in agreement with the finding of hantush 1961 however this case is not true for areal or volumetric sinks the drawdown difference increases with the increase of the horizontal sink size accordingly the radial distance beyond which the drawdown difference is negligibly small among different sink types is larger 4 3 case study in this case study groundwater drainage is discussed for the purpose of polluted site remediation the site is polluted by a former chemical factory the results of site geological survey are shown in table 3 the top 3 5 m thick silt clay layer is heavily polluted by dichloroethane as well as chloroethylene and chloroform thus this layer needs to be remediated by using the thermal desorption process the polluted site covers an area of 1512 m2 as shown in fig 8 the initial head of both upper and lower aquifers is the same h 0 191 m which is 3 7 m above the top surface of the upper confined aquifer well pumping test results show that the average hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer is k 11 6 m d and the specific storage is s s 1 98 10 3 m 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard between the two aquifers is k 0 04 m d for the safety and convenience of the remediation operation 1 the piezometric head of the upper aquifer must be lowered inside the top clay layer that is about 2 1 m minimum drawdown and 2 the drainage facilities have to be along the site boundaries not inside the remediation area two water drainage plans are designed fig 8 plan a uses 25 equally distributed pumping wells 0 1 m radius each with a pumping rate of 90 m3 d and plan b uses 6 drainage slots 0 2 m wide along the site boundaries 332 m long with a drainage strength of 6 7771 m3 d m the total discharge rate is 2250 m3 d for both plans the total drawdown of 25 wells or 6 slots in the aquifer is the algebraic sum of their individual drawdowns as shown in eq 46 for a single well and eqs 62 and 63 for a single vertical slot in the yz plane and xz plane respectively the contour maps of computed drawdown caused by the two plans after 2 5 days of pumping are presented in fig 9 the contour maps show that both plans can make the piezometric head drawdown in the remediation site lower than 2 1 m the ranges of the head drawdown within the site are 2 44 4 16 m for plan a with the maximum value at the well located at x 34 m y 62 m and 2 39 3 25 m for plan b with the maximum at x 40 m y 62 m plan b performs better than plan a in two aspects 1 plan a generates 25 rounded zones centered at each individual well where the drawdown exceeds the 3 7 m piezometric height of the upper aquifer resulting in the head being declined inside the aquifer in these zones unconfined state this means that gravity water in the upper aquifer has to be partially pumped out to reach the objective of making the head drawdown in the site lowered inside the top clay layer plan b does not suffer from this problem because the drawdown along the slots distributes evenly and the aquifer is maintained in its confining state during the drainage 2 the results of computational experiments show that the depth of the slot cutting into the aquifer does not have a great influence over the drawdown distribution this means that plan b can conduct shallower cutting into the aquifer and less interrupting to the aquifer than plan a can this case study indicates that slot drainage can be a practical alternative to well pumping in lowering the groundwater level in engineering applications if the aquifer being drained is shallowly buried 5 conclusions a general approach based on gfm has been developed to construct analytical solutions for groundwater flow in a homogeneous confined aquifer with or without evenly distributed recharge or leakage from adjacent aquifers a library is constructed based on two general solutions for instantaneous and continuous sources sinks and can be a useful tool to analyze the groundwater flow in porous media the leakage solution and directional solutions are presented for pdls and fdls in an aquifer that is horizontally or vertically infinite semi infinite or finite homogeneous and anisotropic or isotropic the presented solutions can be used to construct solutions for problems with specified hydrogeologic and geometric conditions the geometries of the sources sinks may be point line areal or volumetric the approach presented for the construction of analytical solutions is validated by the well known solutions of hantush 1964 and zhan et al 2001 a series of typical solutions are provided for one two and three dimensional flow toward point line areal and volumetric sinks as references for interested readers a computational example is provided to compare the drawdown distributions caused by point vertical line vertical areal and volumetric sinks one notable observation is that the radial distance beyond which the drawdown difference is negligible among different sink geometries increases with the horizontal sink sizes an application case study for the drawdown computation at a groundwater contaminated site by using the line and areal solutions is provided this case study suggests that drainage slots vertical areal sinks can be an effective alternative to pumping wells vertical line sinks in lowering the groundwater level for a shallowly

4877,numerical models with spatially varying head as top boundary conditions were used in previous studies to understand topography driven groundwater flow the head boundary conditions could cause artifacts of extremely large but unrealistic recharge rates owing to unlimited supply of water this study adopted a fully coupled surface subsurface hydrologic modeling approach to simulate transient topography driven groundwater flow and also surface water flow under homogeneous and isotropic settings two 100 year climate datasets and five hydraulic conductivities k 0 01 100 m d were tested in numerical experiments in the base case with a wet climate annual precipitation 1696 mm y and k of 1 m d groundwater head at two different locations close to both lateral boundaries fluctuates only within 5 1 m and 9 6 m respectively during the 100 year period despite the local water table fluctuations caused by the variability in the climatic record large scale groundwater flow systems can be assumed in dynamic equilibrium provided stationary climate long term average exchange fluxes are spatially constant and limited by precipitation infiltration when surface water is absent whereas they vary from positive to negative values i e recharge to discharge spatially when surface water is present sensitivity analysis suggests that wetter climate and smaller k lead to more inundation of the land surface stronger hierarchical nesting of groundwater flow systems and more variable exchange fluxes overall our first fully coupled modeling of topography driven groundwater flow implies that attention must be paid to causality between head and flow and climatic record as boundary conditions may be more appropriate due to its relaxed manner keywords topography driven groundwater flow fully coupled surface water groundwater modeling climate groundwater exchange fluxes 1 introduction water table elevation may vary in space which results in the occurrence of different scales of groundwater flow systems i e local intermediate and regional in the same sedimentary aquifer jiang et al 2014 robinson and love 2013 tóth 1962 1963 although the hierarchical nesting pattern of groundwater flow

resource sustainability huggenberger et al 2013 and surface water groundwater interaction havril et al 2018 sophocleous 2002 winter 1999 this theory of nested groundwater flow systems has also been

numerous numerical studies have been carried out to better understand the hydrodynamics of nested flow systems and resultant groundwater age distributions cardenas 2007 cardenas and jiang 2010 jiang et al 2012 robinson and love 2013 wang et al 2016 many other studies examined the impacts of different factors on nested flow systems such as aquifer permeability settings freeze and witherspoon 1967 jiang et al 2009 2010 and spatiotemporal variation in water table undulation freeze and witherspoon 1967 gomez and wilson 2013 vandenberg 1980 zijl 1999 zhao et al 2018 almost all of these studies employed spatially varying hydraulic head as top boundary conditions in order to ensure perfect undulating water table similar to tóth 1963 this approach eliminates the need to determine spatial groundwater recharge rates but may potentially produce unrealistic groundwater recharge rates which are much larger than precipitation other than the method described above a number of studies have attempted to employ recharge rates as top boundary conditions in simulating nested groundwater flow systems forster and smith 1988 goderniaux et al 2013 gleeson and manning 2008 liang et al 2013 welch and allen 2012 for example forster and smith 1988 first developed a modified free surface approach to accommodate recharge at upper elevations on the seepage face allowing for examining the controls of thermal conditions on patterns and rates of groundwater flow in mountainous terrain gleeson and manning 2008 investigated topographic and hydrogeologic controls on regional and perpendicular groundwater flow by specifying spatially uniform recharge rates to the top surface of a 3 d idealized mountainous multi basin model on the basis of gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2012 allocated two different but temporally constant recharge rates in the mountain area and the plain area respectively in order to examine groundwater flow patterns under similar settings liang et al 2013 examined the impacts of changing infiltration intensity and hydraulic conductivity settings on groundwater flow patterns by establishing a base case model with recharge rates as upper boundary conditions similar to their physical sand box experiments liang et al 2010 although recharge boundary conditions may be preferable to head boundary conditions as they ensure mass conservation an independent effort must be made to obtain accurate estimates of recharge rates and distributions sanford 2002 which is almost impossible in many cases fully coupled physically based modeling approaches may eliminate the need to determine spatial and temporal recharge rates e g condon and maxwell 2015 frei et al 2009 jones et al 2008 panday and huyakorn 2004 tian et al 2015 these approaches simulate both surface water flow and groundwater flow simultaneously in an integrated system where climatic variables are specified as boundary conditions at the top surface of the model water exchange between the surface and subsurface domain i e groundwater recharge and discharge takes place spatially and temporally depending on pressure distributions in the entire system although the number of studies on the fully coupled assessment of surface water and groundwater has been growing continually none of existing studies has reported detailed insight into hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems in this study we attempted to simulate hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems through a fully coupled physically based numerical simulator hydrogeosphere aquanty inc 2018 hydrogeosphere simulates variably saturated groundwater flow with the 3 d modified form of the richards equation and models surface water flow with the 2 d diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equations it generally uses a dual node approach to simulate hydrological processes from precipitation surface runoff groundwater recharge to groundwater discharge we first modified the classic model introduced by tóth 1963 so that overland flow can be simulated then we examined transient groundwater flow by specifying historic climate data as boundary conditions compared to pure groundwater modeling with the undulating water table as boundary conditions this fully coupled modeling enables the water table to form naturally by itself based on the dynamic balance between surface water and groundwater it is not forced through a contrived often unrealistic hydraulic head boundary condition at the surface through fully coupled numerical experiments and qualitative comparison to classic tóthian modeling we aimed to 1 examine spatial and temporal changes in water table elevation 2 quantify relevant variation in surface water groundwater exchange fluxes and 3 improve the understanding of topography driven groundwater flow 2 classic and modified tóthian models 2 1 classic tóthian model we modified one of the classic models introduced by tóth 1963 to conduct numerical experiments as shown in fig 1 a the adopted classic model simulates groundwater flow in a cross sectional rectangle aquifer with the length and thickness of 20 000 m and 1 000 m respectively the two

these parameters are typical for a sandy aquifer we assume our aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic as our objective was to explore the general behaviour of nested groundwater flow the model was discretized uniformly with elemental sizes of 50 m horizontally and 10 m vertically resulting in a total of 40 000 elements the top 270 m was refined to better discretize unsaturated zone the choice of grid discretization was carefully made by ensuring no visual difference between the current grid scheme and the finer one note that the simulation was performed in steady state in this section same as tóth 1963 the simulated head contours and streamlines in fig 2 a resemble those produced analytically by tóth 1963 this also indicates that our grid discretization is reasonable under the current setting overall the undulating water table in the form of spatially varying head along the top boundary drives the development of several independent flow systems that originate from hilltops and terminate at adjacent valley bottoms groundwater flow can occur on both upstream and downstream directions only local flow systems can be identified by streamlines i e no regional flow systems because of the large ratio of model length to thickness i e 20 1 2 2 modified tóthian model the original top surface was then modified to coincide with the spatially varying head as shown in ⅱ of fig 1a this modification allows for the explicit description of topographic relief in the model which enables the simulation of hydrological processes including surface runoff surface water flow and variably saturated groundwater flow the model modification results in several changes in head contours and streamlines fig 2b for example equipotential lines and flow systems are slightly distorted due to the change in the actual top surface streamlines within a flow system become slightly asymmetric in comparison to those in the original model compare fig 2b with 2a despite these differences general patterns of the head and streamline distribution in the modified model remain largely similar to those in the original model this similarity in modeling results suggests that hydrogeosphere is capable of simulating nested flow systems under the current setting the land surface mimicking the same undulation as the water table in the modified model results in the sinusoidal variation in recharge and discharge across the top boundary fig 3 the blue dashed curve similar to the variation in the classic tóthian model fig 3 the red curve it is clear that both recharge and discharge rates are of the same magnitude but their locations alternate in space resulting in the development of local flow systems in general peak recharge occurs at hilltops whereas peak discharge is found at valley bottoms fig 3 in this specific case with k of 1 m d the maximum absolute value of recharge discharge rates reaches as high as 1 4 105 mm y apart from fluxes close to both side boundaries due to boundary effects d1 and r5 in fig 3 the large rates result from the specified head boundary condition which acts as an unlimited supply of water however the reasonableness of these rates needs careful consideration because recharge rates are not expected to exceed appropriate precipitation generally less than 2 000 mm y therefore while our modeling agrees with previous studies that water table configuration controls groundwater flow patterns freeze and witherspoon 1967 gleeson and manning 2008 gleeson et al 2011 sanford 2002 these large recharge rates raise a critical question as to whether and how the water table can undulate in homogeneous aquifers as we expect from the classic theory fully coupled modeling provides an effective pathway to examine this issue 3 fully coupled modeling of topography driven groundwater flow 3 1 transient fully coupled modeling several studies have tried to examine the transient behaviour of topography driven groundwater flow by either deriving an analytically transient solution or performing transient numerical simulations gomez and wilson 2013 niu et al 2015 vandenberg 1980 zhao et al 2018 these studies however still make an important assumption of water table changing in space and time in our study we performed transient numerical simulations of topography driven groundwater flow by simulating rainfall runoff processes in the modified model presented above the top surface of the modified model was treated as the surface domain fig 1b where rainfall and surface runoff processes occur as shown in fig 1b the node at the downstream end of the surface domain top left node was specified with a critical depth boundary condition which allows surface water to exit and forces the water depth to equal the critical depth in surface water flow the rest of the surface domain was specified with climatic boundary conditions including precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet unlike constant recharge rates employed as boundary conditions in previous studies e g goderniaux et al 2013 gleeson and manning 2008 liang et al 2013 climatic boundary conditions on the surface domain drive hydrological processes naturally by relaxing assumptions related to the top boundary condition as a result of the explicit simulation of the rainfall runoff process surface water will likely accumulate in the valleys this part of water can only leave the valleys either by recharging the groundwater system or through evaporation the setting for the subsurface domain remained unchanged from the modified model above i e remained as section 2 2 two real world climate datasets were collected from the silo database available at https www longpaddock qld gov au silo it contains australian climate data from 1889 to the present providing daily meteorological datasets for a variety of climatic variables including p pet air temperature humidity etc the two datasets were extracted for a humid and semi arid region respectively with a timescale of 100 years 1915 2015 the average p fig 4 the blue dashed line is 1696 mm y and 404 mm y respectively annual p seems to be more variable in the semi arid region fig 4b in comparison the average pet of the datasets fig 4 the orange dashed line which was obtained with the fao56 method is 765 mm y in the humid region fig 4a lower than that in the semi arid region 1356 mm y p pet index quantifying aridity extent and dry wet patterns li et al 2019 is 2 2 and 0 3 for the humid and semi arid region respectively the large difference in the p pet index reflects opposite interrelation between p and pet in two climatic regions apart from hydraulic parameters needed for simulating groundwater flow additional parameters are required for the simulation of surface water flow and evapotranspiration processes table 1 for simulating surface water flow a manning s roughness coefficient of 0 03 m 1 3 s was assigned to the surface domain for both x and y directions for simulating evapotranspiration literature parameter values for shrub were adopted panday and huyakorn 2004 we tested different vegetation parameters and found that the vegetation does not play a significant role in groundwater flow patterns as it only affects infiltration in the top few meters this influence is insignificant compared to the volume of the aquifer moreover as a first fully coupled attempt to simulate nested groundwater flow we attempted to remain as homogeneous as possible we employed the head distribution resulting from the steady state simulation as the initial condition for the subsurface domain and initial water depth of 0 0001 m for the surface domain for transient modeling the initial time step is 1 0 10 8 day and the maximum time step is 1 day if groundwater flow systems do not reach a dynamic equilibrium criteria the head increase rate at observation points smaller than 5 cm year in a full model run a 100 year simulation we rerun the model for another 100 years with the same model setting except the initial condition the simulated head distribution in the previous model run is used as the initial condition of the new model run we iterated this process until water table fluctuation at both observation points meets our criteria above the simulation time needed for this iterative process varies from model to model note that strictly speaking the last initial condition obtained by the iteration is not the proper one for the final model run several months to years in the beginning of the final model run are still needed to drive the model to a true dynamic equilibrium it is also well known that hydraulic conductivity k plays a critical role in controlling groundwater flow in order to examine how this parameter affects nested groundwater flow systems we applied another four different k over three orders of magnitude values including 100 10 0 1 and 0 01 m d all the other parameters were kept constant in all the scenarios tested for sensitivity analysis below 3 2 variation in nested groundwater flow firstly the variation in hydraulic head at two observation points obs a and obs b over 100 years was examined based on our modeling results the head variation is shown in fig 5 and the location of two observation points is presented in fig 6 as can be seen in fig 5 the head at both obs a and obs b fluctuates throughout the simulated period because of time varying precipitation and evapotranspiration the maximum change in the head difference between the highest and lowest head at both observation points over the period of the entire simulation is 5 1 m and 9 6 m respectively nevertheless the long term change in the head difference between the head at the start and in the end is merely 3 1 m and 2 3 m for two observation points respectively the long term average head at two observation points is about 1 040 m and 1 270 m respectively given the small variation in the head compared to the aquifer thickness at least greater than 1 000 m the groundwater system is considered to have reached a dynamic equilibrium although there is evident change in groundwater head as well as water table elevation the modeling result suggests that water table undulation maximum 4 m variation over a long period is almost negligible compared to the aquifer thickness from the perspective of the difference in water table undulation it is also reasonable to assume that groundwater flow systems have reached a dynamic equilibrium it can be observed that the water table is fully disconnected from the land surface on the right quarter of the aquifer whereas the water table interacts with surface water bodies for the rest of the aquifer in general the water table of the entire aquifer follows the regional topographic gradient however where groundwater intercepts with the land surface the water table is essentially the elevation of the water surface water table patterns determine the evolution of groundwater flow systems in the base case model streamlines are oriented downstream leftward connecting surface water bodies fig 6 these surface water bodies with inflow and outflow occurring in the same surface water body are characterized as flow through regimes nield et al 1994 winter 1999 this phenomenon was not observed in the previous modeling of nested flow systems with head as top boundary conditions in the classic tóthian model fig 2a streamlines originate from local peaks and terminate in local valleys driven by local topography relief resulting in relatively symmetric flow patterns local valleys are exclusively discharge areas flow through regimes do not occur moreover the irregular variation in the water table in the fully coupled model results in the co existence of local intermediate and regional flow systems fig 6 although not directly comparable due to boundary conditions the original tóthian model only has local flow systems fig 2 under the same model structure 3 3 variation in groundwater exchange because of the temporal variation in precipitation exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater are expected to vary in space and time as shown in fig 7 changes in exchange fluxes over time are relatively small because of limited temporal variation in water table undulation when surface water is absent exchange fluxes are almost zero in most areas because of very little precipitation at these snapshots when surface water exists exchange fluxes vary spatially the largest exchange flux occurs on the upper left corner where surface water exits due to the critical depth boundary for any area with surface water inundation marked in fig 7 exchange fluxes change from positive values on the right to negative values on the left with a rapid increase or decrease close to the edge we used five year 96 100 years average exchange fluxes to represent the long term average groundwater recharge and discharge fig 8 note that this temporal length is rather arbitrary we also examined the length of 10 years 91 100 years but did not observe apparent differences in average fluxes between two different temporal scales it is demonstrated that the five year average exchange fluxes are highly similar to instantaneous exchange fluxes fig 7 except for places with no surface water ponding it is clear that these exchange fluxes are representative of the amount of precipitation driven infiltration over five years as our system is driven by precipitation rather than head our resultant exchange fluxes are constrained by annual precipitation i e approximately 1700 mm y however as no heterogeneity e g vegetation rainfall or hydraulic conductivity was introduced in the model exchange fluxes are constant at those places without surface water ponding fig 8 black dashed rectangles in comparison exchange fluxes are far larger in absolute values for places with surface water ponding they vary spatially in a similar pattern but differ in values because of different hydraulic gradients between two adjacent surface water bodies 3 4 sensitivity analysis hydraulic conductivity k plays a significant role in determining water table undulation as can be seen in fig 9 a e water table undulation weakens with increasing k under the same climate nested groundwater flow tends to occur when the water table interacts with the land surface when k is smaller i e 0 1 m d fig 9b compared to 1 m d in the base case fig 9c groundwater flow is slower and the water table is higher leading to the greater interaction with the land surface and more apparent local flow systems when k is even smaller i e 0 01 m d fig 9a the entire subsurface domain is almost fully saturated and as a result only local flow systems remain with increasing penetration depth when k becomes very large e g 10 and 100 m d fig 9d and e the water table nearly disconnects from the land surface leading to regional groundwater flow with local groundwater flow formed close to the downstream end only a different climate results in completely different water balances and water table patterns p 404 mm y fig 9f j for the case with k 1 m d the water table is lower and less inclined compare fig 9h with 9c of course we can also observe that larger k causes flatter water table weaker water table undulation and more regional groundwater flow in the semi arid region this trend in the semi arid region is similar to that in the humid region however the groundwater flow regime becomes different when k is 0 01 m d or smaller we can find that the water table under local valleys are generally higher than both sides in the vicinity as marked by green dashed rectangles in fig 9f this is because this very small k does not allow rapid infiltration during episodic but intensive precipitation over the land surface as a result water at the surface is likely to flow towards valleys causing groundwater mounding underneath when the water table is disconnected from the land surface inverted water tables also emerge beneath valley bottoms xie et al 2014 this recharge mechanism has been documented in many previous studies e g brock 1991 korkmaz 2013 ortiz et al 1978 but has not been discussed in the context of nested flow systems in spite of limited precipitation in the semi arid condition focused recharge can also induce nested groundwater flow and keep it active at all times for exchange fluxes in comparison to the base case a smaller k i e 0 1 m d results in narrower ranges of precipitation driven infiltration constant fluxes and wider ranges of groundwater exchange with surface water due to higher water table compare fig 10 b with 10c when k is even smaller i e 0 01 m d groundwater exchange with surface water remains similar to the case with the larger k i e 0 1 m d but groundwater exchange with the land surface is strongly affected by evapotranspiration because the subsurface domain is nearly fully saturated compare fig 10a with 10b we can see that the exchange flux curve shows strong periodicity indicating the same mechanism of groundwater exchange when k is larger i e 10 m d the water table drops below the land surface in most areas except the valley bottom close to the left side fig 10d as a result exchange fluxes are largely constant as they are controlled by infiltration of precipitation when k is even larger i e 100 m d exchange fluxes become completely constant due to the disappearance of surface water fig 10e in comparison under the same k case the water table is much lower in the semi arid region than that in the humid region therefore more areas show constant exchange fluxes compare fig 10h with 10c similar to the humid region the increase in k causes the decline in the water table and the wider range of constant fluxes in the semi arid region from fig 10g to j however when k is 0 01 m d fig 10f the pattern of exchange fluxes at three valley bottoms on the right differs from that on the left and those under larger k cases e g 0 1 and 1 m d fig 10g and h at these three places groundwater exchange fluxes are all negative because of focused recharge resulting from overland flow fig 10f when the water table disconnects from valley bottoms see the two sharp decrease in fig 10f resultant focused recharge leads to exchange fluxes 4 5 times larger than those at surrounding areas recharge and discharge fluxes can be calculated by subtracting subsurface evapotranspiration rates set from groundwater exchange fluxes fig 11 it can be seen that the recharge discharge fluxes for large k cases i e 1 10 and 100 m d remain very close to exchange fluxes shown in fig 10 this is because a large k allows for fast infiltration and very little infiltrating water is used for evapotranspiration when k is smaller i e 0 1 m d recharge fluxes become smaller than exchange fluxes in the semi arid region compare fig 11g with fig 10g as the water table is closer to the land surface in the humid region the recharge fluxes are essentially closer to p minus pet compare fig 11b with fig 10b when k is even smaller i e 0 01 m d no obvious difference can be observed between the recharge discharge fluxes and exchange fluxes in the humid region case compare fig 11a with fig 10a due to minimal set resulting from surface water inundation however very large difference can be found for the semi arid region case compare fig 11f with fig 10f because soil water infiltration is slow and most infiltrating water is used for set 4 discussion 4 1 water table undulation water table undulation is a key factor that drives hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems this has been described in many studies where hydraulic parameters and geologic settings are almost homogeneous and isotropic e g freeze and witherspoon 1967 gomez and wilson 2013 jiang et al 2009 2010 tóth 1962 1963 our study suggests that water table undulation is largely affected by climate and hydraulic conductivity consistent with our intuition and many previous studies fan et al 2013 gleeson and manning 2008 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 liang et al 2013 wetter climate tends to result in greater groundwater recharge and so more inclined water table which interacts with surface water larger hydraulic conductivity allows for faster groundwater flow and flatter water table interestingly small hydraulic conductivity can also lead to strong water table undulation because of focused recharge at valley bottoms resultant from overland flow de vries and simmers 2002 this phenomenon has not been reported before although our study shows the occurrence of water table undulation it should be pointed out that it is difficult to form an undulating water table in a similar fashion to the land surface under homogeneous conditions in an integrated modeling framework our modeling analysis shows generally the sloping water table that links two adjacent surface water bodies when the water table is below the land surface fig 9a c as also shown by gleeson and manning 2008 this results in streamlines biased towards the left side downgradient largely driven by the hydraulic gradient between two water bodies in the vicinity however previous studies on nested groundwater flow generally show groundwater streamlines biased towards both the left and the right sides with hilltops acting as groundwater divides tóth 1963 verruijt 2007 different patterns of streamlines in the fully coupled model result from the disappearance of groundwater divides under topographic highs due to the dynamic balance among precipitation evapotranspiration surface water soil water and groundwater flow under current topographic and hydrogeologic conditions when groundwater divides occur under certain conditions liang et al 2010 the more familiar bidirectional streamlines under a groundwater divide will start to appear 4 2 groundwater exchange fluxes our study quantified exchange fluxes between the surface and subsurface domain the pattern and magnitude of exchange fluxes is dependent on the pattern of surface water and groundwater interaction when surface water is absent exchange fluxes are controlled by precipitation minus evapotranspiration xie et al 2019 when surface water is present exchange fluxes are largely determined by the location of the underlying water table relative to the bottom of surface water i e stream bed which may lead to connected disconnected and losing disconnected stream conditions brunner et al 2009 xie et al 2014 for disconnected and losing disconnected conditions exchange fluxes are only directed towards the underlying aquifer and represent natural recharge however exchange fluxes can be in both directions for the connected condition leading to the occurrence of flow through rivers or lakes winter 1999 vertical water table fluxes in the classic tóthian model vary in a sinusoidal pattern apart from boundary effects on both sides haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 jiang et al 2009 these vertical fluxes represent groundwater recharge and discharge rates the spatial distribution of the recharge and discharge is well related to water table undulation more generally groundwater discharge dominates when the water table is at topographic lows and groundwater recharge dominates when the water table is at topographic highs jiang et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 as for the recharge vertical fluxes increase gradually closer to hilltops where groundwater divides are located most of these fluxes are beyond annual precipitation while not directly comparable recharge rates in fully coupled models can also be large but they never exceed actual precipitation clearly large recharge rates implied by the classic tóthian model may need careful assessment with regard to their reasonableness 4 3 implications appropriate top boundary conditions are critical for groundwater modeling bresciani et al 2016 liang et al 2013 sanford 2002 zijl 1999 zhao et al 2018 employing simplified head boundary conditions has been a common practice in simulating nested flow systems however using head as the forcing function has not been widely tested and can be in error in some cases as it can result in unrealistic fluxes that can potentially exceed realistic rainfall rates in reality hydraulic head is the result of groundwater flow and k values which is not the forcing function that is relevant water table position and fluctuation is not the cause but the effect therefore boundary conditions should be chosen with careful consideration in terms of causality between these quantities bresciani et al 2016 fully coupled modeling uses climatic variables as boundary conditions that can be easily measured in the field this conceptualization is more realistic for a range of conditions encountered in nature our fully coupled modeling suggests small variation in groundwater head and limited changes in nested flow systems over 100 years provided stationary climate this occurs in both semi arid and humid regions the occurrence of this phenomenon is because water table variation is small relative to the scale of the aquifer it is clear that in a specific region the k distribution is fixed groundwater flow systems are mainly controlled by regional climate in the long term it is appropriate to assume that groundwater flow systems are in steady state even when there is focused recharge partly consistent with niu et al 2015 transience must be considered if we care about local flow processes and surface water processes that are highly dependent on water table elevation and surface runoff also heterogeneity and anisotropy at the regional scale do commonly exist the impacts of which have been investigated in a number of previous studies in various forms cardenas and jiang 2010 freeze and witherspoon 1967 jiang et al 2009 2010 niu et al 2015 therefore further research on a complex model structure involving heterogeneity and anisotropy should be considered together with the fully coupled approach 5 summary and conclusions topography driven nested groundwater flow is a known phenomenon the relevant theory originated from tóth 1963 and has been investigated in many previous studies most of them employed spatially varying hydraulic head as boundary conditions in steady state in order to eliminate potential issues with the use of head as top boundary conditions we employed a fully coupled surface subsurface hydrologic modeling approach with climatic variables as boundary conditions to simulate nested groundwater flow under different k values and climatic conditions several remarks can be made as follows 1 spatially varying hydraulic head as boundary conditions used in numerous previous studies can result in large vertical fluxes in homogeneous and isotropic topography driven flow systems these vertical fluxes are unreasonable when relating to recharge rates as they can potentially exceed realistic rainfall rates this finding indicates that modeled groundwater flow rates could be larger than the reality it also raises concerns regarding causality between groundwater flow and hydraulic head 2 despite some fluctuations in groundwater head over 100 years it is appropriate to assume that groundwater flow systems are in dynamic equilibrium under a certain climate compared to previous studies our fully coupled modeling suggests that under the same climate water table undulation is affected by regional topographic gradient and surface water presence and is difficult to behave as a subdued replica of the land surface because of the presence of surface water groundwater flow is largely towards downstream regions i e the left side in this model connecting two adjacent water bodies 3 exchange fluxes between the surface and subsurface domain vary in space and time when there is no surface water ponding exchange fluxes are almost zero limited by precipitation infiltration when there is surface water ponding exchange fluxes experience a transition from positive to negative values i e recharge to discharge spatially under the influence of relative locations of surface water and groundwater in general fluxes in our fully coupled models are more appropriate compared with those in the classic tóthian models this is because the fully coupled models are under natural and relaxed rather than contrived boundary conditions and the water table is the response to the climatic forcing this self generating and natural system honors causality in terms of physics 4 sensitivity analysis suggests that water table undulation and resultant exchange fluxes are largely affected by climate and hydraulic conductivity wetter climate and smaller k cause higher water table more expansive regions of surface water and more nested groundwater flow systems drier climate and larger k lead to the opposite behaviour the range of constant exchange fluxes due to precipitation infiltration widens with the increase in k under the same climate under very small k cases in the semi arid region focused recharge is likely to occur due to episodic but intensive precipitation resulting in local flow systems in local valleys and also larger exchange fluxes than surrounding areas overall this study provides a new perspective to characterize topography driven groundwater flow through transient fully coupled modeling it found that groundwater flow systems driven by hydraulic head as top boundary conditions can lead to high fluxes often unrealistic and larger than precipitation the pattern of tóthian nested groundwater flow systems under the idealized conceptual model may be less common than previously understood or intuited through comprehensive sensitivity analysis these new findings are expected to have important implications for basin scale groundwater modeling as well as water resource management given certain limitations imposed future work should be devoted to performing three dimensional fully coupled modeling on flow patterns considering the combined impacts of several factors including topography climate and geology under more complex real

4877,numerical models with spatially varying head as top boundary conditions were used in previous studies to understand topography driven groundwater flow the head boundary conditions could cause artifacts of extremely large but unrealistic recharge rates owing to unlimited supply of water this study adopted a fully coupled surface subsurface hydrologic modeling approach to simulate transient topography driven groundwater flow and also surface water flow under homogeneous and isotropic settings two 100 year climate datasets and five hydraulic conductivities k 0 01 100 m d were tested in numerical experiments in the base case with a wet climate annual precipitation 1696 mm y and k of 1 m d groundwater head at two different locations close to both lateral boundaries fluctuates only within 5 1 m and 9 6 m respectively during the 100 year period despite the local water table fluctuations caused by the variability in the climatic record large scale groundwater flow systems can be assumed in dynamic equilibrium provided stationary climate long term average exchange fluxes are spatially constant and limited by precipitation infiltration when surface water is absent whereas they vary from positive to negative values i e recharge to discharge spatially when surface water is present sensitivity analysis suggests that wetter climate and smaller k lead to more inundation of the land surface stronger hierarchical nesting of groundwater flow systems and more variable exchange fluxes overall our first fully coupled modeling of topography driven groundwater flow implies that attention must be paid to causality between head and flow and climatic record as boundary conditions may be more appropriate due to its relaxed manner keywords topography driven groundwater flow fully coupled surface water groundwater modeling climate groundwater exchange fluxes 1 introduction water table elevation may vary in space which results in the occurrence of different scales of groundwater flow systems i e local intermediate and regional in the same sedimentary aquifer jiang et al 2014 robinson and love 2013 tóth 1962 1963 although the hierarchical nesting pattern of groundwater flow systems may differ in various aquifers this concept is critical for the understanding and assessment of hydrological processes such as heat and solute transport cardenas 2007 lazear 2006 water resource sustainability huggenberger et al 2013 and surface water groundwater interaction havril et al 2018 sophocleous 2002 winter 1999 this theory of nested groundwater flow systems has also been utilized practically to help guide fossil energy exploitation harrison et al 2000 tóth and otto 1989 site selection for long term nuclear waste disposal tóth and sheng 1996 voss and provost 2001 and other geo environmental system engineering engelen and jones 1986 engelen and kloosterman 1996 since the introduction of the concept of hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems tóth 1962 1963 numerous numerical studies have been carried out to better understand the hydrodynamics of nested flow systems and resultant groundwater age distributions cardenas 2007 cardenas and jiang 2010 jiang et al 2012 robinson and love 2013 wang et al 2016 many other studies examined the impacts of different factors on nested flow systems such as aquifer permeability settings freeze and witherspoon 1967 jiang et al 2009 2010 and spatiotemporal variation in water table undulation freeze and witherspoon 1967 gomez and wilson 2013 vandenberg 1980 zijl 1999 zhao et al 2018 almost all of these studies employed spatially varying hydraulic head as top boundary conditions in order to ensure perfect undulating water table similar to tóth 1963 this approach eliminates the need to determine spatial groundwater recharge rates but may potentially produce unrealistic groundwater recharge rates which are much larger than precipitation other than the method described above a number of studies have attempted to employ recharge rates as top boundary conditions in simulating nested groundwater flow systems forster and smith 1988 goderniaux et al 2013 gleeson and manning 2008 liang et al 2013 welch and allen 2012 for example forster and smith 1988 first developed a modified free surface approach to accommodate recharge at upper elevations on the seepage face allowing for examining the controls of thermal conditions on patterns and rates of groundwater flow in mountainous terrain gleeson and manning 2008 investigated topographic and hydrogeologic controls on regional and perpendicular groundwater flow by specifying spatially uniform recharge rates to the top surface of a 3 d idealized mountainous multi basin model on the basis of gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2012 allocated two different but temporally constant recharge rates in the mountain area and the plain area respectively in order to examine groundwater flow patterns under similar settings liang et al 2013 examined the impacts of changing infiltration intensity and hydraulic conductivity settings on groundwater flow patterns by establishing a base case model with recharge rates as upper boundary conditions similar to their physical sand box experiments liang et al 2010 although recharge boundary conditions may be preferable to head boundary conditions as they ensure mass conservation an independent effort must be made to obtain accurate estimates of recharge rates and distributions sanford 2002 which is almost impossible in many cases fully coupled physically based modeling approaches may eliminate the need to determine spatial and temporal recharge rates e g condon and maxwell 2015 frei et al 2009 jones et al 2008 panday and huyakorn 2004 tian et al 2015 these approaches simulate both surface water flow and groundwater flow simultaneously in an integrated system where climatic variables are specified as boundary conditions at the top surface of the model water exchange between the surface and subsurface domain i e groundwater recharge and discharge takes place spatially and temporally depending on pressure distributions in the entire system although the number of studies on the fully coupled assessment of surface water and groundwater has been growing continually none of existing studies has reported detailed insight into hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems in this study we attempted to simulate hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems through a fully coupled physically based numerical simulator hydrogeosphere aquanty inc 2018 hydrogeosphere simulates variably saturated groundwater flow with the 3 d modified form of the richards equation and models surface water flow with the 2 d diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equations it generally uses a dual node approach to simulate hydrological processes from precipitation surface runoff groundwater recharge to groundwater discharge we first modified the classic model introduced by tóth 1963 so that overland flow can be simulated then we examined transient groundwater flow by specifying historic climate data as boundary conditions compared to pure groundwater modeling with the undulating water table as boundary conditions this fully coupled modeling enables the water table to form naturally by itself based on the dynamic balance between surface water and groundwater it is not forced through a contrived often unrealistic hydraulic head boundary condition at the surface through fully coupled numerical experiments and qualitative comparison to classic tóthian modeling we aimed to 1 examine spatial and temporal changes in water table elevation 2 quantify relevant variation in surface water groundwater exchange fluxes and 3 improve the understanding of topography driven groundwater flow 2 classic and modified tóthian models 2 1 classic tóthian model we modified one of the classic models introduced by tóth 1963 to conduct numerical experiments as shown in fig 1 a the adopted classic model simulates groundwater flow in a cross sectional rectangle aquifer with the length and thickness of 20 000 m and 1 000 m respectively the two dimensional model employs a spatially varying hydraulic head boundary condition on the top and no flow boundary conditions on all the other sides the spatially varying hydraulic head boundary condition is given as follows 1 z x z 0 x t a n α a c o s α sin 2 π x λ c o s α where z 0 is the thickness of the aquifer on the left side boundary of the valley bottom l t a n α is the slope of the axial line of the sinusoidal wave a is the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave l λ is the wavelength of the sinusoidal wave l and x is the distance to the left side boundary l a hydraulic conductivity k of 1 m d a porosity θ of 0 43 were chosen and van genuchten soil retention curve parameters α 14 m 1 and β 2 5 carsel and parrish 1988 freeze and cherry 1979 were specified for the base case table 1 these parameters are typical for a sandy aquifer we assume our aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic as our objective was to explore the general behaviour of nested groundwater flow the model was discretized uniformly with elemental sizes of 50 m horizontally and 10 m vertically resulting in a total of 40 000 elements the top 270 m was refined to better discretize unsaturated zone the choice of grid discretization was carefully made by ensuring no visual difference between the current grid scheme and the finer one note that the simulation was performed in steady state in this section same as tóth 1963 the simulated head contours and streamlines in fig 2 a resemble those produced analytically by tóth 1963 this also indicates that our grid discretization is reasonable under the current setting overall the undulating water table in the form of spatially varying head along the top boundary drives the development of several independent flow systems that originate from hilltops and terminate at adjacent valley bottoms groundwater flow can occur on both upstream and downstream directions only local flow systems can be identified by streamlines i e no regional flow systems because of the large ratio of model length to thickness i e 20 1 2 2 modified tóthian model the original top surface was then modified to coincide with the spatially varying head as shown in ⅱ of fig 1a this modification allows for the explicit description of topographic relief in the model which enables the simulation of hydrological processes including surface runoff surface water flow and variably saturated groundwater flow the model modification results in several changes in head contours and streamlines fig 2b for example equipotential lines and flow systems are slightly distorted due to the change in the actual top surface streamlines within a flow system become slightly asymmetric in comparison to those in the original model compare fig 2b with 2a despite these differences general patterns of the head and streamline distribution in the modified model remain largely similar to those in the original model this similarity in modeling results suggests that hydrogeosphere is capable of simulating nested flow systems under the current setting the land surface mimicking the same undulation as the water table in the modified model results in the sinusoidal variation in recharge and discharge across the top boundary fig 3 the blue dashed curve similar to the variation in the classic tóthian model fig 3 the red curve it is clear that both recharge and discharge rates are of the same magnitude but their locations alternate in space resulting in the development of local flow systems in general peak recharge occurs at hilltops whereas peak discharge is found at valley bottoms fig 3 in this specific case with k of 1 m d the maximum absolute value of recharge discharge rates reaches as high as 1 4 105 mm y apart from fluxes close to both side boundaries due to boundary effects d1 and r5 in fig 3 the large rates result from the specified head boundary condition which acts as an unlimited supply of water however the reasonableness of these rates needs careful consideration because recharge rates are not expected to exceed appropriate precipitation generally less than 2 000 mm y therefore while our modeling agrees with previous studies that water table configuration controls groundwater flow patterns freeze and witherspoon 1967 gleeson and manning 2008 gleeson et al 2011 sanford 2002 these large recharge rates raise a critical question as to whether and how the water table can undulate in homogeneous aquifers as we expect from the classic theory fully coupled modeling provides an effective pathway to examine this issue 3 fully coupled modeling of topography driven groundwater flow 3 1 transient fully coupled modeling several studies have tried to examine the transient behaviour of topography driven groundwater flow by either deriving an analytically transient solution or performing transient numerical simulations gomez and wilson 2013 niu et al 2015 vandenberg 1980 zhao et al 2018 these studies however still make an important assumption of water table changing in space and time in our study we performed transient numerical simulations of topography driven groundwater flow by simulating rainfall runoff processes in the modified model presented above the top surface of the modified model was treated as the surface domain fig 1b where rainfall and surface runoff processes occur as shown in fig 1b the node at the downstream end of the surface domain top left node was specified with a critical depth boundary condition which allows surface water to exit and forces the water depth to equal the critical depth in surface water flow the rest of the surface domain was specified with climatic boundary conditions including precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet unlike constant recharge rates employed as boundary conditions in previous studies e g goderniaux et al 2013 gleeson and manning 2008 liang et al 2013 climatic boundary conditions on the surface domain drive hydrological processes naturally by relaxing assumptions related to the top boundary condition as a result of the explicit simulation of the rainfall runoff process surface water will likely accumulate in the valleys this part of water can only leave the valleys either by recharging the groundwater system or through evaporation the setting for the subsurface domain remained unchanged from the modified model above i e remained as section 2 2 two real world climate datasets were collected from the silo database available at https www longpaddock qld gov au silo it contains australian climate data from 1889 to the present providing daily meteorological datasets for a variety of climatic variables including p pet air temperature humidity etc the two datasets were extracted for a humid and semi arid region respectively with a timescale of 100 years 1915 2015 the average p fig 4 the blue dashed line is 1696 mm y and 404 mm y respectively annual p seems to be more variable in the semi arid region fig 4b in comparison the average pet of the datasets fig 4 the orange dashed line which was obtained with the fao56 method is 765 mm y in the humid region fig 4a lower than that in the semi arid region 1356 mm y p pet index quantifying aridity extent and dry wet patterns li et al 2019 is 2 2 and 0 3 for the humid and semi arid region respectively the large difference in the p pet index reflects opposite interrelation between p and pet in two climatic regions apart from hydraulic parameters needed for simulating groundwater flow additional parameters are required for the simulation of surface water flow and evapotranspiration processes table 1 for simulating surface water flow a manning s roughness coefficient of 0 03 m 1 3 s was assigned to the surface domain for both x and y directions for simulating evapotranspiration literature parameter values for shrub were adopted panday and huyakorn 2004 we tested different vegetation parameters and found that the vegetation does not play a significant role in groundwater flow patterns as it only affects infiltration in the top few meters this influence is insignificant compared to the volume of the aquifer moreover as a first fully coupled attempt to simulate nested groundwater flow we attempted to remain as homogeneous as possible we employed the head distribution resulting from the steady state simulation as the initial condition for the subsurface domain and initial water depth of 0 0001 m for the surface domain for transient modeling the initial time step is 1 0 10 8 day and the maximum time step is 1 day if groundwater flow systems do not reach a dynamic equilibrium criteria the head increase rate at observation points smaller than 5 cm year in a full model run a 100 year simulation we rerun the model for another 100 years with the same model setting except the initial condition the simulated head distribution in the previous model run is used as the initial condition of the new model run we iterated this process until water table fluctuation at both observation points meets our criteria above the simulation time needed for this iterative process varies from model to model note that strictly speaking the last initial condition obtained by the iteration is not the proper one for the final model run several months to years in the beginning of the final model run are still needed to drive the model to a true dynamic equilibrium it is also well known that hydraulic conductivity k plays a critical role in controlling groundwater flow in order to examine how this parameter affects nested groundwater flow systems we applied another four different k over three orders of magnitude values including 100 10 0 1 and 0 01 m d all the other parameters were kept constant in all the scenarios tested for sensitivity analysis below 3 2 variation in nested groundwater flow firstly the variation in hydraulic head at two observation points obs a and obs b over 100 years was examined based on our modeling results the head variation is shown in fig 5 and the location of two observation points is presented in fig 6 as can be seen in fig 5 the head at both obs a and obs b fluctuates throughout the simulated period because of time varying precipitation and evapotranspiration the maximum change in the head difference between the highest and lowest head at both observation points over the period of the entire simulation is 5 1 m and 9 6 m respectively nevertheless the long term change in the head difference between the head at the start and in the end is merely 3 1 m and 2 3 m for two observation points respectively the long term average head at two observation points is about 1 040 m and 1 270 m respectively given the small variation in the head compared to the aquifer thickness at least greater than 1 000 m the groundwater system is considered to have reached a dynamic equilibrium although there is evident change in groundwater head as well as water table elevation the modeling result suggests that water table undulation maximum 4 m variation over a long period is almost negligible compared to the aquifer thickness from the perspective of the difference in water table undulation it is also reasonable to assume that groundwater flow systems have reached a dynamic equilibrium it can be observed that the water table is fully disconnected from the land surface on the right quarter of the aquifer whereas the water table interacts with surface water bodies for the rest of the aquifer in general the water table of the entire aquifer follows the regional topographic gradient however where groundwater intercepts with the land surface the water table is essentially the elevation of the water surface water table patterns determine the evolution of groundwater flow systems in the base case model streamlines are oriented downstream leftward connecting surface water bodies fig 6 these surface water bodies with inflow and outflow occurring in the same surface water body are characterized as flow through regimes nield et al 1994 winter 1999 this phenomenon was not observed in the previous modeling of nested flow systems with head as top boundary conditions in the classic tóthian model fig 2a streamlines originate from local peaks and terminate in local valleys driven by local topography relief resulting in relatively symmetric flow patterns local valleys are exclusively discharge areas flow through regimes do not occur moreover the irregular variation in the water table in the fully coupled model results in the co existence of local intermediate and regional flow systems fig 6 although not directly comparable due to boundary conditions the original tóthian model only has local flow systems fig 2 under the same model structure 3 3 variation in groundwater exchange because of the temporal variation in precipitation exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater are expected to vary in space and time as shown in fig 7 changes in exchange fluxes over time are relatively small because of limited temporal variation in water table undulation when surface water is absent exchange fluxes are almost zero in most areas because of very little precipitation at these snapshots when surface water exists exchange fluxes vary spatially the largest exchange flux occurs on the upper left corner where surface water exits due to the critical depth boundary for any area with surface water inundation marked in fig 7 exchange fluxes change from positive values on the right to negative values on the left with a rapid increase or decrease close to the edge we used five year 96 100 years average exchange fluxes to represent the long term average groundwater recharge and discharge fig 8 note that this temporal length is rather arbitrary we also examined the length of 10 years 91 100 years but did not observe apparent differences in average fluxes between two different temporal scales it is demonstrated that the five year average exchange fluxes are highly similar to instantaneous exchange fluxes fig 7 except for places with no surface water ponding it is clear that these exchange fluxes are representative of the amount of precipitation driven infiltration over five years as our system is driven by precipitation rather than head our resultant exchange fluxes are constrained by annual precipitation i e approximately 1700 mm y however as no heterogeneity e g vegetation rainfall or hydraulic conductivity was introduced in the model exchange fluxes are constant at those places without surface water ponding fig 8 black dashed rectangles in comparison exchange fluxes are far larger in absolute values for places with surface water ponding they vary spatially in a similar pattern but differ in values because of different hydraulic gradients between two adjacent surface water bodies 3 4 sensitivity analysis hydraulic conductivity k plays a significant role in determining water table undulation as can be seen in fig 9 a e water table undulation weakens with increasing k under the same climate nested groundwater flow tends to occur when the water table interacts with the land surface when k is smaller i e 0 1 m d fig 9b compared to 1 m d in the base case fig 9c groundwater flow is slower and the water table is higher leading to the greater interaction with the land surface and more apparent local flow systems when k is even smaller i e 0 01 m d fig 9a the entire subsurface domain is almost fully saturated and as a result only local flow systems remain with increasing penetration depth when k becomes very large e g 10 and 100 m d fig 9d and e the water table nearly disconnects from the land surface leading to regional groundwater flow with local groundwater flow formed close to the downstream end only a different climate results in completely different water balances and water table patterns p 404 mm y fig 9f j for the case with k 1 m d the water table is lower and less inclined compare fig 9h with 9c of course we can also observe that larger k causes flatter water table weaker water table undulation and more regional groundwater flow in the semi arid region this trend in the semi arid region is similar to that in the humid region however the groundwater flow regime becomes different when k is 0 01 m d or smaller we can find that the water table under local valleys are generally higher than both sides in the vicinity as marked by green dashed rectangles in fig 9f this is because this very small k does not allow rapid infiltration during episodic but intensive precipitation over the land surface as a result water at the surface is likely to flow towards valleys causing groundwater mounding underneath when the water table is disconnected from the land surface inverted water tables also emerge beneath valley bottoms xie et al 2014 this recharge mechanism has been documented in many previous studies e g brock 1991 korkmaz 2013 ortiz et al 1978 but has not been discussed in the context of nested flow systems in spite of limited precipitation in the semi arid condition focused recharge can also induce nested groundwater flow and keep it active at all times for exchange fluxes in comparison to the base case a smaller k i e 0 1 m d results in narrower ranges of precipitation driven infiltration constant fluxes and wider ranges of groundwater exchange with surface water due to higher water table compare fig 10 b with 10c when k is even smaller i e 0 01 m d groundwater exchange with surface water remains similar to the case with the larger k i e 0 1 m d but groundwater exchange with the land surface is strongly affected by evapotranspiration because the subsurface domain is nearly fully saturated compare fig 10a with 10b we can see that the exchange flux curve shows strong periodicity indicating the same mechanism of groundwater exchange when k is larger i e 10 m d the water table drops below the land surface in most areas except the valley bottom close to the left side fig 10d as a result exchange fluxes are largely constant as they are controlled by infiltration of precipitation when k is even larger i e 100 m d exchange fluxes become completely constant due to the disappearance of surface water fig 10e in comparison under the same k case the water table is much lower in the semi arid region than that in the humid region therefore more areas show constant exchange fluxes compare fig 10h with 10c similar to the humid region the increase in k causes the decline in the water table and the wider range of constant fluxes in the semi arid region from fig 10g to j however when k is 0 01 m d fig 10f the pattern of exchange fluxes at three valley bottoms on the right differs from that on the left and those under larger k cases e g 0 1 and 1 m d fig 10g and h at these three places groundwater exchange fluxes are all negative because of focused recharge resulting from overland flow fig 10f when the water table disconnects from valley bottoms see the two sharp decrease in fig 10f resultant focused recharge leads to exchange fluxes 4 5 times larger than those at surrounding areas recharge and discharge fluxes can be calculated by subtracting subsurface evapotranspiration rates set from groundwater exchange fluxes fig 11 it can be seen that the recharge discharge fluxes for large k cases i e 1 10 and 100 m d remain very close to exchange fluxes shown in fig 10 this is because a large k allows for fast infiltration and very little infiltrating water is used for evapotranspiration when k is smaller i e 0 1 m d recharge fluxes become smaller than exchange fluxes in the semi arid region compare fig 11g with fig 10g as the water table is closer to the land surface in the humid region the recharge fluxes are essentially closer to p minus pet compare fig 11b with fig 10b when k is even smaller i e 0 01 m d no obvious difference can be observed between the recharge discharge fluxes and exchange fluxes in the humid region case compare fig 11a with fig 10a due to minimal set resulting from surface water inundation however very large difference can be found for the semi arid region case compare fig 11f with fig 10f because soil water infiltration is slow and most infiltrating water is used for set 4 discussion 4 1 water table undulation water table undulation is a key factor that drives hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems this has been described in many studies where hydraulic parameters and geologic settings are almost homogeneous and isotropic e g freeze and witherspoon 1967 gomez and wilson 2013 jiang et al 2009 2010 tóth 1962 1963 our study suggests that water table undulation is largely affected by climate and hydraulic conductivity consistent with our intuition and many previous studies fan et al 2013 gleeson and manning 2008 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 liang et al 2013 wetter climate tends to result in greater groundwater recharge and so more inclined water table which interacts with surface water larger hydraulic conductivity allows for faster groundwater flow and flatter water table interestingly small hydraulic conductivity can also lead to strong water table undulation because of focused recharge at valley bottoms resultant from overland flow de vries and simmers 2002 this phenomenon has not been reported before although our study shows the occurrence of water table undulation it should be pointed out that it is difficult to form an undulating water table in a similar fashion to the land surface under homogeneous conditions in an integrated modeling framework our modeling analysis shows generally the sloping water table that links two adjacent surface water bodies when the water table is below the land surface fig 9a c as also shown by gleeson and manning 2008 this results in streamlines biased towards the left side downgradient largely driven by the hydraulic gradient between two water bodies in the vicinity however previous studies on nested groundwater flow generally show groundwater streamlines biased towards both the left and the right sides with hilltops acting as groundwater divides tóth 1963 verruijt 2007 different patterns of streamlines in the fully coupled model result from the disappearance of groundwater divides under topographic highs due to the dynamic balance among precipitation evapotranspiration surface water soil water and groundwater flow under current topographic and hydrogeologic conditions when groundwater divides occur under certain conditions liang et al 2010 the more familiar bidirectional streamlines under a groundwater divide will start to appear 4 2 groundwater exchange fluxes our study quantified exchange fluxes between the surface and subsurface domain the pattern and magnitude of exchange fluxes is dependent on the pattern of surface water and groundwater interaction when surface water is absent exchange fluxes are controlled by precipitation minus evapotranspiration xie et al 2019 when surface water is present exchange fluxes are largely determined by the location of the underlying water table relative to the bottom of surface water i e stream bed which may lead to connected disconnected and losing disconnected stream conditions brunner et al 2009 xie et al 2014 for disconnected and losing disconnected conditions exchange fluxes are only directed towards the underlying aquifer and represent natural recharge however exchange fluxes can be in both directions for the connected condition leading to the occurrence of flow through rivers or lakes winter 1999 vertical water table fluxes in the classic tóthian model vary in a sinusoidal pattern apart from boundary effects on both sides haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 jiang et al 2009 these vertical fluxes represent groundwater recharge and discharge rates the spatial distribution of the recharge and discharge is well related to water table undulation more generally groundwater discharge dominates when the water table is at topographic lows and groundwater recharge dominates when the water table is at topographic highs jiang et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 as for the recharge vertical fluxes increase gradually closer to hilltops where groundwater divides are located most of these fluxes are beyond annual precipitation while not directly comparable recharge rates in fully coupled models can also be large but they never exceed actual precipitation clearly large recharge rates implied by the classic tóthian model may need careful assessment with regard to their reasonableness 4 3 implications appropriate top boundary conditions are critical for groundwater modeling bresciani et al 2016 liang et al 2013 sanford 2002 zijl 1999 zhao et al 2018 employing simplified head boundary conditions has been a common practice in simulating nested flow systems however using head as the forcing function has not been widely tested and can be in error in some cases as it can result in unrealistic fluxes that can potentially exceed realistic rainfall rates in reality hydraulic head is the result of groundwater flow and k values which is not the forcing function that is relevant water table position and fluctuation is not the cause but the effect therefore boundary conditions should be chosen with careful consideration in terms of causality between these quantities bresciani et al 2016 fully coupled modeling uses climatic variables as boundary conditions that can be easily measured in the field this conceptualization is more realistic for a range of conditions encountered in nature our fully coupled modeling suggests small variation in groundwater head and limited changes in nested flow systems over 100 years provided stationary climate this occurs in both semi arid and humid regions the occurrence of this phenomenon is because water table variation is small relative to the scale of the aquifer it is clear that in a specific region the k distribution is fixed groundwater flow systems are mainly controlled by regional climate in the long term it is appropriate to assume that groundwater flow systems are in steady state even when there is focused recharge partly consistent with niu et al 2015 transience must be considered if we care about local flow processes and surface water processes that are highly dependent on water table elevation and surface runoff also heterogeneity and anisotropy at the regional scale do commonly exist the impacts of which have been investigated in a number of previous studies in various forms cardenas and jiang 2010 freeze and witherspoon 1967 jiang et al 2009 2010 niu et al 2015 therefore further research on a complex model structure involving heterogeneity and anisotropy should be considered together with the fully coupled approach 5 summary and conclusions topography driven nested groundwater flow is a known phenomenon the relevant theory originated from tóth 1963 and has been investigated in many previous studies most of them employed spatially varying hydraulic head as boundary conditions in steady state in order to eliminate potential issues with the use of head as top boundary conditions we employed a fully coupled surface subsurface hydrologic modeling approach with climatic variables as boundary conditions to simulate nested groundwater flow under different k values and climatic conditions several remarks can be made as follows 1 spatially varying hydraulic head as boundary conditions used in numerous previous studies can result in large vertical fluxes in homogeneous and isotropic topography driven flow systems these vertical fluxes are unreasonable when relating to recharge rates as they can potentially exceed realistic rainfall rates this finding indicates that modeled groundwater flow rates could be larger than the reality it also raises concerns regarding causality between groundwater flow and hydraulic head 2 despite some fluctuations in groundwater head over 100 years it is appropriate to assume that groundwater flow systems are in dynamic equilibrium under a certain climate compared to previous studies our fully coupled modeling suggests that under the same climate water table undulation is affected by regional topographic gradient and surface water presence and is difficult to behave as a subdued replica of the land surface because of the presence of surface water groundwater flow is largely towards downstream regions i e the left side in this model connecting two adjacent water bodies 3 exchange fluxes between the surface and subsurface domain vary in space and time when there is no surface water ponding exchange fluxes are almost zero limited by precipitation infiltration when there is surface water ponding exchange fluxes experience a transition from positive to negative values i e recharge to discharge spatially under the influence of relative locations of surface water and groundwater in general fluxes in our fully coupled models are more appropriate compared with those in the classic tóthian models this is because the fully coupled models are under natural and relaxed rather than contrived boundary conditions and the water table is the response to the climatic forcing this self generating and natural system honors causality in terms of physics 4 sensitivity analysis suggests that water table undulation and resultant exchange fluxes are largely affected by climate and hydraulic conductivity wetter climate and smaller k cause higher water table more expansive regions of surface water and more nested groundwater flow systems drier climate and larger k lead to the opposite behaviour the range of constant exchange fluxes due to precipitation infiltration widens with the increase in k under the same climate under very small k cases in the semi arid region focused recharge is likely to occur due to episodic but intensive precipitation resulting in local flow systems in local valleys and also larger exchange fluxes than surrounding areas overall this study provides a new perspective to characterize topography driven groundwater flow through transient fully coupled modeling it found that groundwater flow systems driven by hydraulic head as top boundary conditions can lead to high fluxes often unrealistic and larger than precipitation the pattern of tóthian nested groundwater flow systems under the idealized conceptual model may be less common than previously understood or intuited through comprehensive sensitivity analysis these new findings are expected to have important implications for basin scale groundwater modeling as well as water resource management given certain limitations imposed future work should be devoted to performing three dimensional fully coupled modeling on flow patterns considering the combined impacts of several factors including topography climate and geology under more complex real

4878,topography is one of the main factors in hillslope rainfall runoff processes the effect of hillslope geometry representing an important aspect of topography on hortonian rainfall runoff has not been fully understood in order to investigate this effect hillslope geometry was abstracted as the combination of longitudinal profile curvature and plan shape and a set of representative hillslope surfaces were generated using a variety of values of the profile curvature and plan shape factor the infiltration and hortonian runoff processes mainly characterized by ponding time infiltration rate and runoff rate and depth were computed using richards equation for variably saturated flow with given initial soil moisture rainfall and soil texture the results show that different profile curvature and plan shape can cause more than 10 difference in cumulative runoff and runoff rate and more than 20 difference in ponding time the curvature of hillslope longitudinal profile affects infiltration and runoff nonmonotonically and plays a more important role than the plan shape whose effect is monotonic the profile curvature and plan shape can complicate each other s effect but the effect of profile curvature also varies with rainfall duration for a fixed plan shape the longest time to ponding occurs on the straight profile hillslope hillslopes with opposite values of the plan shape factor and curvature have similar infiltration and runoff processes because of the similar slope gradient distributions the widely used time compression approximation tca for rainfall infiltration prediction after ponding can lead to an error of more than 37 when applied to hillslopes with a curved profile and variable width this is because of the inaccurate estimation of the ponding time especially for low intensity rainfalls suggesting the presence of partial area runoff on these hillslopes in addition the results show that the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface is generally negligible and the run on effect causes more infiltration on convex hillslope topography the soil property and rainfall temporal variability do not change the trends but can alter the magnitudes of the hillslope geometry effect the study provides insights into the rainfall runoff processes on natural hillslopes that could benefit studies related to hillslope hydrology and geomorphology keywords hillslope geometry rainfall infiltration runoff ponding time time compression approximation run on effect 1 introduction topography is an essential factor in natural hillslopes which influences the mass flux and energy balance both in local and large scales e g lu and godt 2013 rasmussen et al 2015 fan et al 2019 topography alone can alter the infiltration and runoff under rainfall conditions by changing the initial soil moisture environment affecting effective rainfall falling on the slope and modifying the soil water movement beneath the surface these processes are related to many environmental problems initiated by rainfall such as flash flood soil erosion stefano et al 2000 and landslides talebi et al 2008 and are crucial in the development of hillslope hydrological models e g hallema et al 2013 hallema and moussa 2014 and earth system models fan et al 2019 recent studies related to the effect of hillslope topography on hortonian rainfall infiltration and runoff processes have mainly focused on simple planar slopes either of infinite or semi infinite lengths e g philip 1991a chen and young 2006 wu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 or of limited scales e g essig et al 2009 morbidelli et al 2015 these studies provide insights into the slope effect on hydrology for example the increase of slope gradient usually decreases runoff chen and young 2006 and the slope angle effect usually cannot be ignored when compared to the effects of rainfall and antecedent soil moisture in rainfall runoff processes wang 2018 nevertheless a few studies have made attempts to investigate the impact of complex hillslope geometry philip 1991b concluded that surface convexity decreases infiltrability and surface concavity increases infiltrability within a certain range thompson et al 2010 also found that concave hillslopes increase infiltration when compared to straight ones in addition for convergent and divergent planar hillslopes philip 1991c found that convergent hillslopes increase and divergent hillslopes reduce infiltration when compared to parallel i e rectangular ones although these studies add to our knowledge of the hillslope topographic effect on hortonian infiltration and runoff the extent and mechanisms of the effect still remain unclear in addition to the physical effect of topography the applicability of common modeling approaches for rainfall runoff analysis also needs further evaluation which is related to hydrological model development and assessment the widely used time compression approximation tca is of particular interest tca is a simple and straightforward approach for predicting the rainfall infiltration after surface ponding mein and larson 1973 assouline et al 2007 it assumes that the infiltration rate after ponding is a unique function of the cumulative infiltration regardless of the previous rainfall history assouline et al 2007 assouline 2013 which can be obtained by a parallel shift of the infiltrability curve wang et al 2018 this method early introduced in 1940s sherman 1943 holtan 1945 has been validated for homogenous and layered soils smith 1990 as well as constant and nonuniform rainfalls assouline et al 2007 although applicable for many conditions this method has not been validated other than planar slopes on a hillslope with more complex geometry the slope gradient varies in space and so does the ponding time during rainfall infiltration chen and young 2006 applying tca to the entire hillslope as a whole may therefore lead to errors the issue can be exacerbated for large scale hydrologic modeling practice in which large size grid cells can involve complex subgrid topography that is treated homogeneously at the grid scale a quantitative understanding of the tca applicability for complex topography is therefore needed topography may affect other important aspects of infiltration and runoff on hillslopes such as the run on effect i e upstream runoff enhancing downstream infiltration and downslope subsurface lateral flow near surface the run on effect can modulate the infiltration and runoff processes on hillslopes sometime rather dramatically and has been examined in many previous studies e g smith and hebbert 1979 chen et al 2016 particularly for surfaces with heterogeneous hydraulic properties the topographically heterogeneous surfaces however have not been analyzed for this effect the subsurface lateral flow near surface due to the downslope hydraulic gradient which may occur in both saturated and unsaturated conditions has been discussed in several studies e g philip 1991a jackson 1992 lu et al 2011 lv et al 2013 the fundamental cause for the lateral flow has been attributed to the change of pressure head with time wang 2018 found less effect of this flow on infiltration and runoff through comparing one dimensional and two dimensional variably saturated flow numerical solutions of richards equation for rainfall infiltration on straight hillslopes however when it comes to complex hillslope topography the gradient of pressure head may further vary spatially which could affect infiltration and runoff in such a condition the effect of lateral flow near surface needs to be further validated many previous works examined the complex topography hillslope effects on subsurface runoff using the hillslope storage boussinesq model e g troch et al 2003 aryal et al 2005 berne et al 2005 in these studies complex geometry hillslopes can be depicted by three geometric factors longitudinal profile planform shape and cross section form i e lateral profile through these geometric factors the effect of gravity on subsurface flow and its role in the process of runoff formation can be analyzed in detail the longitudinal profile and cross section are usually expressed by three types of curvature convex straight and concave while the planform shape is represented using three types of plan shape convergent parallel and divergent see troch et al 2002 in previous studies curvature functions including power e g carson and kirkby 1972 evans 1980 ridolfi et al 2003 sabzevari and noroozpour 2014 arctan aryal et al 2005 circular philip 1991b agnese et al 2007 and sine thompson et al 2010 were adopted while for the plan shape symmetrical parabola function evans 1980 trapezoid agnese et al 2007 and sector philip 1991c were used accordingly the geometry of three dimensional hillslopes can be produced by the superposition of functions that describe profiles and plan shape e g evans 1980 agnese et al 2007 these existing works lay the foundation for quantitative analyses of the impact of complex topography on hillslope hydrology and will be applied in this study in view of the knowledge gaps we still have i e the mechanisms and extent of the hillslope topographic effect tca applicability and the processes of run on and subsurface lateral flow on complex hillslope and the approaches we can use the quantification of complex geometry hillslope this study intended to address two main issues related to the role of hillslope geometry in rainfall runoff processes one is the impact of hillslope profile curvature and plan shape on rainfall infiltration and runoff and their combined effects the other is the applicability of tca and the corresponding errors of infiltration and runoff when applied for complex topography hillslopes in addition the effects of run on lateral flow soil property and rainfall temporal variability were also discussed theses analyses were expected to disclose the behavior and the extent of the effect of complex hillslope topography on infiltration and hortonian runoff processes and contribute hillslope process modeling 2 methodology 2 1 hillslope geometry similar to agnese et al 2007 hillslope geometry in this study was approximated by a combination of profile curvature concave straight convex and plan shape convergent parallel and divergent fig 1 these conceptualizations of three dimensional hillslope topography have also been adopted in several other studies for hillslope hydrology hilberts et al 2004 agnese et al 2007 sabzevari et al 2013 the curvature of cross section was ignored for the purpose of simplicity a circular arc was used to describe the profile curvature and an isosceles trapezoid to describe the plan shape this approach allows an easy quantification of both profile curvature and plan shape and can be used to quickly generate different hillslopes of typical geometry based on the parameter values the curvature denoted as σ of the circle is given as follows 1 σ 1 r where r is the radius m of the circle describing the longitudinal profile of the hillslope to distinguish concave and convex hillslopes from profile curvature it is assumed artificially that the plus sign in eq 1 represents concave slopes and minus corresponds to convex slopes a straight hillslope has a zero σ value the following equation was used to quantify the plan shape factor denoted as μ depicting the planform geometry 2 μ l max l min 2 h where l max l min are respectively the width m of long and short sides for two parallel parts of isosceles trapezoid shown in fig 1b and h is the height m of the isosceles trapezoid a positive sign in eq 2 is defined for convergent hillslope while negative for divergent hillslope a zero value of μ describes a parallel hillslope the two indicators σ and μ are therefore the critical parameters defining the hillslope geometry in this study 2 2 simulation design to reduce the computational demand and minimize the boundary effects in numerical computing the simulation domain was designed to be 6 m in depth i e soil thickness and 50 m in horizontal projective length fig 1a the minimum width was set to 6 m while the maximum width was determined by the plan shape factor μ the average profile slope gradient determined by the vertical and horizontal distances of the highest and lowest surface points along the longitudinal profile was set to 30 degrees for all slopes the profile then can be determined by the specified curvature σ the boundary condition at the upper boundary of the modeling domain was the spatially uniform rainfall while a free drainage boundary was used at the lower boundary the remaining boundaries were considered as no flux boundaries 2 3 modeling approach the modeling domain was assumed to be homogenous and isotropic soil water movement in the domain induced by rainfall infiltration can be described by the following three dimensional richards equation for variably saturated flow richards 1931 in cartesian coordinate system 3 θ t i 1 3 x i k ψ ψ x i k ψ x 3 where θ is volumetric water content t is time h ψ is soil water pressure head mm related to θ k ψ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function with ks representing the corresponding saturated value xi i 1 2 3 is the spatial coordinate with x 3 always being assumed vertical and positive upward the rainfall input and soil moisture conditions in the solution of this equation at the soil atmospheric boundary will regulate the infiltration flux and thus can reflect the effect of hillslope topography on infiltration and runoff equation 3 is a highly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation assouline 2013 to implement the numerical solution the van genuchten mualem vgm soil hydraulic property functions for unsaturated volumetric soil water content θ and soil hydraulic conductivity k versus pressure ψ van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 were applied which can be written in the following form 4 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ 1 1 m m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 5 k θ k s θ θ r θ s θ r l 1 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 m m 2 in which θr θs are respectively the residual and saturated volumetric soil water contents α and m are empirical parameters l is pore connectivity parameter which is set to be 0 5 as an average for most soils and ks is the k value for saturated condition once the boundary and initial conditions are given eq 3 can be solved by numerical solvers to simulate water movement in the variably saturated media the well tested software hydrus 2d 3d developed by šimůnek et al 2011 was applied in this study which has been widely used in hydrological studies e g chen and young 2006 hallema et al 2014 variably saturated subsurface flow due to rainfall infiltration was simulated by hydrus 2d 3d and surface runoff was produced when the rainfall intensity exceeds the soil infiltrability a loam soil was selected for this study with its soil water hydraulic functions shown in fig 2 loam is the most widely distributed soil texture in the world see e g https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas soils and thus considered representative in general the related parameters for eq 4 and 5 can be referred to vogel et al 2000 i e θr 0 078 θs 0 43 α 0 0036 mm 1 m 0 359 ks 10 4 mm h two additional soils with 0 5 ks and 1 5 ks respectively were used to examine the effect of soil hydraulic properties a steady and spatially uniform rainfall with a 90 mm total depth and 20 mm hr intensity was applied for all slopes in the analysis of tca the rainfall intensity was adjusted to 30 mm hr with the same total depth two spatially uniform but unsteady rainfalls were used to study the effect of rainfall temporal variability these two unsteady rainfalls are 1 a 6 5 hour rainfall with first 2 h and last 2 5 h rainfall intensity being equal to 20 mm h while no rainfall occurred in the middle 2 h intermittent rainfall 2 a 3 5 hour rainfall with intensity equal to 20 mm h in the first 1 5 h followed by 30 mm h for the next 2 h continuous rainfall a 3 hour ponded infiltration i e saturated soil surface as the initial condition which can be regarded as under the rainfall with infinite intensity was also considered for comparison the initial volumetric soil water content was set to 0 2 uniformly in the entire soil domain to exclude the effect of heterogeneous initial soil water content a series of hillslopes were generated using the following values for the curvature σ and plan shape factor μ σ 1 73 10 2 1 34 10 2 9 12 10 3 6 89 10 3 and 0 m 1 μ 0 466 0 364 0 268 0 176 0 088 and 0 corresponding to the angle of convergence varying from 25 degrees to 25 degrees with a 5 degree increment as a result 99 hillslopes were generated with 9 profile curvature values and 11 plan shape factor values the modeling domain for each hillslope was then established and a computational mesh was generated within hydrus 2d 3d the hillslope geometric space was discretized using a 3d triangular prism mesh with triangular grids parallel to the surface and rectangular grids in the vertical direction in particular the vertical grid is denser near the surface and coarser in deeper portions both grids parallel to the surface and in the vertical direction were adequately refined to eliminate the grid size effect 3 results 3 1 the effect of profile curvature ponded infiltration attributes spatially averaged for the whole hillslope surface same below including cumulative infiltration infiltration rate at t 3 h and infiltrability curves were generated using a fixed plan shape factor μ 0 i e parallel hillslope these results are shown in figs 3 a c the shape of longitudinal profile has a nonmonotonic effect on ponded infiltration across the entire ponded infiltration periods fig 3c similar attributes can be found for fixed curvatures with opposite signs e g σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 the infiltrability curves for the two opposite curvatures basically overlap when compared to the straight profile i e σ 0 m 1 case less than 3 relative error is detected for the cumulative infiltration in this condition the effect of profile curvature is negligible steady rainfall infiltration runoff processes were also examined using the same hillslope geometry as that for ponded infiltration results of runoff ponding time and infiltration rate are shown in figs 4 a e similar to the ponded infiltration these quantities vary nonmonotonically with the topographic indices but the trends for runoff and ponding time are opposite to that of the cumulative infiltration the longest time to ponding occurs on the straight profile slope a relative variation of up to 20 can appear when the profile is more concave or convex however this straight profile results in the smallest infiltration rate despite the largest time to ponding and generates the largest runoff which is about 5 more than that for the most concave i e σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 profile in addition opposite curvatures e g σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 result in almost identical infiltration for parallel slopes fig 4d the infiltration rate for smaller curvatures is higher than that for larger curvatures at early times after ponding but lower at late times this is different from the approximately parallel infiltrability curves fig 3c under initially ponded conditions maximum runoff can therefore happen on slopes of any longitudinal profile depending on the rainfall duration 3 2 the effect of plan shape ponded infiltration was examined by fixing the convex profile curvature i e σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 and the results are shown in fig 5 a nonlinear monotonic trend is found between the cumulative infiltration or infiltrability and the plan shape this trend preserves for all time during the ponded infiltration period fig 5c compared with the parallel hillslope i e μ 0 the maximum difference of cumulative infiltration can be as high as 6 for both convergent and divergent hillslopes with the same negative curvatures circles in fig 5a steady rainfall infiltration was also investigated using the same convex profile curvature as used in ponded infiltration the results are shown in fig 6 a nonlinear monotonic trend due to the slope effect also exists between the cumulative infiltration or infiltration rate and the plan shape for steady rainfall infiltration the trend of runoff is contrast to that of ponding time figs 6a and b the rainfall duration seems to play a less important role than the plan shape in infiltration and runoff processes fig 6d the maximum difference introduced by the plan shape factor is about 8 for runoff and 5 for ponding time compared to the parallel hillslope figs 6a and b circles 3 3 the compound effect of profile curvature and plan shape the results shown in sections 3 1 and 3 2 reveal the effects of profile curvature and plan shape separately complex hillslopes involve the coupling of the two effects which can be investigated by examining the results for all simulated slopes the nonmonotonic effect of profile curvature for parallel topography also exists in convergent or divergent hillslopes for both ponded infiltration and steady rainfall infiltration figs 3 and 4 the effect becomes more complicated with the increase of the plan shape convergence or divergence the most obvious characteristic is that the location for maximum runoff varies with the plan shape factor as a result two hillslopes with opposite curvatures can lead to different processes of infiltration and runoff for nonparallel plan shape however the longest time to ponding occurs on straight profile slopes independent of the plan shape fig 4 the ranges of runoff cumulative infiltration and ponding time all increase with more convergent or divergent plan shape indicating larger variations for these variables on complex hillslopes in our cases the maximum cumulative infiltration is about 9 higher than that for straight longitudinal profile under rainfall conditions while the differences for runoff and ponding time are about 12 and 21 7 respectively it suggests that the effect of profile curvature cannot be ignored especially for rainfall infiltration further comparison between rainfall infiltration curves for different plan shapes reveals that rainfall duration plays a less important role in the relations of infiltration and runoff to profile curvature when the plan shape is not parallel figs 4d and e contrast effects of plan shape are found for opposite curvatures figs 5 and 6 infiltration and runoff remain almost invariant for a straight profile i e σ 0 for a concave or convex profile the effect of plan shape becomes more complicated the ranges of infiltration and runoff increase while the effect on ponding time is indistinct figs 5a 6a and b the maximum variations of these variables are presented in section 3 2 a similar pattern is found for runoff as well as runoff rate varying with curvature figs 4a and c which is affected by the plan shape factor figs 6a and c this suggests that the longitudinal curvature plays a more important role than the plan shape in controlling hillslope infiltration and runoff this also can be inferred from the maximum variations of infiltration and runoff due to plan shapes and profile curvatures similar changes in infiltration and runoff attributes are found for topography characterized by opposite profile curvatures and plan shape factors see figs 3 4 or figs 5 6 4 discussion 4 1 effect of hillslope topography as mentioned above two hillslopes with opposite curvatures and opposite plan shapes have similar effect on infiltration and runoff processes in view of topographic features of these slopes it was hypothesized that the overall slope effect is the ensemble of local slope effect and the slope gradient statistical distribution is a dominant factor determining the effect at the hillslope scale to test this hypothesis the slope gradients for the different hillslope surfaces were extracted and their cumulative distributions are shown in fig 7 the results show that different hillslopes with opposite curvatures and opposite plan shape factors have similar slope gradient distributions meanwhile similar infiltration and runoff results are found for these slopes the results for 30 degrees straight hillslopes show similar infiltration and runoff processes for different plan shape factors in which only a single value of slope gradient appears for longitudinal convex or concave slopes with the same average slope gradient an analysis of the cumulative distributions of slope gradient provides the clue for understanding the patterns of infiltration and runoff as shown in fig 7 with the same profile curvature but different plan shape factors e g σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 μ 0 466 slopes have the same range and mean value of slope gradient but different proportions of low and high gradients which respectively control the ponding time and cumulative infiltration compared to the parallel plan shape any positive change in the plan shape factor reduces the fraction of low slope gradients while increases that of high slope gradients for the same concave profile it therefore increases the ponding time cumulative infiltration and reduces runoff which are shown in figs 5a 6a and b opposite results were obtained for the negative change in the plan shape factor therefore a monotonic effect of plan shape on infiltration and runoff can be expected given the same plan shape factor but opposite curvatures e g σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 μ 0 466 both the range and mean value of the slope gradient are same but the fractions of high and low slope gradients can be fairly different this will result in different ponding times cumulative infiltration and runoff figs 3a 4a and b fixing the mean slope and decreasing the absolute value of curvature the range of slope gradient narrows this will result in an increase in the ponding time due to the increase of slope gradient in the milder portion of the slope which in turn increase the cumulative infiltration and decrease the runoff however the slope gradient also decreases in steeper portion of the slope in the meantime it will decrease cumulative infiltration and increases runoff the combined result of high and low slope gradient components makes the effect of profile curvature nonmonotonic figs 4a and c clearly show such trends in cumulative runoff and runoff rate specifically maximum runoff usually occurs on non straight than on straight hillslopes except parallel plan shapes the spatially varying slope gradient on longitudinally non straight hillslopes results in a smaller ponding time compared to straight hillslopes agreeing with the results in figs 4b and 6b since the overall infiltrability of a hillslope is more affected by high gradient portions of the slope the predicted ponding time based on tca tends to be larger than the actual value this suggests that high slope gradient areas may remain unsaturated when rainfall saturates the surface of low gradient areas i e the appearance of partial area infiltration excess runoff on such slopes for a given rainfall shorter ponding time signals less infiltration and more runoff since high slope gradient areas can increase infiltration and reduce runoff while the low gradient areas function oppositely the effect of a convex or concave profile with high and low gradients are twofold the overall effect will depend on both the longitudinal profile and the plan shape which collectively determine the dominance of high versus low gradient portions of the slope in the infiltration and runoff processes fig 4a 4 2 the applicability for tca to quantify the effects of complex shape of hillslopes on applying tca to the entire hillslope as one unit a series of cases were analyzed including all curvatures and several plan shape factors μ 0 466 0 176 and 0 discussed previously some representative results are shown in fig 8 in which the relationships of infiltration rate versus cumulative infiltration are compared under the conditions of ponded infiltration and rainfall infiltration with different rainfall intensities for ponded infiltration this relationship is the infiltrability curve the results show that these curves do not collapse into one figs 8a b d except for the straight parallel hillslope with an identical slope gradient fig 8c see h 5 in fig 1 the deviations are more prominent for lower rainfall intensity figs 8a d indicating that the hillslope topography can affect the accuracy of tca the larger differences between the results in figs 8a and c compared to that in figs 8a and b suggests that profile curvature affects tca more than does plan shape the results for concave convergent hillslope show that the infiltration rate after ponding given by tca is overestimated particularly for lower intensity rainfalls fig 8e consequently it will cause an underestimation of runoff this is also valid for other hillslopes with concave or convex profiles comparing the cumulative infiltration under a 20 mm h rainfall with that under ponded infiltration the relative differences at ponding time before which infiltration rate equals the rainfall rate for hillslopes h 2 h 1 h 5 h 3 see fig 1 with given curvature and plan shape factor figs 8a d are 29 8 36 9 0 and 18 0 respectively this result for hillslope h 4 σ 0 m 1 μ 0 466 not shown in fig 8 is the same as h5 0 difference this suggests that as high as 37 error could be introduced by tca when applied to nonstraight hillslopes it indicates that although tca can be an effective approach for simulating infiltration under rainfalls at the point scale or for a homogeneous land surface unit it may cause substantial error on complex hillslopes the result suggests that the nonlinear rainfall infiltration process over a heterogeneous surface cannot be represented by a simple spatial average which causes the inaccuracy of tca at the hillslope scale nevertheless these differences in cumulative infiltration will decrease with time and rainfall intensity the error may be neglected for prolonged rainfall durations or very high rainfall intensities 4 3 the occurrence of near surface lateral flow for hillslopes with isotropic and homogenous soil the subsurface lateral flow near surface is strongest when rainfall commences and reduces to zero over time during a steady rainfall the pressure head gradient is certainly the physical drive for such a flow lu et al 2011 lv et al 2013 when the surface soil reaches saturation i e ponding the soil moisture content near surface tends to be maximized and remains invariant thus the lateral pressure gradient as well as the subsurface lateral flow near surface tend to vanish therefore the time to ponding may be a good indicator for such a flow to examine whether the occurrence of this flow can alter infiltration on more complex hillslope topography a relatively easy approach was adopted by using the ponding time since it requires some efforts to extract the time to ponding for a designated location from the modeling results a series of random nodes on the concave convergent hillslope instead of the entire surface were selected for the study which are depicted in fig 9 a the hillslope topography used for this test has the largest range of slope angle which was expected to produce the strongest lateral flow among all considered hillslope topography the time to ponding at each node was determined for the three dimensional 3d domain and compared with that calculated by one dimensional 1d condition šimůnek et al 2008 with the same local slope gradient and vertical mesh discretization the results indicate that ponding time increases with increasing slope angle as shown in previous studies e g wang et al 2018 further validating the presence of partial area infiltration excess runoff the comparison is shown in fig 9b it demonstrates that the data points are close to the 1 1 line meaning that the 3d modeling results with the lateral flow and the 1d results without the lateral flow are very close this suggests that the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface before ponding on the entire hillslope can be ignored since the dominant subsurface flow direction is normal to the slope as a result this effect on rainfall infiltration and runoff is negligible suggesting a practical treatment to calculate rainfall infiltration using 1d richards equation for variably saturated flow more detailed comparison of 3d versus 1d modeling results of infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration is shown in section 2 1 of supplemental information which echoes that this effect on infiltration can be ignored and the infiltration on complex hillslope can be effectively calculated using 1d infiltration models for practical purposes 4 4 the run on effect the above investigations excluded the run on effect which is worth further discussion run on affects infiltration and runoff more notably on hydraulically heterogeneous surfaces and is the major mechanism for the scale effect in hortonian rainfall runoff processes chen et al 2013 2016 our results indicate that different slope gradients correspond to different infiltration rates and ponding times this implies that run on may occur more easily on complex hillslopes consisting of varying slope gradients without a module of overland flow movement the hydrus 2d 3d model is unable to treat run on directly in order to investigate this effect a relatively simple method was used by coupling a kinematic wave model wu et al 2017 and smith infiltration model smith 1972 detail can be seen in the supplement information s1 because the depth of overland flow is usually small and has minor effect on infiltration the numerical experiments only took into account the run on effect on downstream location infiltration before ponding occurs whereas after ponding the run on effect on infiltration through added flow depth was deemed negligible several selected hillslopes were tested and the results are shown in fig 10 as expected run on has little effect on infiltration for concave hillslopes because higher slope gradient areas upstream do not generate runoff earlier than the lower gradient areas downstream and thus do not enhance infiltration downstream figs 10a c little effect appears for run on on infiltration along the slope surface where runoff initiates earlier at downstream similarly uniform slope gradients on the straight profile hillslope lead to equal runoff initiation time along the slope so that run on shows negligible effect on infiltration and runoff contrast to that on concave and straight hillslopes the infiltrations on convex hillslopes are relatively more affected by the run on effect figs 10d and e especially for the convex convergent hillslope fig 10d in this case while the cumulative infiltration is not affected by run on an error close to 4 can be introduced into the infiltration rate when the entire hillslope surface is ponded such an error will tend to diminish towards the end of the rainfall this also applies to the infiltration rate and the maximum error is over 16 before ponding on the entire hillslope the effect may be more significant for smaller rainfalls note that divergent slopes allow more time for runoff infiltrating when compared to convergent slopes because of the smaller flow velocity resulted from the larger downstream width figs 10d and e for the same reason the maximum infiltration rate on a divergent slope is less than that on a convergent hillslope given the same profile curvature thereby the difference between with and without the run on effect is smaller the error for the estimation of infiltration rate using tca is enlarged for convex hillslopes considering the run on effect especially before ponding on the entire hillslope however since run on causes more infiltration the error for cumulative infiltration estimation can be reduced as tca tends to underestimate the cumulative infiltration on convex slopes without run on see fig 8 in addition it is worth noting that the run on effect can be more significant during the hiatus of intermittent rainfall during which infiltration is entirely maintained by run on chen et al 2016 such effect on non straight and non parallel slopes can be examined in more depth in future studies 4 5 the effects of soil hydraulic conductivity and rainfall temporal variability the curvature and plan shape factors with the maximum effect on ponding time and runoff i e σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 and μ 0 466 were selected in this investigation the resulting effects on ponding time and cumulative runoff under different saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks and two patterns of unsteady rainfall un1 intermittent rainfall un2 continuous rainfall are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively as expected the ponding time increases with increasing ks figs 11a and c while the cumulative runoff increases when ks decreases figs 11b and d a second ponding occurs under un1 figs 12a and b but does not occur under un2 while the first ponding times for the two rainfalls are the same as those for the steady rainfall shown in figs 4b and 6b respectively the reason causing the second ponding is the unsaturated soil surface due to the soil moisture redistribution during the hiatus of un1 changes in soil hydraulic conductivity or the rainfall process have minor impact on the trends of infiltration and runoff fig 11 the maximum ponding time still occurs on the straight profile hillslope when the plan shape of hillslope is fixed figs 11c and 12b soil hydraulic properties and rainfall process slightly affect the magnitude of ponding time and runoff while preserving their patterns of variation for a more permeable soil 1 5ks tested in this study changing the plan shape from parallel μ 0 to divergent μ less than 0 or convergent μ 0 alters the ponding time by up to 1 divergent or 6 convergent and the cumulative runoff by up to 12 divergent or 13 convergent figs 11a and b changing the profile from straight σ 0 to convex σ 0 or concave σ 0 alters the ponding time by up to 21 convex or 14 concave and the cumulative runoff by up to 3 convex or 20 concave figs 11c and d similar or smaller values of these changes were obtained for a less permeable soil 0 5ks under the given intermittent rainfall un1 the impact of plan shape on the second ponding time is less than 0 05 with a two hour hiatus fig 12a whereas the effect of curvature is no more than 1 fig 12b it is expected that these effects could be enlarged for a longer period of rainfall hiatus in that the soil moisture redistribution can play a more important role an increase of the plan shape factor from 0 466 to 0 466 under unsteady rainfalls can reduce the cumulative runoff by up to 16 un1 and 10 un2 while an increase in slope curvature from 0 0173 to 0 0173 m 1 reduces the runoff by up to 16 un1 and 10 un2 these results show that the effects of plan shape and curvature are altered similarly under unsteady rainfalls which can be attributed to the similar slope gradient distributions fig 7 nevertheless the variations of soil hydraulic properties and rainfall distribution can be much more complex in real conditions and the above discussion only provides a primary understanding in these aspects 5 summary and conclusion this study investigated the effect of hillslope topography on rainfall infiltration runoff processes through analyzing a variety of different types of topography characterized by two factors i e longitudinal profile curvature and plan shape which allow us to quantify the role of these topographic factors separately as well as their compound effect in the infiltration and runoff processes the applicability of tca the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface the run on effect and the effects of soil hydraulic conductivity and unsteady rainfall were also examined the results of both ponded infiltration and steady rainfall infiltration show that hillslope geometry affects infiltration and runoff the effect of profile curvature is nonmonotonic subject to change of rainfall duration while the effect of plan shape is monotonic and is less affected by rainfall duration the interaction of these two factors can complicate the result convex and concave profile curvatures will result in opposite effects of plan shape for a fixed plan shape up to 12 and 21 7 respective changes in runoff and ponding time can occur by changing the profile curvature and the longest ponding time corresponds to the straight hillslope for a fixed profile curvature about 8 changes for runoff and 5 for ponding time can appear by changing the plan shape accordingly the profile curvature plays a more important role than the plan shape the distribution of slope gradient shows a more fundamental control to the effect of topography two hillslopes with both opposite curvatures and opposite plan shape factors have similar infiltration and runoff characteristics due to the similar distributions of slope gradient the commonly used tca for predicting infiltration after ponding was investigated in complex hillslope topographies the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface and run on effect were also assessed for hillslope with a convex or concave profile a large error of infiltration up to 37 could be introduced because of the overestimation of ponding time especially for low rainfall intensity ponding occurs at different times on such hillslopes suggesting the presence of partial area runoff the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface can be ignored suggesting that a possible simplification in calculating infiltration on complex hillslopes using one dimensional equations the run on effect was investigated by coupling the kinematic wave model for runoff with a simplified infiltration model it is found that convex especially convex convergent hillslopes are affected more than straight or concave hillslopes an error close to 4 can be introduced in to the cumulative infiltration when ignoring the run on effect this may be more significant for lower intensity rainfalls however the applicability of tca could be increased after ponding occurring on the whole slope which can be further tested in future studies by refining the coupled infiltration and runoff modeling approach the effect of hillslope geometry on infiltration and runoff can vary with soil hydraulic properties and rainfall temporal distribution however the general trends are essentially unaffected even though the magnitudes of the effects as functions of plan shape and profile curvature can be altered by soil hydraulic conductivity and unsteady rainfall repeated ponding can occur because of the soil moisture redistribution under intermittent rainfalls the effect of hillslope geometry on recurring ponding time is negligible when the rainfall hiatus is short while that on runoff is more significant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

4878,topography is one of the main factors in hillslope rainfall runoff processes the effect of hillslope geometry representing an important aspect of topography on hortonian rainfall runoff has not been fully understood in order to investigate this effect hillslope geometry was abstracted as the combination of longitudinal profile curvature and plan shape and a set of representative hillslope surfaces were generated using a variety of values of the profile curvature and plan shape factor the infiltration and hortonian runoff processes mainly characterized by ponding time infiltration rate and runoff rate and depth were computed using richards equation for variably saturated flow with given initial soil moisture rainfall and soil texture the results show that different profile curvature and plan shape can cause more than 10 difference in cumulative runoff and runoff rate and more than 20 difference in ponding time the curvature of hillslope longitudinal profile affects infiltration and runoff nonmonotonically and plays a more important role than the plan shape whose effect is monotonic the profile curvature and plan shape can complicate each other s effect but the effect of profile curvature also varies with rainfall duration for a fixed plan shape the longest time to ponding occurs on the straight profile hillslope hillslopes with opposite values of the plan shape factor and curvature have similar infiltration and runoff processes because of the similar slope gradient distributions the widely used time compression approximation tca for rainfall infiltration prediction after ponding can lead to an error of more than 37 when applied to hillslopes with a curved profile and variable width this is because of the inaccurate estimation of the ponding time especially for low intensity rainfalls suggesting the presence of partial area runoff on these hillslopes in addition the results show that the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface is generally negligible and the run on effect causes more infiltration on convex hillslope topography the soil property and rainfall temporal variability do not change the trends but can alter the magnitudes of the hillslope geometry effect the study provides insights into the rainfall runoff processes on natural hillslopes that could benefit studies related to hillslope hydrology and geomorphology keywords hillslope geometry rainfall infiltration runoff ponding time time compression approximation run on effect 1 introduction topography is an essential factor in natural hillslopes which influences the mass flux and energy balance both in local and large scales e g lu and godt 2013 rasmussen et al 2015 fan et al 2019 topography alone can alter the infiltration and runoff under rainfall conditions by changing the initial soil moisture environment affecting effective rainfall falling on the slope and modifying the soil water movement beneath the surface these processes are related to many environmental problems initiated by rainfall such as flash flood soil erosion stefano et al 2000 and landslides talebi et al 2008 and are crucial in the development of hillslope hydrological models e g hallema et al 2013 hallema and moussa 2014 and earth system models fan et al 2019 recent studies related to the effect of hillslope topography on hortonian rainfall infiltration and runoff processes have mainly focused on simple planar slopes either of infinite or semi infinite lengths e g philip 1991a chen and young 2006 wu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 or of limited scales e g essig et al 2009 morbidelli et al 2015 these studies provide insights into the slope effect on hydrology for example the increase of slope gradient usually decreases runoff chen and young 2006 and the slope angle effect usually cannot be ignored when compared to the effects of rainfall and antecedent soil moisture in rainfall runoff processes wang 2018 nevertheless a few studies have made attempts to investigate the impact of complex hillslope geometry philip 1991b concluded that surface convexity decreases infiltrability and surface concavity increases infiltrability within a certain range thompson et al 2010 also found that concave hillslopes increase infiltration when compared to straight ones in addition for convergent and divergent planar hillslopes philip 1991c found that convergent hillslopes increase and divergent hillslopes reduce infiltration when compared to parallel i e rectangular ones although these studies add to our knowledge of the hillslope topographic effect on hortonian infiltration and runoff the extent and mechanisms of the effect still remain unclear in addition to the physical effect of topography the applicability of common modeling approaches for rainfall runoff analysis also needs further evaluation which is related to hydrological model development and assessment the widely used time compression approximation tca is of particular interest tca is a simple and straightforward approach for predicting the rainfall infiltration after surface ponding mein and larson 1973 assouline et al 2007 it assumes that the infiltration rate after ponding is a unique function of the cumulative infiltration regardless of the previous rainfall history assouline et al 2007 assouline 2013 which can be obtained by a parallel shift of the infiltrability curve wang et al 2018 this method early introduced in 1940s sherman 1943 holtan 1945 has been validated for homogenous and layered soils smith 1990 as well as constant and nonuniform rainfalls assouline et al 2007 although applicable for many conditions this method has not been validated other than planar slopes on a hillslope with more complex geometry the slope gradient varies in space and so does the ponding time during rainfall infiltration chen and young 2006 applying tca to the entire hillslope as a whole may therefore lead to errors the issue can be exacerbated for large scale hydrologic modeling practice in which large size grid cells can involve complex subgrid topography that is treated homogeneously at the grid scale a quantitative understanding of the tca applicability for complex topography is therefore needed topography may affect other important aspects of infiltration and runoff on hillslopes such as the run on effect i e upstream runoff enhancing downstream infiltration and downslope subsurface lateral flow near surface the run on effect can modulate the infiltration and runoff processes on hillslopes sometime rather dramatically and has been examined in many previous studies e g smith and hebbert 1979 chen et al 2016 particularly for surfaces with heterogeneous hydraulic properties the topographically heterogeneous surfaces however have not been analyzed for this effect the subsurface lateral flow near surface due to the downslope hydraulic gradient which may occur in both saturated and unsaturated conditions has been discussed in several studies e g philip 1991a jackson 1992 lu et al 2011 lv et al 2013 the fundamental cause for the lateral flow has been attributed to the change of pressure head with time wang 2018 found less effect of this flow on infiltration and runoff through comparing one dimensional and two dimensional variably saturated flow numerical solutions of richards equation for rainfall infiltration on straight hillslopes however when it comes to complex hillslope topography the gradient of pressure head may further vary spatially which could affect infiltration and runoff in such a condition the effect of lateral flow near surface needs to be further validated many previous works examined the complex topography hillslope effects on subsurface runoff using the hillslope storage boussinesq model e g troch et al 2003 aryal et al 2005 berne et al 2005 in these studies complex geometry hillslopes can be depicted by three geometric factors longitudinal profile planform shape and cross section form i e lateral profile through these geometric factors the effect of gravity on subsurface flow and its role in the process of runoff formation can be analyzed in detail the longitudinal profile and cross section are usually expressed by three types of curvature convex straight and concave while the planform shape is represented using three types of plan shape convergent parallel and divergent see troch et al 2002 in previous studies curvature functions including power e g carson and kirkby 1972 evans 1980 ridolfi et al 2003 sabzevari and noroozpour 2014 arctan aryal et al 2005 circular philip 1991b agnese et al 2007 and sine thompson et al 2010 were adopted while for the plan shape symmetrical parabola function evans 1980 trapezoid agnese et al 2007 and sector philip 1991c were used accordingly the geometry of three dimensional hillslopes can be produced by the superposition of functions that describe profiles and plan shape e g evans 1980 agnese et al 2007 these existing works lay the foundation for quantitative analyses of the impact of complex topography on hillslope hydrology and will be applied in this study in view of the knowledge gaps we still have i e the mechanisms and extent of the hillslope topographic effect tca applicability and the processes of run on and subsurface lateral flow on complex hillslope and the approaches we can use the quantification of complex geometry hillslope this study intended to address two main issues related to the role of hillslope geometry in rainfall runoff processes one is the impact of hillslope profile curvature and plan shape on rainfall infiltration and runoff and their combined effects the other is the applicability of tca and the corresponding errors of infiltration and runoff when applied for complex topography hillslopes in addition the effects of run on lateral flow soil property and rainfall temporal variability were also discussed theses analyses were expected to disclose the behavior and the extent of the effect of complex hillslope topography on infiltration and hortonian runoff processes and contribute hillslope process modeling 2 methodology 2 1 hillslope geometry similar to agnese et al 2007 hillslope geometry in this study was approximated by a combination of profile curvature concave straight convex and plan shape convergent parallel and divergent fig 1 these conceptualizations of three dimensional hillslope topography have also been adopted in several other studies for hillslope hydrology hilberts et al 2004 agnese et al 2007 sabzevari et al 2013 the curvature of cross section was ignored for the purpose of simplicity a circular arc was used to describe the profile curvature and an isosceles trapezoid to describe the plan shape this approach allows an easy quantification of both profile curvature and plan shape and can be used to quickly generate different hillslopes of typical geometry based on the parameter values the curvature denoted as σ of the circle is given as follows 1 σ 1 r where r is the radius m of the circle describing the longitudinal profile of the hillslope to distinguish concave and convex hillslopes from profile curvature it is assumed artificially that the plus sign in eq 1 represents concave slopes and minus corresponds to convex slopes a straight hillslope has a zero σ value the following equation was used to quantify the plan shape factor denoted as μ depicting the planform geometry 2 μ l max l min 2 h where l max l min are respectively the width m of long and short sides for two parallel parts of isosceles trapezoid shown in fig 1b and h is the height m of the isosceles trapezoid a positive sign in eq 2 is defined for convergent hillslope while negative for divergent hillslope a zero value of μ describes a parallel hillslope the two indicators σ and μ are therefore the critical parameters defining the hillslope geometry in this study 2 2 simulation design to reduce the computational demand and minimize the boundary effects in numerical computing the simulation domain was designed to be 6 m in depth i e soil thickness and 50 m in horizontal projective length fig 1a the minimum width was set to 6 m while the maximum width was determined by the plan shape factor μ the average profile slope gradient determined by the vertical and horizontal distances of the highest and lowest surface points along the longitudinal profile was set to 30 degrees for all slopes the profile then can be determined by the specified curvature σ the boundary condition at the upper boundary of the modeling domain was the spatially uniform rainfall while a free drainage boundary was used at the lower boundary the remaining boundaries were considered as no flux boundaries 2 3 modeling approach the modeling domain was assumed to be homogenous and isotropic soil water movement in the domain induced by rainfall infiltration can be described by the following three dimensional richards equation for variably saturated flow richards 1931 in cartesian coordinate system 3 θ t i 1 3 x i k ψ ψ x i k ψ x 3 where θ is volumetric water content t is time h ψ is soil water pressure head mm related to θ k ψ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function with ks representing the corresponding saturated value xi i 1 2 3 is the spatial coordinate with x 3 always being assumed vertical and positive upward the rainfall input and soil moisture conditions in the solution of this equation at the soil atmospheric boundary will regulate the infiltration flux and thus can reflect the effect of hillslope topography on infiltration and runoff equation 3 is a highly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation assouline 2013 to implement the numerical solution the van genuchten mualem vgm soil hydraulic property functions for unsaturated volumetric soil water content θ and soil hydraulic conductivity k versus pressure ψ van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 were applied which can be written in the following form 4 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ 1 1 m m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 5 k θ k s θ θ r θ s θ r l 1 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 m m 2 in which θr θs are respectively the residual and saturated volumetric soil water contents α and m are empirical parameters l is pore connectivity parameter which is set to be 0 5 as an average for most soils and ks is the k value for saturated condition once the boundary and initial conditions are given eq 3 can be solved by numerical solvers to simulate water movement in the variably saturated media the well tested software hydrus 2d 3d developed by šimůnek et al 2011 was applied in this study which has been widely used in hydrological studies e g chen and young 2006 hallema et al 2014 variably saturated subsurface flow due to rainfall infiltration was simulated by hydrus 2d 3d and surface runoff was produced when the rainfall intensity exceeds the soil infiltrability a loam soil was selected for this study with its soil water hydraulic functions shown in fig 2 loam is the most widely distributed soil texture in the world see e g https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas soils and thus considered representative in general the related parameters for eq 4 and 5 can be referred to vogel et al 2000 i e θr 0 078 θs 0 43 α 0 0036 mm 1 m 0 359 ks 10 4 mm h two additional soils with 0 5 ks and 1 5 ks respectively were used to examine the effect of soil hydraulic properties a steady and spatially uniform rainfall with a 90 mm total depth and 20 mm hr intensity was applied for all slopes in the analysis of tca the rainfall intensity was adjusted to 30 mm hr with the same total depth two spatially uniform but unsteady rainfalls were used to study the effect of rainfall temporal variability these two unsteady rainfalls are 1 a 6 5 hour rainfall with first 2 h and last 2 5 h rainfall intensity being equal to 20 mm h while no rainfall occurred in the middle 2 h intermittent rainfall 2 a 3 5 hour rainfall with intensity equal to 20 mm h in the first 1 5 h followed by 30 mm h for the next 2 h continuous rainfall a 3 hour ponded infiltration i e saturated soil surface as the initial condition which can be regarded as under the rainfall with infinite intensity was also considered for comparison the initial volumetric soil water content was set to 0 2 uniformly in the entire soil domain to exclude the effect of heterogeneous initial soil water content a series of hillslopes were generated using the following values for the curvature σ and plan shape factor μ σ 1 73 10 2 1 34 10 2 9 12 10 3 6 89 10 3 and 0 m 1 μ 0 466 0 364 0 268 0 176 0 088 and 0 corresponding to the angle of convergence varying from 25 degrees to 25 degrees with a 5 degree increment as a result 99 hillslopes were generated with 9 profile curvature values and 11 plan shape factor values the modeling domain for each hillslope was then established and a computational mesh was generated within hydrus 2d 3d the hillslope geometric space was discretized using a 3d triangular prism mesh with triangular grids parallel to the surface and rectangular grids in the vertical direction in particular the vertical grid is denser near the surface and coarser in deeper portions both grids parallel to the surface and in the vertical direction were adequately refined to eliminate the grid size effect 3 results 3 1 the effect of profile curvature ponded infiltration attributes spatially averaged for the whole hillslope surface same below including cumulative infiltration infiltration rate at t 3 h and infiltrability curves were generated using a fixed plan shape factor μ 0 i e parallel hillslope these results are shown in figs 3 a c the shape of longitudinal profile has a nonmonotonic effect on ponded infiltration across the entire ponded infiltration periods fig 3c similar attributes can be found for fixed curvatures with opposite signs e g σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 the infiltrability curves for the two opposite curvatures basically overlap when compared to the straight profile i e σ 0 m 1 case less than 3 relative error is detected for the cumulative infiltration in this condition the effect of profile curvature is negligible steady rainfall infiltration runoff processes were also examined using the same hillslope geometry as that for ponded infiltration results of runoff ponding time and infiltration rate are shown in figs 4 a e similar to the ponded infiltration these quantities vary nonmonotonically with the topographic indices but the trends for runoff and ponding time are opposite to that of the cumulative infiltration the longest time to ponding occurs on the straight profile slope a relative variation of up to 20 can appear when the profile is more concave or convex however this straight profile results in the smallest infiltration rate despite the largest time to ponding and generates the largest runoff which is about 5 more than that for the most concave i e σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 profile in addition opposite curvatures e g σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 result in almost identical infiltration for parallel slopes fig 4d the infiltration rate for smaller curvatures is higher than that for larger curvatures at early times after ponding but lower at late times this is different from the approximately parallel infiltrability curves fig 3c under initially ponded conditions maximum runoff can therefore happen on slopes of any longitudinal profile depending on the rainfall duration 3 2 the effect of plan shape ponded infiltration was examined by fixing the convex profile curvature i e σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 and the results are shown in fig 5 a nonlinear monotonic trend is found between the cumulative infiltration or infiltrability and the plan shape this trend preserves for all time during the ponded infiltration period fig 5c compared with the parallel hillslope i e μ 0 the maximum difference of cumulative infiltration can be as high as 6 for both convergent and divergent hillslopes with the same negative curvatures circles in fig 5a steady rainfall infiltration was also investigated using the same convex profile curvature as used in ponded infiltration the results are shown in fig 6 a nonlinear monotonic trend due to the slope effect also exists between the cumulative infiltration or infiltration rate and the plan shape for steady rainfall infiltration the trend of runoff is contrast to that of ponding time figs 6a and b the rainfall duration seems to play a less important role than the plan shape in infiltration and runoff processes fig 6d the maximum difference introduced by the plan shape factor is about 8 for runoff and 5 for ponding time compared to the parallel hillslope figs 6a and b circles 3 3 the compound effect of profile curvature and plan shape the results shown in sections 3 1 and 3 2 reveal the effects of profile curvature and plan shape separately complex hillslopes involve the coupling of the two effects which can be investigated by examining the results for all simulated slopes the nonmonotonic effect of profile curvature for parallel topography also exists in convergent or divergent hillslopes for both ponded infiltration and steady rainfall infiltration figs 3 and 4 the effect becomes more complicated with the increase of the plan shape convergence or divergence the most obvious characteristic is that the location for maximum runoff varies with the plan shape factor as a result two hillslopes with opposite curvatures can lead to different processes of infiltration and runoff for nonparallel plan shape however the longest time to ponding occurs on straight profile slopes independent of the plan shape fig 4 the ranges of runoff cumulative infiltration and ponding time all increase with more convergent or divergent plan shape indicating larger variations for these variables on complex hillslopes in our cases the maximum cumulative infiltration is about 9 higher than that for straight longitudinal profile under rainfall conditions while the differences for runoff and ponding time are about 12 and 21 7 respectively it suggests that the effect of profile curvature cannot be ignored especially for rainfall infiltration further comparison between rainfall infiltration curves for different plan shapes reveals that rainfall duration plays a less important role in the relations of infiltration and runoff to profile curvature when the plan shape is not parallel figs 4d and e contrast effects of plan shape are found for opposite curvatures figs 5 and 6 infiltration and runoff remain almost invariant for a straight profile i e σ 0 for a concave or convex profile the effect of plan shape becomes more complicated the ranges of infiltration and runoff increase while the effect on ponding time is indistinct figs 5a 6a and b the maximum variations of these variables are presented in section 3 2 a similar pattern is found for runoff as well as runoff rate varying with curvature figs 4a and c which is affected by the plan shape factor figs 6a and c this suggests that the longitudinal curvature plays a more important role than the plan shape in controlling hillslope infiltration and runoff this also can be inferred from the maximum variations of infiltration and runoff due to plan shapes and profile curvatures similar changes in infiltration and runoff attributes are found for topography characterized by opposite profile curvatures and plan shape factors see figs 3 4 or figs 5 6 4 discussion 4 1 effect of hillslope topography as mentioned above two hillslopes with opposite curvatures and opposite plan shapes have similar effect on infiltration and runoff processes in view of topographic features of these slopes it was hypothesized that the overall slope effect is the ensemble of local slope effect and the slope gradient statistical distribution is a dominant factor determining the effect at the hillslope scale to test this hypothesis the slope gradients for the different hillslope surfaces were extracted and their cumulative distributions are shown in fig 7 the results show that different hillslopes with opposite curvatures and opposite plan shape factors have similar slope gradient distributions meanwhile similar infiltration and runoff results are found for these slopes the results for 30 degrees straight hillslopes show similar infiltration and runoff processes for different plan shape factors in which only a single value of slope gradient appears for longitudinal convex or concave slopes with the same average slope gradient an analysis of the cumulative distributions of slope gradient provides the clue for understanding the patterns of infiltration and runoff as shown in fig 7 with the same profile curvature but different plan shape factors e g σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 μ 0 466 slopes have the same range and mean value of slope gradient but different proportions of low and high gradients which respectively control the ponding time and cumulative infiltration compared to the parallel plan shape any positive change in the plan shape factor reduces the fraction of low slope gradients while increases that of high slope gradients for the same concave profile it therefore increases the ponding time cumulative infiltration and reduces runoff which are shown in figs 5a 6a and b opposite results were obtained for the negative change in the plan shape factor therefore a monotonic effect of plan shape on infiltration and runoff can be expected given the same plan shape factor but opposite curvatures e g σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 μ 0 466 both the range and mean value of the slope gradient are same but the fractions of high and low slope gradients can be fairly different this will result in different ponding times cumulative infiltration and runoff figs 3a 4a and b fixing the mean slope and decreasing the absolute value of curvature the range of slope gradient narrows this will result in an increase in the ponding time due to the increase of slope gradient in the milder portion of the slope which in turn increase the cumulative infiltration and decrease the runoff however the slope gradient also decreases in steeper portion of the slope in the meantime it will decrease cumulative infiltration and increases runoff the combined result of high and low slope gradient components makes the effect of profile curvature nonmonotonic figs 4a and c clearly show such trends in cumulative runoff and runoff rate specifically maximum runoff usually occurs on non straight than on straight hillslopes except parallel plan shapes the spatially varying slope gradient on longitudinally non straight hillslopes results in a smaller ponding time compared to straight hillslopes agreeing with the results in figs 4b and 6b since the overall infiltrability of a hillslope is more affected by high gradient portions of the slope the predicted ponding time based on tca tends to be larger than the actual value this suggests that high slope gradient areas may remain unsaturated when rainfall saturates the surface of low gradient areas i e the appearance of partial area infiltration excess runoff on such slopes for a given rainfall shorter ponding time signals less infiltration and more runoff since high slope gradient areas can increase infiltration and reduce runoff while the low gradient areas function oppositely the effect of a convex or concave profile with high and low gradients are twofold the overall effect will depend on both the longitudinal profile and the plan shape which collectively determine the dominance of high versus low gradient portions of the slope in the infiltration and runoff processes fig 4a 4 2 the applicability for tca to quantify the effects of complex shape of hillslopes on applying tca to the entire hillslope as one unit a series of cases were analyzed including all curvatures and several plan shape factors μ 0 466 0 176 and 0 discussed previously some representative results are shown in fig 8 in which the relationships of infiltration rate versus cumulative infiltration are compared under the conditions of ponded infiltration and rainfall infiltration with different rainfall intensities for ponded infiltration this relationship is the infiltrability curve the results show that these curves do not collapse into one figs 8a b d except for the straight parallel hillslope with an identical slope gradient fig 8c see h 5 in fig 1 the deviations are more prominent for lower rainfall intensity figs 8a d indicating that the hillslope topography can affect the accuracy of tca the larger differences between the results in figs 8a and c compared to that in figs 8a and b suggests that profile curvature affects tca more than does plan shape the results for concave convergent hillslope show that the infiltration rate after ponding given by tca is overestimated particularly for lower intensity rainfalls fig 8e consequently it will cause an underestimation of runoff this is also valid for other hillslopes with concave or convex profiles comparing the cumulative infiltration under a 20 mm h rainfall with that under ponded infiltration the relative differences at ponding time before which infiltration rate equals the rainfall rate for hillslopes h 2 h 1 h 5 h 3 see fig 1 with given curvature and plan shape factor figs 8a d are 29 8 36 9 0 and 18 0 respectively this result for hillslope h 4 σ 0 m 1 μ 0 466 not shown in fig 8 is the same as h5 0 difference this suggests that as high as 37 error could be introduced by tca when applied to nonstraight hillslopes it indicates that although tca can be an effective approach for simulating infiltration under rainfalls at the point scale or for a homogeneous land surface unit it may cause substantial error on complex hillslopes the result suggests that the nonlinear rainfall infiltration process over a heterogeneous surface cannot be represented by a simple spatial average which causes the inaccuracy of tca at the hillslope scale nevertheless these differences in cumulative infiltration will decrease with time and rainfall intensity the error may be neglected for prolonged rainfall durations or very high rainfall intensities 4 3 the occurrence of near surface lateral flow for hillslopes with isotropic and homogenous soil the subsurface lateral flow near surface is strongest when rainfall commences and reduces to zero over time during a steady rainfall the pressure head gradient is certainly the physical drive for such a flow lu et al 2011 lv et al 2013 when the surface soil reaches saturation i e ponding the soil moisture content near surface tends to be maximized and remains invariant thus the lateral pressure gradient as well as the subsurface lateral flow near surface tend to vanish therefore the time to ponding may be a good indicator for such a flow to examine whether the occurrence of this flow can alter infiltration on more complex hillslope topography a relatively easy approach was adopted by using the ponding time since it requires some efforts to extract the time to ponding for a designated location from the modeling results a series of random nodes on the concave convergent hillslope instead of the entire surface were selected for the study which are depicted in fig 9 a the hillslope topography used for this test has the largest range of slope angle which was expected to produce the strongest lateral flow among all considered hillslope topography the time to ponding at each node was determined for the three dimensional 3d domain and compared with that calculated by one dimensional 1d condition šimůnek et al 2008 with the same local slope gradient and vertical mesh discretization the results indicate that ponding time increases with increasing slope angle as shown in previous studies e g wang et al 2018 further validating the presence of partial area infiltration excess runoff the comparison is shown in fig 9b it demonstrates that the data points are close to the 1 1 line meaning that the 3d modeling results with the lateral flow and the 1d results without the lateral flow are very close this suggests that the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface before ponding on the entire hillslope can be ignored since the dominant subsurface flow direction is normal to the slope as a result this effect on rainfall infiltration and runoff is negligible suggesting a practical treatment to calculate rainfall infiltration using 1d richards equation for variably saturated flow more detailed comparison of 3d versus 1d modeling results of infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration is shown in section 2 1 of supplemental information which echoes that this effect on infiltration can be ignored and the infiltration on complex hillslope can be effectively calculated using 1d infiltration models for practical purposes 4 4 the run on effect the above investigations excluded the run on effect which is worth further discussion run on affects infiltration and runoff more notably on hydraulically heterogeneous surfaces and is the major mechanism for the scale effect in hortonian rainfall runoff processes chen et al 2013 2016 our results indicate that different slope gradients correspond to different infiltration rates and ponding times this implies that run on may occur more easily on complex hillslopes consisting of varying slope gradients without a module of overland flow movement the hydrus 2d 3d model is unable to treat run on directly in order to investigate this effect a relatively simple method was used by coupling a kinematic wave model wu et al 2017 and smith infiltration model smith 1972 detail can be seen in the supplement information s1 because the depth of overland flow is usually small and has minor effect on infiltration the numerical experiments only took into account the run on effect on downstream location infiltration before ponding occurs whereas after ponding the run on effect on infiltration through added flow depth was deemed negligible several selected hillslopes were tested and the results are shown in fig 10 as expected run on has little effect on infiltration for concave hillslopes because higher slope gradient areas upstream do not generate runoff earlier than the lower gradient areas downstream and thus do not enhance infiltration downstream figs 10a c little effect appears for run on on infiltration along the slope surface where runoff initiates earlier at downstream similarly uniform slope gradients on the straight profile hillslope lead to equal runoff initiation time along the slope so that run on shows negligible effect on infiltration and runoff contrast to that on concave and straight hillslopes the infiltrations on convex hillslopes are relatively more affected by the run on effect figs 10d and e especially for the convex convergent hillslope fig 10d in this case while the cumulative infiltration is not affected by run on an error close to 4 can be introduced into the infiltration rate when the entire hillslope surface is ponded such an error will tend to diminish towards the end of the rainfall this also applies to the infiltration rate and the maximum error is over 16 before ponding on the entire hillslope the effect may be more significant for smaller rainfalls note that divergent slopes allow more time for runoff infiltrating when compared to convergent slopes because of the smaller flow velocity resulted from the larger downstream width figs 10d and e for the same reason the maximum infiltration rate on a divergent slope is less than that on a convergent hillslope given the same profile curvature thereby the difference between with and without the run on effect is smaller the error for the estimation of infiltration rate using tca is enlarged for convex hillslopes considering the run on effect especially before ponding on the entire hillslope however since run on causes more infiltration the error for cumulative infiltration estimation can be reduced as tca tends to underestimate the cumulative infiltration on convex slopes without run on see fig 8 in addition it is worth noting that the run on effect can be more significant during the hiatus of intermittent rainfall during which infiltration is entirely maintained by run on chen et al 2016 such effect on non straight and non parallel slopes can be examined in more depth in future studies 4 5 the effects of soil hydraulic conductivity and rainfall temporal variability the curvature and plan shape factors with the maximum effect on ponding time and runoff i e σ 1 73 10 2 m 1 and μ 0 466 were selected in this investigation the resulting effects on ponding time and cumulative runoff under different saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks and two patterns of unsteady rainfall un1 intermittent rainfall un2 continuous rainfall are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively as expected the ponding time increases with increasing ks figs 11a and c while the cumulative runoff increases when ks decreases figs 11b and d a second ponding occurs under un1 figs 12a and b but does not occur under un2 while the first ponding times for the two rainfalls are the same as those for the steady rainfall shown in figs 4b and 6b respectively the reason causing the second ponding is the unsaturated soil surface due to the soil moisture redistribution during the hiatus of un1 changes in soil hydraulic conductivity or the rainfall process have minor impact on the trends of infiltration and runoff fig 11 the maximum ponding time still occurs on the straight profile hillslope when the plan shape of hillslope is fixed figs 11c and 12b soil hydraulic properties and rainfall process slightly affect the magnitude of ponding time and runoff while preserving their patterns of variation for a more permeable soil 1 5ks tested in this study changing the plan shape from parallel μ 0 to divergent μ less than 0 or convergent μ 0 alters the ponding time by up to 1 divergent or 6 convergent and the cumulative runoff by up to 12 divergent or 13 convergent figs 11a and b changing the profile from straight σ 0 to convex σ 0 or concave σ 0 alters the ponding time by up to 21 convex or 14 concave and the cumulative runoff by up to 3 convex or 20 concave figs 11c and d similar or smaller values of these changes were obtained for a less permeable soil 0 5ks under the given intermittent rainfall un1 the impact of plan shape on the second ponding time is less than 0 05 with a two hour hiatus fig 12a whereas the effect of curvature is no more than 1 fig 12b it is expected that these effects could be enlarged for a longer period of rainfall hiatus in that the soil moisture redistribution can play a more important role an increase of the plan shape factor from 0 466 to 0 466 under unsteady rainfalls can reduce the cumulative runoff by up to 16 un1 and 10 un2 while an increase in slope curvature from 0 0173 to 0 0173 m 1 reduces the runoff by up to 16 un1 and 10 un2 these results show that the effects of plan shape and curvature are altered similarly under unsteady rainfalls which can be attributed to the similar slope gradient distributions fig 7 nevertheless the variations of soil hydraulic properties and rainfall distribution can be much more complex in real conditions and the above discussion only provides a primary understanding in these aspects 5 summary and conclusion this study investigated the effect of hillslope topography on rainfall infiltration runoff processes through analyzing a variety of different types of topography characterized by two factors i e longitudinal profile curvature and plan shape which allow us to quantify the role of these topographic factors separately as well as their compound effect in the infiltration and runoff processes the applicability of tca the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface the run on effect and the effects of soil hydraulic conductivity and unsteady rainfall were also examined the results of both ponded infiltration and steady rainfall infiltration show that hillslope geometry affects infiltration and runoff the effect of profile curvature is nonmonotonic subject to change of rainfall duration while the effect of plan shape is monotonic and is less affected by rainfall duration the interaction of these two factors can complicate the result convex and concave profile curvatures will result in opposite effects of plan shape for a fixed plan shape up to 12 and 21 7 respective changes in runoff and ponding time can occur by changing the profile curvature and the longest ponding time corresponds to the straight hillslope for a fixed profile curvature about 8 changes for runoff and 5 for ponding time can appear by changing the plan shape accordingly the profile curvature plays a more important role than the plan shape the distribution of slope gradient shows a more fundamental control to the effect of topography two hillslopes with both opposite curvatures and opposite plan shape factors have similar infiltration and runoff characteristics due to the similar distributions of slope gradient the commonly used tca for predicting infiltration after ponding was investigated in complex hillslope topographies the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface and run on effect were also assessed for hillslope with a convex or concave profile a large error of infiltration up to 37 could be introduced because of the overestimation of ponding time especially for low rainfall intensity ponding occurs at different times on such hillslopes suggesting the presence of partial area runoff the effect of subsurface lateral flow near surface can be ignored suggesting that a possible simplification in calculating infiltration on complex hillslopes using one dimensional equations the run on effect was investigated by coupling the kinematic wave model for runoff with a simplified infiltration model it is found that convex especially convex convergent hillslopes are affected more than straight or concave hillslopes an error close to 4 can be introduced in to the cumulative infiltration when ignoring the run on effect this may be more significant for lower intensity rainfalls however the applicability of tca could be increased after ponding occurring on the whole slope which can be further tested in future studies by refining the coupled infiltration and runoff modeling approach the effect of hillslope geometry on infiltration and runoff can vary with soil hydraulic properties and rainfall temporal distribution however the general trends are essentially unaffected even though the magnitudes of the effects as functions of plan shape and profile curvature can be altered by soil hydraulic conductivity and unsteady rainfall repeated ponding can occur because of the soil moisture redistribution under intermittent rainfalls the effect of hillslope geometry on recurring ponding time is negligible when the rainfall hiatus is short while that on runoff is more significant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

connectivity and soil loss structural control dominates connectivity in this study and soil loss and connectivity are self similar the structural control is contrary to recent suggestions that functional dynamic processes control sediment connectivity in all landscapes self similarity also remains an open topic because a number of studies show poor correlation between soil loss and connectivity on average 12 of forested land and 47 of reclaimed mine land was connected for events studied predicted soil loss rates in the reclaimed mine were approximately 30 times greater than the forest land despite the fact that the reclamation is classified as phase 3 spatially explicit results highlight pathways that should be targeted for remediation and this study supports the idea of the forestry reclamation approach for remediation of excess soil loss keywords sediment connectivity erosion modeling watershed model forest hydrology reclaimed mine hydrology 1 introduction structural and functional watershed properties are now well known to control sediment yield and connectivity bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2017 zingaro et al 2019 over the past six decades watershed models have been widely implemented to simulate soil loss and understand controlling sediment processes at the watershed scale usepa 2004 and now play an important role in measuring impacts of sediment on ecology water supply and water quality morris and fan 1998 we find however that watershed models currently are hindered for several reasons namely seldom do watershed models represent structural and functional watershed variability at the fundamental spatial and temporal units at which sediment processes occur bracken et al 2015 nunes et al 2017 wohl et al 2019 batista et al 2019 this results from spatial and temporal lumping of sediment processes across landscapes and hydrologic events disassociating models from physical process and introducing empiricism in years past such lumping resulted from limited computing power and availability of spatially explicit data walling et al 1983 fryirs 2013 coupling sediment models with connectivity theory see fryirs 2013 bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2019 and now widely available geospatial data e g kyaped 2014 serves as one promising approach to better represent structural and functional variability of watershed properties the ubiquity of high resolution geospatial data serves as one means to overcome data limitations that currently hinder sediment models even in environments that have previously been considered data sparse e g fox 2009 our motivation was to better understand structural and functional processes that control sediment yield and sediment connectivity by coupling watershed soil loss modeling with spatially explicit sediment connectivity simulations we applied the coupled model to a steep forested watershed with reclaimed mine land in the appalachian region of eastern kentucky usa in this regard this paper serves the motivations of 1 advancing methods for coupling connectivity modelling with erosion rate modelling 2 understanding spatially explicit soil loss in forested and reclaimed mine land uses and 3 understanding and discussing controlling structural and functional watershed properties that limit sediment yield and sediment connectivity on forested and reclaimed mine hillslopes our intent was to improve process based knowledge of active sediment pathways and assist with management of soil loss in steep forested watersheds we couple the widely popular revised universal soil loss equation e g rusle renard et al 1997 with connectivity theory bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2017 to better represent spatially explicit pathways that actively contribute sediment to the stream network we chose to couple connectivity theory with rusle among other erosion models for a number of reasons first rusle has been widely applied across the united states and europe batista et al 2019 partially due to its success of implementation and relatively few input requirements fox and martin 2015 second the rusle formulation serves as the conceptual foundation for many popular non point source sediment models including ann agnps bingner and theurer 2001 and the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 third the availability of high resolution geospatial data such as 1 m digital elevation models dems serves as a basis to improve the spatial resolution of hillslope erosion simulations fourth rusle parameters have been incorporated in recent connectivity measures such as the index of connectivity see borselli et al 2008 suggesting that further coupling of the frameworks is possible while rusle has been widely applied one underlying assumption of the model is that all soil generated on a hillslope or within a hru reaches the stream network lenhart et al 2005 and that deposition along hillslope pathways is negligible de vente et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 such assumptions limit the applicability of the model to predict sediment yield only on surfaces with known active erosion pathways renard et al 1997 to overcome limitations of current watershed models and simulate actively eroding pathways we suggest coupling rusle simulations with connectivity theory we define connectivity similarly to heckmann et al 2018 as an emergent system property that reflects the strength and continuity of sediment linkages between and within system compartments at a given point in time connectivity is an emerging field that aims to understand spatially and temporally explicit pathways that facilitate sediment transport fryirs 2013 bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2019 theory and frameworks to understand sediment connectivity have been well developed within the geomorphology and engineering communities e g hooke 2003 borselli et al 2008 cavalli et al 2013 fryirs 2013 heckmann et al 2013 bracken et al 2015 gran and czuba 2017 mahoney et al 2018 2020a b ali et al 2018 several promising advancements in coupling connectivity equations with soil loss formulae in recent years include studies from vigiak et al 2012 jamshidi et al 2014 hamel et al 2015 mahoney et al 2018 2020a b zhao et al 2020 and michalek et al 2021 among others the majority of whom have implemented the structurally based index of connectivity from borselli et al 2008 to assess connectivity we find that seldom in the literature have both structural and functional connectivity considerations been coupled with soil loss prediction yet that structural and functional connectivity processes control sediment transport at both relatively short event timescales as well as relatively long decadal timescales bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2019 mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2019 ali et al 2018 in this study we couple rusle with connectivity while seeking to advance methods to quantify the tenets of structural and functional connectivity that consider the magnitude of connections it is now recognized that connectivity simulations should consider connectivity s magnitude extent timing and continuity bracken et al 2015 grant et al 2017 ali et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 mahoney et al 2020a b the model recently updated by mahoney et al 2020a b shows promise to serve this goal we consider event variability of structural and functional watershed properties using the probability of connectivity p c model from mahoney et al 2018 2020a b and suggest that representing the magnitude of connectivity by coupling p c with rusle serves as one approach to quantify connectivity s magnitude that is comparable across catchments another motivation of this work is to better understand structural and functional processes that control sediment connectivity and transport in steep forested catchments and on reclaimed mines such as those found throughout the appalachian coal belt region usa taylor et al 2009 steep forested catchments in the appalachian region are well known for soils with very high infiltration rates and limited runoff production hewlett and hibbert 1965 khan and ormsbee 1989 taylor et al 2009 fox and martin 2015 which is generally attributed to soil texture and macropore formations soil macropores efficiently transport subsurface interflow to stream networks gupta et al 2016 and are formed from freeze thaw processes dissolution of limestone and activity and decomposition of flora and fauna sloan et al 1983 guebert and gardner 2001 warner et al 2010 and we find the impact of macropores on sediment connectivity is understudied the appalachian coal belt s namesake originates from the presence of coal seams located frequently throughout the mountainous region surface coal mining is one method commonly used to extract coal in the region and involves removing vegetation timber and topsoil from surfaces bonta 2000 to access underlying coal seams which are subsequently excavated shrestha and lal 2006 during reclamation land surfaces are regraded with mine spoils crushed rock and coal fragments wickham et al 2007 and heavily compacted and reseeded to prevent mass wasting and landslides taylor et al 2009 warner et al 2010 generally regraded hillslopes remain relatively steep post reclamation but are slightly flatter than the surrounding forest hillslopes fox and martin 2015 notable difference in hydrology have been observed in reclaimed mine hillslopes compared to forested hillslopes in the region namely compacted surfaces have much lower infiltration rates compared to forested hillslopes resulting in greater runoff production warner et al 2010 we find that structural and functional controls on sediment connectivity in steep forested hillslopes and reclaimed mine lands in the appalachian coal belt region are understudied the use of coupled models such as the probability of connectivity and rusle serves as one approach to better understand controls of sediment processes in these remote regions the objectives of this paper were to 1 couple and evaluate the probability of connectivity model and rusle to advance spatially explicit watershed sediment modeling and 2 advance understanding of structural and functional variables that control connectivity and sediment yield in steep forested watersheds and reclaimed mine land we apply the model to a steep forested watershed in eastern kentucky usa with reclaimed mine land to fulfill these objectives 2 study site and materials the study site is the whitaker branch watershed 2 63 km2 located in letcher county kentucky see fig 1 land use in the watershed is primarily second growth deciduous forest 2 47 km2 and pastureland 0 16 km2 which coincides with reclaimed surface mining the deciduous forest consists primarily of maple beech yellow poplar oak hickory buckeye and basswood soils in the watershed are primarily silt loams with high infiltration capacity fox 2009 in the late 19th century timber within the watershed was harvested and subsequently farmed where contours were implemented for resource conservation purposes the watershed was subsequently reforested and remained relatively undisturbed for approximately one hundred years although some farming and residential areas existed in the lower part of the basin whitaker branch watershed is located in the appalachian coal belt and was subjected to surface mining between 1982 and 1988 and between 1998 and 2004 fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 see fig 1 reclamation of the surface mining site began in 2004 and was completed according to regulations specified from the surface mine reclamation act smcra notably surfaces were regraded with mine spoils crushed rock and residual coal and were heavily compacted to prevent mass wasting fox 2009 limited regrowth from native trees has been observed as consequence from compaction procedures and due to reseeding with grasses fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 watershed morphology is considered to be very steep with long narrow ridgetops and narrow valleys with some variability due to the reclaimed mine average slope in the forested land is 0 51 m m 1 and 0 44 m m 1 on the reclaimed mine surfaces features that promote sediment connectivity include concentrated flow pathways roads and surfaces throughout the reclaimed mine bonta 2000 fox and martin 2015 disconnecting morphology includes soil macropores that limit overland runoff production and historic terracing which dissects hillslopes fox and martin 2015 climate in letcher county kentucky is temperate humid with on average 102 cm of rainfall per year and average temperature of 1 7 c during winter and 22 8 c in summer during the study period 2007 12 storm events with rainfall that contributed to soil loss were identified high infiltration rates on the order of 120 mm h 1 are common in steep forested catchments throughout the appalachian coal belt harden and scruggs 2003 due to soil texture and the formation of macropores from flora and fauna freeze thaw cycling and dissolution of limestone in the area sloan et al 1983 taylor et al 2009 guebert and gardner et al 2001 warner et al 2010 fox and martin 2015 observations throughout watersheds in the appalachian coal belt region indicate that little overland flow is typically generated during storm events due to interception from the forest canopy and high infiltration rates due to the soil texture and macropore pathways taylor et al 2009 hewlett and hibbert 1965 khan and ormsbee 1989 sloan et al 1983 rainfall runoff response in the reclaimed surface mine varies from that of steep forested land uses reclamation of surface mines impacts infiltration rates of rainfall due to earthwork and compaction and results in notable runoff production shukla et al 2004 guebert and gardner et al 2001 warner et al 2010 researchers have observed decreases in infiltration from 120 mm h 1 to 10 20 mm h 1 from pre mining conditions to post reclamation warner et al 2010 taylor et al 2009 interception of rainfall is also impacted because of limited tree growth post reclamation angel et al 2005 acton et al 2011 a conceptual model highlighting differences in hydrology on steep forested hillslopes and reclaimed mine hillslopes is shown in fig 2 we used several materials to conduct probability of connectivity and rusle modeling including geospatial data sediment field measurements sediment fingerprinting results previous sediment and hydrologic modeling and field reconnaissance see table 1 highly resolved geospatial data used include 1 5 1 5 m dems land use and land cover data and soil data all geospatial data are freely available across the commonwealth of kentucky precipitation data collected at the nearby usgs gage in whitesburg ky were used as an input to both the hydrologic model and the rusle model delineation of the reclaimed mine was completed using remote sensing field reconnaissance and spatial mapping of statewide mined out areas we carried out hydrologic modeling using the soil and water assessment tool swat via arcswat 2012 10 21 to predict event runoff generation and daily soil moisture content since the basin is ungauged we verified hydrologic modeling by comparing annual water budget results generated from the modeling with results from similar catchments in the appalachian coal belt which improves our confidence in annual sediment yield modelling we applied the probability of connectivity p c model developed by mahoney et al 2018 2020a b to the whitaker branch watershed to determine the spatial extent of sediment connectivity during events connectivity modeling was carried out using arcgis 10 4 1 on a desktop pc intel core i7 6700 cpu at 3 40 ghz 64 bit operating system x64 based processor rusle modeling and subsequent uncertainty analyses were performed in arcgis 10 4 1 and in microsoft excel on a desktop pc windows 10 dell optiplex 9010 intel i7 3770 3 40 ghz 4 cores we utilized total suspended solids tss samples and sediment fingerprinting results presented in fox and martin 2015 to determine soil loss rates on forest and reclaimed mine land uses in the watershed which we used to evaluate the model sediment fingerprinting was conducted using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers to identify contribution of sediment sources fox and martin 2015 3 methods 3 1 sediment flux formulation via connectivity and erosion formulae simulation of sediment flux requires multiplication of connectivity formulae and an erosion generation function simulated using rusle connectivity is formulated using probability theory to reflect the stochastic nature of sediment transport and heterogeneity of hydrologic variables at the watershed scale wright and webster 1991 papanicolaou et al 2003 borselli et al 2008 wohl et al 2017 mahoney et al 2018 formulation of sediment flux via connectivity theory is originally presented in mahoney et al 2020a b to reflect tenets of connectivity theory including connectivity s magnitude extent and timing bracken et al 2015 grant et al 2017 wohl 2017 ali et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 as 1 m e p c p τ p γ where m is sediment flux generated from a spatial unit at an instant e is a respective erosion rate p c is the probability of sediment connectivity representing the spatial extent of connectivity during an event p τ is the probability of sediment timing representing the variability of connectivity and active erosion periods during an event and p γ is the probability of sediment dis continuity representing the continuity of sediment connectivity along the pathway the bracketed probabilities represent aspects of connectivity while the erosion rate is used to represent the magnitude of flux mahoney et al 2020a mahoney 2020 the theoretical background of eq 1 is detailed in mahoney et al 2018 and mahoney et al 2020a and we briefly summarize each concept below p c considers structural e g slope critical shear stress and functional e g runoff depth soil moisture watershed characteristics to predict active and inactive periods and locations of erosion entering a stream network borselli et al 2008 mahoney et al 2018 heckmann et al 2018 p c considers co occurring sediment process to predict locations within a watershed that are likely connected during an event as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 of this paper p τ predicts temporal connectivity i e temporal variability hoffmann 2015 of sediment flux during an event due to sediment travel time from connected cells ali et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020a mathematically p τ represents the percent of landscape units within a watershed that likely contribute sediment to the stream network between two instances determined via the integration of the frequency distribution of sediment travel time from connected landscape units between two instances of an event mahoney et al 2020a b mahoney 2020 p γ predicts dis continuity of sediment along a longitudinal pathway e g fryirs 2013 mahoney et al 2020a realized as the fraction of sediment lost along a pathway due to a morphologic barrier or a process such as deposition grant et al 2017 mahoney et al 2020a intersecting probabilities are used to represent the connectivity components of eq 1 because detachment and transport must occur sequentially and coincidentally with some degree of sediment continuity for connectivity to be established bracken et al 2015 grant et al 2017 wohl et al 2019 mahoney et al 2020a b additionally since the intersection probabilities of eq 1 simulate conditions necessary for sediment transport to be established mahoney et al 2020a introduce an erosion rate e to estimate the scalar magnitude of sediment flux at the fundamental unit scale during this analysis we focus on estimating connectivity over the entire duration of storm events rather than inter event variability thus p τ becomes unity see mahoney et al 2020a b additionally we find that very little instream deposition of fine fluvial sediment occurs due to the steep stream gradient fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 thus p γ becomes unity we note that p γ has traditionally been formulated to represent instream longitudinal deposition rather than cumulative hillslope and stream network lateral and longitudinal deposition e g mahoney et al 2020a b mahoney 2020 given recent sentiment to discretize connectivity into lateral longitudinal and vertical dimensions e g fryirs et al 2007 fryirs 2013 in this formulation hillslope deposition and disconnectivity are treated implicitly within p c formula see sections 3 2 and 3 3 for justification similarly to formulations presented in mahoney et al 2018 and mahoney et al 2020a b we emphasize that future work might focus on explicit treatment of deposition for both hillslopes and the stream network at the fundamental unit scale which has been an area of research for our group for example mahoney 2020 shows how p γ in the connectivity formula see mahoney 2020 pp 241 equation 7 can also be parameterized to explicitly account for deposition eq 1 is discretized across the watershed to represent spatially distributed connectivity and flux in fundamental spatial units e g geospatial cells where erosion and transport processes occur during an event as 2 m ij e ij p c ij where i is the event and j is the spatial unit we utilize 1 5 1 5 m dem cells to represent fundamental spatial units in this study because such resolution has been found to adequately capture morphologic features that influence sediment transport lopez vicente and alvarez 2018 cantreul et al 2018 mahoney et al 2018 eq 3 can be integrated in space and time over the watershed surface and over an event to determine sediment yield for the event as 3 y e p c where y is sediment yield 3 2 formulation of the probability of sediment connectivity p c the probability of sediment connectivity p c is defined as the probability that a landscape unit can detach and transport sediment laterally to the fluvial network borselli et al 2008 mahoney et al 2018 p c reflects the co occurrence or intersection of several structural and functional wohl et al 2019 sub processes requisite of transport including sediment supply sediment detachment and sediment transport as formulated by mahoney et al 2018 and mahoney et al 2020a p c is formulated as 4 p c p s p g p t 1 p b where p s is the probability of sediment supply p g is the probability of sediment generation p t is the probability of sediment transport and p b is the probability of a buffer that impedes lateral sediment transport e g fryirs 2013 p b is an implicit representation of hillslope deposition facilitated by morphologic features that impede lateral sediment transport and ultimately force deposition of upland sediment eq 4 considers intersecting probabilities because each sub process must occur coincidentally or sequentially for sediment originating in a spatial unit to reach the stream network leopold et al 1964 when considering that sediment generation and transport can occur via both hydrologic and non hydrologic e g mass wasting processes eq 4 is expanded as 5 p c p s p d h d nh p t h t nh 1 p b where d h and d n h represent hydrologic and non hydrologic detachment respectively and t h and t n h represent hydrologic and non hydrologic transport respectively eq 5 is expanded mathematically as 6 p c p s p d h p d nh p d h p d nh p t h p t nh p t h p t nh 1 p b we discretize eq 6 for all spatial units across the watershed surface during an event and integrate results to determine the percentage of the watershed that actively contributes sediment to the stream network 3 3 application of p c for forest and reclaimed mine land we make several simplifying assumptions regarding application of eq 6 to the whitaker branch watershed based on conceptual understanding of sediment processes observed during field reconnaissance herein we do not explicitly consider non hydrologic detachment or transport processes based on field visits and previous studies in the watershed fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 which found that deep rooted trees generally stabilized surfaces in the watershed uplands limiting non hydrologic transport additionally we do not explicitly parameterize buffers p b for the watershed because we did not observe the presence of morphologic features known to prohibit lateral sediment transport and connectivity during field reconnaissance and geospatial analysis fox 2009 fryirs 2013 fox and martin 2015 similarly to borselli et al 2008 p t h is represented by upstream and downstream components which conceptually reflects the likelihood for upstream sediment to transport to a cell and sediment generated within a cell to be transported downstream respectively mahoney et al 2018 as 7 p t h p t h u p p t h d w n where p t h u p is the probability of upstream hydrologic transport and p t h d w n is the probability of downstream transport thus eq 6 is rewritten as 8 p c p s p d h p t h u p p t h d w n mahoney et al 2018 explain in detail the parameterization of each subprocess and we have parameterized eq 8 similarly for the whitaker branch watershed given our perception of sediment transport processes during field reconnaissance we briefly discuss the parametrization of eq 8 as follows fig 3 shows the probability of connectivity simulation structure adapted from mahoney et al 2018 and inputs used to parameterize sub processes we implement a boolean approach similarly to mahoney et al 2018 to parameterize each geospatial cell across the whitaker branch watershed for each sub process where a value of 1 represents that a geospatial cell is connected with respect to the sub process and a value of 0 represents that a geospatial cell is disconnected with respect to the sub process p c results were later integrated across the watershed surface to represent the percentage of the watershed area likely contributing sediment to the stream network the probability of sediment supply p s is parameterized as 9 p s ij 1 i f s e d i m e n t i s p r e s e n t w i t h i n t h e c e l l 0 i f s e d i m e n t i s a b s e n t w i t h i n t h e c e l l where as before i is the temporal unit i e a hydrologic event and j is the spatial unit i e a geospatial cell we parameterized eq 9 by identifying geospatial cells with likely no erodible sediment via field reconnaissance and remote sensing of aerial imagery provided by naip during leaf off time periods for example due to an impervious surface or rock outcrop being located within a cell the probability of hydrologic detachment is expressed using an excess shear stress approach as 10 p d h ij 1 i f τ f i j τ cr j 0 i f τ f i j τ cr j where τ f is the fluid shear stress in cell j during event i and τ cr is the critical shear stress of the soil the fluid shear stress is parameterized in cells using the fluid momentum equation as 11 τ fij γ h ij s j where γ is the specific weight of water h is the depth of runoff in cell j during event i and s is the slope of cell j runoff depth is estimated for geospatial cells for the 12 events analyzed during the study period using arcswat 2012 10 21 see table 2 slope is determined in arcmap 10 4 1 via the spatial analyst toolbox the critical shear stress parameter τ cr is treated as a calibration parameter in this study as will be explained in section 3 5 the probability of upstream hydrologic transport is parameterized as 12 p t h u p ij 1 i f s j s cr i j 0 i f s j s cr i j where as before s is the slope of cell j and s cr represents a critical slope required to initiate sediment transport in cell j during event i based on approaches similar to torri and poesen 2014 s cr is parameterized similarly to torri and poesen 2014 and mahoney et al 2018 as 13 s crij 0 73 η j e 1 3 r f c j 0 00124 s 0 05 i j 0 37 u a j b where s 0 05 is a function of the daily curve number taken as a proxy for daily soil moisture content in cell j during event i ua is the upstream contributing area of cell j rfc is the rock fragment content of the soil in cell j as determined from usda soil surveys η is a connectivity rill gully threshold coefficient representing processes that might stifle or promote connectivity torri and poesen 2014 and b is the runoff turbulence exponent representing the hydraulic regime of runoff facilitating transport torri and poesen 2014 daily curve number is estimated for geospatial cells for the 12 events analyzed during the study period using arcswat 2012 10 21 see table 2 mahoney et al 2018 envisaged that eq 12 represented requisites of upstream connectivity since the critical slope threshold is an inverse function of upstream contributing area the connectivity η parameter and b exponent are treated as calibration parameters in this study as discussed in section 3 5 connectivity parameter ranges are recorded in table 3 studies used to derive the parameter ranges are also recorded in table 3 the probability of downstream hydrologic transport is parameterized as 14 p t h d w n j 1 i f s j s up n 0 i f s j s up n where s is the slope in the geospatial cell s up n is the average slope of cells upstream of cell j calculated in arcmap 10 4 1 physically eq 14 represents locations where the energy in a geospatial cell represented by the slope is sufficient for suspended sediments to transport through the geospatial cell to downstream cells mahoney 2017 mahoney et al 2018 hillslope deposition is also represented by the probability of hydrologic detachment p d h and the probability of downstream hydrologic transport p t h d w n these formula account for deposition because if the downstream slope of cell j is flatter than the average slope of upstream cells then downstream transport of sediment is not possible despite instances when detachment occurs thus detached sediment is assumed to deposit along the hillslope in these instances conceptually the p t h d w n equation compares fluid energy to transport sediment in downstream cell j represented by the slope to incoming fluid energy represented by the average slope we note however that disconnected cells downstream of upstream connected cells do not necessarily represent deposition from sediment in the connected cell rather these cells are assumed to not contribute additional sediment to the sediment cascade during the hydrologic event mahoney 2017 mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2019 several variables in eq 9 through eq 14 represent structural and functional attributes of the whitaker branch watershed structural connectivity which represents morphometric properties e g slope soil texture of watersheds with little variability from event to event over the course of the study period are represented with the probability of sediment supply p s and probability of downstream hydrologic transport p t h d w n mahoney et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 we represent functional connectivity defined as dynamic connectivity processes such as runoff generation and soil moisture flux using the probability of detachment p d h and the probability of upstream hydrologic transport p t h u p see mahoney et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 hydrologic variables used to predict p d h and p t h for the 12 events analyzed during the study period were estimated using arcswat 2012 10 21 see table 2 we conducted analyses of the estimated rouse number for suspended sediments in this system which suggested that once sediment is detached and entrained at the hillslope scale sediment likely remains suspended justifying the implicit treatment of deposition in the p c formulation for this system we briefly detail this analysis below the rouse number is traditionally used in sediment transport to specify the dominant mode of sediment motion and provides a measure of the shear action of fluid on entrained particles comparatively to particle settling chang 1998 the forest soils of the study watershed see mapping in fox 2009 and fig 1 are silt dominated and are generally classified as silt loam or silty clay loam mcintosh 2004 based on our recent research the crushed overburden making up the surface soils of reclaimed mining sites in this region also has a median particle size classified as silt fox et al 2020 using this information we analyzed the rouse number for diameter d of 53 µm sediment the rouse number is defined as 15 z ω κ u where ω denotes the settling velocity κ is defined as the von karman constant equal to 0 41 and u is the shear velocity of the flow the settling velocity ω is calculated here via the dietrich 1982 approach for nonspherical particles for d 53 µm particles and is estimated to be 0 3 cm s 1 the shear velocity of the flow is defined as 16 u g r s 1 2 where r is the hydraulic radius and is approximated as the flow depth h s is the energy gradient approximated with the hillslope and g is gravity the average slope in the forested land is 0 51 m m 1 and 0 44 m m 1 on the reclaimed mine surfaces and we assume a 1 cm flow depth in rills during erosion as a low bound on concentrated flow during fluvial erosion these sediment and hydraulic conditions provide a rouse number equal to approximately 1 30 based on these conditions we examine the possibility of sediment remaining suspended using the rouse criteria according to vanoni 1941 see fig 7 9 from chang 1998 pp 149 the z value of 1 30 corresponds to highly suspended and nearly fully uniform sediment concentration profile therefore it is estimated that sediment will remain suspended and not deposit once detached and entrained in this system 3 4 rusle application to forested land and reclaimed mine we apply the rusle model to represent erosion rates in geospatial cells to simulate sediment flux in eq 2 we assume that surface erosion occurs primarily via rill and sheet erosion in both the steep forested hillslopes and the reclaimed mine sites justifying our use of rusle to simulate erosion rates renard et al 1997 fox and martin 2015 the rusle model simulates soil loss on hillslopes at an event basis renard et al 1997 as 17 a e i k l s c p where a represents hillslope soil loss tonne ha 1 ei is the storm erosivity factor m j m m h a h r 1 k is the soil erodibility coefficient t o n n e h a h r h a m j m m 1 ls is the slope length and steepness factor m m 1 c is the cover management factor unitless and p is the supporting practice factor unitless we discretize eq 17 for geospatial cells to estimate annual soil loss throughout the whitaker branch watershed from both steep forested hillslopes as well as slopes on the reclaimed mine we modify eq 17 to account for connectivity by multiplying cells by p c results which represents the complete parameterization of eq 1 additionally we make the following assumptions 1 the ei factor is uniform spatially across the watershed during an event 2 the k ls c and p factors remain constant temporally throughout the study period 3 c factors vary between forest and reclaimed mine land uses and 4 disconnected cells i e p c 0 do not yield sediment a 0 eq 17 is thus rewritten as 18 a ij e i i k j l s j c j p j p c ij average annual soil loss tonne ha 1 for steep forested and reclaimed mine land uses is thus determined as 19 a forest i 1 m j 1 n a ij n j s t e e p f o r e s t l a n d 20 a mine i 1 m j 1 k a ij k j r e c l a i m e d m i n e where a forest is the average annual soil loss tonne ha 1 across the entire steep forested land use i is an index representing the storm event m is the total number of storm events during the study year j is an index representing the geospatial cell n is the total number of geospatial cells belonging to the forested land use a mine is the average annual soil loss tonne ha 1 across the entire reclaimed mine land use and k is the total number of geospatial cells belonging to the reclaimed mine land use since eqs 19 and 20 are divided by n and k the total number of geospatial cells that belong to the land use a forest and a mine represent soil loss rates from the entirety of each land use since sediment connectivity occurs on only a fraction of cells belonging to the varying

rusle as follows to parameterize the storm erosivity ei parameter we focus only on rainfall events that produce more than 1 3 cm of rainfall and storms that produce at least 0 6 cm of rain in 15 min in accordance with renard et al 1997 p 23 we utilize hourly rainfall data measured at the usgs gage in whitesburg kentucky for 2007 to determine storms appropriate for analysis 12 events during the study year were identified to produce sediment based on these requisites during 2007 renard et al 1997 we determine ei m j m m h a h r 1 values in accordance with renard et al 1997 as 23 ei r 1 p 1099 1 0 72 exp 1 27 δ v r δ t r i 30 0 1702 where r is a temporal index representing increments of a storm event p is the total increments in the storm event δ v is the depth of rainfall during the increment r in δ t is the duration of the increment h and i 30 is the 30 min rainfall intensity we record ei values in table 2 we parameterize the soil erosivity k factor using usda soils maps for the whitaker branch watershed and reported k values for each soil type see fig 1 and table 3 we parameterize the slope length and steepness ls factor by 1 delineating slope lengths from the watershed boundary to the nearest downstream concentrated flow pathway 2 defining slope along the slope length using the slope tool in arcgis 10 4 1 and 3 interpolating ls values reported in table 4 1 from renard et al 1997 we parameterize the support practice p factor as being equal to 1 0 we justify this given that slopes are relatively steep in both forested hillslopes and reclaimed mine hillslopes renard et al 1997 additionally we argue that this avoids overparameterization of the model given that disconnectivity due to terracing is already accounted for in p c results see section 4 1 we treat the cover management c factor as a calibration parameter in order to more accurately understand impacts of the reclaimed mine on soil loss as discussed in section 3 5 we justify using temporally constant values for k ls c and p given previous study in the watershed fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 rusle factor ranges are reported in table 3 3 5 model calibration and evaluation data used to calibrate the coupled probability of connectivity and rusle models include geospatial analysis and field reconnaissance of sediment transport pathways sediment fingerprinting analyses and sediment concentration samples field reconnaissance of sediment transport pathways was conducted by fox 2009 and geospatial analyses were conducted using dems kyaped 2014 and orthophotographs samples to conduct sediment fingerprinting were collected from forest and reclaimed mine sources as described in campbell et al 2009 and instream samples were collected five times during 2007 as described in fox 2009 tss samples were collected using a teledyne isco automated pump sampler as reported in fox 2009 and fox and martin 2015 observed soil loss estimates from forest and reclaimed mine land uses in 2007 were derived from tss samples and fingerprinting results we completed evaluation of the model in two stages see fig 4 in stage one we calibrated results from the probability of connectivity model by qualitatively comparing spatially distributed connectivity results with sediment pathways identified via field reconnaissance and remote sensing if simulated sediment transport pathways were considered unacceptable we adjusted connectivity parameters until the realization qualitatively matched known transport pathways connectivity parameters calibrated in this stage included 1 b the connectivity runoff turbulence exponent 2 η the rill gully threshold coefficient and 3 τcr the critical shear stress of erodible surfaces we used literature values to define ranges of parameter values torri and poesen 2014 mccool et al 1993 hanson and simon 2001 since calibration is completed qualitatively we defined wide parameter ranges to account for potential uncertainty see table 3 we justify the use of large parameter ranges given the difficulty of calibrating and validating spatially explicit sediment transport processes in stage two we calibrated results from the combined connectivity and rulse modeling by comparing simulated sediment yield to observed sediment yield for the forested land use and reclaimed mine fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 if simulated sediment yield was not within 35 of observed sediment yield we adjusted c factor for the forested and or reclaimed mine land use until sediment yield results were acceptable 35 uncertainty bounds surrounding modeling results considers error due to sediment fingerprinting approx 15 fox and martin 2015 and error due to sediment concentration measurements based on previous work we estimate 20 error from sediment concentration measurements after empirical observations of the variability of isco sediment concentration samples upon calibrating the model initially we recalibrated the model starting at stage one to account for landscape units with little or no soil loss that should be considered disconnected thus we treat calibration of the coupled models as an iterative process we quantified model uncertainty by permuting realizations of parameter ranges and running the probability of connectivity and rusle model we created over 200 permutations of the connectivity and rusle model to simulate sediment yield we justify using a low number of model realizations due to restrictions related to model computing requirements and file size we iteratively chose parameter ranges to reduce limitations related to the number of realizations see table 3 realizations with simulated sediment yield within 35 of the observed sediment yield were included in the solution space we qualitatively validated rusle modeling by comparing spatially explicit r ls k and calibrated c parameters with separate rusle modeling that considered lumped r ls k and calibrated c parameters all lumped parameters were on the same order of magnitude as the zonal average of the spatially explicit analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of coupled connectivity and rusle modelling a need for iterative validation we found that coupling the probability of connectivity model with rusle simulated both observed sediment yield and sediment fingerprinting results well optimal parameter values determined during model calibration are recorded in table 4 and simulated and observed sediment yield results are recorded in table 5 uncertainty results suggest that relatively wide ranges of connectivity parameters adequately simulate sediment transport whereas the range for acceptable c factor values is much smaller see table 3 approximately 55 of model realizations were included in the solution space which we attribute to the tight parameter ranges associated with the c factor we generally find that optimal parameters make physical sense however some parameter values warrant further discussion which is the focus below optimal cropping and management c factor values are on the low end of proposed range but still within the range suggested in research literature see table 3 for both the forest and reclaimed mine land surfaces low c factors have physical significance in the forested and reclaimed mine land use and likely reflect the presence of morphologic features that buffer sediment transport in the forested land subsurface macropore pathways increase rainfall infiltration rates and reduce the depth of runoff produced during storm events sloan et al 1983 which is then manifested as the low c factors additionally microtopography resulting from dense forest root mats and shielding from leaf detritus further reduce sediment transport and hence forest c factor values calibrated c factor values were an order of magnitude greater for the reclaimed mine site as compared to the forest which is to be expected considering the increase in event runoff generation due to the high bulk density and low infiltration capacity of the soils on the reclaimed mine relative to the neighboring forests acton et al 2011 the fact that the c factor was on the low end of suggested ranges for grassland reclaimed coal mine lands is reasonable because the land surface was classified as phase 3 of reclamation where final reclamation has been achieved fox 2009 erosion results in this region have shown erosion rates to reduce drastically once the land surface has entered phase 3 reclamation curtis 1978 bonta 2000 we parameterized the optimal rusle practice p factor as being equal to one which indicates that no anthropogenic practices such as associated with terracing exist in the watershed to reduce soil loss renard et al 1997 as will be shown in our connectivity results we found that legacy associated terracing occurred across the forest landscape of this system anthropogenic terracing existed from farming the mountains in the 19th century and early 20th century this farming and terracing were common in this appalachian forest region despite the steep slopes and corn was grown for animal feeding human consumption and illegally producing alcohol regionally known as moonshine kalisz 1986 stewart and bruce 2003 the legacy terracing typically would warrant parameterization of a p factor less than one however our probability of connectivity model results causes these terraced areas to become disconnected therefore the land surface area of the disconnected regions is not included in the calculation of mass flux because mass flux is the product of generation via rusle soil loss estimates and the probability of connectivity see eq 1 a p factor of less than one would over account for terracing and erroneously reduce the estimated sediment mass flux estimate for this reason iterative calibration between rusle and connectivity modelling was important to account for unforeseen dependency between variables in eq 1 we set the p factor as equal to unity to avoid the dependency in this instance our results suggest coupled connectivity erosion rate modelling incorporate iterative dual calibration strategies where calibration of one model should feed back or loop into calibration of the second model our results present evidence of the utility of such approach in two instances first as previously mentioned we found that calibration of the p factor in rusle was unnecessary upon multiplication of the rusle results with p c specifically we find that the probability of downstream hydrologic transport p t h d w n causes terraced areas to be predicted as being disconnected this is because p t h d w n predicts that there is insufficient fluid energy to transport new sediment downstream due to the flat surfaces of the terraced landscapes mahoney et al 2018 in this regard care should be taken by the researcher to avoid unforeseen dependency between the coupled formula because for example parameterization of the p c model may sometimes impact rusle parameterization second we noticed that upon completing rusle modeling that some landscape units in the forest were predicted to produce little to no sediment despite being predicted to be connected according to p c the lack of generation as predicted with rusle indicates the magnitude of connectivity is in fact weak on some landscape units such that sediment contribution from these areas is negligible and can be classified as disconnected following the criteria definition of heckmann et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 and ali et al 2018 we present results from determining event p c with and without considering feedbacks between the models referred to as initial calibration and final calibration in table 6 notably considering the feedback between the models and iterative calibration caused a reduction in overall connectivity for all events the result ranges from 0 1 to 13 8 reduction in connectivity which is relatively high considering final connectivity ranges from 2 9 to 22 4 this result and need for feedbacks between sediment generation and connectivity estimates is corroborated by recent sentiment in the literature and highlights the importance of considering not only the boolean connectivity processes e g fryirs 2013 but also the magnitude or continuity of connectivity grant et al 2017 wohl et al 2019 the model evaluation results of this study point out the researcher should use caution when coupling connectivity and erosion formula because parameters of the two model types are not necessarily independent in the present study the process of terracing impacts both erosion formula in the empirical rusle model and net connectivity estimates for predicting the erodible surface area of the basin we may have under predicted watershed erosion without this consideration however iterative calibration allowed us to account for dependence of the models on one another as permeations of coupled connectivity and erosion models develop in future years researchers should at the same time develop new evaluation procedures with qualitative and quantitative checks and balances to correct for unforeseen problems from model co dependency the efficacy of coupling connectivity theory and sediment modelling is corroborated by recent findings from zhao et al 2020 who independently from this study coupled rusle with the index of connectivity ic to predict sediment yield similar to vigiak et al 2012 zhao et al 2020 transformed the ic using a boltzmann type sigmoid function to represent potential sediment delivery ratios from landscape units the formulation was evaluated to perform well and qualitatively validates the approach presented here we emphasize several important differences however between the study of zhao et al 2020 and the work presented herein namely the ic used to represent connectivity is treated quasi statically ic is calculated once for a simulation in 1990 and once for a simulation in 2010 and thus only captures aspects of structural connectivity e g heckmann et al 2018 the ability of the ic framework to rapidly assess connectivity elements is noteworthy given that recently developed geospatial toolboxes allow the ic to be calculated for a catchment on the order of several hours of simulation time crema and cavalli 2018 however ic is recognized to only capture elements of structural connectivity due to the morphologic configuration of the watershed heckmann et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020a b consideration of functional connectivity is particularly meaningful when simulating sediment transport at relatively shorter timescales e g event daily and for small yet still important hydrologic events as will be shown later in the results and as highlighted in mahoney et al 2018 2020a b incorporation of functional connectivity elements is one limitation of the current ic approach as emphasized by a number of researchers e g bracken et al 2013 heckmann et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020a b however recent developments from gay et al 2016 kalantari et al 2017 and several others present promise for coupling the ic with functional elements additionally coupling elements of the probability of connectivity framework presented here and the ic may serve to better incorporate functional processes within the ic 4 2 event p c results connectivity and disconnectivity in appalachian forests and minelands results highlight behavior of event based connectivity in the whitaker branch watershed p c results vary between 2 9 connected event 8 and 22 4 connected event 5 at the watershed scale see table 6 this implies that 2 9 of the catchment and 22 4 of the catchment actively contribute sediment to the stream network during respective events ambroise 2004 mahoney et al 2018 p c varied greatly between land uses throughout the 12 events namely p c ranged from 34 4 to 57 1 in the reclaimed mine μ 46 8 σ 8 1 and 1 0 34 9 in the forested land μ 12 1 σ 9 8 see table 5 we attribute the high percentages of connectivity in the reclaimed mine to increased runoff production and hence energy available to transport sediment caused by compaction of soils during reclamation processes predicting the most connected pathways across the landscape was a notable result of this study and our spatially explicit p c results highlight morphologic pathways most sensitive to hydrologic activity in the whitaker branch watershed figs 5 and 6 specifically our results indicate that landscape units within the reclaimed mine are connected during hydrologic events of low magnitude and remain connected during events of increased hydrologic magnitude see fig 5a d events shown in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 are approximately representative of minimum event 8 25 quartile event 12 75 quartile event 1 and maximum event 5 p c results within the forest we find that only areas with large upstream contributing area within close proximity to the stream network are connected during events with low hydrologic magnitude see fig 5a and table 2 and forest hillslopes only become connected during high magnitude events fig 5d low connectivity on forested hillslopes in low and moderate events is attributed to the high infiltration rates in forest soils due to soil texture and macropores khan and ormsbee 1989 in contrast connectivity occurs on both flat and steep reclaimed mine surfaces with variable upstream contributing areas during events with low hydrologic activity see fig 5a the connectivity of reclaimed mines is attributed to runoff generation during low and moderate events because of the high bulk density measured for the compacted reclaimed mine sites acton et al 2011 we classify the landscape units within the reclaimed mine as highly sensitive active pathways for this watershed since they are connected in much greater proportions and more frequently than forested hillslopes morphologic features promoting connectivity can be seen visually for both land cover types using orthophotos gradient models and our connectivity results fig 6 as shown morphology causing connectivity in both the forest and reclaimed mine land include 1 concentrated flow paths on steep surfaces in the forestland fig 6a 2 steep hillslopes between historic terracing fig 6b and 3 surfaces throughout the reclaimed mine fig 6c disconnectivity of the landscape was another important result of this study and spatially explicit results also highlight morphologic buffers that disconnect sediments and impede sediment transport throughout the watershed see fig 6a c fryirs 2013 we examine disconnectivity in fig 6 during the event with highest hydrologic activity event 5 which highlights impedances due to structural watershed properties as opposed to impedances from functional hydrologic variability e g runoff depth or soil moisture content thus highlighting the upper limit of connectivity in the watershed fig 6a indicates that even on the steepest surfaces sediment connectivity seldom occurs in forested hillslopes the prevalence of disconnectivity on these hillslopes is attributed to relatively high sand content of the soil texture and infiltration capacity of the soil these soil drainage characteristics limit runoff generation and fluid energy to detach and transport sediment despite the steep hillslope gradient i e average gradient 0 51 m m 1 other morphologic features influencing disconnectivity on forested hillslopes include microtopography created from exposed tree roots and tree fall which promotes localized pockets of very flat slopes e g 0 10 decreasing fluid transport capacity also fig 6b highlights disconnectivity due to historic terracing found throughout the watershed locally flat swaths see fig 6b slope occur in contours throughout forested hillslopes and decrease overland fluid energy available to detach and transport sediment we find that terraces particularly impacted the probability of downstream sediment transport p t h d o w n and cause localized regions where deposition is likely disconnected landscape across the reclaimed mine was found to occur near ridgelines and locally flat areas created during reclamation see fig 6c disconnectivity near ridgelines occurs because with very little upstream contributing area is available to accumulate water and produce shearing able to erode sediment disconnectivity of flat contours occurs because spoil is placed in lifts during surface mine reclamation e g skousen and zipper 2014 each lift is constructed with near constant gradient with a slope length on the order of 50 m in this study and the lifts are compacted in place in between lifts a near zero gradient berm of spoil is compacted across the contour and is between 5 and 10 m wide these berms cause disconnectivity across the mining landscape 4 3 functional and structural controls on p c event variability of p c sub processes highlights structural and functional behavior that controls connectivity throughout the whitaker branch watershed sub process connectivity probabilities for the whitaker branch watershed are shown in fig 7a we find that generally functional connectivity associated with the probability of hydrologic detachment p d h controls overall probability of connectivity results in the forest and the whitaker branch watershed as a whole see fig 7a and b p d h limits p c during all events at and below the 75 quartile event 1 8 12 which indicates that detachment processes control sediment transport and connectivity across most surfaces in the whitaker branch watershed physically this result is related to the very high infiltration rates in most soils in the whitaker branch watershed which limits runoff production and hence sediment detachment only during the event with most extreme hydrologic activity event 5 did p d h not limit overall connectivity we notice similar trends in forest sub process probabilities see fig 7b which is to be expected considering forest land covers 94 of the watershed our results indicate notably different processes control the behavior of sediment connectivity in the reclaimed mine and the structural control and to a lesser degree the functional control associated with the probability of hydrologic transport and detachment respectively play a role in the minelands fig 7c in nearly all events the structurally dependent probability of downstream hydrologic transport p t h d w n is the limiting connectivity sub process indicating that structural watershed variables e g slope stream density limit connectivity in the reclaimed mine as opposed to functional variability e g soil moisture content runoff generation one reason that this occurs is because soil texture disturbance reduces infiltration rates such that storms frequently produce relatively large runoff volumes compared to the surrounding forest this results in elevated energy to detach and transport sediment manifested within the model by increased probability of functional sub processes p d h and p t h u p thus reducing functional control over p c results our findings add to an existing discussion of structural and functional control of connectivity in other watersheds and specifically our results relax the notion that functional dynamic processes control sediment connectivity in all landscapes bracken et al 2015 mahoney et al 2018 rather based on our review and experiences structural connectivity shows the dominant control on connectivity for steep basins and or during high magnitude hydrologic events when runoff production is high functional connectivity becomes more and more controlling on net connectivity for lower gradient basins well drained landscapes and or low and moderate hydrologic events for example application of both the probability of connectivity and index of connectivity methods showed the importance of the dominant structural control for high magnitude events in the comparison by mahoney et al 2020a results of this basin show the importance of structural control for the steep whitaker branch catchment and structural control showing differences between land cover types see fig 8 functional control associated with p t h u p seldom limits p c in the whitaker branch watershed likely because i soil moisture is relatively high in the catchment promoting low critical slope thresholds to initiate erosion and ii the steep slopes throughout the watershed easily overcome critical slope thresholds necessary to initiate rill or gully development on the other hand recent study has shown the importance of functional controls for lower gradient basins and lower magnitude events mahoney et al 2018 found in the upper south elkhorn watershed 65 1 km2 a gently rolling catchment average slope 0 07 m m 1 in central kentucky that sediment connectivity is generally controlled by the functional probability of upstream transport p t h u p which is a function of soil moisture content slope and upstream contributing area soils within the upper south elkhorn are primarily silt loams and produce large runoff volumes during events thus promoting detachment of sediment the relatively flat slopes of the upper south elkhorn lack energy required to overcome critical slopes requisite of rill and gully development explaining the control of p t h u p on connectivity in the upper south elkhorn 4 4 coupled p c and rusle model reveals connectivity and sediment loss rates our coupled p c and rusle model indicates that sediment yield from the reclaimed mine is nearly two times the amount of sediment yield from the forest during the simulation period see table 5 this result is significant because the reclaimed mine makes up only 6 0 of the whitaker branch watershed we find that soil loss rates a throughout the reclaimed mine are approximately 30 times greater than the forest land we emphasize that this rate is normalized across the entire surface of the whitaker branch watershed see eqs 19 and 20 as opposed to surfaces where erosion actually occurs see eqs 21 and 22 when only considering soil loss on connected surfaces ac soil loss rates increase by nearly an order of magnitude in the forest land use and by a factor of two in the reclaimed mine see table 5 increased simulated soil loss rates result from connected surfaces occurring on average on 12 1 of the forest land use and 46 8 of the reclaimed mine we emphasize this result because ac soil loss rates are likely more realistic of soil loss occurring in the whitaker branch watershed from a management standpoint this result highlights pathways that should be targeted for remediation within the watershed mahoney et al 2018 found that approximately 90 of sediment is transported in during events with greater than 3 connectivity which gives us confidence that this analysis captures the majority of important sediment transport events during 2007 spatially explicit p c and rusle modeling extends our view of sediment transport in the whitaker branch watershed and highlights connected pathways that produce the most sediment in the watershed see fig 9 in the four events presented in fig 9 soil loss rates within the reclaimed mine are greater than rates in the forest this result highlights that the pathways most sensitive to connectivity are also pathways that contribute the greatest soil loss rates spatially explicit results of the coupled p c and rusle model also highlight areas that are predicted to be connected but ultimately produce little sediment see for example fig 5d and fig 9d in particular we find that forested regions of the watershed north of whitaker branch are predicted to be connected fig 5d yet produce zero or near zero soil loss implying disconnectivity fig 9d we attribute this result to particularly rocky soils located throughout the forested hillslopes that increases effective critical shear stress of the soil and reduces potential for soil loss this result highlights the importance of considering connectivity s magnitude in addition to the extent of connectivity during connectivity simulations fryirs 2013 bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2017 recent reclamation literature suggests that in addition to detrimentally impacting rainfall and runoff infiltration processes excessive compaction of reclaimed soils reduces rates of native tree growth and promotes growth of short rooted grasses acton et al 2011 our spatially explicit results highlight that connectivity occurs frequently and soil loss rates are greatest within the reclaimed mine angel et al 2005 has suggested that one strategy to improve soil stabilization and regrowth of native trees on reclaimed mines is to compact soils and leave approximately 1 m of relatively loose spoil on top of compacted surface now known as the forestry reclamation approach fra williamson and barton 2020 this method limits mass wasting and recreates soil conditions akin to forested land uses related to the results herein we suggest that this method likely decreases sediment connectivity and soil loss in the reclaimed mine because reestablishment of native trees and recreation of surface microtopography increases interception and infiltration of precipitation and runoff we plotted event soil loss against probability of connectivity results see fig 10 and noticed a positive linear trend for both the forest r2 0 95 and reclaimed mine r2 0 55 implying a strong relationship exists between connectivity and soil loss relationships between soil loss and connectivity in the forest and reclaimed mine show trends of self similarity which implies that in steep watersheds probability of connectivity might be a predictor of normalized soil loss based on land use our results that p c is a good predictor of sediment yield agrees with findings from vigiak et al 2012 who found that calibrated hillslope sediment delivery ratio hsdr a function of the index of connectivity borselli et al 2008 was well correlated with specific sediment yield vigiak et al 2012 linked hsdr and ic and found hsdr predicted specific sediment yield well however it is noteworthy that this result contrasts findings from mahoney et al 2018 and mahoney et al 2020a b where probability of connectivity was poorly related to soil loss and sediment yield r2 0 26 and r2 0 007 respectively this is because connectivity simulations presented in mahoney et al 2018 2020a b were conducted in the much flatter upper south elkhorn watershed we find that sub processes controlling connectivity vary in the whitaker branch and upper south elkhorn watershed specifically in the whitaker branch watershed the probability of hydrologic detachment p d h a function of runoff depth and slope controls p c results variability of soil loss a as determined by rusle is also largely a function of event rainfall and runoff which may explain the good relationship this contrasts the upper south elkhorn where p c is largely controlled by p t h u p which implies that such self similarity is only realized in certain systems with very steep slopes where rill and gully development does not control sediment transport 5 conclusion the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the coupled probability of connectivity and rusle model simulates sediment transport on forested and reclaimed mine hillslopes well however unforeseen dependencies between connectivity formulae and rusle need to be accounted for for example the p factor in rusle was codependent with p c and the p factor needed to be held at unity to account for dependence when coupling the models we suggest future coupled models of connectivity and rusle should consider incorporating feedback calibration schemes as was carried out in this study to resolve potential overlap and discrepancies between connectivity modelling and rusle modelling 2 the coupled p c and rusle model tended to predict sediment transport well in this system that being said the p c model treats deposition in a rather implicit manner i e parameterization of buffers through field assessment a flatter downstream gradient classifying a given cell as disconnected rather than an explicitly including a deposition formula in each cell of the upland model per our analyses of the rouse number this treatment is justified for the conditions of this study however explicit treatment of deposition could be improved upon in our sediment connectivity formula and this has been an area of research for our group 3 our understanding of sediment transport on steep hillslopes with forest and mining land uses was advanced because an unforeseen impact of legacy terracing controlled both sediment connectivity and soil loss legacy terracing following historic deforestation in forested land and subsequent surface mining activities in the reclaimed minelands created disconnectivity throughout the basin disconnectivity was also predicted to occur because of soil macropores and the high sand content of soils that increase infiltration rates in forested land and because of constructed berms between compacted spoil lifts on reclaimed mine surfaces results show on average 12 of the drainage area of appalachian forests was connected during hydrologic events and 47 of the drainage area of reclaimed minelands was connected connectivity was prevalent in concentrated flow paths in both land types 4 structural control tended to dominate connectivity in this study and soil loss and connectivity are self similar the structural control results are contrary to the notion that functional dynamic processes control sediment connectivity in all landscapes summarizing in the context of other published studies suggests structural control dominates connectivity for steep basins with high runoff and functional connectivity becomes more and more controlling for lower gradient basins well drained landscapes or low to moderate hydrologic events self similarity between soil loss and connectivity implies that in steep watersheds probability of connectivity might be a predictor of normalized soil loss based on land use this topic remains somewhat open because one recent study agrees with our findings but others suggest the probability of connectivity can be poorly correlated with soil loss and sediment yield in some basins 5 the soil loss rates of the reclaimed mine are approximately 30 times greater than the forest land despite the fact that the reclamation is classified as phase 3 soil loss rates that consider spatially explicit connectivity are on average an order of magnitude higher in the forested land use and double in the reclaimed mine compared to analyses that assume lumped contributions from land uses from a management perspective spatially explicit results highlight pathways that should be targeted for remediation reforestation has been promoted in the region and this study supports the idea that reforestation will likely decrease sediment connectivity and soil loss in the reclaimed mine because reestablishment of native trees and recreation of surface microtopography increases interception and infiltration of precipitation and runoff credit authorship

4879,coupling erosion formulae with sediment connectivity methods is one promising approach to better represent structural and functional variability of sediment processes to advance this goal the probability of connectivity approach is coupled with the revised universal soil loss equation rusle in a basin with forest and reclaimed mine landuses model evaluation showed unforeseen codependency between connectivity formulae and rusle for example the rusle p factor was codependent with the probability of downstream transport within the connectivity formula researchers should use feedback calibration schemes to resolve lack of model independence connectivity modelling advanced prediction of sediment processes because it simulated the unforeseen impact of legacy terracing on sediment connectivity and soil loss structural control dominates connectivity in this study and soil loss and connectivity are self similar the structural control is contrary to recent suggestions that functional dynamic processes control sediment connectivity in all landscapes self similarity also remains an open topic because a number of studies show poor correlation between soil loss and connectivity on average 12 of forested land and 47 of reclaimed mine land was connected for events studied predicted soil loss rates in the reclaimed mine were approximately 30 times greater than the forest land despite the fact that the reclamation is classified as phase 3 spatially explicit results highlight pathways that should be targeted for remediation and this study supports the idea of the

and functional watershed properties are now well known to control sediment yield and connectivity bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2017 zingaro et al 2019 over the past six decades watershed models have been widely implemented to simulate soil loss and understand controlling sediment processes at the watershed scale usepa 2004 and now play an important role in measuring impacts of sediment on ecology water supply and water quality morris and fan 1998 we find however that watershed models currently are hindered for several reasons namely seldom do watershed models represent structural and functional watershed variability at the fundamental spatial and temporal units at which sediment processes occur bracken et al 2015 nunes et al 2017 wohl et al 2019 batista et al 2019 this results from spatial and temporal lumping of sediment processes across landscapes and hydrologic events disassociating models from physical process and introducing empiricism in years past such lumping resulted from limited computing power and availability of spatially explicit data walling et al 1983 fryirs 2013 coupling sediment models with connectivity theory see fryirs 2013 bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2019 and now widely available geospatial data e g kyaped 2014 serves as one promising approach to better represent structural and functional variability of watershed properties the ubiquity of high resolution geospatial data serves as one means to overcome data limitations that currently hinder sediment models even in environments that have previously been considered data sparse e g fox 2009 our motivation was to better understand structural and functional processes that control sediment yield and sediment connectivity by coupling watershed soil loss modeling with spatially explicit sediment connectivity simulations we applied the coupled model to a steep forested watershed with reclaimed mine land in the appalachian region of eastern kentucky usa in this regard this paper serves the motivations of 1 advancing methods for coupling connectivity modelling with erosion rate modelling 2 understanding spatially explicit soil loss in forested and reclaimed mine land uses and 3 understanding and discussing controlling structural and functional watershed properties that limit sediment yield and sediment connectivity on forested and reclaimed mine hillslopes our intent was to improve process based knowledge of active sediment pathways and assist with management of soil loss in steep forested watersheds we couple the widely popular revised universal soil loss equation e g rusle renard et al 1997 with connectivity theory bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2017 to better represent spatially explicit pathways that actively contribute sediment to the stream network we chose to couple connectivity theory with rusle among other erosion models for a number of reasons first rusle has been widely applied across the united states and europe batista et al 2019 partially due to its success of implementation and relatively few input requirements fox and martin 2015 second the rusle formulation serves as the conceptual foundation for many popular non point source sediment models including ann agnps bingner and theurer 2001 and the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 third the availability of high resolution geospatial data such as 1 m digital elevation models dems serves as a basis to improve the spatial resolution of hillslope erosion simulations fourth rusle parameters have been incorporated in recent connectivity measures such as the index of connectivity see borselli et al 2008 suggesting that further coupling of the frameworks is possible while rusle has been widely applied one underlying assumption of the model is that all soil generated on a hillslope or within a hru reaches the stream network lenhart et al 2005 and that deposition along hillslope pathways is negligible de vente et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 such assumptions limit the applicability of the model to predict sediment yield only on surfaces with known active erosion pathways renard et al 1997 to overcome limitations of current watershed models and simulate actively eroding pathways we suggest coupling rusle simulations with connectivity theory we define connectivity similarly to heckmann et al 2018 as an emergent system property that reflects the strength and continuity of sediment linkages between and within system compartments at a given point in time connectivity is an emerging field that aims to understand spatially and temporally explicit pathways that facilitate sediment transport fryirs 2013 bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2019 theory and frameworks to understand sediment connectivity have been well developed within the geomorphology and engineering communities e g hooke 2003 borselli et al 2008 cavalli et al 2013 fryirs 2013 heckmann et al 2013 bracken et al 2015 gran and czuba 2017 mahoney et al 2018 2020a b ali et al 2018 several promising advancements in coupling connectivity equations with soil loss formulae in recent years include studies from vigiak et al 2012 jamshidi et al 2014 hamel et al 2015 mahoney et al 2018 2020a b zhao et al 2020 and michalek et al 2021 among others the majority of whom have implemented the structurally based index of connectivity from borselli et al 2008 to assess connectivity we find that seldom in the literature have both structural and functional connectivity considerations been coupled with soil loss prediction yet that structural and functional connectivity processes control sediment transport at both relatively short event timescales as well as relatively long decadal timescales bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2019 mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2019 ali et al 2018 in this study we couple rusle with connectivity while seeking to advance methods to quantify the tenets of structural and functional connectivity that consider the magnitude of connections it is now recognized that connectivity simulations should consider connectivity s magnitude extent timing and continuity bracken et al 2015 grant et al 2017 ali et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 mahoney et al 2020a b the model recently updated by mahoney et al 2020a b shows promise to serve this goal we consider event variability of structural and functional watershed properties using the probability of connectivity p c model from mahoney et al 2018 2020a b and suggest that representing the magnitude of connectivity by coupling p c with rusle serves as one approach to quantify connectivity s magnitude that is comparable across catchments another motivation of this work is to better understand structural and functional processes that control sediment connectivity and transport in steep forested catchments and on reclaimed mines such as those found throughout the appalachian coal belt region usa taylor et al 2009 steep forested catchments in the appalachian region are well known for soils with very high infiltration rates and limited runoff production hewlett and hibbert 1965 khan and ormsbee 1989 taylor et al 2009 fox and martin 2015 which is generally attributed to soil texture and macropore formations soil macropores efficiently transport subsurface interflow to stream networks gupta et al 2016 and are formed from freeze thaw processes dissolution of limestone and activity and decomposition of flora and fauna sloan et al 1983 guebert and gardner 2001 warner et al 2010 and we find the impact of macropores on sediment connectivity is understudied the appalachian coal belt s namesake originates from the presence of coal seams located frequently throughout the mountainous region surface coal mining is one method commonly used to extract coal in the region and involves removing vegetation timber and topsoil from surfaces bonta 2000 to access underlying coal seams which are subsequently excavated shrestha and lal 2006 during reclamation land surfaces are regraded with mine spoils crushed rock and coal fragments wickham et al 2007 and heavily compacted and reseeded to prevent mass wasting and landslides taylor et al 2009 warner et al 2010 generally regraded hillslopes remain relatively steep post reclamation but are slightly flatter than the surrounding forest hillslopes fox and martin 2015 notable difference in hydrology have been observed in reclaimed mine hillslopes compared to forested hillslopes in the region namely compacted surfaces have much lower infiltration rates compared to forested hillslopes resulting in greater runoff production warner et al 2010 we find that structural and functional controls on sediment connectivity in steep forested hillslopes and reclaimed mine lands in the appalachian coal belt region are understudied the use of coupled models such as the probability of connectivity and rusle serves as one approach to better understand controls of sediment processes in these remote regions the objectives of this paper were to 1 couple and evaluate the probability of connectivity model and rusle to advance spatially explicit watershed sediment modeling and 2 advance understanding of structural and functional variables that control connectivity and sediment yield in steep forested watersheds and reclaimed mine land we apply the model to a steep forested watershed in eastern kentucky usa with reclaimed mine land to fulfill these objectives 2 study site and materials the study site is the whitaker branch watershed 2 63 km2 located in letcher county kentucky see fig 1 land use in the watershed is primarily second growth deciduous forest 2 47 km2 and pastureland 0 16 km2 which coincides with reclaimed surface mining the deciduous forest consists primarily of maple beech yellow poplar oak hickory buckeye and basswood soils in the watershed are primarily silt loams with high infiltration capacity fox 2009 in the late 19th century timber within the watershed was harvested and subsequently farmed where contours were implemented for resource conservation purposes the watershed was subsequently reforested and remained relatively undisturbed for approximately one hundred years although some farming and residential areas existed in the lower part of the basin whitaker branch watershed is located in the appalachian coal belt and was subjected to surface mining between 1982 and 1988 and between 1998 and 2004 fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 see fig 1 reclamation of the surface mining site began in 2004 and was completed according to regulations specified from the surface mine reclamation act smcra notably surfaces were regraded with mine spoils crushed rock and residual coal and were heavily compacted to prevent mass wasting fox 2009 limited regrowth from native trees has been observed as consequence from compaction procedures and due to reseeding with grasses fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 watershed morphology is considered to be very steep with long narrow ridgetops and narrow valleys with some variability due to the reclaimed mine average slope in the forested land is 0 51 m m 1 and 0 44 m m 1 on the reclaimed mine surfaces features that promote sediment connectivity include concentrated flow pathways roads and surfaces throughout the reclaimed mine bonta 2000 fox and martin 2015 disconnecting morphology includes soil macropores that limit overland runoff production and historic terracing which dissects hillslopes fox and martin 2015 climate in letcher county kentucky is temperate humid with on average 102 cm of rainfall per year and average temperature of 1 7 c during winter and 22 8 c in summer during the study period 2007 12 storm events with rainfall that contributed to soil loss were identified high infiltration rates on the order of 120 mm h 1 are common in steep forested catchments throughout the appalachian coal belt harden and scruggs 2003 due to soil texture and the formation of macropores from flora and fauna freeze thaw cycling and dissolution of limestone in the area sloan et al 1983 taylor et al 2009 guebert and gardner et al 2001 warner et al 2010 fox and martin 2015 observations throughout watersheds in the appalachian coal belt region indicate that little overland flow is typically generated during storm events due to interception from the forest canopy and high infiltration rates due to the soil texture and macropore pathways taylor et al 2009 hewlett and hibbert 1965 khan and ormsbee 1989 sloan et al 1983 rainfall runoff response in the reclaimed surface mine varies from that of steep forested land uses reclamation of surface mines impacts infiltration rates of rainfall due to earthwork and compaction and results in notable runoff production shukla et al 2004 guebert and gardner et al 2001 warner et al 2010 researchers have observed decreases in infiltration from 120 mm h 1 to 10 20 mm h 1 from pre mining conditions to post reclamation warner et al 2010 taylor et al 2009 interception of rainfall is also impacted because of limited tree growth post reclamation angel et al 2005 acton et al 2011 a conceptual model highlighting differences in hydrology on steep forested hillslopes and reclaimed mine hillslopes is shown in fig 2 we used several materials to conduct probability of connectivity and rusle modeling including geospatial data sediment field measurements sediment fingerprinting results previous sediment and hydrologic modeling and field reconnaissance see table 1 highly resolved geospatial data used include 1 5 1 5 m dems land use and land cover data and soil data all geospatial data are freely available across the commonwealth of kentucky precipitation data collected at the nearby usgs gage in whitesburg ky were used as an input to both the hydrologic model and the rusle model delineation of the reclaimed mine was completed using remote sensing field reconnaissance and spatial mapping of statewide mined out areas we carried out hydrologic modeling using the soil and water assessment tool swat via arcswat 2012 10 21 to predict event runoff generation and daily soil moisture content since the basin is ungauged we verified hydrologic modeling by comparing annual water budget results generated from the modeling with results from similar catchments in the appalachian coal belt which improves our confidence in annual sediment yield modelling we applied the probability of connectivity p c model developed by mahoney et al 2018 2020a b to the whitaker branch watershed to determine the spatial extent of sediment connectivity during events connectivity modeling was carried out using arcgis 10 4 1 on a desktop pc intel core i7 6700 cpu at 3 40 ghz 64 bit operating system x64 based processor rusle modeling and subsequent uncertainty analyses were performed in arcgis 10 4 1 and in microsoft excel on a desktop pc windows 10 dell optiplex 9010 intel i7 3770 3 40 ghz 4 cores we utilized total suspended solids tss samples and sediment fingerprinting results presented in fox and martin 2015 to determine soil loss rates on forest and reclaimed mine land uses in the watershed which we used to evaluate the model sediment fingerprinting was conducted using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers to identify contribution of sediment sources fox and martin 2015 3 methods 3 1 sediment flux formulation via connectivity and erosion formulae simulation of sediment flux requires multiplication of connectivity formulae and an erosion generation function simulated using rusle connectivity is formulated using probability theory to reflect the stochastic nature of sediment transport and heterogeneity of hydrologic variables at the watershed scale wright and webster 1991 papanicolaou et al 2003 borselli et al 2008 wohl et al 2017 mahoney et al 2018 formulation of sediment flux via connectivity theory is originally presented in mahoney et al 2020a b to reflect tenets of connectivity theory including connectivity s magnitude extent and timing bracken et al 2015 grant et al 2017 wohl 2017 ali et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 as 1 m e p c p τ p γ where m is sediment flux generated from a spatial unit at an instant e is a respective erosion rate p c is the probability of sediment connectivity representing the spatial extent of connectivity during an event p τ is the probability of sediment timing representing the variability of connectivity and active erosion periods during an event and p γ is the probability of sediment dis continuity representing the continuity of sediment connectivity along the pathway the bracketed probabilities represent aspects of connectivity while the erosion rate is used to represent the magnitude of flux mahoney et al 2020a mahoney 2020 the theoretical background of eq 1 is detailed in mahoney et al 2018 and mahoney et al 2020a and we briefly summarize each concept below p c considers structural e g slope critical shear stress and functional e g runoff depth soil moisture watershed characteristics to predict active and inactive periods and locations of erosion entering a stream network borselli et al 2008 mahoney et al 2018 heckmann et al 2018 p c considers co occurring sediment process to predict locations within a watershed that are likely connected during an event as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 of this paper p τ predicts temporal connectivity i e temporal variability hoffmann 2015 of sediment flux during an event due to sediment travel time from connected cells ali et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020a mathematically p τ represents the percent of landscape units within a watershed that likely contribute sediment to the stream network between two instances determined via the integration of the frequency distribution of sediment travel time from connected landscape units between two instances of an event mahoney et al 2020a b mahoney 2020 p γ predicts dis continuity of sediment along a longitudinal pathway e g fryirs 2013 mahoney et al 2020a realized as the fraction of sediment lost along a pathway due to a morphologic barrier or a process such as deposition grant et al 2017 mahoney et al 2020a intersecting probabilities are used to represent the connectivity components of eq 1 because detachment and transport must occur sequentially and coincidentally with some degree of sediment continuity for connectivity to be established bracken et al 2015 grant et al 2017 wohl et al 2019 mahoney et al 2020a b additionally since the intersection probabilities of eq 1 simulate conditions necessary for sediment transport to be established mahoney et al 2020a introduce an erosion rate e to estimate the scalar magnitude of sediment flux at the fundamental unit scale during this analysis we focus on estimating connectivity over the entire duration of storm events rather than inter event variability thus p τ becomes unity see mahoney et al 2020a b additionally we find that very little instream deposition of fine fluvial sediment occurs due to the steep stream gradient fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 thus p γ becomes unity we note that p γ has traditionally been formulated to represent instream longitudinal deposition rather than cumulative hillslope and stream network lateral and longitudinal deposition e g mahoney et al 2020a b mahoney 2020 given recent sentiment to discretize connectivity into lateral longitudinal and vertical dimensions e g fryirs et al 2007 fryirs 2013 in this formulation hillslope deposition and disconnectivity are treated implicitly within p c formula see sections 3 2 and 3 3 for justification similarly to formulations presented in mahoney et al 2018 and mahoney et al 2020a b we emphasize that future work might focus on explicit treatment of deposition for both hillslopes and the stream network at the fundamental unit scale which has been an area of research for our group for example mahoney 2020 shows how p γ in the connectivity formula see mahoney 2020 pp 241 equation 7 can also be parameterized to explicitly account for deposition eq 1 is discretized across the watershed to represent spatially distributed connectivity and flux in fundamental spatial units e g geospatial cells where erosion and transport processes occur during an event as 2 m ij e ij p c ij where i is the event and j is the spatial unit we utilize 1 5 1 5 m dem cells to represent fundamental spatial units in this study because such resolution has been found to adequately capture morphologic features that influence sediment transport lopez vicente and alvarez 2018 cantreul et al 2018 mahoney et al 2018 eq 3 can be integrated in space and time over the watershed surface and over an event to determine sediment yield for the event as 3 y e p c where y is sediment yield 3 2 formulation of the probability of sediment connectivity p c the probability of sediment connectivity p c is defined as the probability that a landscape unit can detach and transport sediment laterally to the fluvial network borselli et al 2008 mahoney et al 2018 p c reflects the co occurrence or intersection of several structural and functional wohl et al 2019 sub processes requisite of transport including sediment supply sediment detachment and sediment transport as formulated by mahoney et al 2018 and mahoney et al 2020a p c is formulated as 4 p c p s p g p t 1 p b where p s is the probability of sediment supply p g is the probability of sediment generation p t is the probability of sediment transport and p b is the probability of a buffer that impedes lateral sediment transport e g fryirs 2013 p b is an implicit representation of hillslope deposition facilitated by morphologic features that impede lateral sediment transport and ultimately force deposition of upland sediment eq 4 considers intersecting probabilities because each sub process must occur coincidentally or sequentially for sediment originating in a spatial unit to reach the stream network leopold et al 1964 when considering that sediment generation and transport can occur via both hydrologic and non hydrologic e g mass wasting processes eq 4 is expanded as 5 p c p s p d h d nh p t h t nh 1 p b where d h and d n h represent hydrologic and non hydrologic detachment respectively and t h and t n h represent hydrologic and non hydrologic transport respectively eq 5 is expanded mathematically as 6 p c p s p d h p d nh p d h p d nh p t h p t nh p t h p t nh 1 p b we discretize eq 6 for all spatial units across the watershed surface during an event and integrate results to determine the percentage of the watershed that actively contributes sediment to the stream network 3 3 application of p c for forest and reclaimed mine land we make several simplifying assumptions regarding application of eq 6 to the whitaker branch watershed based on conceptual understanding of sediment processes observed during field reconnaissance herein we do not explicitly consider non hydrologic detachment or transport processes based on field visits and previous studies in the watershed fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 which found that deep rooted trees generally stabilized surfaces in the watershed uplands limiting non hydrologic transport additionally we do not explicitly parameterize buffers p b for the watershed because we did not observe the presence of morphologic features known to prohibit lateral sediment transport and connectivity during field reconnaissance and geospatial analysis fox 2009 fryirs 2013 fox and martin 2015 similarly to borselli et al 2008 p t h is represented by upstream and downstream components which conceptually reflects the likelihood for upstream sediment to transport to a cell and sediment generated within a cell to be transported downstream respectively mahoney et al 2018 as 7 p t h p t h u p p t h d w n where p t h u p is the probability of upstream hydrologic transport and p t h d w n is the probability of downstream transport thus eq 6 is rewritten as 8 p c p s p d h p t h u p p t h d w n mahoney et al 2018 explain in detail the parameterization of each subprocess and we have parameterized eq 8 similarly for the whitaker branch watershed given our perception of sediment transport processes during field reconnaissance we briefly discuss the parametrization of eq 8 as follows fig 3 shows the probability of connectivity simulation structure adapted from mahoney et al 2018 and inputs used to parameterize sub processes we implement a boolean approach similarly to mahoney et al 2018 to parameterize each geospatial cell across the whitaker branch watershed for each sub process where a value of 1 represents that a geospatial cell is connected with respect to the sub process and a value of 0 represents that a geospatial cell is disconnected with respect to the sub process p c results were later integrated across the watershed surface to represent the percentage of the watershed area likely contributing sediment to the stream network the probability of sediment supply p s is parameterized as 9 p s ij 1 i f s e d i m e n t i s p r e s e n t w i t h i n t h e c e l l 0 i f s e d i m e n t i s a b s e n t w i t h i n t h e c e l l where as before i is the temporal unit i e a hydrologic event and j is the spatial unit i e a geospatial cell we parameterized eq 9 by identifying geospatial cells with likely no erodible sediment via field reconnaissance and remote sensing of aerial imagery provided by naip during leaf off time periods for example due to an impervious surface or rock outcrop being located within a cell the probability of hydrologic detachment is expressed using an excess shear stress approach as 10 p d h ij 1 i f τ f i j τ cr j 0 i f τ f i j τ cr j where τ f is the fluid shear stress in cell j during event i and τ cr is the critical shear stress of the soil the fluid shear stress is parameterized in cells using the fluid momentum equation as 11 τ fij γ h ij s j where γ is the specific weight of water h is the depth of runoff in cell j during event i and s is the slope of cell j runoff depth is estimated for geospatial cells for the 12 events analyzed during the study period using arcswat 2012 10 21 see table 2 slope is determined in arcmap 10 4 1 via the spatial analyst toolbox the critical shear stress parameter τ cr is treated as a calibration parameter in this study as will be explained in section 3 5 the probability of upstream hydrologic transport is parameterized as 12 p t h u p ij 1 i f s j s cr i j 0 i f s j s cr i j where as before s is the slope of cell j and s cr represents a critical slope required to initiate sediment transport in cell j during event i based on approaches similar to torri and poesen 2014 s cr is parameterized similarly to torri and poesen 2014 and mahoney et al 2018 as 13 s crij 0 73 η j e 1 3 r f c j 0 00124 s 0 05 i j 0 37 u a j b where s 0 05 is a function of the daily curve number taken as a proxy for daily soil moisture content in cell j during event i ua is the upstream contributing area of cell j rfc is the rock fragment content of the soil in cell j as determined from usda soil surveys η is a connectivity rill gully threshold coefficient representing processes that might stifle or promote connectivity torri and poesen 2014 and b is the runoff turbulence exponent representing the hydraulic regime of runoff facilitating transport torri and poesen 2014 daily curve number is estimated for geospatial cells for the 12 events analyzed during the study period using arcswat 2012 10 21 see table 2 mahoney et al 2018 envisaged that eq 12 represented requisites of upstream connectivity since the critical slope threshold is an inverse function of upstream contributing area the connectivity η parameter and b exponent are treated as calibration parameters in this study as discussed in section 3 5 connectivity parameter ranges are recorded in table 3 studies used to derive the parameter ranges are also recorded in table 3 the probability of downstream hydrologic transport is parameterized as 14 p t h d w n j 1 i f s j s up n 0 i f s j s up n where s is the slope in the geospatial cell s up n is the average slope of cells upstream of cell j calculated in arcmap 10 4 1 physically eq 14 represents locations where the energy in a geospatial cell represented by the slope is sufficient for suspended sediments to transport through the geospatial cell to downstream cells mahoney 2017 mahoney et al 2018 hillslope deposition is also represented by the probability of hydrologic detachment p d h and the probability of downstream hydrologic transport p t h d w n these formula account for deposition because if the downstream slope of cell j is flatter than the average slope of upstream cells then downstream transport of sediment is not possible despite instances when detachment occurs thus detached sediment is assumed to deposit along the hillslope in these instances conceptually the p t h d w n equation compares fluid energy to transport sediment in downstream cell j represented by the slope to incoming fluid energy represented by the average slope we note however that disconnected cells downstream of upstream connected cells do not necessarily represent deposition from sediment in the connected cell rather these cells are assumed to not contribute additional sediment to the sediment cascade during the hydrologic event mahoney 2017 mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2019 several variables in eq 9 through eq 14 represent structural and functional attributes of the whitaker branch watershed structural connectivity which represents morphometric properties e g slope soil texture of watersheds with little variability from event to event over the course of the study period are represented with the probability of sediment supply p s and probability of downstream hydrologic transport p t h d w n mahoney et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 we represent functional connectivity defined as dynamic connectivity processes such as runoff generation and soil moisture flux using the probability of detachment p d h and the probability of upstream hydrologic transport p t h u p see mahoney et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 hydrologic variables used to predict p d h and p t h for the 12 events analyzed during the study period were estimated using arcswat 2012 10 21 see table 2 we conducted analyses of the estimated rouse number for suspended sediments in this system which suggested that once sediment is detached and entrained at the hillslope scale sediment likely remains suspended justifying the implicit treatment of deposition in the p c formulation for this system we briefly detail this analysis below the rouse number is traditionally used in sediment transport to specify the dominant mode of sediment motion and provides a measure of the shear action of fluid on entrained particles comparatively to particle settling chang 1998 the forest soils of the study watershed see mapping in fox 2009 and fig 1 are silt dominated and are generally classified as silt loam or silty clay loam mcintosh 2004 based on our recent research the crushed overburden making up the surface soils of reclaimed mining sites in this region also has a median particle size classified as silt fox et al 2020 using this information we analyzed the rouse number for diameter d of 53 µm sediment the rouse number is defined as 15 z ω κ u where ω denotes the settling velocity κ is defined as the von karman constant equal to 0 41 and u is the shear velocity of the flow the settling velocity ω is calculated here via the dietrich 1982 approach for nonspherical particles for d 53 µm particles and is estimated to be 0 3 cm s 1 the shear velocity of the flow is defined as 16 u g r s 1 2 where r is the hydraulic radius and is approximated as the flow depth h s is the energy gradient approximated with the hillslope and g is gravity the average slope in the forested land is 0 51 m m 1 and 0 44 m m 1 on the reclaimed mine surfaces and we assume a 1 cm flow depth in rills during erosion as a low bound on concentrated flow during fluvial erosion these sediment and hydraulic conditions provide a rouse number equal to approximately 1 30 based on these conditions we examine the possibility of sediment remaining suspended using the rouse criteria according to vanoni 1941 see fig 7 9 from chang 1998 pp 149 the z value of 1 30 corresponds to highly suspended and nearly fully uniform sediment concentration profile therefore it is estimated that sediment will remain suspended and not deposit once detached and entrained in this system 3 4 rusle application to forested land and reclaimed mine we apply the rusle model to represent erosion rates in geospatial cells to simulate sediment flux in eq 2 we assume that surface erosion occurs primarily via rill and sheet erosion in both the steep forested hillslopes and the reclaimed mine sites justifying our use of rusle to simulate erosion rates renard et al 1997 fox and martin 2015 the rusle model simulates soil loss on hillslopes at an event basis renard et al 1997 as 17 a e i k l s c p where a represents hillslope soil loss tonne ha 1 ei is the storm erosivity factor m j m m h a h r 1 k is the soil erodibility coefficient t o n n e h a h r h a m j m m 1 ls is the slope length and steepness factor m m 1 c is the cover management factor unitless and p is the supporting practice factor unitless we discretize eq 17 for geospatial cells to estimate annual soil loss throughout the whitaker branch watershed from both steep forested hillslopes as well as slopes on the reclaimed mine we modify eq 17 to account for connectivity by multiplying cells by p c results which represents the complete parameterization of eq 1 additionally we make the following assumptions 1 the ei factor is uniform spatially across the watershed during an event 2 the k ls c and p factors remain constant temporally throughout the study period 3 c factors vary between forest and reclaimed mine land uses and 4 disconnected cells i e p c 0 do not yield sediment a 0 eq 17 is thus rewritten as 18 a ij e i i k j l s j c j p j p c ij average annual soil loss tonne ha 1 for steep forested and reclaimed mine land uses is thus determined as 19 a forest i 1 m j 1 n a ij n j s t e e p f o r e s t l a n d 20 a mine i 1 m j 1 k a ij k j r e c l a i m e d m i n e where a forest is the average annual soil loss tonne ha 1 across the entire steep forested land use i is an index representing the storm event m is the total number of storm events during the study year j is an index representing the geospatial cell n is the total number of geospatial cells belonging to the forested land use a mine is the average annual soil loss tonne ha 1 across the entire reclaimed mine land use and k is the total number of geospatial cells belonging to the reclaimed mine land use since eqs 19 and 20 are divided by n and k the total number of geospatial cells that belong to the land use a forest and a mine represent soil loss rates from the entirety of each land use since sediment connectivity occurs on only a fraction of cells belonging to the varying land uses we modify eqs 19 and 20 to represent normalized soil loss for only connected areas as 21 ac forest i 1 m j 1 n a ij α i j s t e e p f o r e s t l a n d 22 ac mine i 1 m j 1 k a ij β i j r e c l a i m e d m i n e where ac forest represents annual soil loss tonne ha 1 for connected forested land use α i is the total number of steep forested geospatial cells connected during an event ac mine is the annual soil loss tonne ha 1 for the reclaimed mine land use and β i is the total number of reclaimed mine geospatial cells connected during an event also α i n and β i k we parameterize rusle as follows to parameterize the storm erosivity ei parameter we focus only on rainfall events that produce more than 1 3 cm of rainfall and storms that produce at least 0 6 cm of rain in 15 min in accordance with renard et al 1997 p 23 we utilize hourly rainfall data measured at the usgs gage in whitesburg kentucky for 2007 to determine storms appropriate for analysis 12 events during the study year were identified to produce sediment based on these requisites during 2007 renard et al 1997 we determine ei m j m m h a h r 1 values in accordance with renard et al 1997 as 23 ei r 1 p 1099 1 0 72 exp 1 27 δ v r δ t r i 30 0 1702 where r is a temporal index representing increments of a storm event p is the total increments in the storm event δ v is the depth of rainfall during the increment r in δ t is the duration of the increment h and i 30 is the 30 min rainfall intensity we record ei values in table 2 we parameterize the soil erosivity k factor using usda soils maps for the whitaker branch watershed and reported k values for each soil type see fig 1 and table 3 we parameterize the slope length and steepness ls factor by 1 delineating slope lengths from the watershed boundary to the nearest downstream concentrated flow pathway 2 defining slope along the slope length using the slope tool in arcgis 10 4 1 and 3 interpolating ls values reported in table 4 1 from renard et al 1997 we parameterize the support practice p factor as being equal to 1 0 we justify this given that slopes are relatively steep in both forested hillslopes and reclaimed mine hillslopes renard et al 1997 additionally we argue that this avoids overparameterization of the model given that disconnectivity due to terracing is already accounted for in p c results see section 4 1 we treat the cover management c factor as a calibration parameter in order to more accurately understand impacts of the reclaimed mine on soil loss as discussed in section 3 5 we justify using temporally constant values for k ls c and p given previous study in the watershed fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 rusle factor ranges are reported in table 3 3 5 model calibration and evaluation data used to calibrate the coupled probability of connectivity and rusle models include geospatial analysis and field reconnaissance of sediment transport pathways sediment fingerprinting analyses and sediment concentration samples field reconnaissance of sediment transport pathways was conducted by fox 2009 and geospatial analyses were conducted using dems kyaped 2014 and orthophotographs samples to conduct sediment fingerprinting were collected from forest and reclaimed mine sources as described in campbell et al 2009 and instream samples were collected five times during 2007 as described in fox 2009 tss samples were collected using a teledyne isco automated pump sampler as reported in fox 2009 and fox and martin 2015 observed soil loss estimates from forest and reclaimed mine land uses in 2007 were derived from tss samples and fingerprinting results we completed evaluation of the model in two stages see fig 4 in stage one we calibrated results from the probability of connectivity model by qualitatively comparing spatially distributed connectivity results with sediment pathways identified via field reconnaissance and remote sensing if simulated sediment transport pathways were considered unacceptable we adjusted connectivity parameters until the realization qualitatively matched known transport pathways connectivity parameters calibrated in this stage included 1 b the connectivity runoff turbulence exponent 2 η the rill gully threshold coefficient and 3 τcr the critical shear stress of erodible surfaces we used literature values to define ranges of parameter values torri and poesen 2014 mccool et al 1993 hanson and simon 2001 since calibration is completed qualitatively we defined wide parameter ranges to account for potential uncertainty see table 3 we justify the use of large parameter ranges given the difficulty of calibrating and validating spatially explicit sediment transport processes in stage two we calibrated results from the combined connectivity and rulse modeling by comparing simulated sediment yield to observed sediment yield for the forested land use and reclaimed mine fox 2009 fox and martin 2015 if simulated sediment yield was not within 35 of observed sediment yield we adjusted c factor for the forested and or reclaimed mine land use until sediment yield results were acceptable 35 uncertainty bounds surrounding modeling results considers error due to sediment fingerprinting approx 15 fox and martin 2015 and error due to sediment concentration measurements based on previous work we estimate 20 error from sediment concentration measurements after empirical observations of the variability of isco sediment concentration samples upon calibrating the model initially we recalibrated the model starting at stage one to account for landscape units with little or no soil loss that should be considered disconnected thus we treat calibration of the coupled models as an iterative process we quantified model uncertainty by permuting realizations of parameter ranges and running the probability of connectivity and rusle model we created over 200 permutations of the connectivity and rusle model to simulate sediment yield we justify using a low number of model realizations due to restrictions related to model computing requirements and file size we iteratively chose parameter ranges to reduce limitations related to the number of realizations see table 3 realizations with simulated sediment yield within 35 of the observed sediment yield were included in the solution space we qualitatively validated rusle modeling by comparing spatially explicit r ls k and calibrated c parameters with separate rusle modeling that considered lumped r ls k and calibrated c parameters all lumped parameters were on the same order of magnitude as the zonal average of the spatially explicit analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of coupled connectivity and rusle modelling a need for iterative validation we found that coupling the probability of connectivity model with rusle simulated both observed sediment yield and sediment fingerprinting results well optimal parameter values determined during model calibration are recorded in table 4 and simulated and observed sediment yield results are recorded in table 5 uncertainty results suggest that relatively wide ranges of connectivity parameters adequately simulate sediment transport whereas the range for acceptable c factor values is much smaller see table 3 approximately 55 of model realizations were included in the solution space which we attribute to the tight parameter ranges associated with the c factor we generally find that optimal parameters make physical sense however some parameter values warrant further discussion which is the focus below optimal cropping and management c factor values are on the low end of proposed range but still within the range suggested in research literature see table 3 for both the forest and reclaimed mine land surfaces low c factors have physical significance in the forested and reclaimed mine land use and likely reflect the presence of morphologic features that buffer sediment transport in the forested land subsurface macropore pathways increase rainfall infiltration rates and reduce the depth of runoff produced during storm events sloan et al 1983 which is then manifested as the low c factors additionally microtopography resulting from dense forest root mats and shielding from leaf detritus further reduce sediment transport and hence forest c factor values calibrated c factor values were an order of magnitude greater for the reclaimed mine site as compared to the forest which is to be expected considering the increase in event runoff generation due to the high bulk density and low infiltration capacity of the soils on the reclaimed mine relative to the neighboring forests acton et al 2011 the fact that the c factor was on the low end of suggested ranges for grassland reclaimed coal mine lands is reasonable because the land surface was classified as phase 3 of reclamation where final reclamation has been achieved fox 2009 erosion results in this region have shown erosion rates to reduce drastically once the land surface has entered phase 3 reclamation curtis 1978 bonta 2000 we parameterized the optimal rusle practice p factor as being equal to one which indicates that no anthropogenic practices such as associated with terracing exist in the watershed to reduce soil loss renard et al 1997 as will be shown in our connectivity results we found that legacy associated terracing occurred across the forest landscape of this system anthropogenic terracing existed from farming the mountains in the 19th century and early 20th century this farming and terracing were common in this appalachian forest region despite the steep slopes and corn was grown for animal feeding human consumption and illegally producing alcohol regionally known as moonshine kalisz 1986 stewart and bruce 2003 the legacy terracing typically would warrant parameterization of a p factor less than one however our probability of connectivity model results causes these terraced areas to become disconnected therefore the land surface area of the disconnected regions is not included in the calculation of mass flux because mass flux is the product of generation via rusle soil loss estimates and the probability of connectivity see eq 1 a p factor of less than one would over account for terracing and erroneously reduce the estimated sediment mass flux estimate for this reason iterative calibration between rusle and connectivity modelling was important to account for unforeseen dependency between variables in eq 1 we set the p factor as equal to unity to avoid the dependency in this instance our results suggest coupled connectivity erosion rate modelling incorporate iterative dual calibration strategies where calibration of one model should feed back or loop into calibration of the second model our results present evidence of the utility of such approach in two instances first as previously mentioned we found that calibration of the p factor in rusle was unnecessary upon multiplication of the rusle results with p c specifically we find that the probability of downstream hydrologic transport p t h d w n causes terraced areas to be predicted as being disconnected this is because p t h d w n predicts that there is insufficient fluid energy to transport new sediment downstream due to the flat surfaces of the terraced landscapes mahoney et al 2018 in this regard care should be taken by the researcher to avoid unforeseen dependency between the coupled formula because for example parameterization of the p c model may sometimes impact rusle parameterization second we noticed that upon completing rusle modeling that some landscape units in the forest were predicted to produce little to no sediment despite being predicted to be connected according to p c the lack of generation as predicted with rusle indicates the magnitude of connectivity is in fact weak on some landscape units such that sediment contribution from these areas is negligible and can be classified as disconnected following the criteria definition of heckmann et al 2018 wohl et al 2019 and ali et al 2018 we present results from determining event p c with and without considering feedbacks between the models referred to as initial calibration and final calibration in table 6 notably considering the feedback between the models and iterative calibration caused a reduction in overall connectivity for all events the result ranges from 0 1 to 13 8 reduction in connectivity which is relatively high considering final connectivity ranges from 2 9 to 22 4 this result and need for feedbacks between sediment generation and connectivity estimates is corroborated by recent sentiment in the literature and highlights the importance of considering not only the boolean connectivity processes e g fryirs 2013 but also the magnitude or continuity of connectivity grant et al 2017 wohl et al 2019 the model evaluation results of this study point out the researcher should use caution when coupling connectivity and erosion formula because parameters of the two model types are not necessarily independent in the present study the process of terracing impacts both erosion formula in the empirical rusle model and net connectivity estimates for predicting the erodible surface area of the basin we may have under predicted watershed erosion without this consideration however iterative calibration allowed us to account for dependence of the models on one another as permeations of coupled connectivity and erosion models develop in future years researchers should at the same time develop new evaluation procedures with qualitative and quantitative checks and balances to correct for unforeseen problems from model co dependency the efficacy of coupling connectivity theory and sediment modelling is corroborated by recent findings from zhao et al 2020 who independently from this study coupled rusle with the index of connectivity ic to predict sediment yield similar to vigiak et al 2012 zhao et al 2020 transformed the ic using a boltzmann type sigmoid function to represent potential sediment delivery ratios from landscape units the formulation was evaluated to perform well and qualitatively validates the approach presented here we emphasize several important differences however between the study of zhao et al 2020 and the work presented herein namely the ic used to represent connectivity is treated quasi statically ic is calculated once for a simulation in 1990 and once for a simulation in 2010 and thus only captures aspects of structural connectivity e g heckmann et al 2018 the ability of the ic framework to rapidly assess connectivity elements is noteworthy given that recently developed geospatial toolboxes allow the ic to be calculated for a catchment on the order of several hours of simulation time crema and cavalli 2018 however ic is recognized to only capture elements of structural connectivity due to the morphologic configuration of the watershed heckmann et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020a b consideration of functional connectivity is particularly meaningful when simulating sediment transport at relatively shorter timescales e g event daily and for small yet still important hydrologic events as will be shown later in the results and as highlighted in mahoney et al 2018 2020a b incorporation of functional connectivity elements is one limitation of the current ic approach as emphasized by a number of researchers e g bracken et al 2013 heckmann et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020a b however recent developments from gay et al 2016 kalantari et al 2017 and several others present promise for coupling the ic with functional elements additionally coupling elements of the probability of connectivity framework presented here and the ic may serve to better incorporate functional processes within the ic 4 2 event p c results connectivity and disconnectivity in appalachian forests and minelands results highlight behavior of event based connectivity in the whitaker branch watershed p c results vary between 2 9 connected event 8 and 22 4 connected event 5 at the watershed scale see table 6 this implies that 2 9 of the catchment and 22 4 of the catchment actively contribute sediment to the stream network during respective events ambroise 2004 mahoney et al 2018 p c varied greatly between land uses throughout the 12 events namely p c ranged from 34 4 to 57 1 in the reclaimed mine μ 46 8 σ 8 1 and 1 0 34 9 in the forested land μ 12 1 σ 9 8 see table 5 we attribute the high percentages of connectivity in the reclaimed mine to increased runoff production and hence energy available to transport sediment caused by compaction of soils during reclamation processes predicting the most connected pathways across the landscape was a notable result of this study and our spatially explicit p c results highlight morphologic pathways most sensitive to hydrologic activity in the whitaker branch watershed figs 5 and 6 specifically our results indicate that landscape units within the reclaimed mine are connected during hydrologic events of low magnitude and remain connected during events of increased hydrologic magnitude see fig 5a d events shown in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 are approximately representative of minimum event 8 25 quartile event 12 75 quartile event 1 and maximum event 5 p c results within the forest we find that only areas with large upstream contributing area within close proximity to the stream network are connected during events with low hydrologic magnitude see fig 5a and table 2 and forest hillslopes only become connected during high magnitude events fig 5d low connectivity on forested hillslopes in low and moderate events is attributed to the high infiltration rates in forest soils due to soil texture and macropores khan and ormsbee 1989 in contrast connectivity occurs on both flat and steep reclaimed mine surfaces with variable upstream contributing areas during events with low hydrologic activity see fig 5a the connectivity of reclaimed mines is attributed to runoff generation during low and moderate events because of the high bulk density measured for the compacted reclaimed mine sites acton et al 2011 we classify the landscape units within the reclaimed mine as highly sensitive active pathways for this watershed since they are connected in much greater proportions and more frequently than forested hillslopes morphologic features promoting connectivity can be seen visually for both land cover types using orthophotos gradient models and our connectivity results fig 6 as shown morphology causing connectivity in both the forest and reclaimed mine land include 1 concentrated flow paths on steep surfaces in the forestland fig 6a 2 steep hillslopes between historic terracing fig 6b and 3 surfaces throughout the reclaimed mine fig 6c disconnectivity of the landscape was another important result of this study and spatially explicit results also highlight morphologic buffers that disconnect sediments and impede sediment transport throughout the watershed see fig 6a c fryirs 2013 we examine disconnectivity in fig 6 during the event with highest hydrologic activity event 5 which highlights impedances due to structural watershed properties as opposed to impedances from functional hydrologic variability e g runoff depth or soil moisture content thus highlighting the upper limit of connectivity in the watershed fig 6a indicates that even on the steepest surfaces sediment connectivity seldom occurs in forested hillslopes the prevalence of disconnectivity on these hillslopes is attributed to relatively high sand content of the soil texture and infiltration capacity of the soil these soil drainage characteristics limit runoff generation and fluid energy to detach and transport sediment despite the steep hillslope gradient i e average gradient 0 51 m m 1 other morphologic features influencing disconnectivity on forested hillslopes include microtopography created from exposed tree roots and tree fall which promotes localized pockets of very flat slopes e g 0 10 decreasing fluid transport capacity also fig 6b highlights disconnectivity due to historic terracing found throughout the watershed locally flat swaths see fig 6b slope occur in contours throughout forested hillslopes and decrease overland fluid energy available to detach and transport sediment we find that terraces particularly impacted the probability of downstream sediment transport p t h d o w n and cause localized regions where deposition is likely disconnected landscape across the reclaimed mine was found to occur near ridgelines and locally flat areas created during reclamation see fig 6c disconnectivity near ridgelines occurs because with very little upstream contributing area is available to accumulate water and produce shearing able to erode sediment disconnectivity of flat contours occurs because spoil is placed in lifts during surface mine reclamation e g skousen and zipper 2014 each lift is constructed with near constant gradient with a slope length on the order of 50 m in this study and the lifts are compacted in place in between lifts a near zero gradient berm of spoil is compacted across the contour and is between 5 and 10 m wide these berms cause disconnectivity across the mining landscape 4 3 functional and structural controls on p c event variability of p c sub processes highlights structural and functional behavior that controls connectivity throughout the whitaker branch watershed sub process connectivity probabilities for the whitaker branch watershed are shown in fig 7a we find that generally functional connectivity associated with the probability of hydrologic detachment p d h controls overall probability of connectivity results in the forest and the whitaker branch watershed as a whole see fig 7a and b p d h limits p c during all events at and below the 75 quartile event 1 8 12 which indicates that detachment processes control sediment transport and connectivity across most surfaces in the whitaker branch watershed physically this result is related to the very high infiltration rates in most soils in the whitaker branch watershed which limits runoff production and hence sediment detachment only during the event with most extreme hydrologic activity event 5 did p d h not limit overall connectivity we notice similar trends in forest sub process probabilities see fig 7b which is to be expected considering forest land covers 94 of the watershed our results indicate notably different processes control the behavior of sediment connectivity in the reclaimed mine and the structural control and to a lesser degree the functional control associated with the probability of hydrologic transport and detachment respectively play a role in the minelands fig 7c in nearly all events the structurally dependent probability of downstream hydrologic transport p t h d w n is the limiting connectivity sub process indicating that structural watershed variables e g slope stream density limit connectivity in the reclaimed mine as opposed to functional variability e g soil moisture content runoff generation one reason that this occurs is because soil texture disturbance reduces infiltration rates such that storms frequently produce relatively large runoff volumes compared to the surrounding forest this results in elevated energy to detach and transport sediment manifested within the model by increased probability of functional sub processes p d h and p t h u p thus reducing functional control over p c results our findings add to an existing discussion of structural and functional control of connectivity in other watersheds and specifically our results relax the notion that functional dynamic processes control sediment connectivity in all landscapes bracken et al 2015 mahoney et al 2018 rather based on our review and experiences structural connectivity shows the dominant control on connectivity for steep basins and or during high magnitude hydrologic events when runoff production is high functional connectivity becomes more and more controlling on net connectivity for lower gradient basins well drained landscapes and or low and moderate hydrologic events for example application of both the probability of connectivity and index of connectivity methods showed the importance of the dominant structural control for high magnitude events in the comparison by mahoney et al 2020a results of this basin show the importance of structural control for the steep whitaker branch catchment and structural control showing differences between land cover types see fig 8 functional control associated with p t h u p seldom limits p c in the whitaker branch watershed likely because i soil moisture is relatively high in the catchment promoting low critical slope thresholds to initiate erosion and ii the steep slopes throughout the watershed easily overcome critical slope thresholds necessary to initiate rill or gully development on the other hand recent study has shown the importance of functional controls for lower gradient basins and lower magnitude events mahoney et al 2018 found in the upper south elkhorn watershed 65 1 km2 a gently rolling catchment average slope 0 07 m m 1 in central kentucky that sediment connectivity is generally controlled by the functional probability of upstream transport p t h u p which is a function of soil moisture content slope and upstream contributing area soils within the upper south elkhorn are primarily silt loams and produce large runoff volumes during events thus promoting detachment of sediment the relatively flat slopes of the upper south elkhorn lack energy required to overcome critical slopes requisite of rill and gully development explaining the control of p t h u p on connectivity in the upper south elkhorn 4 4 coupled p c and rusle model reveals connectivity and sediment loss rates our coupled p c and rusle model indicates that sediment yield from the reclaimed mine is nearly two times the amount of sediment yield from the forest during the simulation period see table 5 this result is significant because the reclaimed mine makes up only 6 0 of the whitaker branch watershed we find that soil loss rates a throughout the reclaimed mine are approximately 30 times greater than the forest land we emphasize that this rate is normalized across the entire surface of the whitaker branch watershed see eqs 19 and 20 as opposed to surfaces where erosion actually occurs see eqs 21 and 22 when only considering soil loss on connected surfaces ac soil loss rates increase by nearly an order of magnitude in the forest land use and by a factor of two in the reclaimed mine see table 5 increased simulated soil loss rates result from connected surfaces occurring on average on 12 1 of the forest land use and 46 8 of the reclaimed mine we emphasize this result because ac soil loss rates are likely more realistic of soil loss occurring in the whitaker branch watershed from a management standpoint this result highlights pathways that should be targeted for remediation within the watershed mahoney et al 2018 found that approximately 90 of sediment is transported in during events with greater than 3 connectivity which gives us confidence that this analysis captures the majority of important sediment transport events during 2007 spatially explicit p c and rusle modeling extends our view of sediment transport in the whitaker branch watershed and highlights connected pathways that produce the most sediment in the watershed see fig 9 in the four events presented in fig 9 soil loss rates within the reclaimed mine are greater than rates in the forest this result highlights that the pathways most sensitive to connectivity are also pathways that contribute the greatest soil loss rates spatially explicit results of the coupled p c and rusle model also highlight areas that are predicted to be connected but ultimately produce little sediment see for example fig 5d and fig 9d in particular we find that forested regions of the watershed north of whitaker branch are predicted to be connected fig 5d yet produce zero or near zero soil loss implying disconnectivity fig 9d we attribute this result to particularly rocky soils located throughout the forested hillslopes that increases effective critical shear stress of the soil and reduces potential for soil loss this result highlights the importance of considering connectivity s magnitude in addition to the extent of connectivity during connectivity simulations fryirs 2013 bracken et al 2015 wohl et al 2017 recent reclamation literature suggests that in addition to detrimentally impacting rainfall and runoff infiltration processes excessive compaction of reclaimed soils reduces rates of native tree growth and promotes growth of short rooted grasses acton et al 2011 our spatially explicit results highlight that connectivity occurs frequently and soil loss rates are greatest within the reclaimed mine angel et al 2005 has suggested that one strategy to improve soil stabilization and regrowth of native trees on reclaimed mines is to compact soils and leave approximately 1 m of relatively loose spoil on top of compacted surface now known as the forestry reclamation approach fra williamson and barton 2020 this method limits mass wasting and recreates soil conditions akin to forested land uses related to the results herein we suggest that this method likely decreases sediment connectivity and soil loss in the reclaimed mine because reestablishment of native trees and recreation of surface microtopography increases interception and infiltration of precipitation and runoff we plotted event soil loss against probability of connectivity results see fig 10 and noticed a positive linear trend for both the forest r2 0 95 and reclaimed mine r2 0 55 implying a strong relationship exists between connectivity and soil loss relationships between soil loss and connectivity in the forest and reclaimed mine show trends of self similarity which implies that in steep watersheds probability of connectivity might be a predictor of normalized soil loss based on land use our results that p c is a good predictor of sediment yield agrees with findings from vigiak et al 2012 who found that calibrated hillslope sediment delivery ratio hsdr a function of the index of connectivity borselli et al 2008 was well correlated with specific sediment yield vigiak et al 2012 linked hsdr and ic and found hsdr predicted specific sediment yield well however it is noteworthy that this result contrasts findings from mahoney et al 2018 and mahoney et al 2020a b where probability of connectivity was poorly related to soil loss and sediment yield r2 0 26 and r2 0 007 respectively this is because connectivity simulations presented in mahoney et al 2018 2020a b were conducted in the much flatter upper south elkhorn watershed we find that sub processes controlling connectivity vary in the whitaker branch and upper south elkhorn watershed specifically in the whitaker branch watershed the probability of hydrologic detachment p d h a function of runoff depth and slope controls p c results variability of soil loss a as determined by rusle is also largely a function of event rainfall and runoff which may explain the good relationship this contrasts the upper south elkhorn where p c is largely controlled by p t h u p which implies that such self similarity is only realized in certain systems with very steep slopes where rill and gully development does not control sediment transport 5 conclusion the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the coupled probability of connectivity and rusle model simulates sediment transport on forested and reclaimed mine hillslopes well however unforeseen dependencies between connectivity formulae and rusle need to be accounted for for example the p factor in rusle was codependent with p c and the p factor needed to be held at unity to account for dependence when coupling the models we suggest future coupled models of connectivity and rusle should consider incorporating feedback calibration schemes as was carried out in this study to resolve potential overlap and discrepancies between connectivity modelling and rusle modelling 2 the coupled p c and rusle model tended to predict sediment transport well in this system that being said the p c model treats deposition in a rather implicit manner i e parameterization of buffers through field assessment a flatter downstream gradient classifying a given cell as disconnected rather than an explicitly including a deposition formula in each cell of the upland model per our analyses of the rouse number this treatment is justified for the conditions of this study however explicit treatment of deposition could be improved upon in our sediment connectivity formula and this has been an area of research for our group 3 our understanding of sediment transport on steep hillslopes with forest and mining land uses was advanced because an unforeseen impact of legacy terracing controlled both sediment connectivity and soil loss legacy terracing following historic deforestation in forested land and subsequent surface mining activities in the reclaimed minelands created disconnectivity throughout the basin disconnectivity was also predicted to occur because of soil macropores and the high sand content of soils that increase infiltration rates in forested land and because of constructed berms between compacted spoil lifts on reclaimed mine surfaces results show on average 12 of the drainage area of appalachian forests was connected during hydrologic events and 47 of the drainage area of reclaimed minelands was connected connectivity was prevalent in concentrated flow paths in both land types 4 structural control tended to dominate connectivity in this study and soil loss and connectivity are self similar the structural control results are contrary to the notion that functional dynamic processes control sediment connectivity in all landscapes summarizing in the context of other published studies suggests structural control dominates connectivity for steep basins with high runoff and functional connectivity becomes more and more controlling for lower gradient basins well drained landscapes or low to moderate hydrologic events self similarity between soil loss and connectivity implies that in steep watersheds probability of connectivity might be a predictor of normalized soil loss based on land use this topic remains somewhat open because one recent study agrees with our findings but others suggest the probability of connectivity can be poorly correlated with soil loss and sediment yield in some basins 5 the soil loss rates of the reclaimed mine are approximately 30 times greater than the forest land despite the fact that the reclamation is classified as phase 3 soil loss rates that consider spatially explicit connectivity are on average an order of magnitude higher in the forested land use and double in the reclaimed mine compared to analyses that assume lumped contributions from land uses from a management perspective spatially explicit results highlight pathways that should be targeted for remediation reforestation has been promoted in the region and this study supports the idea that reforestation will likely decrease sediment connectivity and soil loss in the reclaimed mine because reestablishment of native trees and recreation of surface microtopography increases interception and infiltration of precipitation and runoff credit authorship
