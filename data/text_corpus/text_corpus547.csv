introduction hot extremes have become more frequent and intensive across most land regions since the 1950s which is considered a direct consequence of human induced climate change ipcc 2021 when the earth s surface emits longwave radiation some is absorbed by greenhouse gases ghg and re emitted in all directions in the atmosphere consequently increasing ghg warms the earth s surface and the lower atmosphere fig 1 a as a result the frequency of hot extremes increases with an increase in global mean temperature superposed by interannual fluctuations in addition local soil moisture conditions strongly influence the partitioning of net radiation on a surface into the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux fig 1 b a deficit in soil moisture can reduce the latent heat flux leading to less

atmosphere coupling pathway investigated in this study their effects via dynamic atmospheric circulations which are beyond the influence of human activities are not the focus of this study there are a variety of indices developed in previous studies for characterising different properties of hot extremes such as the number of days with daily maximum temperature higher than 35 c the number of days with daily mean temperature higher than 90th percentile alexander et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 perkins and alexander 2013 these indices are absolute threshold based or percentile based which provide useful information for evaluating the duration and severity of hot extremes a percentile based index is adopted in this study as mueller and seneviratne 2012 suggested that it is more comparable than threshold based indices across different climatic regions the lack of continuous soil moisture observations in both time and space is a major impediment in investigating soil moisture climate

model derived soil moisture displayed a comparable coupling strength with hot extremes as the spi the strength of the relationship appeared to be weaker when remotely sensed surface soil moisture was used the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived terrestrial water storage tws provides data on water storage including groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice andrew et al 2017a showed that a discrete wavelet decomposition method is capable of partitioning the total water storage into shallow and deep components based on this approach andrew et al 2017b investigated large scale vegetation responses to monthly moisture storage represented by decomposed grace tws at different frequencies they reported that grassland dominated areas were more sensitive to higher frequency signals of tws time series while deeper rooted vegetation e g forests was more sensitive to moisture storage changes of longer time scales these findings imply the possibility of using

moisture and hot extreme occurrences on a global scale and based on the developed methodology 2 to investigate the relative importance of the global temperature change and local moisture deficit in influencing hot extreme occurrences 2 methodology 2 1 data and metrics 2 1 1 nhd calculation and data sources in this study the number of hot days in the hottest month nhd is used to represent hot extremes which is defined following mueller and seneviratne 2012 as the number of hot days with daily maximum 2 m air temperature above the 90th percentile of the period 1985 2015 as a time window of five days centered on each day of the 31 year period is considered the 90th percentile is calculated from 155 daily values e g to determine if a 15th june is a hot day the 90th percentile is based on all days of 13th 17th june in the 31 years the hottest month is determined for each grid cell based on the monthly average daily maximum temperature for the time series during 1985 2015 its geographical distribution is shown in fig 2 the temperature data as well as monthly latent heat flux and net radiation data used to calculate the evaporative fraction are from the recent era5 global reanalysis hersbach et al 2019 2 1 2 global mean temperature data annual global mean land surface air temperature hansen et al 2013 data are available from nasa goddard institute for space studies giss it represents the global temperature change including both variability and trend of global mean temperature 2 1 3 wavelet decomposed grace tws a reconstructed grace tws dataset humphrey et al 2017 from 1985 to 2015 provided by the institute for atmospheric and climate science eidgenössische technische hochschule zurich iac eth is used in this study this grace tws dataset has been decomposed into approximate a1 a2 a3 a4 and detail d1 d2 d3 d4 components by a discrete wavelet decomposition method following andrew et al 2017a the approximate and detail components are the coefficients resulting from the convolution of the original tws signal with a low pass filter and a high pass filter respectively bruce et al 2002 nalley et al 2012 the structure of wavelet decomposition is shown in fig 3 taking a grid cell in australia 30 5 s 130 5 e as an example the sum of an approximate series and the corresponding detail components equals the raw signal e g raw signal d1 d2 a2 d1 d2 d3 a3 each decomposition level represents a specific time scale d1 2 month d2 4 month d3 8 month and a4 and d4 16 month those decomposed components of different temporal scales reflect moisture dynamics dominant at different depths this is based on the understanding that soil moisture at various depths has different response time to the climate system andrew et al 2017a chen et al 2019 deep soil moisture responds more slowly to the climate system and has much longer residence time than shallow soil moisture thus it is possible that moisture storage with response timescales of several months could impact energy balance partitioning at the land surface the original grace tws data from 2003 to 2016 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2019 provided by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl are also used to compare with the reconstructed grace tws on their derived relationships with hot extreme occurrences 2 1 4 soil moisture proxies for relating the variability in nhd to soil moisture spi calculated from gpcc reanalysis precipitation data schneider et al 2015 and a land surface model derived soil moisture product gldas noah10 m 2 1 rodell et al 2004 rui 2011 are chosen to compare with grace tws the 3 month spi characterising precipitation deficits accumulated in the previous two months together with the hottest month itself mckee et al 1993 is applied since soil moisture in the hottest month includes contributions from infiltration of precipitation in previous months the gldas model derived soil moisture 0 1 m is also standardised into a standard normal distribution using the same methodology as in vidal et al 2010 and hirschi et al 2014 where a 3 month time scale is applied in this case to be consistent with the applied time scale of spi this standardised gldas model derived soil moisture is expressed as gldas noah θ hereafter therefore the correlation between these two soil moisture proxies and nhd can reflect the influence of antecedent soil moisture conditions on hot extremes in the hottest month grace tws are correlated with nhd in the concurrent month as it reflects the result of slow changes in water storage over a period all the soil moisture proxies are calculated on a monthly basis and then the metrics in the hottest month are used to examine the relationship between nhd and soil moisture θ nhd relationship a 1 1 spatial resolution is adopted for all datasets used in this study 2 2 statistical analysis methods 2 2 1 correlation analysis relationships between nhd and soil moisture are examined by the pearson linear correlation the t test statistic is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the correlation coefficient r for testing the linear relationship between time series grid datasets erroneous rejection of the null hypothesis inevitably happens at individual grid cells for several reasons as described in wilks 2016 leading to the false discovery of significant relationships to address this problem the threshold for significant p values typically 0 05 should be adjusted to control the false discovery rate fdr this adjustment is made based on the distribution of p values of all grid cells and a prescribed parameter αfdr which controls the level of the fdr an αfdr of 0 1 2αglobal where αglobal 0 05 should be used for gridded atmospheric data as it often has a strong spatial correlation wilks 2016 after this adjustment the threshold values for testing significant linear relationships are 0 0241 for nhd spi 0 0250 for nhd gldas noah θ 0 0191 for nhd tws and 0 0347 for tws evaporative fraction ef 2 2 2 dominance analysis stepwise multiple linear regression draper and smith 1998 clow 2010 is used to determine the significant 5 significance level assessed by an f test predictor variables in explaining nhd temporal variability for each grid cell the explanatory power is estimated by the coefficient of determination r2 next the dominance analysis approach azen and budescu 2003 is applied to compare the relative importance of those selected variables the total variance among a set of predictors can be fully partitioned by dominance analysis even if the predictors are correlated vize et al 2019 the collinearity among predictors is addressed by examining the unique variance accounted for by the predictor across all possible regression sub models involving the predictor dominance analysis is completed through an exhaustive set of pairwise comparisons among the predictors the comparisons can be examined by three types of dominance complete dominance conditional dominance and general dominance nimon and oswald 2013 to be completely dominant a predictor must account for a greater amount of outcome variance than another predictor for every sub model the conditional dominance of different predictors is conditional on what sub model level is being examined we applied the general dominance in this study which is determined by taking the average amount of variance accounted for by a predictor across all sub models and comparing it to other predictors general dominance weights can be calculated for each predictor in a set and represent the relative proportion of r2 attributable to a predictor 3 results and discussion 3 1 global θ nhd relationship based on decomposed tws correlations between nhd and each of spi gldas noah θ and tws during 1985 2015 are compared in figs 4 a c similar spatial patterns of a global θ nhd relationship are observed strong θ nhd relationships occur in most of the americas europe australia south africa east asia and southeast asia which cover almost all the areas with strong land atmosphere coupling as identified in previous studies e g koster et al 2006 miralles et al 2012 schwingshackl et al 2017 donat et al 2017 chen et al 2019 significant negative correlations between nhd and spi are observed for 25 5 of the land area while nhd and gldas noah θ are significantly correlated for 17 8 of the land area this difference may be due to that spi being used as a soil moisture proxy reflects its influence on air temperature by soil moisture dependent latent heat processes evaporation and transpiration in addition to that it may reflect precipitation and air temperature coupling through weather systems e g evaporation of rainwater draws heat out of the near surface air rooney et al 2018 the total area with a significant θ nhd relationship increases from 21 7 when the total terrestrial water storage is used to 29 9 when the optimal decomposed tws component at each grid cell is correlated to nhd figs 4 c d this is likely because a part of the terrestrial water storage is not directly accessible for evapotranspiration from all soil moisture proxies the decomposed grace tws covers the largest land area with a significant negative correlation with nhd figs 4 a d it should be noted that only one tws sub component the one that has the largest r with nhd is used for fig 4 d which sub component is used here can be seen in fig s1 the sum of all decomposed tws components involved in the tws nhd coupling is expected to have higher explanatory power for nhd temporal variability over a larger area the global θ nhd relationship results shown in fig 4 are based on the reconstructed grace tws dataset 1985 2015 we did the same analysis for the original grace tws data from 2003 to 2016 for comparison and the results are shown in fig s2 based on the 14 year data strong θ nhd relationships are also spatially distributed in most of the americas europe australia south africa east asia and southeast asia in addition the decomposed tws fig s2 d shows a significant correlation with nhd over a larger area than spi fig s2 a and gldas noah θ fig s2 b although the period of available original grace tws data is relatively short at present its contribution to this and related research will increase with the accumulation and improved resolution of grace tws data in the future a correlation analysis is not supposed to directly reflect a causal relationship between hot extremes and soil moisture deficit however in this study the spi the standardised model derived soil moisture and tws can reflect the antecedent soil moisture conditions that influence hot extremes in the hottest month thus the θ nhd relationship examined in fig 4 is more likely to reflect the feedback of dry primarily root zone soil to the atmosphere in addition the correlation between tws and the evaporative fraction latent heat net radiation is relatively stronger in regions with significant negative θ nhd correlation such as parts of the americas and asia south africa west europe southeast asia and australia fig 5 this implies that local moisture limitation in those regions results in a higher portion of available energy partitioning towards sensible heat flux and consequently increases the likelihood of hot extreme occurrences indeed it has already been suggested that hot extremes in europe hirschi et al 2011 australia herold et al 2016 and parts of the americas and south africa mueller and seneviratne 2012 are amplified by soil moisture deficit fig 6 shows the explanatory power reflected by the regression r2 of different soil moisture proxies for nhd variability 1985 2015 the result is consistent with what is shown in fig 4 that spi has stronger explanatory power for nhd variability for a larger land area than gldas noah θ the decomposed tws shows the highest r2 among all soil moisture proxies for testing the improvement of the decomposed tws compared to the raw tws in explaining the nhd variability the adjusted r2 is applied which considers the total number of explanatory variables up to 5 for the decomposed tws vs 1 for other proxies by including a penalty for having additional variables in the regression analysis it shows that with the discrete wavelet decomposition over 61 8 of the land areas show a higher adjusted r2 than that of raw tws this result sheds light on the potential of decomposed grace tws for hot extreme prediction the correlations between nhd and moisture at shallower d1 d2 d3 and deeper d4 a4 soil depths represented by wavelet decomposition levels of tws are compared in figs 7 a and b although the r values are relatively low it is sufficient for the comparison purposes compared to d4 a4 d1 d3 shows a higher correlation with nhd in parts of asia and europe those regions are reported to have relatively shallower plant rooting depth fan et al 2017 where near surface temperature has a relatively shorter response time to soil moisture changes than that of regions with deeper rooted vegetation the central part of north america the northeastern part of south america and the northwestern part of southeast asia are reported to have deeper plant rooting depths fan et al 2017 where interannual variability d4 and a4 of tws seems to be more important than its seasonal variability d1 d3 in explaining nhd temporal variability this implies that plant water uptake from deeper soil plays an essential role in θ nhd coupling in those regions however d4 a4 also show a stronger correlation than d1 d2 d3 with nhd in areas without deep rooted vegetation including the northern and southeastern parts of south america and parts of southeast asia this could be explained by the shallow groundwater table depth in those regions fan et al 2013 it implies that in areas where groundwater is shallow groundwater dependent ecosystems may contribute to hot extreme mitigation which is worthy of future investigation 3 2 relative importance of global temperature change and local moisture deficit for nhd variability the long term underlying increasing trend in nhd seems to be a consequence of increasing global mean temperature fig 8 compared to the relationships between nhd versus different soil moisture proxies shown in fig 4 significant correlations are observed in larger areas when the trends in nhd and soil moisture proxies have been removed fig s3 this implies that the trend and interannual variability in nhd might be respectively resulting from increasing global mean temperature and natural variability in the climate system i e interannual variability in soil moisture therefore this study aims to reveal which factor global temperature change or local moisture deficit is more important in influencing hot extreme occurrence during 1985 2015 the decomposed tws is adopted to represent soil moisture in the dominance analysis the results are mapped in fig 9 only the grid cells where the total explanatory power of global mean temperature and decomposed tws is over 95 significance level are highlighted in blue if the dominant analysis results show that the global temperature change is more important than soil moisture deficit in influencing nhd variability in a grid cell it is marked by a red cross symbol on top of the blue hot extreme occurrences in the grey areas are not significantly associated with either global mean temperature or soil moisture during the study period 1985 2015 in almost all the previously identified regions with strong land moisture and air temperature coupling including the northern areas of south america the southern regions of north america south africa west europe parts of east asia and australia local moisture deficit shows very strong explanatory power for nhd temporal variability fig 9 it appears that local moisture deficit played a more important role than global temperature change in influencing the hot extreme occurrences for 38 2 of the land area during 1985 2015 fig 9 areas where moisture deficit is more important than global temperature change in influencing the occurrence of hot extremes tend to be flat with thick soils such as the north american great plain the west siberian plain and the north china plain or have relatively larger inter annual rainfall variability such as india australia south africa and the eastern tip of brazil fatichi et al 2012 in these areas influences of soil moisture variability on hot extremes may be mediated by vegetation chen et al 2021 thus adaptive land and vegetation management may contribute to mitigating the moisture deficit exacerbated hot extremes from 1985 to 2015 for 23 8 of the land area global temperature change played a more important role than local moisture deficit in influencing the occurrence of hot extremes fig 9 those areas are more likely located in dry regions e g the sahara mountain ranges e g the andes in south america the rockies in north america and plateaus e g the brazilian plateau and the mongolian plateau where interannual variability of root zone moisture is likely small due to water deficiency steep topography and or low temperature other factors such as coupled atmosphere ocean phenomena e g lorenzo and mantua 2016 and land use changes e g luo and lau 2017 may have a stronger influence on hot extreme occurrence in some regions the coupled atmosphere ocean phenomena were not considered in this study because they are beyond the influence of human activities since land use changes such as changes in vegetation coverage and urbanisation can influence local soil moisture conditions further distinguishing and quantifying the relative contribution of land use changes and soil moisture deficit in influencing hot extremes are worthy of future investigation based on the data from 1985 to 2015 this study reveals that local moisture deficit played a more important role in influencing hot extreme occurrences in a total area 1 6 times as large as that of the areas where the global temperature change has posed a stronger influence regional adaptive land management is suggested to mitigate the moisture deficit exacerbating hot extremes however as the ghg forcing is continually increasing the warmer earth is expected to continue the increasing trend in the nhd furthermore a continuous increase in global mean temperature can also result in regional decreasing trends in soil moisture during the hottest month and consequently exerts indirect effects on nhd hence global measures for reducing emissions are essential in combating the current and future expansion of hot extremes 4 conclusions this study identifies which factor global temperature change or local moisture deficit is more important in influencing the temporal occurrence of hot extremes on a global scale from 1985 to 2015 in parts of the americas africa and asia the occurrence of hot extremes was more sensitive to global temperature change than in other areas most of those regions are mountain ranges e g the andes plateaus e g the brazilian plateau and deserts e g sahara local moisture deficit played a more important role in influencing hot extreme occurrences in regions with a total area 1 6 times as large as the area strongly influenced by the global temperature change during the 31 year period investigated here which is an important new realisation these regions i e north america west europe australia southeast asia and south africa previously identified as having strong land atmosphere coupling appear to possess clear moisture deficit hot extreme links the moisture deficit sensitive regions share some common characteristics such as relatively flat topography thick soil and large inter annual rainfall variability in those regions mitigation of some hot extremes might be possible by addressing the moisture deficit e g by adaptive land management the noise from natural climate variability appeared to be an important factor in influencing the occurrence of nhd in larger areas than that of the signal from rising global mean temperature within the 31 year period of the analysis however under a continuing increase of ghg forcing global measures for reducing emissions are essential in combating the current and future expansion of hot extremes the dominance analysis approach is applied to quantify the relative importance of global temperature change and local moisture deficit to the occurrence of hot extremes during 1985 2015 for the first time the application of decomposed grace tws in estimating the global distribution of hot extremes is presented it shows larger areas with significant θ nhd relationships and higher regression r2 in examining the occurrence of hot extremes than the selected commonly used soil moisture proxies spi and the gldas noah soil moisture data it suggests the potential of decomposed grace tws as a useful soil moisture proxy in examining the coupling

in nhd to soil moisture spi calculated from gpcc reanalysis precipitation data schneider et al 2015 and a land surface model derived soil moisture product gldas noah10 m 2 1 rodell et al 2004 rui 2011 are chosen to compare with grace tws the 3 month spi characterising precipitation deficits accumulated in the previous two months together with the hottest month itself mckee et al 1993 is applied since soil moisture in the hottest month includes contributions from infiltration of precipitation in previous months the gldas model derived soil moisture 0 1 m is also standardised into a standard normal distribution using the same methodology as in vidal et al 2010 and hirschi et al 2014 where a 3 month time scale is applied in this case to be consistent with the applied time scale of spi this standardised gldas model derived soil moisture is expressed as gldas noah θ hereafter therefore the correlation between these two soil moisture proxies and nhd can reflect the influence of antecedent soil moisture conditions on hot extremes in the hottest month grace tws are correlated with nhd in the concurrent month as it reflects the result of slow changes in water storage over a period all the soil moisture proxies are calculated on a monthly basis and then the metrics in the hottest month are used to examine the relationship between nhd and soil moisture θ nhd relationship a 1 1 spatial resolution is adopted for all datasets used in this study 2 2 statistical analysis methods 2 2 1 correlation analysis relationships between nhd and soil moisture are examined by the pearson linear correlation the t test statistic is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the correlation coefficient r for testing the linear relationship between time series grid datasets erroneous rejection of the null hypothesis inevitably happens at individual grid cells for several reasons as described in wilks 2016 leading to the false discovery of significant relationships to address this problem the threshold for significant p values typically 0 05 should be adjusted to control the false discovery rate fdr this adjustment is made based on the distribution of p values of all grid cells and a prescribed parameter αfdr which controls the level of the fdr an αfdr of 0 1 2αglobal where αglobal 0 05 should be used for gridded atmospheric data as it often has a strong spatial correlation wilks 2016 after this adjustment the threshold values for testing significant linear relationships are 0 0241 for nhd spi 0 0250 for nhd gldas noah θ 0 0191 for nhd tws and 0 0347 for tws evaporative fraction ef 2 2 2 dominance analysis stepwise multiple linear regression draper and smith 1998 clow 2010 is used to determine the significant 5 significance level assessed by an f test predictor variables in explaining nhd temporal variability for each grid cell the explanatory power is estimated by the coefficient of determination r2 next the dominance analysis approach azen and budescu 2003 is applied to compare the relative importance of those selected variables the total variance among a set of predictors can be fully partitioned by dominance analysis even if the predictors are correlated vize et al 2019 the collinearity among predictors is addressed by examining the unique variance accounted for by the predictor across all possible regression sub models involving the predictor dominance analysis is completed through an exhaustive set of pairwise comparisons among the predictors the comparisons can be examined by three types of dominance complete dominance conditional dominance and general dominance nimon and oswald 2013 to be completely dominant a predictor must account for a greater amount of outcome variance than another predictor for every sub model the conditional dominance of different predictors is conditional on what sub model level is being examined we applied the general dominance in this study which is determined by taking the average amount of variance accounted for by a predictor across all sub models and comparing it to other predictors general dominance weights can be calculated for each predictor in a set and represent the relative proportion of r2 attributable to a predictor 3 results and discussion 3 1 global θ nhd relationship based on decomposed tws correlations between nhd and each of spi gldas noah θ and tws during 1985 2015 are compared in figs 4 a c similar spatial patterns of a global θ nhd relationship are observed strong θ nhd relationships occur in most of the americas europe australia south africa east asia and southeast asia which cover almost all the areas with strong land atmosphere coupling as identified in previous studies e g koster et al 2006 miralles et al 2012 schwingshackl et al 2017 donat et al 2017 chen et al 2019 significant negative correlations between nhd and spi are observed for 25 5 of the land area while nhd and gldas noah θ are significantly correlated for 17 8 of the land area this difference may be due to that spi being used as a soil moisture proxy reflects its influence on air temperature by soil moisture dependent latent heat processes evaporation and transpiration in addition to that it may reflect precipitation and air temperature coupling through weather systems e g evaporation of rainwater draws heat out of the near surface air rooney et al 2018 the total area with a significant θ nhd relationship increases from 21 7 when the total terrestrial water storage is used to 29 9 when the optimal decomposed tws component at each grid cell is correlated to nhd figs 4 c d this is likely because a part of the terrestrial water storage is not directly accessible for evapotranspiration from all soil moisture proxies the decomposed grace tws covers the largest land area with a significant negative correlation with nhd figs 4 a d it should be noted that only one tws sub component the one that has the largest r with nhd is used for fig 4 d which sub component is used here can be seen in fig s1 the sum of all decomposed tws components involved in the tws nhd coupling is expected to have higher explanatory power for nhd temporal variability over a larger area the global θ nhd relationship results shown in fig 4 are based on the reconstructed grace tws dataset 1985 2015 we did the same analysis for the original grace tws data from 2003 to 2016 for comparison and the results are shown in fig s2 based on the 14 year data strong θ nhd relationships are also spatially distributed in most of the americas europe australia south africa east asia and southeast asia in addition the decomposed tws fig s2 d shows a significant correlation with nhd over a larger area than spi fig s2 a and gldas noah θ fig s2 b although the period of available original grace tws data is relatively short at present its contribution to this and related research will increase with the accumulation and improved resolution of grace tws data in the future a correlation analysis is not supposed to directly reflect a causal relationship between hot extremes and soil moisture deficit however in this study the spi the standardised model derived soil moisture and tws can reflect the antecedent soil moisture conditions that influence hot extremes in the hottest month thus the θ nhd relationship examined in fig 4 is more likely to reflect the feedback of dry primarily root zone soil to the atmosphere in addition the correlation between tws and the evaporative fraction latent heat net radiation is relatively stronger in regions with significant negative θ nhd correlation such as parts of the americas and asia south africa west europe southeast asia and australia fig 5 this implies that local moisture limitation in those regions results in a higher portion of available energy partitioning towards sensible heat flux and consequently increases the likelihood of hot extreme occurrences indeed it has already been suggested that hot extremes in europe hirschi et al 2011 australia herold et al 2016 and parts of the americas and south africa mueller and seneviratne 2012 are amplified by soil moisture deficit fig 6 shows the explanatory power reflected by the regression r2 of different soil moisture proxies for nhd variability 1985 2015 the result is consistent with what is shown in fig 4 that spi has stronger explanatory power for nhd variability for a larger land area than gldas noah θ the decomposed tws shows the highest r2 among all soil moisture proxies for testing the improvement of the decomposed tws compared to the raw tws in explaining the nhd variability the adjusted r2 is applied which considers the total number of explanatory variables up to 5 for the decomposed tws vs 1 for other proxies by including a penalty for having additional variables in the regression analysis it shows that with the discrete wavelet decomposition over 61 8 of the land areas show a higher adjusted r2 than that of raw tws this result sheds light on the potential of decomposed grace tws for hot extreme prediction the correlations between nhd and moisture at shallower d1 d2 d3 and deeper d4 a4 soil depths represented by wavelet decomposition levels of tws are compared in figs 7 a and b although the r values are relatively low it is sufficient for the comparison purposes compared to d4 a4 d1 d3 shows a higher correlation with nhd in parts of asia and europe those regions are reported to have relatively shallower plant rooting depth fan et al 2017 where near surface temperature has a relatively shorter response time to soil moisture changes than that of regions with deeper rooted vegetation the central part of north america the northeastern part of south america and the northwestern part of southeast asia are reported to have deeper plant rooting depths fan et al 2017 where interannual variability d4 and a4 of tws seems to be more important than its seasonal variability d1 d3 in explaining nhd temporal variability this implies that plant water uptake from deeper soil plays an essential role in θ nhd coupling in those regions however d4 a4 also show a stronger correlation than d1 d2 d3 with nhd in areas without deep rooted vegetation including the northern and southeastern parts of south america and parts of southeast asia this could be explained by the shallow groundwater table depth in those regions fan et al 2013 it implies that in areas where groundwater is shallow groundwater dependent ecosystems may contribute to hot extreme mitigation which is worthy of future investigation 3 2 relative importance of global temperature change and local moisture deficit for nhd variability the long term underlying increasing trend in nhd seems to be a consequence of increasing global mean temperature fig 8 compared to the relationships between nhd versus different soil moisture proxies shown in fig 4 significant correlations are observed in larger areas when the trends in nhd and soil moisture proxies have been removed fig s3 this implies that the trend and interannual variability in nhd might be respectively resulting from increasing global mean temperature and natural variability in the climate system i e interannual variability in soil moisture therefore this study aims to reveal which factor global temperature change or local moisture deficit is more important in influencing hot extreme occurrence during 1985 2015 the decomposed tws is adopted to represent soil moisture in the dominance analysis the results are mapped in fig 9 only the grid cells where the total explanatory power of global mean temperature and decomposed tws is over 95 significance level are highlighted in blue if the dominant analysis results show that the global temperature change is more important than soil moisture deficit in influencing nhd variability in a grid cell it is marked by a red cross symbol on top of the blue hot extreme occurrences in the grey areas are not significantly associated with either global mean temperature or soil moisture during the study period 1985 2015 in almost all the previously identified regions with strong land moisture and air temperature coupling including the northern areas of south america the southern regions of north america south africa west europe parts of east asia and australia local moisture deficit shows very strong explanatory power for nhd temporal variability fig 9 it appears that local moisture deficit played a more important role than global temperature change in influencing the hot extreme occurrences for 38 2 of the land area during 1985 2015 fig 9 areas where moisture deficit is more important than global temperature change in influencing the occurrence of hot extremes tend to be flat with thick soils such as the north american great plain the west siberian plain and the north china plain or have relatively larger inter annual rainfall variability such as india australia south africa and the eastern tip of brazil fatichi et al 2012 in these areas influences of soil moisture variability on hot extremes may be mediated by vegetation chen et al 2021 thus adaptive land and vegetation management may contribute to mitigating the moisture deficit exacerbated hot extremes from 1985 to 2015 for 23 8 of the land area global temperature change played a more important role than local moisture deficit in influencing the occurrence of hot extremes fig 9 those areas are more likely located in dry regions e g the sahara mountain ranges e g the andes in south america the rockies in north america and plateaus e g the brazilian plateau and the mongolian plateau where interannual variability of root zone moisture is likely small due to water deficiency steep topography and or low temperature other factors such as coupled atmosphere ocean phenomena e g lorenzo and mantua 2016 and land use changes e g luo and lau 2017 may have a stronger influence on hot extreme occurrence in some regions the coupled atmosphere ocean phenomena were not considered in this study because they are beyond the influence of human activities since land use changes such as changes in vegetation coverage and urbanisation can influence local soil moisture conditions further distinguishing and quantifying the relative contribution of land use changes and soil moisture deficit in influencing hot extremes are worthy of future investigation based on the data from 1985 to 2015 this study reveals that local moisture deficit played a more important role in influencing hot extreme occurrences in a total area 1 6 times as large as that of the areas where the global temperature change has posed a stronger influence regional adaptive land management is suggested to mitigate the moisture deficit exacerbating hot extremes however as the ghg forcing is continually increasing the warmer earth is expected to continue the increasing trend in the nhd furthermore a continuous increase in global mean temperature can also result in regional decreasing trends in soil moisture during the hottest month and consequently exerts indirect effects on nhd hence global measures for reducing emissions are essential in combating the current and future expansion of hot extremes 4 conclusions this study identifies which factor global temperature change or local moisture deficit is more important in influencing the temporal occurrence of hot extremes on a global scale from 1985 to 2015 in parts of the americas africa and asia the occurrence of hot extremes was more sensitive to global temperature change than in other areas most of those regions are mountain ranges e g the andes plateaus e g the brazilian plateau and deserts e g sahara local moisture deficit played a more important role in influencing hot extreme occurrences in regions with a total area 1 6 times as large as the area strongly influenced by the global temperature change during the 31 year period investigated here which is an important new realisation these regions i e north america west europe australia southeast asia and south africa previously identified as having strong land atmosphere coupling appear to possess clear moisture deficit hot extreme links the moisture deficit sensitive regions share some common characteristics such as relatively flat topography thick soil and large inter annual rainfall variability in those regions mitigation of some hot extremes might be possible by addressing the moisture deficit e g by adaptive land management the noise from natural climate variability appeared to be an important factor in influencing the occurrence of nhd in larger areas than that of the signal from rising global mean temperature within the 31 year period of the analysis however under a continuing increase of ghg forcing global measures for reducing emissions are essential in combating the current and future expansion of hot extremes the dominance analysis approach is applied to quantify the relative importance of global temperature change and local moisture deficit to the occurrence of hot extremes during 1985 2015 for the first time the application of decomposed grace tws in estimating the global distribution of hot extremes is presented it shows larger areas with significant θ nhd relationships and higher regression r2 in examining the occurrence of hot extremes than the selected commonly used soil moisture proxies spi and the gldas noah soil moisture data it suggests the potential of decomposed grace tws as a useful soil moisture proxy in examining the coupling

2736,most existing studies do not consider the effect that the deformability of submarine sediments may have on solute transport under the action of ocean waves in this study a two dimensional numerical model based on biot s poro elastic consolidation theory and an advection dispersion equation is established to investigate the transport of non reactive solute into a deformable porous seabed under the influence of ocean waves the numerical model is then validated against experimental and analytical results in order to demonstrate its accuracy and robustness the simulation results indicate that ignoring the deformability of seabed soil and associated seepage force due to ocean waves may lead to a significant underestimation of the rate of solute transport in shallow layers of marine sediment particularly fine sand or silt the effects of parameters such as the shear modulus non dimensional mechanical dispersion coefficient related to particle size and permeability dimensionless sediment thickness wave steepness and the relative water depth have on solute transport into deformable sediments were investigated the results indicate that the ratio of the longitudinal coefficient of mechanical dispersion between deformable and non deformable sediments that can represent the enhancement of solute migration due to soil deformation may reach up to 85 this becomes more pronounced as the shear modulus and permeability of sediments decrease and the depth of water increases when the sediment thickness is less than 0 8 times the wavelength the rate of solute transport in deformable sediments reaches its maximum when the sediment thickness is about 0 2 times the wavelength in fact as the relative water depth increases from 0 1 to 0 3 the enhancement of solute migration due to wave induced soil deformation increases by about 60 80 in comparison to linear waves shallow water waves e g the first order cnoidal waves can increase the transport of solute more due to its strong non linear behaviour particularly in deformable seabed keywords solute transport soil deformation marine sediments progressive waves numerical simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as one of the main parts of the earth s filter system permeable sediments play an important role in nutrient cycling and hosting the bio geochemical process in aquatic environments the exchange of dissolved substances or solutes e g nutrients contaminants and trace metals between sediment and water columns affects the chemical and biological condition of sediments and the benthic primary production falter and sansone 2000 precht et al 2004 higashino and stefan 2011 understanding the process of solute transport in permeable marine sediments is still challenging because oceanic environment is dynamic and the intrinsic behaviour of marine sediment is complicated field observations and a certain number of studies have confirmed that the exchange of solute between permeable sediments and overlying water in estuarine and coastal areas where the sediment is mainly medium or fine sand is greatly enhanced by surface gravity waves especially in areas where the water is less than half the depth of the wavelength harrison et al 1983 malan and mclachlan 1991 oldham and lavery 1999 falter and sansone 2000 precht and huettel 2003 when waves cross obstacles such as biogenic burrows and bed ripples advection could become an important physical mechanism for enhancing the exchange of solute at the interface between water and sediment webb and theodor 1972 shum 1992 huettel and gust 1992 advection due to ripples may penetrate to a depth of several ripple heights below the mudline for a wide range of sediment characteristics and wave conditions shum 1992 however the net transport of solute by advection may be negligible for a flat seabed under regular waves where the displacement of oscillatory pore fluid and the net exchange of interstitial flow through the sediment and water interface may become zero over a wave period due to its cyclic nature precht and huettel 2003 webster 2003 on the other hand the mechanical dispersion or convective diffusion that could be significantly enhanced by the wave induced circular motion of pore flow may become the dominant physical mechanism that enhances the net exchange of solute between the sediment and overlying water column clark et al 2019 qian et al 2008 rutgers van der loeff 1981 webster 2003 webster and taylor 1992 harrison et al 1983 two separate mechanisms for the mechanical dispersion of solute migration induced by progressive waves have been identified one is referred to as rotational dispersion webster and taylor 1992 which mainly occurs at the intersections between pores and is more obvious in sandy sediment with medium or large particles where pore flow is caused by a pressure gradient with a rotating direction in time the other is called shear dispersion webster 2003 which exists in sandy sediment with a wide range of particle size for homogeneous porous media these processes can be modelled using the classical advection dispersion equation ade a fickian based model for solute transport harrison et al 1983 qian et al 2008 feng and michaelides 2009 boufadel et al 2011 guo et al 2014 where the coefficient of dispersion can be expressed as a function of the pore fluid velocity and dispersivity of the porous media this depends on the particle size and packing arrangements etc qian et al 2008 introduced an enhanced dispersion coefficient that varied with depth to propose a vertical dispersion model for solute migration based on the transport of solute in a gravel bed due to standing waves or bedforms using two dimensional 2 d transient ade boufadel et al 2011 applied 2 d ade to simulate the migration of solute in a beach subjected to tides and waves and found they could enhance the pollutant fluxes other researchers used ade to investigate the inertial effects of pore water flow i e the non darcy flow on the exchange of solute through the sediment interface under the influence of waves habel and bagtzoglou 2005 higashino and stefan 2011 they found that non darcy flow only worked for high permeable sediment where the hydraulic conductivity was greater than 0 01 m s however for heterogeneous porous media that may contain low permeability deposits or preferential flow paths the process of solute transport cannot be precisely modelled using the classical ade due to the non fickian or anomalous transport of solute zhang et al 2009 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 zhang et al 2019b mohammadi and mehdinejadiani 2021 to simulate the non fickian transport of solute some non local models for solute transport such as the stochastic averaging of ade sa ade method cushman 1987 the continuous time random walk ctrw method berkowitz et al 2006 the multi rate mass transfer mrmt method haggerty and gorelick 1995 and the fractional advection dispersion equations fades method zhang et al 2009 were developed as a promising technique fractional derivative models for simulating non fickian migration in heterogeneous media can be characterized as three main types i e the spatial fade s fade that can capture super diffusion the temporal t fade that can capture sub diffusion and the tempered spatiotemporal fade st fade that can capture the mixture of sub and super diffusion zhang et al 2019b these studies and many others assumed that the sediment beds were rigid and non deformable and the pore fluid seepage was computed based on the laplace equation in a realistic oceanic environment waves travelling over a porous seabed may lead to a coupled seepage flow and deformation i e when the water is driven into a porous bed the bed itself may withstand the pressure of waves and become deformed investigations into the deformability of seabed soil coupled with the wave induced seepage force were mainly based on biot s poro elastic theory yamamoto 1978 hsu and jeng 1994 jeng and hsu 1996 the results indicated that the pore water pressure may change depending on the thickness and stiffness of the seabed e g the shear modulus as well as the drainage condition of the soil whereas the pore water pressure of a rigid or non deformable seabed was independent of the permeability of the sediment this means that ignoring the coupled effect of soil deformation and seepage flow may lead to an inaccurate estimation of pore water velocity that pertains to the transport of solute in seabed soil unfortunately to the best of the authors knowledge the coupled effect of soil deformation and seepage flow on solute transport has not been considered in any of the existing studies on solute transport in marine sediments under the influence of ocean waves thus far the effect of soil deformation has been incorporated into the classical ade for solute transport in deformable sediments by some references of which most studies investigated the solute migration that occurred in landfill cases by utilising different models for example smith 2000 peters and smith 2002 zhang et al 2012 wu and jeng 2017 and wu et al 2020 investigated solute transport in landfills using one dimensional ade that considered the effect of soil deformation caused by gravitational consolidation zhang and fang 2016 zhang et al 2017 and wu 2020 investigated solute transport in landfills by three dimensional or two dimensional ade that incorporated soil deformation based on biot s consolidation theory however the communication of solute concentrations between transverse and longitudinal directions that may occur during multi directional solute spreading was not considered so this may be a long way away from a realistic situation in this study a 2 d numerical model based on biot s poro elastic theory and classical two dimensional advection dispersion equation ade has been developed to investigate the characteristics of solute transport in a homogeneous deformable seabed driven by ocean waves where the coupled effect of pore water seepage and deformation of the seabed is incorporated into the ade by pore water velocities meanwhile the model considers the interplay of solute transport among different directions the model results with regards to pore water pressures and soil deformation including the transport of solute in non deformable and deformable sediments have been verified against the data available in literature the validated numerical model was then used to investigate the performance of solute transport in a deformable seabed with different stiffness shear modulus and thickness soil particle size and permeability and wave parameters and types of waves compared to a rigid or non deformable seabed 2 theory and numerical model 2 1 description of the physical problem fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the physical problem in this study the deformable porous medium i e seabed material known as sediment or soil is regarded as an isotropic and homogenous three phase mixture of a solid soil skeleton a liquid pore water and a non reactive solute dissolved in the liquid it is assumed that the deformation of soil i e its displacement and strain is small and variations in the void ratio are negligible two sub models are included in the numerical model i e the pore fluid seepage model that considers the coupled effect of soil deformation and pore water pressure and the solute transport model that incorporates the effect that the soil deformation has on the velocity of pore water the computational domain is a saturated sand bed which is supposed to be flat along the direction of wave propagation with a finite thickness h at the surface a periodic cyclic pressure in a sine or cosine distribution is applied by progressive surface waves with a height of h w a water depth of d w a wave period of t w and a wave length of l w the x axis is along the interface of sediment and water and the y axis is upwards bottom of the sediment bed is assumed to be rigid and impermeable an initial solute concentration of c s 0 x y t t 0 0 is allocated within the sediment along the sediment and water interface a constant concentration of c x y t y 0 c 0 is maintained qian et al 2008 higashino and stefan 2011 as shown in fig 1 a the seepage of pore water in sediments occurs when there is a difference in the water head as the wave pressure fluctuates at the sediment surface for a flat seabed subjected to regular periodic and progressive waves the net solute flux that is migrated by advection can be omitted due to the equal pore water fluxes of outflow and inflow through the sediment interface over a period of one wave whereas mechanical dispersion due to wave induced pore water seepage will accelerate the migration of solute in sediment clark et al 2019 webster 2003 harrison et al 1983 as such the solute would be migrated into the sediment by hydrodynamic dispersion i e mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion as shown in fig 1 b 2 2 pore fluid seepage in deformable sediments the consolidation theory for elastic porous media developed by biot 1941 is used to determine the coupled seepage flow and deformation in sediment the two dimensional equations for the force equilibrium of soil and the conservation of pore fluid mass are expressed as follows biot 1941 1 g 2 w x g 1 2 μ ε x p x 2 g 2 w y g 1 2 μ ε y p y 3 k γ w 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 n 0 β p t ε t where w x and w y denote the displacement of soil in the x

the porosity of soil t is time s and k is the hydraulic conductivity m s which can be expressed as bear 1972 boudreau 1997 higashino and stefan 2011 4 k 5 6 10 3 n 0 3 d g 2 g υ 0 1 n 0 2 where dg is the mean particle diameter m g is the gravitational acceleration and υ 0 is the kinematic viscosity of water 1 10 6 m 2 s at 20⁰ ε is the volumetric strain of soil expressed as 5 ε w x x w y y β is the compressibility of pore fluid where the gas is either dissolved in or enclosed in pore water by tiny bubbles it can be expressed as yamamoto 1978 6 β 1 k w 0 1 s r p w 0 where k w 0 is the true bulk modulus of water 2 10 9 n m2 p w 0 is the absolute pore water pressure pa and s r is the degree of soil saturation the components for the seepage velocity of pore fluid can be written as 7 u k n 0 γ w p x v k n 0 γ w p y where u and v are the velocity of pore fluid in the horizontal direction x axis and the vertical direction y axis m s equations 1 3 are the governing equations of biot s consolidation theory where the displacements of soil and pore water pressure are fully coupled and solved synchronously this means the effect that the soil deformation induced by waves has on the seepage velocity of pore fluid can be considered and at the same time the effect that the seepage flow i e the pore water pressure has on soil deformation can also be considered for cases of rigid and non deformable porous media the equation governing the seepage velocity field of pore fluid can be deduced from equation 3 when the volumetric strain of soil is zero and the compressibility of pore fluid is ignored habel and bagtzoglou 2005 i e 8 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 where ϕ is the pore water pressure head m p γ w ϕ 2 3 solute transport in deformable sediments the conservative solute transport follows the law of mass conservation if the sorption of solute onto the solid phase is omitted the two dimensional advection dispersion equation ade in deforming sediments can be written as follows peters and smith 2002 gardiner et al 2007 bear and cheng 2010 9 c t u u s c x v v s c y x d xx c x d xy c y y d yy c y d yx c x 10 d xx d dxx d em d xy d dxy d em d yx d dyx d em d

system for small deformations of a porous medium the main difference between the solute transport equations of a deforming porous medium and a rigid one is reflected as follows firstly the advective terms i e the first and second terms on the right hand side of equation 9 for a deformable porous medium depend not only on the relative fluid velocity i e darcy velocity they also depend on the solid phase velocity secondly the pore fluid velocity used in the ade for a deformable porous medium stems from biot s consolidation equations which considered the coupled effect of soil deformation and pore water pressure therefore the transient soil response and the process of solute transport are semi coupled i e the effect of soil deformation on solute transport in sediments is considered while the transport of solute has no influence on the deformation of soil 2 4 boundary and initial conditions below are the boundary and initial conditions used to solve biot s consolidation equations and the advection dispersion equation in the developed model 1 boundary conditions at the surface of the seabed i e the sediment and water interface y 0 the wave induced pore water pressure is equal to

w x and w y in the studied domain are all zero the initial concentration in the pore water of the sediment is set at zero as shown in fig 1 2 5 numerical implementation the present model involving biot s poro elastic equations and ade was solved numerically via comsol multiphysics a simulation platform that provides fully coupled multi physics and single physics modelling capabilities comsol offers a level of flexibility that enables the user to directly input user defined equations and expressions that describe the coupled or uncoupled physics phenomena in the user interface this equation based modelling in comsol can be realized by the termed pde partial differential equation module a flowchart indicating the process of numerical solution in a comsol environment is shown in fig 2 with regards to solving the pdes the implicit time stepping method i e the backward differentiation formulae bdf is used to find the solution where space is discretised with the finite element method fem it is worth noting that the quadratic lagrange elements have been utilised to discretise the computational domain and the mesh is refined until the solution cannot be influenced by any change in the number of elements with appropriate boundaries and initial conditions as demonstrated above the governing equations 1 3 and 9 for solute transport in a deformable sediment can be solved synchronously and the results for soil displacements pore water pressures velocity field of pore fluid and the solute concentration field can be obtained note that the non deformable or rigid seabed case is also considered as a benchmark in which the pore water pressures pore water velocity field and solute concentration field without the effect of soil deformation can be obtained by solving the governing equations 8 and 9 where the soil velocity is regarded as zero 3 model validations first the soil deformation and solute transport components of the developed model were validated separately using the data available from literature as presented in subsections 3 1 3 3 the numerical model was further validated against experiments for solute transport in deformable sediments under wave loading and gravitational consolidation as presented in subsections 3 4 3 6 3 1 comparison with the analytical solution for wave induced pore water pressure and soil deformation several researchers have derived analytical solutions for the linear wave induced response of a poro elastic seabed yamamoto 1978 hsu and jeng 1994 based on biot s consolidation theory the analytical solutions derived by yamamoto 1978 for a coarse and fine sandy seabed were then used to validate the proposed numerical model the wave and soil parameters in yamamoto 1978 are as follows wave height h w 24 m water depth d w 70 m wave period t w 15 s wave length l w 324 m hydraulic conductivity of coarse sand k 1 10 2 m s hydraulic conductivity of fine sand k 1 10 4 m s soil porosity n 0 0 3 poisson s ratio μ 0 333 degree of soil saturation s r 1 shear modulus g 1 10 7 pa bed thickness h 25 m fig 3 shows the results with regards to variations in the depth of the volumetric strain of the soil skeleton and the pore water pressure the agreement between the model predictions and the analytical solutions is fairly good which implies that the numerical simulation can precisely reproduce the characteristics of soil deformation and the corresponding evolution of pore water pressure due to oceanic waves 3 2 comparison with flume experiments for wave induced pore water pressure the seepage filed simulated by the numerical model is further validated against qi et al s 2019 laboratory flume tests to demonstrate its reliability at predicting the mechanism of coupled flow and deformation in a porous sandy seabed under the action of progressive waves the soil and wave characteristics presented by qi et al 2019 are as follows soil porosity n 0 0 435 poisson s ratio μ 0 3 shear modulus g 1 0 10 7 p a degree of saturation s r 0 995 hydraulic conductivity of soil k 1 88 10 4 m s sediment depth h 0 5 m buoyant unit weight of soil γ s 9320 n m3 water depth d w 0 5 m wave height h w 0 095 m various wave period t w 1 0 s 1 2 s 1 4 s and 1 6 s as fig 4 shows the simulated pore water pressure coincides well with the data measured by qi et al 2019 the verifications of the model results to the analytical solutions and experimental data indicate that the coupled effect of soil deformation and pore water seepage can be reproduced in the proposed model for various wave and soil conditions this is fundamental and essential for any further investigation into how the transportation of solute in a deformable seabed driven by waves evolves this is the primary goal of this present study 3 3 comparison with flume tests for solute transport in gravel beds packman et al 2004 conducted a series of laboratory flume tests under different hydrodynamic conditions to investigate the exchange of solute between overlying water and dune shaped beds in view of the high permeability and rigidity of gravel beds only the governing equations of 7 and 8 for solute transport in non deformable sediments were solved the experimental data of 3 cases i e run 7 run 8 and run 9 of the flume tests were utilised to validate the numerical results of the variations of solute concentration versus time the average size of particle is 0 6 cm the gravel bed is 0 19 m thick and has a porosity of 0 38 and the hydraulic conductivity of 0 15 m s according to the method and semiempirical relationship proposed by elliott and brooks 1997 the distribution of dynamic water pressure over the dune shaped bed can be expressed as a sinusoidal variation of pressure above a flat bed hence the wave pressure on the flat gravel bed for runs 7 8 and 9 can be expressed as p b7 3 54 sin 19 63 x p b8 0 91 sin 19 63 x and p b 9 6 67 sin 19 63 x where the unit of wave pressure is pa to reproduce the flume tests the boundary conditions at the interface between the water and the bed must be updated according to the variations of solute concentration due to the continuous exchange of solute between the overlying water and sand bed during the test by the conservation of solute mass the concentration of solute at the water and sand bed interface can be calculated as 17 c wt c w 0 n h 0 0 l c t d x d y l d where c wt is the concentration of solute at the water and bed interface c w 0 is the initial concentration of solute in the overlying water c t is the concentration of solute in the bed l is the length of the bed d is the effective depth of water volume per unit bed area the results of this comparison indicate a satisfactory match between the numerical model and the experiments as shown in fig 5 the rate of the decreased concentration of solute in run 8 was higher in the experiments than that in the numerical solutions especially from 2000 to 6000 s this may be due to the relatively small magnitude of wave pressure and the relatively more pronounced effect of turbulence in run 8 3 4 comparison with flume tests for solute transport in fine and medium sand beds elliott and brooks 1997 carried out laboratory flume tests under different hydrodynamic conditions to investigate the exchange of an inert tracer i e solute between flowing water and dune shaped sand beds the governing equations of 1 3 and 9 were solved simultaneously for solute transport in a deformable porous medium under wave loading the experimental data of run 14 run 16 and run 17 of the flume tests were used to validate the numerical results of the solute transport for run 14 and 16 the average size particle is 0 47 mm medium sand the porous sand bed is 0 22 m thick and has a porosity of 0 325 the hydraulic conductivity is 1 1 10 3 m s and the effective coefficient of molecular diffusion is 6 10 10 m2 s for run 17 the average particle size is 0 13 mm fine sand the bed is 0 225 m thick and the porosity is 0 295 the hydraulic conductivity is 7 9 10 5 m s and the effective coefficient of molecular diffusion is 4 1 10 10 m2 s the shear modulus is taken as 1 107 pa and the poisson s ratio is 0 33 according to the method and semi empirical relationship proposed by elliott and brooks 1997 the wave pressure acting on a flat bed for runs 14 16 and 17 can be expressed as p b14 0 83 sin 71 36 x p b16 1 5 sin 26 17 x and p b 17 0 85 sin 44 86 x with the unit pa fig 6 shows the predicted effective depth of solute penetration versus the square root of time t 1 2 in comparison with the measured data from elliott and brooks 1997 while there is good overall agreement between the measured and predicted results for run 16 and run 17 the effective depth of penetration of the solute in the sand bed for run 14 by experiment is somewhat smaller than by the numerical simulation for time longer than 100 min this is probably due to the relatively small hydraulic gradient that induced a horizontal flow in the experiments as well as some uncertainties in the experiment or numerical simulation 3 5 comparison with flume test for solute transport in a medium sand bed similar to the experiments of elliott and brooks 1997 jin et al 2010 also carried out flume experiments to examine the solute transport process in a sand bed with periodic bedforms where periodic interstitial flows would be induced when the stream flowed at the bed surface with bedforms the mean particle size is 0 3 mm the bed is 0 12 m thick and the porosity is 0 33 the hydraulic conductivity is 8 84 10 4 m s and the effective coefficient of molecular diffusion is 5 10 10 m2 s the shear modulus of sediment is 1 107 pa and poisson s ratio is 0 3 using the semi empirical relationship suggested by elliott and brooks 1997 the bedform induced dynamic pressure distribution can be expressed as the water pressure varying in sinusoidal form above a flat bed i e p b 2 06 sin 41 23 x with the unit of pa fig 7 shows the variation of solute concentration in overlying water versus time as predicted by the present model in comparison with the experimental data measured by jin et al 2010 the satisfactory match between the predicted results and the measured data indicates that the present numerical model can reproduce the solute transport in deformable sandy sediment under periodic oscillatory flows induced by waves or other factors 3 6 comparison with flume test for consolidation induced solute migration in a silty bed zhang et al 2019a conducted a flume test to investigate the release of heavy metal cu from silty sediment to overlying water due to consolidation and waves here the migration and release of dissolved cu due to consolidation is numerically simulated while the impact of adsorption and desorption is ignored in the experiment a 5 cm thick and 60 cm long slurry of silty soil including dissolved cu no3 2 3h2o was laid on top of another 25 cm thick layer of slurry with zero solute concentration the initial concentration of dissolved cu in the sediment is about 8 2 g l the overlying water is 50 cm deep and the flume is 400 cm long by 40 cm wide the mean particle size of the silty soil is 0 05 mm and the porosity is 0 32 the hydraulic conductivity is 1 10 6 m s and the effective coefficient of molecular diffusion is 1 10 12 m2 s the shear modulus is 1 106 pa poisson s ratio is 0 33 and the effective unit weight of silty soil is about 8 5 kn m3 the concentration of dissolved cu in the overlying water was measured in the test the concentrations of dissolved cu measured in the overlying water and the results predicted by the developed model are shown in fig 8 the simulation results agree with the experimental data except at the incipient stage where the experimental data is distorted due to the disturbance of surficial sediment resulting from adding water into the flume as explained by the authors themselves nevertheless the good agreement between the measured and simulated results implies that the numerical model can reliably simulate the transport of solute in a deformable sediment 4 results and discussion 4 1 solute transport into deformable sediments with different shear modulus 4 1 1 characteristics of solute transport into deformable sediments under progressive waves the parameters of waves and sediments used for numerical simulation are tabulated in table 1 the concentration of solute at the interface between porous sediment and overlying water is supposed to be c 0 1 mg l the advective solute flux and hydrodynamic dispersive flux can be calculated by eqs 18 and 19 as follows 18 j adv n 0 v c 19 j dis n 0 d c the direction arrow and magnitude colour of vertical advective solute fluxes and the vertical hydrodynamic dispersive fluxes for a deformable porous seabed with a shear modulus of g 106 pa and a non deformable porous seabed at wave cycles of 3600 are shown in fig 9 in this figure the positive indicates the solute transported out of the seabed and the negative indicates the solute transported into the seabed as shown in fig 9 a and 9 c solute is transported into the sediment under the wave crest and out of the sediment under the wave trough by advection as such although the value of the wave induced advective flux of solute is much larger than the dispersive flux the solute transported into the sediment by advection is very small due to the equal quantities of solute that moves into and out of the seabed over the wave periods on the other hand hydrodynamic dispersion whether under a wave trough or crest always helps to transport solute into the sediment under progressive waves as shown in fig 9 b and 9 d hence the rate of solute migration promoted by waves can be represented by the magnitude of the longitudinal mechanical dispersion coefficient i e d dyy the solute fluxes at locations near the wave trough or crest are greater than those near the wave nodes owing to the relatively larger vertical seepage velocity of pore water under a wave trough and crest however because of the cyclic and periodic characteristics of progressive waves the distribution of solute concentration in the horizontal direction is uniform it is worth noticing that the quantity of solute transported into the deformable sediment is much greater than that into the non deformable sediment in addition the depth to which the solute penetrates in the deformable case is about 40 cm and about 17 cm in the non deformable case variations of the averaged advective flux and dispersive flux at the seabed surface in a wavelength over time i e the number of wave cycles are shown in fig 10 where the averaged advective flux is always zero the dispersive flux is large initially and then it decreases rapidly after a period of time the decreasing rate becomes smaller and tends to be constant due to zero concentration of solute in sediment at the incipient stage the gradient of solute concentration becomes maximum at the seabed surface which results in the largest dispersive flux the gradient of solute concentration at the seabed surface decreases as the solute is transported into the sediment resulting in a smaller dispersive flux furthermore the dispersive flux into a deformable seabed is larger than into a rigid seabed 4 1 2 mechanism for the effect of wave induced soil deformation on solute transport the shear modulus of soil g is a parameter which describes the ability of soil to withstand external loading so it relates to the extent of deformation the shear modulus varies from 106 pa for silt and clay to 109 pa for very dense sand yamamoto 1978 even as low as approximate104 pa for loose sand sumer et al 2012 as yamamoto 1978 has demonstrated variations in the shear modulus of soil will affect the extent of deformation that is coupled with seepage flow in a marine sediment driven by oceanic waves this may further affect the transport of solute in sediment therefore the mechanism for solute transport into deformable seabed with different shear modulus will be investigated in this subsection as a comparison the transport of solute in a non deformable seabed is incorporated in this analysis fig 11 shows the variations in depth of the maximum volumetric strain and dimensionless pore water pressure over the wave period where the shear modulus varies from 106 pa to 109 pa the ability of soil to resist deformation generally increases as the shear modulus increases therefore as indicated in fig 11 a there is less volumetric strain along the depth as the shear modulus increases to 109 pa at which the volumetric strain is negligibly small however there is a huge increase in volumetric strain as the shear modulus decreases from 109 pa to 106 pa due to the decreased soil stiffness to withstand the external pressure this is very evident in shallow soil with layers up to y h 0 17 deep in this region the volumetric strain and corresponding pore water pressure fig 11 b attenuate faster along the depth as the shear modulus decreases especially with a shear modulus of g 106 pa this leads to the more significant vertical velocity of pore water v and the longitudinal mechanical dispersion coefficient of solute d dyy in shallow layers of soil as shown in fig 12 a and b this is because the variation of water quantity in a saturated soil element per unit time is proportional to its variation in volume of a soil skeleton therefore a larger volumetric strain would generally lead to a larger seepage velocity of pore water and a larger longitudinal mechanical dispersion coefficient the maximum v and d dyy both occur at the seabed surface and increase markedly by a non linear trend as the shear modulus decreases due to the increasing soil deformation however a larger soil deformation may not necessarily lead to a greater pore water velocity of sediment in deeper locations this phenomenon could be attributed to the rigid bottom which restricts the free deformation of sediment near the boundary yamamoto 1978 for a deformable seabed with a shear modulus of 106 pa the vertical velocity of pore water and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient at the seabed surface can be approximately 6 times the non deformable case however with a shear modulus of 109 pa v and d dyy are almost the same as the non deformable case due to the very small deformation there is an intense relationship between the longitudinal coefficient of mechanical dispersion and the vertical velocity of pore water as fig 13 shows the relationship between d dyy and the velocity of pore water in a vertical direction i e the direction of flow is almost linear this is consistent with the analysis of bear 1972 and de lemos 2006 who pointed out that dispersion in the direction of flow was approximately proportional to the velocity of pore flow this implies that it is the vertical velocity of pore water rather than the horizontal velocity induced by waves that dominates the magnitude of d dyy the vertical distribution of solute concentration and the average solute flux in a wavelengh after 3600 wave cycles for cases of different shear modulus are shown in fig 14 overall the concentration of solute and the average solute flux decrease with depth as expected the concentration and average flux of solute increase with the decrease in the shear modulus due to the increased coefficient of longitudinal dispersion when g 106 pa where the wave induced deformation of soil becomes more pronounced the depth of penetration of solute could be up to about 40 cm which is roughly 2 3 times the non deformable case this discrepancy would become more pronounced as time passes when the shear modulus of soil becomes 109 pa there is no apparent difference in the concentration of solute and average solute flux between the deformed and rigid seabed which indicates that in this case the effect of soil deformation has almost vanished 4 2 effects of dimensionless parameters 4 2 1 dimensionless coefficient of mechanical dispersion according to darcy s law if only seepage in a longitudinal direction is considered the seepage velocity of pore water is equal to the hydraulic conductivity k eq 4 when the hydraulic gradient is a unit here a non dimensional coefficient of mechanical dispersion d d at the unit hydraulic gradient can be defined as 20 d d α l k n 0 υ 0 5 6 10 3 n 0 3 d g 3 g n 0 υ 0 2 1 n 0 2 where υ 0 and α l are the kinematic viscosity of water 1 10 6 m2 s and the longitudinal dispersivity of the porous medium d g m respectively the hydraulic conductivity k expressed as equation 4 is a function of the porosity n 0 and the particle size d g of the sediment therefore the effect of the dimensionless parameter d d on solute transport represents the effect of the grain diameter and the permeability of the sediment as mentioned previously the longitudinal coefficient of mechanical dispersion d dyy denotes the rate of solute transport promoted by progressive waves the ratio of d dyy between the deformable and non deformable sediments r is introduced here to quantify the coupled effect of wave induced soil deformation and seepage flow on the rate of solute migration fig 15 shows the ratio of d dyy between deformable and non deformable sediments at the seabed surface versus d d for different shear modulus here the magnitude of d d ranges from 0 0007 to 2 5 which corresponds to the grain diameters of d g from 0 03 mm to 0 5 mm and the porosity of sediment n 0 0 4 as shown in fig 15 r decreases exponentially with the increase of d d this rate of decrease becomes more apparent in seabed with a small shear modulus this implies that the effect of wave induced soil deformation on solute transport becomes more significant for sediment with a small grain size and with poor drainage conditions and a small shear modulus e g find sand or silt while for cases with larger dimensionless coefficients of mechanical dispersion and shear modulus e g coarse sand or gravel the coupled effect of seepage flow and soil deformation on solute transport becomes less significant 4 2 2 dimensionless thickness of sediment in real oceanic environments the natural deposits of soil may consist of a number of sub layers with different thicknesses and geotechnical properties li et al 1998 sultan et al 2004 the deformable and permeable sediments are generally layered over a rigid stratum of soil such as a hard layer of clay or rock which means that any migration of solute in deformable sediment may have various thicknesses considering that variations in the thickness of the seabed have a certain effect on wave induced pore water pressure in the seabed with coupled flow and soil deformation hsu and jeng 1994 it may further affect the transport of solute as will be discussed in this section numerical simulations were carried out for transport of solute in deformable and non deformable sediments with a dimensionless thickness of seabed h h l w i e the ratio of the thickness of the seabed to wavelength ranging from 0 1 to 1 0 the other parameters for waves and sediments are the same as those tabulated in table 1 figs 16 and 17 show how variations in the thickness of sediment affect the distribution of pore water pressure and concentration of solute in a non deformable and deformable seabed respectively fig 16 a and fig 17 a show that the attenuation of pore pressure in depth becomes more apparent in a deformable seabed than in a non deformable seabed particularly when h less than 0 3 this means that a larger velocity of pore water as well as a larger concentration of solute will be induced in a deformable sediment as the comparison between fig 16 b and fig 17 b shows when the deformability of seabed soil is ignored the vertical gradient of pore pressure versus soil depth gradually increases as sediment increases in thickness to a given value of h 0 5 fig 16 a for deformable sediments the most significant attenuation in pore water pressure in depth occurs when the thickness of the seabed is h 0 2 fig 17 a this is much larger than a non deformable seabed which indicates that variations in the thickness of sediment can have a more vigorous effect on the transport of solute when the impact of soil deformation is considered fig 18 a shows the amplitude of coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion d dyy at the seabed surface versus the dimensionless sediment thicknesses h as with those shown in figs 16 and 17 the effect of seabed thickness on the rate of solute transport is always greater in a deformable seabed than that in a non deformable seabed in non deformable cases the coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion d dyy increases slightly as h increases until it becomes 0 5 above which d dyy remains almost unchanged with variations of h in a deformable seabed d dyy increases as h increases to 0 2 beyond this value d dyy decreases significantly as h increases fig 18 b shows the ratio of d dyy at the seabed surface between deformable and non deformable cases versus the seabed thickness for various shear moduli the enhancement of solute transport by wave induced soil deformation becomes most apparent when the dimensionless thickness of seabed is between 0 1 and 0 2 there is a threshold value of h 0 8 below which the coupled effect of wave induced soil deformation and seepage flow becomes more significant especially for sediment with a relatively small shear modulus 4 2 3 dimensionless wave parameters the wave steepness h hw lw and the relative water depth d dw lw are two commonly used dimensionless wave parameters that represent the intensity of wave pressure experienced by the seabed soil here the extent to which soil deformation affects the rate of solute migration for different wave scenarios is discussed as mentioned previously the seepage velocity and longitudinal mechanical dispersion coefficient are related to the gradient of pore water pressure in sedimentary soil as shown in fig 19 a in a deformable or non deformable seabed variations in the wave steepness have almost no effect on the change of dimensionless pore water pressure p p 0 p 0 is the amplitude of wave pressure at the seabed surface along the depth this means the extent to which the rate of solute transport is enhanced in a deformable seabed compared to a rigid seabed is always the same regardless of the change in wave steepness on the other hand there is a close relationship between the relative water depth and the dimensionless pore water pressure fig 19 b especially for a rigid seabed where the vertical gradient of pore water pressure decreases significantly as d increases in shallow layers of soil this implies that the relative water depth may have a significant influence on the rate of solute transport in marine sediment as shown by fig 20 in each case the ratio of d dyy between deformable and non deformable sediments r increases significantly as the relative water depth increases to 0 3 but then at a decreasing rate an increase in the relative depth of water from 0 1 to 0 3 would lead to an increase in the magnitude of r by about 60 80 in those cases where the dimensionless mechanical dispersion coefficient or shear modulus varied the ratio of d dyy between deformable and non deformable sediments r can reach up to 85 for sediment with small dimensionless coefficient of mechanical dispersion 4 3 effect of wave nonlinearity waves that propagate over the ocean always exhibit nonlinear behaviour to some extent this phenomenon may become more apparent for large waves in shallow water jeng and lin 1997 hsu et al 2019 theories of stokes waves and cnoidal waves have mainly been used to describe the nonlinearity of waves in coastal and oceanic engineering whereas the cnoidal wave theory can describe the performance of waves in shallow water more accurately such as when the depth of water is less than 1 10 of the wavelength dean and dalrymple 1991 based on the second order stokes wave and the first order cnoidal wave the effect of wave nonlinearity on the transport of solute into sediment with and without considering the impact of wave induced soil deformation is investigated in this section using the following wave parameters water depth 6 m wave height 2 5 m wave period 8 s the wave pressure at the surface of the seabed induced by a second order stokes wave can be expressed as jeng and lin 1997 21 p b x t p 0 c 11 cos k w x ω t c 02 c 20 c 22 cos 2 k w x ω t where 22 c 11 1 c 02 k w h w 16 s i n h k w d w 1 ω 0 4 23 c 20 k w h w 16 s i n h k w d w 1 ω 0 4 3 1 ω 0 8 ω 0 4 c o s h 2 k w d w 24 c 22 k w h w 16 s i n h k w d w 1 ω 0 4 3 ω 0 4 ω 0 4 cosh 2 k w d w 25 ω 0 2 g k w tanh k w d w the first order cnoidal wave induced pressure at the surface of the seabed can be calculated by using the following expression hsu et al 2019 26 p b x t γ w h w j 1 n j π 2 m k m 2 sinh j π k 1 m k m cos j k w x ω t where k m is the first complete elliptic integral m is the elliptic parameter and n is the upper bound of summation n 30 fig 21 shows the evolution of solute mass versus the number of wave cycles in a deformable and non deformable seabed fig 21 a shows the results based on a linear wave a second order stokes wave and a first order cnoidal wave and fig 21 b shows the difference in the mass of solute between the results predicted by the first order cnoidal wave and the linear wave as with previous discussions the mass of solute in a deformable seabed is always greater than in a non deformable seabed regardless of the type of waves exerted onto the seabed in all cases there is an apparent discrepancy in the mass of solute transported between results based on the first order cnoidal wave and the linear wave where the difference is approximately 0 32 g after 3000 wave cycles in deformable case this is about 2 times the difference when the deformability of seabed soil is omitted fig 21 b on the other hand the difference of solute mass between results based on stokes wave and linear wave is very small fig 21 a to explain these phenomena fig 22 a and b show the distribution of wave pressure and coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion d dyy at the interface between water and sediment within a single wavelength according with solutions based on the linear wave the second order stokes wave and the first order cnoidal wave the results presented here are for a deformable seabed only as fig 22 a shows the behaviour of a nonlinear wave with a steeper wave crest and a flatter trough is reflected very well in a waveform based on the first order cnoidal wave and the second order stokes wave moreover the behaviour predicted by the first order cnoidal wave is more nonlinear than the second order stokes wave for example the pressures at the crest of the cnoidal wave and the second order stokes wave are respectively about 165 and 120 of the linear wave whereas the pressures at the trough of the cnoidal wave and the second order stokes wave are both about 80 of the linear wave corresponding to this nonlinear and asymmetric distribution the period averaged dd yy for the solutions based on the first order cnoidal wave and the second order stokes wave are respectively increased by about 15 and 3 than for the solutions based on the linear wave this explains why the mass of solute that is transported into the sediment under the first order cnoidal waves is greater than under linear waves whereas the mass of solute predicted by stokes waves is almost the same as by linear waves 5 conclusions based on biot s consolidation theory and the two dimensional advection dispersion equation a numerical model for transport of non reactive solutes into a deformable porous medium under oceanic waves is established to investigate the coupled effect of seepage flow and soil deformation on solute migration the two components of the numerical model i e the pore fluid seepage in deformable sediments and the solute transport were validated separately by comparing them with the analytical and experimental data available in the literature this coupled model was further validated against experiments for solute transport in deformable sediments induced by wave loading and consolidation the characteristics and mechanism of solute transport into deformable sediments driven by periodic waves have been described and discussed the effects of parameters such as the shear modulus the non dimensional coefficient of mechanical dispersion the dimensionless sediment thickness wave steepness and relative water depth as well as wave nonlinearity on the solute transport in deformable sediments were investigated based on the simulated results the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 solute mass is more likely to be driven into deformable sediments by oceanic waves due to the increased seepage of pore water in shallow layers of soil that is coupled with the wave induced deformation of soil unlike a rigid seabed the volumetric strain of soil in shallow layers of a deformable seabed will attenuate quickly along the depth and lead to higher vertical pore water velocity and a larger coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion this phenomenon becomes more apparent in seabed soil with a small shear modulus and hydraulic conductivity e g fine sand or silt when the sediment thickness is less than 0 8 times the wavelength 2 the enhancement that wave induced soil deformation has on the rate of solute transport as defined by the ratio of the coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion between deformable and non deformable sediments may reach up to the order of 85 although this enhancement is independent of wave steepness it increases by 60 80 as the relative water depth increases from 0 1 to 0 3 and then at a decreasing rate this varying trend remains the same regardless of changes in the magnitudes of dimensionless mechanical dispersion coefficient related to grain size and permeability or the shear modulus 3 the effect of sediment thickness on solute transport is more pronounced when the impact of coupled wave induced soil deformation and seepage flow is considered where the rate of solute transport increases significantly with an increase in the sediment thickness to 0 2 times the wavelength this then decreases as the seabed thickness continues to increase to a wavelength for a non deformable seabed the transport of solute increases slightly as the sediment becomes thicker with the maximum rate occurring when the seabed thickness becomes almost half the wavelength the enhancement of solute transport due to wave induced soil deformation can reach a peak value when the sediment thickness is 0 1 0 2 times the wavelength 4 due to their nonlinear behaviour shallow water waves e g the first order cnoidal wave can accelerate the rate at which solute is transported more than linear waves the period averaged coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion at the deformable seabed surface as determined by the first order cnoidal waves can increase by about 15 more than linear waves while a stokes wave is more applicable to deeper water its enhancement of solute transport compared to a linear wave is negligible in a deformable and non deformable seabed credit authorship contribution statement xiaoli liu conceptualization methodology formal analysis

2736,most existing studies do not consider the effect that the deformability of submarine sediments may have on solute transport under the action of ocean waves in this study a two dimensional numerical model based on biot s poro elastic consolidation theory and an advection dispersion equation is established to investigate the transport of non reactive solute into a deformable porous seabed under the influence of ocean waves the numerical model is then validated against experimental and analytical results in order to demonstrate its accuracy and robustness the simulation results indicate that ignoring the deformability of seabed soil and associated seepage force due to ocean waves may lead to a significant underestimation of the rate of solute transport in shallow layers of marine sediment particularly fine sand or silt the effects of parameters such as the shear modulus non dimensional mechanical dispersion coefficient related to particle size and permeability dimensionless sediment thickness wave steepness and the relative water depth have on solute transport into deformable sediments were investigated the results indicate that the ratio of the longitudinal coefficient of mechanical dispersion between deformable and non deformable sediments that can represent the enhancement of solute migration due to soil deformation may reach up to 85 this becomes more pronounced as the shear modulus and permeability of sediments decrease and the depth of water increases when the sediment thickness is less than 0 8 times the wavelength the rate of solute transport in deformable sediments reaches its maximum when the sediment thickness is about 0 2 times the wavelength in fact as the relative water depth increases from 0 1 to 0 3 the enhancement of solute migration due to wave induced soil deformation increases by about 60 80 in comparison to linear waves shallow water waves e g the first order cnoidal waves can increase the transport of solute more due to its strong non linear behaviour particularly in deformable seabed keywords solute transport soil deformation marine sediments progressive waves numerical simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as one of the main parts of the earth s filter system permeable sediments play an important role in nutrient cycling and hosting the bio geochemical process in aquatic environments the exchange of dissolved substances or solutes e g nutrients contaminants and trace metals between sediment and water columns affects the chemical and biological condition of sediments and the benthic primary production falter and sansone 2000 precht et al 2004 higashino and stefan 2011 understanding the process of solute transport in permeable marine sediments is still challenging because oceanic environment is dynamic and the intrinsic behaviour of marine sediment is complicated field observations and a certain number of studies have confirmed that the exchange of solute between permeable sediments and overlying water in estuarine and coastal areas where the sediment is mainly medium or fine sand is greatly enhanced by surface gravity waves especially in areas where the water is less than half the depth of the wavelength harrison et al 1983 malan and mclachlan 1991 oldham and lavery 1999 falter and sansone 2000 precht and huettel 2003 when waves cross obstacles such as biogenic burrows and bed ripples advection could become an important physical mechanism for enhancing the exchange of solute at the interface between water and sediment webb and theodor 1972 shum 1992 huettel and gust 1992 advection due to ripples may penetrate to a depth of several ripple heights below the mudline for a wide range of sediment characteristics and wave conditions shum 1992 however the net transport of solute by advection may be negligible for a flat seabed under regular waves where the displacement of oscillatory pore fluid and the net exchange of interstitial flow through the sediment and water interface may become zero over a wave period due to its cyclic nature precht and huettel 2003 webster 2003 on the other hand the mechanical dispersion or convective diffusion that could be significantly enhanced by the wave induced circular motion of pore flow may become the dominant physical mechanism that enhances the net exchange of solute between the sediment and overlying water column clark et al 2019 qian et al 2008 rutgers van der loeff 1981 webster 2003 webster and taylor 1992 harrison et al 1983 two separate mechanisms for the mechanical dispersion of solute migration induced by progressive waves have been identified one is referred to as rotational dispersion webster and taylor 1992 which mainly occurs at the intersections between pores and is more obvious in sandy sediment with medium or large particles where pore flow is caused by a pressure gradient with a rotating direction in time the other is called shear dispersion webster 2003 which exists in sandy sediment with a wide range of particle size for homogeneous porous media these processes can be modelled using the classical advection dispersion equation ade a fickian based model for solute transport harrison et al 1983 qian et al 2008 feng and michaelides 2009 boufadel et al 2011 guo et al 2014 where the coefficient of dispersion can be expressed as a function of the pore fluid velocity and dispersivity of the porous media this depends on the particle size and packing arrangements etc qian et al 2008 introduced an enhanced dispersion coefficient that varied with depth to propose a vertical dispersion model for solute migration based on the transport of solute in a gravel bed due to standing waves or bedforms using two dimensional 2 d transient ade boufadel et al 2011 applied 2 d ade to simulate the migration of solute in a beach subjected to tides and waves and found they could enhance the pollutant fluxes other researchers used ade to investigate the inertial effects of pore water flow i e the non darcy flow on the exchange of solute through the sediment interface under the influence of waves habel and bagtzoglou 2005 higashino and stefan 2011 they found that non darcy flow only worked for high permeable sediment where the hydraulic conductivity was greater than 0 01 m s however for heterogeneous porous media that may contain low permeability deposits or preferential flow paths the process of solute transport cannot be precisely modelled using the classical ade due to the non fickian or anomalous transport of solute zhang et al 2009 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 zhang et al 2019b mohammadi and mehdinejadiani 2021 to simulate the non fickian transport of solute some non local models for solute transport such as the stochastic averaging of ade sa ade method cushman 1987 the continuous time random walk ctrw method berkowitz et al 2006 the multi rate mass transfer mrmt method haggerty and gorelick 1995 and the fractional advection dispersion equations fades method zhang et al 2009 were developed as a promising technique fractional derivative models for simulating non fickian migration in heterogeneous media can be characterized as three main types i e the spatial fade s fade that can capture super diffusion the temporal t fade that can capture sub diffusion and the tempered spatiotemporal fade st fade that can capture the mixture of sub and super diffusion zhang et al 2019b these studies and many others assumed that the sediment beds were rigid and non deformable and the pore fluid seepage was computed based on the laplace equation in a realistic oceanic environment waves travelling over a porous seabed may lead to a coupled seepage flow and deformation i e when the water is driven into a porous bed the bed itself may withstand the pressure of waves and become deformed investigations into the deformability of seabed soil coupled with the wave induced seepage force were mainly based on biot s poro elastic theory yamamoto 1978 hsu and jeng 1994 jeng and hsu 1996 the results indicated that the pore water pressure may change depending on the thickness and stiffness of the seabed e g the shear modulus as well as the drainage condition of the soil whereas the pore water pressure of a rigid or non deformable seabed was independent of the permeability of the sediment this means that ignoring the coupled effect of soil deformation and seepage flow may lead to an inaccurate estimation of pore water velocity that pertains to the transport of solute in seabed soil unfortunately to the best of the authors knowledge the coupled effect of soil deformation and seepage flow on solute transport has not been considered in any of the existing studies on solute transport in marine sediments under the influence of ocean waves thus far the effect of soil deformation has been incorporated into the classical ade for solute transport in deformable sediments by some references of which most studies investigated the solute migration that occurred in landfill cases by utilising different models for example smith 2000 peters and smith 2002 zhang et al 2012 wu and jeng 2017 and wu et al 2020 investigated solute transport in landfills using one dimensional ade that considered the effect of soil deformation caused by gravitational consolidation zhang and fang 2016 zhang et al 2017 and wu 2020 investigated solute transport in landfills by three dimensional or two dimensional ade that incorporated soil deformation based on biot s consolidation theory however the communication of solute concentrations between transverse and longitudinal directions that may occur during multi directional solute spreading was not considered so this may be a long way away from a realistic situation in this study a 2 d numerical model based on biot s poro elastic theory and classical two dimensional advection dispersion equation ade has been developed to investigate the characteristics of solute transport in a homogeneous deformable seabed driven by ocean waves where the coupled effect of pore water seepage and deformation of the seabed is incorporated into the ade by pore water velocities meanwhile the model considers the interplay of solute transport among different directions the model results with regards to pore water pressures and soil deformation including the transport of solute in non deformable and deformable sediments have been verified against the data available in literature the validated numerical model was then used to investigate the performance of solute transport in a deformable seabed with different stiffness shear modulus and thickness soil particle size and permeability and wave parameters and types of waves compared to a rigid or non deformable seabed 2 theory and numerical model 2 1 description of the physical problem fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the physical problem in this study the deformable porous medium i e seabed material known as sediment or soil is regarded as an isotropic and homogenous three phase mixture of a solid soil skeleton a liquid pore water and a non reactive solute dissolved in the liquid it is assumed that the deformation of soil i e its displacement and strain is small and variations in the void ratio are negligible two sub models are included in the numerical model i e the pore fluid seepage model that considers the coupled effect of soil deformation and pore water pressure and the solute transport model that incorporates the effect that the soil deformation has on the velocity of pore water the computational domain is a saturated sand bed which is supposed to be flat along the direction of wave propagation with a finite thickness h at the surface a periodic cyclic pressure in a sine or cosine distribution is applied by progressive surface waves with a height of h w a water depth of d w a wave period of t w and a wave length of l w the x axis is along the interface of sediment and water and the y axis is upwards bottom of the sediment bed is assumed to be rigid and impermeable an initial solute concentration of c s 0 x y t t 0 0 is allocated within the sediment along the sediment and water interface a constant concentration of c x y t y 0 c 0 is maintained qian et al 2008 higashino and stefan 2011 as shown in fig 1 a the seepage of pore water in sediments occurs when there is a difference in the water head as the wave pressure fluctuates at the sediment surface for a flat seabed subjected to regular periodic and progressive waves the net solute flux that is migrated by advection can be omitted due to the equal pore water fluxes of outflow and inflow through the sediment interface over a period of one wave whereas mechanical dispersion due to wave induced pore water seepage will accelerate the migration of solute in sediment clark et al 2019 webster 2003 harrison et al 1983 as such the solute would be migrated into the sediment by hydrodynamic dispersion i e mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion as shown in fig 1 b 2 2 pore fluid seepage in deformable sediments the consolidation theory for elastic porous media developed by biot 1941 is used to determine the coupled seepage flow and deformation in sediment the two dimensional equations for the force equilibrium of soil and the conservation of pore fluid mass are expressed as follows biot 1941 1 g 2 w x g 1 2 μ ε x p x 2 g 2 w y g 1 2 μ ε y p y 3 k γ w 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 n 0 β p t ε t where w x and w y denote the displacement of soil in the x

the porosity of soil t is time s and k is the hydraulic conductivity m s which can be expressed as bear 1972 boudreau 1997 higashino and stefan 2011 4 k 5 6 10 3 n 0 3 d g 2 g υ 0 1 n 0 2 where dg is the mean particle diameter m g is the gravitational acceleration and υ 0 is the kinematic viscosity of water 1 10 6 m 2 s at 20⁰ ε is the volumetric strain of soil expressed as 5 ε w x x w y y β is the compressibility of pore fluid where the gas is either dissolved in or enclosed in pore water by tiny bubbles it can be expressed as yamamoto 1978 6 β 1 k w 0 1 s r p w 0 where k w 0 is the true bulk modulus of water 2 10 9 n m2 p w 0 is the absolute pore water pressure pa and s r is the degree of soil saturation the components for the seepage velocity of pore fluid can be written as 7 u k n 0 γ w p x v k n 0 γ w p y where u and v are the velocity of pore fluid in the horizontal direction x axis and the vertical direction y axis m s equations 1 3 are the governing equations of biot s consolidation theory where the displacements of soil and pore water pressure are fully coupled and solved synchronously this means the effect that the soil deformation induced by waves has on the seepage velocity of pore fluid can be considered and at the same time the effect that the seepage flow i e the pore water pressure has on soil deformation can also be considered for cases of rigid and non deformable porous media the equation governing the seepage velocity field of pore fluid can be deduced from equation 3 when the volumetric strain of soil is zero and the compressibility of pore fluid is ignored habel and bagtzoglou 2005 i e 8 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 where ϕ is the pore water pressure head m p γ w ϕ 2 3 solute transport in deformable sediments the conservative solute transport follows the law of mass conservation if the sorption of solute onto the solid phase is omitted the two dimensional advection dispersion equation ade in deforming sediments can be written as follows peters and smith 2002 gardiner et al 2007 bear and cheng 2010 9 c t u u s c x v v s c y x d xx c x d xy c y y d yy c y d yx c x 10 d xx d dxx d em d xy d dxy d em d yx d dyx d em d

zheng and bennett 1995 qian et al 2008 and u s and v s are the velocity of soil in the x and y directions respectively m s the equations presented here are based on the spatial eulerian coordinate system for small deformations of a porous medium the main difference between the solute transport equations of a deforming porous medium and a rigid one is reflected as follows firstly the advective terms i e the first and second terms on the right hand side of equation 9 for a deformable porous medium depend not only on the relative fluid velocity i e darcy velocity they also depend on the solid phase velocity secondly the pore fluid velocity used in the ade for a deformable porous medium stems from biot s consolidation equations which considered the coupled effect of soil deformation and pore water pressure therefore the transient soil response and the process of solute transport are semi coupled i e the effect of soil deformation on solute transport in sediments is considered while the transport of solute has no influence on the deformation of soil 2 4 boundary and initial conditions below are the boundary and initial conditions used to solve biot s consolidation equations and the advection dispersion equation in the developed model 1 boundary conditions at the surface of the seabed i e the sediment and water interface y 0 the wave induced pore water pressure is equal to

k w 2 π l w is the wave number m 1 and ω 2 π t w is the frequency of the wave s 1 the wavelength can be obtained based on the dispersion equation of linear wave theory as follows 14 l w g t w 2 tanh k

w x and w y in the studied domain are all zero the initial concentration in the pore water of the sediment is set at zero as shown in fig 1 2 5 numerical implementation the present model involving biot s poro elastic equations and ade was solved numerically via comsol multiphysics a simulation platform that provides fully coupled multi physics and single physics modelling capabilities comsol offers a level of flexibility that enables the user to directly input user defined equations and expressions that describe the coupled or uncoupled physics phenomena in the user interface this equation based modelling in comsol can be realized by the termed pde partial differential equation module a flowchart indicating the process of numerical solution in a comsol environment is shown in fig 2 with regards to solving the pdes the implicit time stepping method i e the backward differentiation formulae bdf is used to find the solution where space is discretised with the finite element method fem it is worth noting that the quadratic lagrange elements have been utilised to discretise the computational domain and the mesh is refined until the solution cannot be influenced by any change in the number of elements with appropriate boundaries and initial conditions as demonstrated above the governing equations 1 3 and 9 for solute transport in a deformable sediment can be solved synchronously and the results for soil displacements pore water pressures velocity field of pore fluid and the solute concentration field can be obtained note that the non deformable or rigid seabed case is also considered as a benchmark in which the pore water pressures pore water velocity field and solute concentration field without the effect of soil deformation can be obtained by solving the governing equations 8 and 9 where the soil velocity is regarded as zero 3 model validations first the soil deformation and solute transport components of the developed model were validated separately using the data available from literature as presented in subsections 3 1 3 3 the numerical model was further validated against experiments for solute transport in deformable sediments under wave loading and gravitational consolidation as presented in subsections 3 4 3 6 3 1 comparison with the analytical solution for wave induced pore water pressure and soil deformation several researchers have derived analytical solutions for the linear wave induced response of a poro elastic seabed yamamoto 1978 hsu and jeng 1994 based on biot s consolidation theory the analytical solutions derived by yamamoto 1978 for a coarse and fine sandy seabed were then used to validate the proposed numerical model the wave and soil parameters in yamamoto 1978 are as follows wave height h w 24 m water depth d w 70 m wave period t w 15 s wave length l w 324 m hydraulic conductivity of coarse sand k 1 10 2 m s hydraulic conductivity of fine sand k 1 10 4 m s soil porosity n 0 0 3 poisson s ratio μ 0 333 degree of soil saturation s r 1 shear modulus g 1 10 7 pa bed thickness h 25 m fig 3 shows the results with regards to variations in the depth of the volumetric strain of the soil skeleton and the pore water pressure the agreement between the model predictions and the analytical solutions is fairly good which implies that the numerical simulation can precisely reproduce the characteristics of soil deformation and the corresponding evolution of pore water pressure due to oceanic waves 3 2 comparison with flume experiments for wave induced pore water pressure the seepage filed simulated by the numerical model is further validated against qi et al s 2019 laboratory flume tests to demonstrate its reliability at predicting the mechanism of coupled flow and deformation in a porous sandy seabed under the action of progressive waves the soil and wave characteristics presented by qi et al 2019 are as follows soil porosity n 0 0 435 poisson s ratio μ 0 3 shear modulus g 1 0 10 7 p a degree of saturation s r 0 995 hydraulic conductivity of soil k 1 88 10 4 m s sediment depth h 0 5 m buoyant unit weight of soil γ s 9320 n m3 water depth d w 0 5 m wave height h w 0 095 m various wave period t w 1 0 s 1 2 s 1 4 s and 1 6 s as fig 4 shows the simulated pore water pressure coincides well with the data measured by qi et al 2019 the verifications of the model results to the analytical solutions and experimental data indicate that the coupled effect of soil deformation and pore water seepage can be reproduced in the proposed model for various wave and soil conditions this is fundamental and essential for any further investigation into how the transportation of solute in a deformable seabed driven by waves evolves this is the primary goal of this present study 3 3 comparison with flume tests for solute transport in gravel beds packman et al 2004 conducted a series of laboratory flume tests under different hydrodynamic conditions to investigate the exchange of solute between overlying water and dune shaped beds in view of the high permeability and rigidity of gravel beds only the governing equations of 7 and 8 for solute transport in non deformable sediments were solved the experimental data of 3 cases i e run 7 run 8 and run 9 of the flume tests were utilised to validate the numerical results of the variations of solute concentration versus time the average size of particle is 0 6 cm the gravel bed is 0 19 m thick and has a porosity of 0 38 and the hydraulic conductivity of 0 15 m s according to the method and semiempirical relationship proposed by elliott and brooks 1997 the distribution of dynamic water pressure over the dune shaped bed can be expressed as a sinusoidal variation of pressure above a flat bed hence the wave pressure on the flat gravel bed for runs 7 8 and 9 can be expressed as p b7 3 54 sin 19 63 x p b8 0 91 sin 19 63 x and p b 9 6 67 sin 19 63 x where the unit of wave pressure is pa to reproduce the flume tests the boundary conditions at the interface between the water and the bed must be updated according to the variations of solute concentration due to the continuous exchange of solute between the overlying water and sand bed during the test by the conservation of solute mass the concentration of solute at the water and sand bed interface can be calculated as 17 c wt c w 0 n h 0 0 l c t d x d y l d where c wt is the concentration of solute at the water and bed interface c w 0 is the initial concentration of solute in the overlying water c t is the concentration of solute in the bed l is the length of the bed d is the effective depth of water volume per unit bed area the results of this comparison indicate a satisfactory match between the numerical model and the experiments as shown in fig 5 the rate of the decreased concentration of solute in run 8 was higher in the experiments than that in the numerical solutions especially from 2000 to 6000 s this may be due to the relatively small magnitude of wave pressure and the relatively more pronounced effect of turbulence in run 8 3 4 comparison with flume tests for solute transport in fine and medium sand beds elliott and brooks 1997 carried out laboratory flume tests under different hydrodynamic conditions to investigate the exchange of an inert tracer i e solute between flowing water and dune shaped sand beds the governing equations of 1 3 and 9 were solved simultaneously for solute transport in a deformable porous medium under wave loading the experimental data of run 14 run 16 and run 17 of the flume tests were used to validate the numerical results of the solute transport for run 14 and 16 the average size particle is 0 47 mm medium sand the porous sand bed is 0 22 m thick and has a porosity of 0 325 the hydraulic conductivity is 1 1 10 3 m s and the effective coefficient of molecular diffusion is 6 10 10 m2 s for run 17 the average particle size is 0 13 mm fine sand the bed is 0 225 m thick and the porosity is 0 295 the hydraulic conductivity is 7 9 10 5 m s and the effective coefficient of molecular diffusion is 4 1 10 10 m2 s the shear modulus is taken as 1 107 pa and the poisson s ratio is 0 33 according to the method and semi empirical relationship proposed by elliott and brooks 1997 the wave pressure acting on a flat bed for runs 14 16 and 17 can be expressed as p b14 0 83 sin 71 36 x p b16 1 5 sin 26 17 x and p b 17 0 85 sin 44 86 x with the unit pa fig 6 shows the predicted effective depth of solute penetration versus the square root of time t 1 2 in comparison with the measured data from elliott and brooks 1997 while there is good overall agreement between the measured and predicted results for run 16 and run 17 the effective depth of penetration of the solute in the sand bed for run 14 by experiment is somewhat smaller than by the numerical simulation for time longer than 100 min this is probably due to the relatively small hydraulic gradient that induced a horizontal flow in the experiments as well as some uncertainties in the experiment or numerical simulation 3 5 comparison with flume test for solute transport in a medium sand bed similar to the experiments of elliott and brooks 1997 jin et al 2010 also carried out flume experiments to examine the solute transport process in a sand bed with periodic bedforms where periodic interstitial flows would be induced when the stream flowed at the bed surface with bedforms the mean particle size is 0 3 mm the bed is 0 12 m thick and the porosity is 0 33 the hydraulic conductivity is 8 84 10 4 m s and the effective coefficient of molecular diffusion is 5 10 10 m2 s the shear modulus of sediment is 1 107 pa and poisson s ratio is 0 3 using the semi empirical relationship suggested by elliott and brooks 1997 the bedform induced dynamic pressure distribution can be expressed as the water pressure varying in sinusoidal form above a flat bed i e p b 2 06 sin 41 23 x with the unit of pa fig 7 shows the variation of solute concentration in overlying water versus time as predicted by the present model in comparison with the experimental data measured by jin et al 2010 the satisfactory match between the predicted results and the measured data indicates that the present numerical model can reproduce the solute transport in deformable sandy sediment under periodic oscillatory flows induced by waves or other factors 3 6 comparison with flume test for consolidation induced solute migration in a silty bed zhang et al 2019a conducted a flume test to investigate the release of heavy metal cu from silty sediment to overlying water due to consolidation and waves here the migration and release of dissolved cu due to consolidation is numerically simulated while the impact of adsorption and desorption is ignored in the experiment a 5 cm thick and 60 cm long slurry of silty soil including dissolved cu no3 2 3h2o was laid on top of another 25 cm thick layer of slurry with zero solute concentration the initial concentration of dissolved cu in the sediment is about 8 2 g l the overlying water is 50 cm deep and the flume is 400 cm long by 40 cm wide the mean particle size of the silty soil is 0 05 mm and the porosity is 0 32 the hydraulic conductivity is 1 10 6 m s and the effective coefficient of molecular diffusion is 1 10 12 m2 s the shear modulus is 1 106 pa poisson s ratio is 0 33 and the effective unit weight of silty soil is about 8 5 kn m3 the concentration of dissolved cu in the overlying water was measured in the test the concentrations of dissolved cu measured in the overlying water and the results predicted by the developed model are shown in fig 8 the simulation results agree with the experimental data except at the incipient stage where the experimental data is distorted due to the disturbance of surficial sediment resulting from adding water into the flume as explained by the authors themselves nevertheless the good agreement between the measured and simulated results implies that the numerical model can reliably simulate the transport of solute in a deformable sediment 4 results and discussion 4 1 solute transport into deformable sediments with different shear modulus 4 1 1 characteristics of solute transport into deformable sediments under progressive waves the parameters of waves and sediments used for numerical simulation are tabulated in table 1 the concentration of solute at the interface between porous sediment and overlying water is supposed to be c 0 1 mg l the advective solute flux and hydrodynamic dispersive flux can be calculated by eqs 18 and 19 as follows 18 j adv n 0 v c 19 j dis n 0 d c the direction arrow and magnitude colour of vertical advective solute fluxes and the vertical hydrodynamic dispersive fluxes for a deformable porous seabed with a shear modulus of g 106 pa and a non deformable porous seabed at wave cycles of 3600 are shown in fig 9 in this figure the positive indicates the solute transported out of the seabed and the negative indicates the solute transported into the seabed as shown in fig 9 a and 9 c solute is transported into the sediment under the wave crest and out of the sediment under the wave trough by advection as such although the value of the wave induced advective flux of solute is much larger than the dispersive flux the solute transported into the sediment by advection is very small due to the equal quantities of solute that moves into and out of the seabed over the wave periods on the other hand hydrodynamic dispersion whether under a wave trough or crest always helps to transport solute into the sediment under progressive waves as shown in fig 9 b and 9 d hence the rate of solute migration promoted by waves can be represented by the magnitude of the longitudinal mechanical dispersion coefficient i e d dyy the solute fluxes at locations near the wave trough or crest are greater than those near the wave nodes owing to the relatively larger vertical seepage velocity of pore water under a wave trough and crest however because of the cyclic and periodic characteristics of progressive waves the distribution of solute concentration in the horizontal direction is uniform it is worth noticing that the quantity of solute transported into the deformable sediment is much greater than that into the non deformable sediment in addition the depth to which the solute penetrates in the deformable case is about 40 cm and about 17 cm in the non deformable case variations of the averaged advective flux and dispersive flux at the seabed surface in a wavelength over time i e the number of wave cycles are shown in fig 10 where the averaged advective flux is always zero the dispersive flux is large initially and then it decreases rapidly after a period of time the decreasing rate becomes smaller and tends to be constant due to zero concentration of solute in sediment at the incipient stage the gradient of solute concentration becomes maximum at the seabed surface which results in the largest dispersive flux the gradient of solute concentration at the seabed surface decreases as the solute is transported into the sediment resulting in a smaller dispersive flux furthermore the dispersive flux into a deformable seabed is larger than into a rigid seabed 4 1 2 mechanism for the effect of wave induced soil deformation on solute transport the shear modulus of soil g is a parameter which describes the ability of soil to withstand external loading so it relates to the extent of deformation the shear modulus varies from 106 pa for silt and clay to 109 pa for very dense sand yamamoto 1978 even as low as approximate104 pa for loose sand sumer et al 2012 as yamamoto 1978 has demonstrated variations in the shear modulus of soil will affect the extent of deformation that is coupled with seepage flow in a marine sediment driven by oceanic waves this may further affect the transport of solute in sediment therefore the mechanism for solute transport into deformable seabed with different shear modulus will be investigated in this subsection as a comparison the transport of solute in a non deformable seabed is incorporated in this analysis fig 11 shows the variations in depth of the maximum volumetric strain and dimensionless pore water pressure over the wave period where the shear modulus varies from 106 pa to 109 pa the ability of soil to resist deformation generally increases as the shear modulus increases therefore as indicated in fig 11 a there is less volumetric strain along the depth as the shear modulus increases to 109 pa at which the volumetric strain is negligibly small however there is a huge increase in volumetric strain as the shear modulus decreases from 109 pa to 106 pa due to the decreased soil stiffness to withstand the external pressure this is very evident in shallow soil with layers up to y h 0 17 deep in this region the volumetric strain and corresponding pore water pressure fig 11 b attenuate faster along the depth as the shear modulus decreases especially with a shear modulus of g 106 pa this leads to the more significant vertical velocity of pore water v and the longitudinal mechanical dispersion coefficient of solute d dyy in shallow layers of soil as shown in fig 12 a and b this is because the variation of water quantity in a saturated soil element per unit time is proportional to its variation in volume of a soil skeleton therefore a larger volumetric strain would generally lead to a larger seepage velocity of pore water and a larger longitudinal mechanical dispersion coefficient the maximum v and d dyy both occur at the seabed surface and increase markedly by a non linear trend as the shear modulus decreases due to the increasing soil deformation however a larger soil deformation may not necessarily lead to a greater pore water velocity of sediment in deeper locations this phenomenon could be attributed to the rigid bottom which restricts the free deformation of sediment near the boundary yamamoto 1978 for a deformable seabed with a shear modulus of 106 pa the vertical velocity of pore water and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient at the seabed surface can be approximately 6 times the non deformable case however with a shear modulus of 109 pa v and d dyy are almost the same as the non deformable case due to the very small deformation there is an intense relationship between the longitudinal coefficient of mechanical dispersion and the vertical velocity of pore water as fig 13 shows the relationship between d dyy and the velocity of pore water in a vertical direction i e the direction of flow is almost linear this is consistent with the analysis of bear 1972 and de lemos 2006 who pointed out that dispersion in the direction of flow was approximately proportional to the velocity of pore flow this implies that it is the vertical velocity of pore water rather than the horizontal velocity induced by waves that dominates the magnitude of d dyy the vertical distribution of solute concentration and the average solute flux in a wavelengh after 3600 wave cycles for cases of different shear modulus are shown in fig 14 overall the concentration of solute and the average solute flux decrease with depth as expected the concentration and average flux of solute increase with the decrease in the shear modulus due to the increased coefficient of longitudinal dispersion when g 106 pa where the wave induced deformation of soil becomes more pronounced the depth of penetration of solute could be up to about 40 cm which is roughly 2 3 times the non deformable case this discrepancy would become more pronounced as time passes when the shear modulus of soil becomes 109 pa there is no apparent difference in the concentration of solute and average solute flux between the deformed and rigid seabed which indicates that in this case the effect of soil deformation has almost vanished 4 2 effects of dimensionless parameters 4 2 1 dimensionless coefficient of mechanical dispersion according to darcy s law if only seepage in a longitudinal direction is considered the seepage velocity of pore water is equal to the hydraulic conductivity k eq 4 when the hydraulic gradient is a unit here a non dimensional coefficient of mechanical dispersion d d at the unit hydraulic gradient can be defined as 20 d d α l k n 0 υ 0 5 6 10 3 n 0 3 d g 3 g n 0 υ 0 2 1 n 0 2 where υ 0 and α l are the kinematic viscosity of water 1 10 6 m2 s and the longitudinal dispersivity of the porous medium d g m respectively the hydraulic conductivity k expressed as equation 4 is a function of the porosity n 0 and the particle size d g of the sediment therefore the effect of the dimensionless parameter d d on solute transport represents the effect of the grain diameter and the permeability of the sediment as mentioned previously the longitudinal coefficient of mechanical dispersion d dyy denotes the rate of solute transport promoted by progressive waves the ratio of d dyy between the deformable and non deformable sediments r is introduced here to quantify the coupled effect of wave induced soil deformation and seepage flow on the rate of solute migration fig 15 shows the ratio of d dyy between deformable and non deformable sediments at the seabed surface versus d d for different shear modulus here the magnitude of d d ranges from 0 0007 to 2 5 which corresponds to the grain diameters of d g from 0 03 mm to 0 5 mm and the porosity of sediment n 0 0 4 as shown in fig 15 r decreases exponentially with the increase of d d this rate of decrease becomes more apparent in seabed with a small shear modulus this implies that the effect of wave induced soil deformation on solute transport becomes more significant for sediment with a small grain size and with poor drainage conditions and a small shear modulus e g find sand or silt while for cases with larger dimensionless coefficients of mechanical dispersion and shear modulus e g coarse sand or gravel the coupled effect of seepage flow and soil deformation on solute transport becomes less significant 4 2 2 dimensionless thickness of sediment in real oceanic environments the natural deposits of soil may consist of a number of sub layers with different thicknesses and geotechnical properties li et al 1998 sultan et al 2004 the deformable and permeable sediments are generally layered over a rigid stratum of soil such as a hard layer of clay or rock which means that any migration of solute in deformable sediment may have various thicknesses considering that variations in the thickness of the seabed have a certain effect on wave induced pore water pressure in the seabed with coupled flow and soil deformation hsu and jeng 1994 it may further affect the transport of solute as will be discussed in this section numerical simulations were carried out for transport of solute in deformable and non deformable sediments with a dimensionless thickness of seabed h h l w i e the ratio of the thickness of the seabed to wavelength ranging from 0 1 to 1 0 the other parameters for waves and sediments are the same as those tabulated in table 1 figs 16 and 17 show how variations in the thickness of sediment affect the distribution of pore water pressure and concentration of solute in a non deformable and deformable seabed respectively fig 16 a and fig 17 a show that the attenuation of pore pressure in depth becomes more apparent in a deformable seabed than in a non deformable seabed particularly when h less than 0 3 this means that a larger velocity of pore water as well as a larger concentration of solute will be induced in a deformable sediment as the comparison between fig 16 b and fig 17 b shows when the deformability of seabed soil is ignored the vertical gradient of pore pressure versus soil depth gradually increases as sediment increases in thickness to a given value of h 0 5 fig 16 a for deformable sediments the most significant attenuation in pore water pressure in depth occurs when the thickness of the seabed is h 0 2 fig 17 a this is much larger than a non deformable seabed which indicates that variations in the thickness of sediment can have a more vigorous effect on the transport of solute when the impact of soil deformation is considered fig 18 a shows the amplitude of coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion d dyy at the seabed surface versus the dimensionless sediment thicknesses h as with those shown in figs 16 and 17 the effect of seabed thickness on the rate of solute transport is always greater in a deformable seabed than that in a non deformable seabed in non deformable cases the coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion d dyy increases slightly as h increases until it becomes 0 5 above which d dyy remains almost unchanged with variations of h in a deformable seabed d dyy increases as h increases to 0 2 beyond this value d dyy decreases significantly as h increases fig 18 b shows the ratio of d dyy at the seabed surface between deformable and non deformable cases versus the seabed thickness for various shear moduli the enhancement of solute transport by wave induced soil deformation becomes most apparent when the dimensionless thickness of seabed is between 0 1 and 0 2 there is a threshold value of h 0 8 below which the coupled effect of wave induced soil deformation and seepage flow becomes more significant especially for sediment with a relatively small shear modulus 4 2 3 dimensionless wave parameters the wave steepness h hw lw and the relative water depth d dw lw are two commonly used dimensionless wave parameters that represent the intensity of wave pressure experienced by the seabed soil here the extent to which soil deformation affects the rate of solute migration for different wave scenarios is discussed as mentioned previously the seepage velocity and longitudinal mechanical dispersion coefficient are related to the gradient of pore water pressure in sedimentary soil as shown in fig 19 a in a deformable or non deformable seabed variations in the wave steepness have almost no effect on the change of dimensionless pore water pressure p p 0 p 0 is the amplitude of wave pressure at the seabed surface along the depth this means the extent to which the rate of solute transport is enhanced in a deformable seabed compared to a rigid seabed is always the same regardless of the change in wave steepness on the other hand there is a close relationship between the relative water depth and the dimensionless pore water pressure fig 19 b especially for a rigid seabed where the vertical gradient of pore water pressure decreases significantly as d increases in shallow layers of soil this implies that the relative water depth may have a significant influence on the rate of solute transport in marine sediment as shown by fig 20 in each case the ratio of d dyy between deformable and non deformable sediments r increases significantly as the relative water depth increases to 0 3 but then at a decreasing rate an increase in the relative depth of water from 0 1 to 0 3 would lead to an increase in the magnitude of r by about 60 80 in those cases where the dimensionless mechanical dispersion coefficient or shear modulus varied the ratio of d dyy between deformable and non deformable sediments r can reach up to 85 for sediment with small dimensionless coefficient of mechanical dispersion 4 3 effect of wave nonlinearity waves that propagate over the ocean always exhibit nonlinear behaviour to some extent this phenomenon may become more apparent for large waves in shallow water jeng and lin 1997 hsu et al 2019 theories of stokes waves and cnoidal waves have mainly been used to describe the nonlinearity of waves in coastal and oceanic engineering whereas the cnoidal wave theory can describe the performance of waves in shallow water more accurately such as when the depth of water is less than 1 10 of the wavelength dean and dalrymple 1991 based on the second order stokes wave and the first order cnoidal wave the effect of wave nonlinearity on the transport of solute into sediment with and without considering the impact of wave induced soil deformation is investigated in this section using the following wave parameters water depth 6 m wave height 2 5 m wave period 8 s the wave pressure at the surface of the seabed induced by a second order stokes wave can be expressed as jeng and lin 1997 21 p b x t p 0 c 11 cos k w x ω t c 02 c 20 c 22 cos 2 k w x ω t where 22 c 11 1 c 02 k w h w 16 s i n h k w d w 1 ω 0 4 23 c 20 k w h w 16 s i n h k w d w 1 ω 0 4 3 1 ω 0 8 ω 0 4 c o s h 2 k w d w 24 c 22 k w h w 16 s i n h k w d w 1 ω 0 4 3 ω 0 4 ω 0 4 cosh 2 k w d w 25 ω 0 2 g k w tanh k w d w the first order cnoidal wave induced pressure at the surface of the seabed can be calculated by using the following expression hsu et al 2019 26 p b x t γ w h w j 1 n j π 2 m k m 2 sinh j π k 1 m k m cos j k w x ω t where k m is the first complete elliptic integral m is the elliptic parameter and n is the upper bound of summation n 30 fig 21 shows the evolution of solute mass versus the number of wave cycles in a deformable and non deformable seabed fig 21 a shows the results based on a linear wave a second order stokes wave and a first order cnoidal wave and fig 21 b shows the difference in the mass of solute between the results predicted by the first order cnoidal wave and the linear wave as with previous discussions the mass of solute in a deformable seabed is always greater than in a non deformable seabed regardless of the type of waves exerted onto the seabed in all cases there is an apparent discrepancy in the mass of solute transported between results based on the first order cnoidal wave and the linear wave where the difference is approximately 0 32 g after 3000 wave cycles in deformable case this is about 2 times the difference when the deformability of seabed soil is omitted fig 21 b on the other hand the difference of solute mass between results based on stokes wave and linear wave is very small fig 21 a to explain these phenomena fig 22 a and b show the distribution of wave pressure and coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion d dyy at the interface between water and sediment within a single wavelength according with solutions based on the linear wave the second order stokes wave and the first order cnoidal wave the results presented here are for a deformable seabed only as fig 22 a shows the behaviour of a nonlinear wave with a steeper wave crest and a flatter trough is reflected very well in a waveform based on the first order cnoidal wave and the second order stokes wave moreover the behaviour predicted by the first order cnoidal wave is more nonlinear than the second order stokes wave for example the pressures at the crest of the cnoidal wave and the second order stokes wave are respectively about 165 and 120 of the linear wave whereas the pressures at the trough of the cnoidal wave and the second order stokes wave are both about 80 of the linear wave corresponding to this nonlinear and asymmetric distribution the period averaged dd yy for the solutions based on the first order cnoidal wave and the second order stokes wave are respectively increased by about 15 and 3 than for the solutions based on the linear wave this explains why the mass of solute that is transported into the sediment under the first order cnoidal waves is greater than under linear waves whereas the mass of solute predicted by stokes waves is almost the same as by linear waves 5 conclusions based on biot s consolidation theory and the two dimensional advection dispersion equation a numerical model for transport of non reactive solutes into a deformable porous medium under oceanic waves is established to investigate the coupled effect of seepage flow and soil deformation on solute migration the two components of the numerical model i e the pore fluid seepage in deformable sediments and the solute transport were validated separately by comparing them with the analytical and experimental data available in the literature this coupled model was further validated against experiments for solute transport in deformable sediments induced by wave loading and consolidation the characteristics and mechanism of solute transport into deformable sediments driven by periodic waves have been described and discussed the effects of parameters such as the shear modulus the non dimensional coefficient of mechanical dispersion the dimensionless sediment thickness wave steepness and relative water depth as well as wave nonlinearity on the solute transport in deformable sediments were investigated based on the simulated results the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 solute mass is more likely to be driven into deformable sediments by oceanic waves due to the increased seepage of pore water in shallow layers of soil that is coupled with the wave induced deformation of soil unlike a rigid seabed the volumetric strain of soil in shallow layers of a deformable seabed will attenuate quickly along the depth and lead to higher vertical pore water velocity and a larger coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion this phenomenon becomes more apparent in seabed soil with a small shear modulus and hydraulic conductivity e g fine sand or silt when the sediment thickness is less than 0 8 times the wavelength 2 the enhancement that wave induced soil deformation has on the rate of solute transport as defined by the ratio of the coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion between deformable and non deformable sediments may reach up to the order of 85 although this enhancement is independent of wave steepness it increases by 60 80 as the relative water depth increases from 0 1 to 0 3 and then at a decreasing rate this varying trend remains the same regardless of changes in the magnitudes of dimensionless mechanical dispersion coefficient related to grain size and permeability or the shear modulus 3 the effect of sediment thickness on solute transport is more pronounced when the impact of coupled wave induced soil deformation and seepage flow is considered where the rate of solute transport increases significantly with an increase in the sediment thickness to 0 2 times the wavelength this then decreases as the seabed thickness continues to increase to a wavelength for a non deformable seabed the transport of solute increases slightly as the sediment becomes thicker with the maximum rate occurring when the seabed thickness becomes almost half the wavelength the enhancement of solute transport due to wave induced soil deformation can reach a peak value when the sediment thickness is 0 1 0 2 times the wavelength 4 due to their nonlinear behaviour shallow water waves e g the first order cnoidal wave can accelerate the rate at which solute is transported more than linear waves the period averaged coefficient of longitudinal mechanical dispersion at the deformable seabed surface as determined by the first order cnoidal waves can increase by about 15 more than linear waves while a stokes wave is more applicable to deeper water its enhancement of solute transport compared to a linear wave is negligible in a deformable and non deformable seabed credit authorship contribution statement xiaoli liu conceptualization methodology formal analysis

2737,tropical cyclones are often accompanied by heavy rainfall high tides and strong wind speeds which can induce serious compound floods resulting in immeasurable losses to coastal areas studies on flood risk for ocean engineering by compound impacts of rain tide and wind are still limited to date the west artificial island of hong kong zhuhai macao bridge is a vital link between the immersed tunnel and the bridge the flooding on the artificial island under the compound effects of rain tide wind and the flood risk of cars were analyzed in this study we propose rain tide wind joint

rainfall and wave overtopping the 24 hour flood process and maximum flood depth distribution of each scenario are presented the car damage in floods by the compound effects was assessed to derive the probability car damage curve for risk assessment the study provides technical support for artificial island flood prevention and disaster risk reduction keywords flood disaster risk assessment rain tide wind compound artificial island car damage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods have an extensive impact range and are among the most severe threats to coastal areas fang et al 2020 matsuba et al 2021 the floods induced by the co occurrence of multiple drivers are compound flood events that can exacerbate the flood impacts compared to floods under single disaster drivers jang and chang 2022 shen et al 2019 in coastal cities compound flooding during tropical cyclones often forms under the concurrent effects of storm surges heavy rains and enormous waves gao et al 2020 2021 hsiao et al 2021 jane et al 2020 compound floods have more complex flood processes and cause more severe losses to coastal economies couasnon et al 2018 jang and chang 2022 shi et al 2022 due to the global climate change and coastal urban development compound flood disasters continue to raise attention from the scientific and engineering communities many researchers have studied the joint probability of multiple flood drivers and conducted risk assessments for compound floods in coastal areas in recent years bevacqua et al 2017 couasnon et al 2018 hsiao et al 2021 kang et al 2019 li et al 2019 lin et al 2020 bevacqua et al 2017 studied the compound flood events under the combined effects of storm surge and high river runoff and defined the impact of compound floods as a function of sea and river levels by quantifying the risk through uncertainty analysis couasnon et al 2018 found that multivariate dependence among flood disaster drivers is critical for the accurate representation of flood risk in coastal catchments prone to compound riverine and coastal interactions hsiao et al 2021 assessed the flood risk by a hydraulic model with the compound effect of storm surges and rainfall hasan tanim and goharian 2021 developed a multivariate framework for storm surges and rainfall in urban compound flooding shen et al 2019 assessed the flood risk under the combined impact of tide and rainfall in coastal areas using the hydrodynamic model existing studies have studied the compound flood events caused by multiple flood drivers such as rivers storm surges and rain the interaction and dependence of multiple flooding triggers have been analyzed and the hydrodynamic models have been used to simulate flooding under joint impacts tropical cyclones induce compound floods by multi factors of rain storm surge and wind in coastal areas among which strong wind and high tide could generate overtopping the interactions and compound effects of flood drivers of rain storm surges and wind may result in damage to ocean engineering during tropical cyclones shen et al 2019 torres et al 2015 most studies about coastal compound floods were focused on assessing the rain and tide but few studies analyzed the combined effects of rain and overtopping for protected coastal areas with wave walls hasan tanim and goharian 2021 hsiao et al 2021 torres et al 2015 besides most researchers mainly aim at flooding in the coastal urban cities but few studies analyze the flood risk for large scale traffic infrastructure in the coastal region li et al 2022 shi et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 extreme tropical cyclones frequently hit the pearl river estuary in the south china sea zhang et al 2017 where the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge hzmb is located as an important ocean traffic infrastructure hu et al 2015 the west artificial island of hzmb is a vital link between the immersed tunnel and the bridge during extreme tropical cyclones multiple flood drivers could induce compound flooding which greatly threatens the safety of the artificial island jang and chang 2022 shi et al 2022 torres et al 2015 for example the highest sea levels of super typhoon hato in 2017 and mangkhut in 2018 were 4 5 m and 4 7 m respectively hko 2022 tropical cyclones could also generate strong winds to produce high waves super typhoon mangkhut s maximum wind speed was 220 km h hko 2022 although the extreme tide levels would not directly influence the artificial island surrounded by high wave walls the waves induced by concurrent strong wind speeds and high tide levels might climb over the wave wall and enter the island rainfall is also a significant factor in island flooding during tropical cyclones the rainfall amount during typhoon t sam in august 1999 reached 600 mm hko 2022 therefore it is therefore critical to analyze the joint probabilities of compound scenarios and associated flooding consequences for the artificial island where flood risk of car damage under compound flood scenarios is desired to be quantitatively assessed martínez gomariz et al 2018 xia et al 2014 however there is still a lack of studies that conduct the flood risk assessment of artificial islands considering the compound effects of rain tide wind during tropical cyclones this study evaluates compound flood disasters on artificial islands and conducts the risk assessment of cars hit by flooding under the compound effects of rain tide and wind the workflow is shown in fig 1 rain tide wind scenarios with joint probability for compound flood are first proposed the hydrodynamic model is then established to simulate flood by rainfall and wave overtopping for compound scenarios the risk of car damage by compound floods is finally assessed based on the compound flood scenarios and car depth damage curve 2 study area the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge hzmb is a complex sea crossing traffic project connecting hong kong zhuhai and macau in china as shown in fig 2 a it is located in the lingdingyang area of the pearl river estuary in the south china sea the hzmb spans 55 km including the main bridge covering 29 6 km a 6 7 kilometer immersed tunnel and two artificial islands hu et al 2015 the east and west ends of the immersed tunnel are each connected to an artificial island the study area is the west artificial island of the immersed tunnel of the hzmb fig 2b it covers an area of about 100 000 square meters with an east west length of about 630 m and a north south length of about 200 m as shown in fig 2c it is created by reclaiming land in the sea and serve as a traffic channel between the tunnel and bridge for daily transportation and sightseeing there are drainage pipes buildings roads and other infrastructure on the island the main road in the middle connects the bridge on the west side and the immersed tunnel on the east side it is an open section from the west and extends eastward into the island as a tunnel the island has breakwater structures including the wave wall and slope with concrete armour dolosse presented in fig 2c the wave wall is higher than the average sea level by 8 m under normal weather conditions the sea level is well below the wave wall s top this region has a subtropical monsoon climate with high temperatures and abundant precipitation weather disasters in this sea area are frequent and tropical cyclones i e typhoons are the most severe disaster tropical cyclones might induce flood disasters on the artificial island by the compound effects of rainfall and wave overtopping as shown in fig 3 high tide and strong wind are the major triggers of wave overtopping the three factors of tropical cyclones i e rainfall tide level and wind speed are analyzed for flood disaster on the artificial island flood on the island s surface and entering the immersed tunnel will present a danger to vehicles it is vital to assess the flood risk and vehicle safety of the artificial island by compound floods 3 methodology 3 1 joint probability of rain tide wind the pearl river estuary was affected by an average of 30 tropical cyclones each year between 1961 and 2010 according to the hong kong observatory s tropical cyclone annual reports hko 2022 during tropical cyclones rainfall tide and wind are not independent events and extreme tide rain and wind values may be encountered in an event high tide levels may accompany high wind speeds but not absolutely as shown in fig 4 rainfall intensity might be small when the tide levels and wind speeds are extreme for example super typhoon mangkhut had extreme high tide levels and wind speeds of 4 71 m and 180 km h respectively while the rainfall was only 180 mm hko 2022 the observation data for tropical cyclone events from 1990 to 2019 recorded in hongkong were collected and obtained from hong kong observatory hko 2022 the maximum values of total rainfall wind speed and tide level for the top 30 tropical cyclone events in the wind speed ranking are selected and adopted in this study shown in fig 4 the pearson correlation coefficients are used to assess dependence among variables the pearson correlation coefficients for rain tide and rain wind are 0 2 and 0 0 respectively showing a weak correlation the pearson correlation coefficient for wind tide level is 0 4 which shows a moderate correlation therefore the joint probability for the wind tide is considered and rainfall is assumed as an independent variable during tropical cyclone events the probability of the total rainfall amount the highest tide level and the maximum wind speed recorded for 30 tropical cyclone events from 1990 to 2019 were obtained by frequency analysis let x be the rainfall amount for tropical cyclone events the rainfall amount probability p r p x x is shown in fig 5 a let y and z be the maximum wind speed and tide level for tropical cyclone events the joint probability of maximum wind speed and tide level is defined as p t w p y y z z as shown in fig 5 b since we assume that rainfall amount is an independent variable for wind and tide we get the rain tide wind joint probability shown by p r t w p r p t w 3 2 compound scenarios design 3 2 1 rain tide wind 24 h process the rainfall tide level and wind speed will vary with the distance to and intensity of the tropical cyclone and there is no universal distribution for them in this study the normalized distribution processes of the three drivers are constructed the normalized value of a driver at a certain moment is defined as the ratio of the value at that moment to the maximum value in the entire process the 24 hour 24 h wind speeds and tide levels from the observed data in this region during tropical cyclones are employed to generalize the normalized distribution pattern the 24 h normalized tide level distribution in fig 6 a was obtained by fitting the observed 24 h tide process of typhoon mangkhut from 2 00 on 16 september 2018 to 2 00 on 17 septem 2018 and typhoon hato from 0 00 to 24 00 on 23 august 2017 hko 2022 the 24 h normalized wind speed distribution process in fig 6 b was obtained by fitting the observed 24 h wind process of typhoon pakhar from 19 00 on 26 september 2017 to 19 00 on 27 september 2017 and typhoon hato from 0 00 to 24 00 on 23 august 2017 hko 2022 extreme rainstorms are common in the pearl river estuary rainfall during tropical cyclones commonly lasts longer than one day the normalized 24 h rain process is adopted from the shenzhen rainstorm intensity design manual smb 2015 as shown in fig 6 c the 24 h process can be constructed by multiplying the normalized distribution process with a given maximum value of a driver 3 2 2 wave overtopping by tide wind strong winds generate high waves and high tide levels help the waves climb across wave walls during tropical cyclones a large number of surging waves endangers the safety of the artificial island the estimation of wave overtopping is based on the significant wave height and tide level the significant wave height and period are calculated through the wind speed according to the code of hydrology for sea harbour mot 2013 as in the following equation 1 1 g h 1 3 u 2 5 5 10 3 g f u 2 0 35 t a n h 30 g d u 2 0 8 g f u 2 0 35 1 2 g t s u 0 55 g f u 2 0 233 t a n h 2 3 30 g d u 2 0 8 g f u 2 0 35 where h 1 3 and t s are the significant wave height m and the wave period s respectively u is the average wind speed m s f is the fetch length m g is the gravity acceleration m s2 and d is the water depth m wave overtopping is calculated according to the formula in the eurotop manual van der meer et al 2018 eurotop is the wave overtopping design manual for coastal defences and related structures the wave overtopping process under different significant wave heights and tide levels can be obtained the artificial island has the wave wall and armoured slope with dolosse the wave overtopping discharge formula for the armoured slope is described in eq 2 2 q g h m 0 3 0 1035 exp 1 35 r c h m 0 γ f γ β 1 3 where q is the wave overtopping discharge m3 m s h m 0 is the incident significant wave height at the toe of seawall m r c is the crest freeboard m γ f is the influence factor for roughness on the slope and is 0 43 for the dolosse γ β is the influence factor for oblique wave attack and γ β 1 0 0063 β and β is the angle of wave attack relative to normal on structure the wave overtopping discharge for the artificial island under different combinations of tide levels and wind speeds are shown in fig 7 3 3 flood model and risk assessment 3 3 1 flood model mike is a coupled hydrodynamic model for the numerical simulation of water flow in drainage and overland dhi 2022 the coupled model of drainage and overland of the artificial island is established by mike the unsteady flow calculation in the pipe flow model is solved by the conservation of momentum and mass via the saint venant equation the drainage model is used for the rainfall runoff process and flow simulation in the pipe network the model catchments are divided using the tyson polygon method the underlying surface of the island is mostly hard and includes buildings and roads with a 0 85 impermeability rate in the model the rainfall drainage network in the model has 128 pipes 105 sub catchments 108 nodes and 10 pipeline outlets that link to the outside in fig 8 the drainage outlets adopt check valves and the backflow of seawater into the drainage pipe during the high tide period is not considered in this model the drainage network and overland model are coupled using manhole connections which link the water flow between the surface and pipe the coupling to nodes is designed for the interaction of water when a manhole is overtopped or when overland flow enters the water network the overland model is used to simulate surface floods from collection system networks and discharges the overland model uses triangular grids to spatially discretize the study area with a total of 47 000 grids as shown in fig 9 the artificial island elevation is generated by interpolating the elevation scattered points in arcgis the main road goes down the slope into the tunnel from west to east and the longitudinal gradient is about 3 the time series of rainfall and wave overtopping discharges are boundary conditions in the flood model the eastern boundary of the tunnel is an open boundary and water flows out freely the coupled model was used to simulate the drainage and flooding process of the artificial island caused by wave overtopping discharges and rainfall during tropical cyclones 3 3 2 flood risk assessment of cars the artificial island is an important transportation hub connecting the bridge and the immersed tunnel with daily traffic the artificial island is the only place to pass from the bridge to the tunnel and many cars pass daily vehicles are the most vulnerable objects directly threatened by flooding that results in damage it will cause damage to vehicle components or even scrap the entire vehicle when the flood submerges vehicles to a certain depth the vehicular depth damage curve fema 2006 is adopted to estimate the loss to cars in floods as shown in fig 10 the design speed of the main road in the middle of the artificial island is assumed to be 90 km h with a safety distance of 90 m and it is a two way six lane road with a length of about 630 m the secondary road around the artificial island has a speed limit of 30 km h with a safety distance of 30 m it is an opposite two lane road with a total length of about 1100 m the cars on the main road and the secondary road around the island are assumed to be uniformly distributed according to the safe driving distance and all vehicles are driven at the designed speed the total number of cars on the artificial island road is approximately 114 cars when the road is fully loaded the hydrodynamic model is used to simulate flood depth for various locations in compound scenarios the car damage for simulated floods on the roads is calculated through the car depth damage curve the car damage distributions on the island are assessed for all compound scenarios based on the flood model 4 results and discussions 4 1 compound scenarios compound scenarios are designed by combining the joint probability of flooding drivers including rain tide and wind with their 24 h process during tropical cyclones twelve scenarios with different rainfall tide levels and wind speeds were constructed with the rain tide wind joint probability to comprehensively study artificial island flood disasters table 1 shows the maximum wind speed ws m s maximum tide level tl m astronomical tide and storm surge and total rainfall ra mm during 24 h process for each scenario the od m3 m s and wh m are the maximum wave overtopping discharge and the highest significant wave height the p r t w is the rain tide wind joint probability of the scenarios the 24 h time series of rainfall wind speed and tide level for 12 compound scenarios are based on the normalized pattern and maximum value the effective wave height and wave overtopping discharge for various wind speeds and tide levels were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 the 24 h time series of the significant wave height crest freeboard and wave overtopping discharge for all scenarios are calculated scenario 1 is the most extreme in all designed scenarios with the maximum overtopping discharge and rainfall there is no overtopping discharge when the wind speed and tide level are lower than 42 m s and 3 2 m respectively scenarios 8 10 11 and 12 had no overtopping discharge in these scenarios floods are caused only by rain 4 2 flooding process of the extreme scenario the 24 h processes of flooding for the 12 compound scenarios are simulated to obtain the flood depth by the flood model scenario 1 has the most extreme rainfall tide level and wind speed of all simulation scenes the rain tide wind joint probability of scenario 1 is about 0 001 the 24 h time series of rainfall wind speed tide level significant wave height crest freeboard and wave overtopping discharge for scenario 1 are shown in fig 11 the flood conditions at different times during the 24 h for scenario 1 are simulated shown in fig 12 after the first 4 h the artificial island s secondary road turns start to be flooded and there is little inundation in the middle tunnel at this time the flood is caused by rainfall and no waves cross the wave wall after 8 h the outer circle of the artificial island is flooded because of wave starts entering the island after 10 h the entire island is almost flooded and the rainfall has already reached its peak after 12 h tide level wind speed and wave discharge reached their peak leading to serious flooding with the maximum depth of the secondary road turns reaching 1 2 m as the rainfall and wave discharge passes their peak values the flood depth is greatly reduced and the depth for most areas is less than 0 2 m after 14 h the flood disappears in most areas with continuous drainage and there is still some inundation at the turns after 18 h most locations are flooded after 10 h and more severe flooding occurs after 12 h the island will be inundated under extreme rainfall and waves although the island has drainage pipelines and wave proof structures although the joint probability of this extreme flood event is as low as 0 001 it is important to prepare for this kind of low probability high consequences extreme event by strengthening flood warning and prevention 4 3 flood scenarios comparison the floods for 24 h for 12 scenarios of the artificial island are simulated and the maximum flood depth during 24 h for each simulation scenario is shown in fig 13 the related conditions for the 12 scenarios are shown in table 1 scenario 1 is the most extreme compound scenario with the most rainfall and overtopping resulting in the most severe flooding the maximum flood depth in the middle tunnel and secondary road reached 0 5 m and 1 2 m respectively scenarios 1 and 2 have the same rainfall of 595 mm but the maximum wave discharge of scenario 1 is much more than in scenario 2 the flood depth in scenario 1 is much more serious reaching 0 5 m in scenario 1 and 0 25 m in scenario 2 in the middle tunnel scenario 2 has more intense rainfall but wave overtopping discharge is less than in scenario 3 the flood in scenario 3 is more serious indicating that wave overtopping aggravates flooding scenarios 3 and 5 have different rainfalls but the same overtopping discharge and their overall flood depth is not much different scenario 5 has less rainfall but more wave overtopping and the flooding situation is more serious than in scenario 4 from the comparison above we note that wave overtopping is a crucial factor that could affect the flooding of the artificial island which should be considered in flood control design as the wind tide and rainfall decrease the flooding severity conditions for these scenarios are reduced in scenarios 7 to 12 the flood depth on most island areas is less than 0 2 m except for the secondary road turns the flooding depth at the secondary road is relatively larger than other areas in these scenarios indicating that it is vulnerable to being flooded and dangerous for people the rainfall in scenarios 10 11 and 12 is less than 315 mm and only the places on the secondary road and some areas on the main road are flooded on the island under rainfall 4 4 risk assessment of cars the artificial island is an important traffic hub and it is essential to assess the flood risk for cars on it the simulated maximum flooding depths on the island for compound scenarios are obtained by the flood model the car damage curve is used to estimate damage degree in different flood depths the maximum car damage degree distributions on the island for 12 scenarios are shown in fig 14 the damage degree in scenario 1 is the most serious the car damage in most positions reaches more than 30 the most severe damage at the secondary road turning is over 90 and at the middle tunnel is 40 in scenario 2 the overall damage degree reduces a lot in the tunnel with a damage degree of 20 the damage conditions for scenarios 7 to 12 are reduced a lot car losses on the island are all less than 20 except for the secondary road turns the turning of the secondary road has relatively large car damage for all scenarios so the cars should keep away from this position during tropical cyclones cars in most positions for scenarios 10 11 and 12 would not be damaged but there will be a little damage on the secondary road the maximum flood depths for different scenarios at nine locations p1 p9 are shown in fig 15 a these nine locations are shown in fig 2 c and location p5 is inside the tunnel the flood at p2 is the most severe and the maximum water depth reaches about 1 2 m for the most extreme scenario the maximum water depth at p5 reaches 0 5 m in the most extreme scenario the maximum water depth at position p7 in these scenarios is relatively large reaching 0 8 m in the most extreme case cars and personnel should stay away from the dangerous locations of p2 and p7 the flood depth in most locations is less than 0 5 m in all scenarios except for p2 and p7 the water depth of p1 and p3 in all scenarios is less than 0 3 m which is safe for cars the maximum car damage at nine places in different scenarios is shown in fig 15 b flooding at the p2 and p7 locations cause greater damage to cars than in other areas during floods there is a 0 001 probability of 90 car damage and a 0 02 probability of 50 car damage at the p2 location there is about a 0 01 probability of 30 damage to cars at the p7 position the probability of maximum car damage greater than 10 is less than 0 01 at tunnel p5 the maximum car damage degree is always less than 20 at p1 and p3 for all scenarios posing little risk to cars the probability of car damage greater than 20 is less than 0 01 at most locations except for locations p2 and p7 the total number of cars on the artificial island roads is distributed based on the safe driving distance of the design speed we assumed the road is fully loaded to maximize the estimated car risk and there are about 114 cars the car damage degree for different road locations is obtained by simulated flood depth and car depth damage curve all cars damage is added to get the total loss in flood scenarios the total flood risk of cars on the artificial island is assessed for the 12 scenarios in fig 16 the probability of total car loss greater than 40 caused by the most severe flood scenario is about 0 001 the probability of the total car loss greater than 10 is less than 0 02 the probability of the total car loss greater than 2 is less than 0 1 the tail of the risk curve demonstrates that low probability may induce car losses it is crucial to enhance early warning and evacuate cars in time when tropical cyclones come especially in dangerous areas 5 conclusions the hzmb artificial island is a complex cross sea project and a vital traffic connection from the bridge to tunnel it is essential to conduct the flood risk assessment and car safety evaluations as tropical cyclones hit the area frequently in this study the joint probability of rain tide wind scenarios is proposed to analyze compound floods then coupled hydrodynamic model of drainage and overland of the island is established to simulate the flood for compound scenarios the most severe flood condition of each scenario was evaluated and the flood risk for car damage on the artificial island was assessed major conclusions are given as follows flooding induced by tropical cyclones is triggered by the multi factor compound of high tide strong wind and heavy rain in which high tide levels and strong wind jointly result in wave overtopping wave overtopping is a vital factor in artificial island flooding the compound floods with small probabilities are more serious when wave overtopping and rainfall are both extreme the flooding depth and car damage at the secondary road turnings are more serious than in other places which are vulnerable to flooding and dangerous for people the flood risk of car damage by the compound impacts is assessed based on the simulated flood scenarios the risk assessment results could provide theoretical guidance and technical support for evaluating existing flood control and designing future mitigation measures the risk curve tail shows a moderate probability for minor vehicle damage suggesting that early warning is necessary during tropical cyclones whether the risk is acceptable depends on the risk evaluation criteria it remains an open research question to be solved however limitations exist in the current study and will be solved in the future firstly the rain tide wind scenarios with joint probabilities were generated based on limited historical data for tropical cyclones we will study more comprehensive compound flood events and multivariate joint probability functions in the future secondly the distribution of cars is assumed when the road is fully loaded based on the safety drive distance while the actual number of cars will reduce a lot during tropical cyclones car damage at maximum water depth is used to assess risk and damage reduction at other times is ignored the car flood risk is a conservative estimate larger than the real situation thirdly the drainage model lacks consideration of pumps on the artificial island the peaks of the tide and wind are synchronized to maximize the compound effect which makes the simulated flooding larger than the actual conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

2737,tropical cyclones are often accompanied by heavy rainfall high tides and strong wind speeds which can induce serious compound floods resulting in immeasurable losses to coastal areas studies on flood risk for ocean engineering by compound impacts of rain tide and wind are still limited to date the west artificial island of hong kong zhuhai macao bridge is a vital link between the immersed tunnel and the bridge the flooding on the artificial island under the compound effects of rain tide wind and the flood risk of cars were analyzed in this study we propose rain tide wind joint

tide wind compound artificial island car damage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods have an extensive impact range and are among the most severe threats to coastal areas fang et al 2020 matsuba et al 2021 the floods induced by the co occurrence of multiple drivers are compound flood events that can exacerbate the flood impacts compared to floods under single disaster drivers jang and chang 2022 shen et al 2019 in coastal cities compound flooding during tropical cyclones often forms under the concurrent effects of storm surges heavy rains and enormous waves gao et al 2020 2021 hsiao et al 2021 jane et al 2020 compound floods have more complex flood processes and cause more severe losses to coastal economies couasnon et al 2018 jang and chang 2022 shi et al 2022 due to the global climate change and coastal urban development compound flood disasters continue to raise attention from the scientific and engineering communities many researchers have studied the joint probability of multiple flood drivers and conducted risk assessments for compound floods in coastal areas in recent years bevacqua et al 2017 couasnon et al 2018 hsiao et al 2021 kang et al 2019 li et al 2019 lin et al 2020 bevacqua et al 2017 studied the compound flood events under the combined effects of storm surge and high river runoff and defined the impact of compound floods as a function of sea and river levels by quantifying the risk through uncertainty analysis couasnon et al 2018 found that multivariate dependence among flood disaster drivers is critical for the accurate representation of flood risk in coastal catchments prone to compound riverine and coastal interactions hsiao et al 2021 assessed the flood risk by a hydraulic model with the compound effect of storm surges and rainfall hasan tanim and goharian 2021 developed a multivariate framework for storm surges and rainfall in urban compound flooding shen et al 2019 assessed the flood risk under the combined impact of tide and rainfall in coastal areas using the hydrodynamic model existing studies have studied the compound flood events caused by multiple flood drivers such as rivers storm surges and rain the interaction and dependence of multiple flooding triggers have been analyzed and the hydrodynamic models have been used to simulate flooding under joint impacts tropical cyclones induce compound floods by multi factors of rain storm surge and wind in coastal areas among which strong wind and high tide could generate overtopping the interactions and compound effects of flood drivers of rain storm surges and wind may result in damage to ocean engineering during tropical cyclones shen et al 2019 torres et al 2015 most studies about coastal compound floods were focused on assessing the rain and tide but few studies analyzed the combined effects of rain and overtopping for protected coastal areas with wave walls hasan tanim and goharian 2021 hsiao et al 2021 torres et al 2015 besides most researchers mainly aim at flooding in the coastal urban cities but few studies analyze the flood risk for large scale traffic infrastructure in the coastal region li et al 2022 shi et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 extreme tropical cyclones frequently hit the pearl river estuary in the south china sea zhang et al 2017 where the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge hzmb is located as an important ocean traffic infrastructure hu et al 2015 the west artificial island of hzmb is a vital link between the immersed tunnel and the bridge during extreme tropical cyclones multiple flood drivers could induce compound flooding which greatly threatens the safety of the artificial island jang and chang 2022 shi et al 2022 torres et al 2015 for example the highest sea levels of super typhoon hato in 2017 and mangkhut in 2018 were 4 5 m and 4 7 m respectively hko 2022 tropical cyclones could also generate strong winds to produce high waves super typhoon mangkhut s maximum wind speed was 220 km h hko 2022 although the extreme tide levels would not directly influence the artificial island surrounded by high wave walls the waves induced by concurrent strong wind speeds and high tide levels might climb over the wave wall and enter the island rainfall is also a significant factor in island flooding during tropical cyclones the rainfall amount during typhoon t sam in august 1999 reached 600 mm hko 2022 therefore it is therefore critical to analyze the joint probabilities of compound scenarios and associated flooding consequences for the artificial island where flood risk of car damage under compound flood scenarios is desired to be quantitatively assessed martínez gomariz et al 2018 xia et al 2014 however there is still a lack of studies that conduct the flood risk assessment of artificial islands considering the compound effects of rain tide wind during tropical cyclones this study evaluates compound flood disasters on artificial islands and conducts the risk assessment of cars hit by flooding under the compound effects of rain tide and wind the workflow is shown in fig 1 rain tide wind scenarios with joint probability for compound flood are first proposed the hydrodynamic model is then established to simulate flood by rainfall and wave overtopping for compound scenarios the risk of car damage by compound floods is finally assessed based on the compound flood scenarios and car depth damage curve 2 study area the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge hzmb is a complex sea crossing traffic project connecting hong kong zhuhai and macau in china as shown in fig 2 a it is located in the lingdingyang area of the pearl river estuary in the south china sea the hzmb spans 55 km including the main bridge covering 29 6 km a 6 7 kilometer immersed tunnel and two artificial islands hu et al 2015 the east and west ends of the immersed tunnel are each connected to an artificial island the study area is the west artificial island of the immersed tunnel of the hzmb fig 2b it covers an area of about 100 000 square meters with an east west length of about 630 m and a north south length of about 200 m as shown in fig 2c it is created by reclaiming land in the sea and serve as a traffic channel between the tunnel and bridge for daily transportation and sightseeing there are drainage pipes buildings roads and other infrastructure on the island the main road in the middle connects the bridge on the west side and the immersed tunnel on the east side it is an open section from the west and extends eastward into the island as a tunnel the island has breakwater structures including the wave wall and slope with concrete armour dolosse presented in fig 2c the wave wall is higher than the average sea level by 8 m under normal weather conditions the sea level is well below the wave wall s top this region has a subtropical monsoon climate with high temperatures and abundant precipitation weather disasters in this sea area are frequent and tropical cyclones i e typhoons are the most severe disaster tropical cyclones might induce flood disasters on the artificial island by the compound effects of rainfall and wave overtopping as shown in fig 3 high tide and strong wind are the major triggers of wave overtopping the three factors of tropical cyclones i e rainfall tide level and wind speed are analyzed for flood disaster on the artificial island flood on the island s surface and entering the immersed tunnel will present a danger to vehicles it is vital to assess the flood risk and vehicle safety of the artificial island by compound floods 3 methodology 3 1 joint probability of rain tide wind the pearl river estuary was affected by an average of 30 tropical cyclones each year between 1961 and 2010 according to the hong kong observatory s tropical cyclone annual reports hko 2022 during tropical cyclones rainfall tide and wind are not independent events and extreme tide rain and wind values may be encountered in an event high tide levels may accompany high wind speeds but not absolutely as shown in fig 4 rainfall intensity might be small when the tide levels and wind speeds are extreme for example super typhoon mangkhut had extreme high tide levels and wind speeds of 4 71 m and 180 km h respectively while the rainfall was only 180 mm hko 2022 the observation data for tropical cyclone events from 1990 to 2019 recorded in hongkong were collected and obtained from hong kong observatory hko 2022 the maximum values of total rainfall wind speed and tide level for the top 30 tropical cyclone events in the wind speed ranking are selected and adopted in this study shown in fig 4 the pearson correlation coefficients are used to assess dependence among variables the pearson correlation coefficients for rain tide and rain wind are 0 2 and 0 0 respectively showing a weak correlation the pearson correlation coefficient for wind tide level is 0 4 which shows a moderate correlation therefore the joint probability for the wind tide is considered and rainfall is assumed as an independent variable during tropical cyclone events the probability of the total rainfall amount the highest tide level and the maximum wind speed recorded for 30 tropical cyclone events from 1990 to 2019 were obtained by frequency analysis let x be the rainfall amount for tropical cyclone events the rainfall amount probability p r p x x is shown in fig 5 a let y and z be the maximum wind speed and tide level for tropical cyclone events the joint probability of maximum wind speed and tide level is defined as p t w p y y z z as shown in fig 5 b since we assume that rainfall amount is an independent variable for wind and tide we get the rain tide wind joint probability shown by p r t w p r p t w 3 2 compound scenarios design 3 2 1 rain tide wind 24 h process the rainfall tide level and wind speed will vary with the distance to and intensity of the tropical cyclone and there is no universal distribution for them in this study the normalized distribution processes of the three drivers are constructed the normalized value of a driver at a certain moment is defined as the ratio of the value at that moment to the maximum value in the entire process the 24 hour 24 h wind speeds and tide levels from the observed data in this region during tropical cyclones are employed to generalize the normalized distribution pattern the 24 h normalized tide level distribution in fig 6 a was obtained by fitting the observed 24 h tide process of typhoon mangkhut from 2 00 on 16 september 2018 to 2 00 on 17 septem 2018 and typhoon hato from 0 00 to 24 00 on 23 august 2017 hko 2022 the 24 h normalized wind speed distribution process in fig 6 b was obtained by fitting the observed 24 h wind process of typhoon pakhar from 19 00 on 26 september 2017 to 19 00 on 27 september 2017 and typhoon hato from 0 00 to 24 00 on 23 august 2017 hko 2022 extreme rainstorms are common in the pearl river estuary rainfall during tropical cyclones commonly lasts longer than one day the normalized 24 h rain process is adopted from the shenzhen rainstorm intensity design manual smb 2015 as shown in fig 6 c the 24 h process can be constructed by multiplying the normalized distribution process with a given maximum value of a driver 3 2 2 wave overtopping by tide wind strong winds generate high waves and high tide levels help the waves climb across wave walls during tropical cyclones a large number of surging waves endangers the safety of the artificial island the estimation of wave overtopping is based on the significant wave height and tide level the significant wave height and period are calculated through the wind speed according to the code of hydrology for sea harbour mot 2013 as in the following equation 1 1 g h 1 3 u 2 5 5 10 3 g f u 2 0 35 t a n h 30 g d u 2 0 8 g f u 2 0 35 1 2 g t s u 0 55 g f u 2 0 233 t a n h 2 3 30 g d u 2 0 8 g f u 2 0 35 where h 1 3 and t s are the significant wave height m and the wave period s respectively u is the average wind speed m s f is the fetch length m g is the gravity acceleration m s2 and d is the water depth m wave overtopping is calculated according to the formula in the eurotop manual van der meer et al 2018 eurotop is the wave overtopping design manual for coastal defences and related structures the wave overtopping process under different significant wave heights and tide levels can be obtained the artificial island has the wave wall and armoured slope with dolosse the wave overtopping discharge formula for the armoured slope is described in eq 2 2 q g h m 0 3 0 1035 exp 1 35 r c h m 0 γ f γ β 1 3 where q is the wave overtopping discharge m3 m s h m 0 is the incident significant wave height at the toe of seawall m r c is the crest freeboard m γ f is the influence factor for roughness on the slope and is 0 43 for the dolosse γ β is the influence factor for oblique wave attack and γ β 1 0 0063 β and β is the angle of wave attack relative to normal on structure the wave overtopping discharge for the artificial island under different combinations of tide levels and wind speeds are shown in fig 7 3 3 flood model and risk assessment 3 3 1 flood model mike is a coupled hydrodynamic model for the numerical simulation of water flow in drainage and overland dhi 2022 the coupled model of drainage and overland of the artificial island is established by mike the unsteady flow calculation in the pipe flow model is solved by the conservation of momentum and mass via the saint venant equation the drainage model is used for the rainfall runoff process and flow simulation in the pipe network the model catchments are divided using the tyson polygon method the underlying surface of the island is mostly hard and includes buildings and roads with a 0 85 impermeability rate in the model the rainfall drainage network in the model has 128 pipes 105 sub catchments 108 nodes and 10 pipeline outlets that link to the outside in fig 8 the drainage outlets adopt check valves and the backflow of seawater into the drainage pipe during the high tide period is not considered in this model the drainage network and overland model are coupled using manhole connections which link the water flow between the surface and pipe the coupling to nodes is designed for the interaction of water when a manhole is overtopped or when overland flow enters the water network the overland model is used to simulate surface floods from collection system networks and discharges the overland model uses triangular grids to spatially discretize the study area with a total of 47 000 grids as shown in fig 9 the artificial island elevation is generated by interpolating the elevation scattered points in arcgis the main road goes down the slope into the tunnel from west to east and the longitudinal gradient is about 3 the time series of rainfall and wave overtopping discharges are boundary conditions in the flood model the eastern boundary of the tunnel is an open boundary and water flows out freely the coupled model was used to simulate the drainage and flooding process of the artificial island caused by wave overtopping discharges and rainfall during tropical cyclones 3 3 2 flood risk assessment of cars the artificial island is an important transportation hub connecting the bridge and the immersed tunnel with daily traffic the artificial island is the only place to pass from the bridge to the tunnel and many cars pass daily vehicles are the most vulnerable objects directly threatened by flooding that results in damage it will cause damage to vehicle components or even scrap the entire vehicle when the flood submerges vehicles to a certain depth the vehicular depth damage curve fema 2006 is adopted to estimate the loss to cars in floods as shown in fig 10 the design speed of the main road in the middle of the artificial island is assumed to be 90 km h with a safety distance of 90 m and it is a two way six lane road with a length of about 630 m the secondary road around the artificial island has a speed limit of 30 km h with a safety distance of 30 m it is an opposite two lane road with a total length of about 1100 m the cars on the main road and the secondary road around the island are assumed to be uniformly distributed according to the safe driving distance and all vehicles are driven at the designed speed the total number of cars on the artificial island road is approximately 114 cars when the road is fully loaded the hydrodynamic model is used to simulate flood depth for various locations in compound scenarios the car damage for simulated floods on the roads is calculated through the car depth damage curve the car damage distributions on the island are assessed for all compound scenarios based on the flood model 4 results and discussions 4 1 compound scenarios compound scenarios are designed by combining the joint probability of flooding drivers including rain tide and wind with their 24 h process during tropical cyclones twelve scenarios with different rainfall tide levels and wind speeds were constructed with the rain tide wind joint probability to comprehensively study artificial island flood disasters table 1 shows the maximum wind speed ws m s maximum tide level tl m astronomical tide and storm surge and total rainfall ra mm during 24 h process for each scenario the od m3 m s and wh m are the maximum wave overtopping discharge and the highest significant wave height the p r t w is the rain tide wind joint probability of the scenarios the 24 h time series of rainfall wind speed and tide level for 12 compound scenarios are based on the normalized pattern and maximum value the effective wave height and wave overtopping discharge for various wind speeds and tide levels were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 the 24 h time series of the significant wave height crest freeboard and wave overtopping discharge for all scenarios are calculated scenario 1 is the most extreme in all designed scenarios with the maximum overtopping discharge and rainfall there is no overtopping discharge when the wind speed and tide level are lower than 42 m s and 3 2 m respectively scenarios 8 10 11 and 12 had no overtopping discharge in these scenarios floods are caused only by rain 4 2 flooding process of the extreme scenario the 24 h processes of flooding for the 12 compound scenarios are simulated to obtain the flood depth by the flood model scenario 1 has the most extreme rainfall tide level and wind speed of all simulation scenes the rain tide wind joint probability of scenario 1 is about 0 001 the 24 h time series of rainfall wind speed tide level significant wave height crest freeboard and wave overtopping discharge for scenario 1 are shown in fig 11 the flood conditions at different times during the 24 h for scenario 1 are simulated shown in fig 12 after the first 4 h the artificial island s secondary road turns start to be flooded and there is little inundation in the middle tunnel at this time the flood is caused by rainfall and no waves cross the wave wall after 8 h the outer circle of the artificial island is flooded because of wave starts entering the island after 10 h the entire island is almost flooded and the rainfall has already reached its peak after 12 h tide level wind speed and wave discharge reached their peak leading to serious flooding with the maximum depth of the secondary road turns reaching 1 2 m as the rainfall and wave discharge passes their peak values the flood depth is greatly reduced and the depth for most areas is less than 0 2 m after 14 h the flood disappears in most areas with continuous drainage and there is still some inundation at the turns after 18 h most locations are flooded after 10 h and more severe flooding occurs after 12 h the island will be inundated under extreme rainfall and waves although the island has drainage pipelines and wave proof structures although the joint probability of this extreme flood event is as low as 0 001 it is important to prepare for this kind of low probability high consequences extreme event by strengthening flood warning and prevention 4 3 flood scenarios comparison the floods for 24 h for 12 scenarios of the artificial island are simulated and the maximum flood depth during 24 h for each simulation scenario is shown in fig 13 the related conditions for the 12 scenarios are shown in table 1 scenario 1 is the most extreme compound scenario with the most rainfall and overtopping resulting in the most severe flooding the maximum flood depth in the middle tunnel and secondary road reached 0 5 m and 1 2 m respectively scenarios 1 and 2 have the same rainfall of 595 mm but the maximum wave discharge of scenario 1 is much more than in scenario 2 the flood depth in scenario 1 is much more serious reaching 0 5 m in scenario 1 and 0 25 m in scenario 2 in the middle tunnel scenario 2 has more intense rainfall but wave overtopping discharge is less than in scenario 3 the flood in scenario 3 is more serious indicating that wave overtopping aggravates flooding scenarios 3 and 5 have different rainfalls but the same overtopping discharge and their overall flood depth is not much different scenario 5 has less rainfall but more wave overtopping and the flooding situation is more serious than in scenario 4 from the comparison above we note that wave overtopping is a crucial factor that could affect the flooding of the artificial island which should be considered in flood control design as the wind tide and rainfall decrease the flooding severity conditions for these scenarios are reduced in scenarios 7 to 12 the flood depth on most island areas is less than 0 2 m except for the secondary road turns the flooding depth at the secondary road is relatively larger than other areas in these scenarios indicating that it is vulnerable to being flooded and dangerous for people the rainfall in scenarios 10 11 and 12 is less than 315 mm and only the places on the secondary road and some areas on the main road are flooded on the island under rainfall 4 4 risk assessment of cars the artificial island is an important traffic hub and it is essential to assess the flood risk for cars on it the simulated maximum flooding depths on the island for compound scenarios are obtained by the flood model the car damage curve is used to estimate damage degree in different flood depths the maximum car damage degree distributions on the island for 12 scenarios are shown in fig 14 the damage degree in scenario 1 is the most serious the car damage in most positions reaches more than 30 the most severe damage at the secondary road turning is over 90 and at the middle tunnel is 40 in scenario 2 the overall damage degree reduces a lot in the tunnel with a damage degree of 20 the damage conditions for scenarios 7 to 12 are reduced a lot car losses on the island are all less than 20 except for the secondary road turns the turning of the secondary road has relatively large car damage for all scenarios so the cars should keep away from this position during tropical cyclones cars in most positions for scenarios 10 11 and 12 would not be damaged but there will be a little damage on the secondary road the maximum flood depths for different scenarios at nine locations p1 p9 are shown in fig 15 a these nine locations are shown in fig 2 c and location p5 is inside the tunnel the flood at p2 is the most severe and the maximum water depth reaches about 1 2 m for the most extreme scenario the maximum water depth at p5 reaches 0 5 m in the most extreme scenario the maximum water depth at position p7 in these scenarios is relatively large reaching 0 8 m in the most extreme case cars and personnel should stay away from the dangerous locations of p2 and p7 the flood depth in most locations is less than 0 5 m in all scenarios except for p2 and p7 the water depth of p1 and p3 in all scenarios is less than 0 3 m which is safe for cars the maximum car damage at nine places in different scenarios is shown in fig 15 b flooding at the p2 and p7 locations cause greater damage to cars than in other areas during floods there is a 0 001 probability of 90 car damage and a 0 02 probability of 50 car damage at the p2 location there is about a 0 01 probability of 30 damage to cars at the p7 position the probability of maximum car damage greater than 10 is less than 0 01 at tunnel p5 the maximum car damage degree is always less than 20 at p1 and p3 for all scenarios posing little risk to cars the probability of car damage greater than 20 is less than 0 01 at most locations except for locations p2 and p7 the total number of cars on the artificial island roads is distributed based on the safe driving distance of the design speed we assumed the road is fully loaded to maximize the estimated car risk and there are about 114 cars the car damage degree for different road locations is obtained by simulated flood depth and car depth damage curve all cars damage is added to get the total loss in flood scenarios the total flood risk of cars on the artificial island is assessed for the 12 scenarios in fig 16 the probability of total car loss greater than 40 caused by the most severe flood scenario is about 0 001 the probability of the total car loss greater than 10 is less than 0 02 the probability of the total car loss greater than 2 is less than 0 1 the tail of the risk curve demonstrates that low probability may induce car losses it is crucial to enhance early warning and evacuate cars in time when tropical cyclones come especially in dangerous areas 5 conclusions the hzmb artificial island is a complex cross sea project and a vital traffic connection from the bridge to tunnel it is essential to conduct the flood risk assessment and car safety evaluations as tropical cyclones hit the area frequently in this study the joint probability of rain tide wind scenarios is proposed to analyze compound floods then coupled hydrodynamic model of drainage and overland of the island is established to simulate the flood for compound scenarios the most severe flood condition of each scenario was evaluated and the flood risk for car damage on the artificial island was assessed major conclusions are given as follows flooding induced by tropical cyclones is triggered by the multi factor compound of high tide strong wind and heavy rain in which high tide levels and strong wind jointly result in wave overtopping wave overtopping is a vital factor in artificial island flooding the compound floods with small probabilities are more serious when wave overtopping and rainfall are both extreme the flooding depth and car damage at the secondary road turnings are more serious than in other places which are vulnerable to flooding and dangerous for people the flood risk of car damage by the compound impacts is assessed based on the simulated flood scenarios the risk assessment results could provide theoretical guidance and technical support for evaluating existing flood control and designing future mitigation measures the risk curve tail shows a moderate probability for minor vehicle damage suggesting that early warning is necessary during tropical cyclones whether the risk is acceptable depends on the risk evaluation criteria it remains an open research question to be solved however limitations exist in the current study and will be solved in the future firstly the rain tide wind scenarios with joint probabilities were generated based on limited historical data for tropical cyclones we will study more comprehensive compound flood events and multivariate joint probability functions in the future secondly the distribution of cars is assumed when the road is fully loaded based on the safety drive distance while the actual number of cars will reduce a lot during tropical cyclones car damage at maximum water depth is used to assess risk and damage reduction at other times is ignored the car flood risk is a conservative estimate larger than the real situation thirdly the drainage model lacks consideration of pumps on the artificial island the peaks of the tide and wind are synchronized to maximize the compound effect which makes the simulated flooding larger than the actual conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

2738,model based polarimetric decomposition can separate to some extent the backscattered radar signals from the vegetation canopy and the underlying ground hence enabling a strategy for soil moisture retrieval in vegetated agricultural fields however the volume scattering models used in previous studies are only applicable to specific cases making it difficult to completely remove the volume component induced by the vegetation layer in this paper three generalized volume scattering models i e generalized volume scattering model gvsm simplified adaptive volume scattering model savsm and simplified neumann volume scattering model snvsm are incorporated in the decomposition and evaluated for soil moisture retrieval considering the complexity and descriptive ability of the available physical models a modified two component model based decomposition is proposed as the basic decomposition framework this decomposition is also based on the physical constraint of the dielectric constants included in the model the employed models combine an x bragg surface scattering model with three continuous generalized volume scattering models the analytic solution of the parameters is obtained and the minimum residual power criterion is used to determine the optimal solution to fit the model by using the proposed model based decomposition framework the performance of the three models to simulate the canopy scattering and as a result to later estimate soil moisture under agricultural vegetation is evaluated fully polarimetric radarsat 2 c band images acquired on eight dates in 2013 and 2015 over fields covered by two crops wheat and soybean were employed for validation results show that the proposed decomposition method using any of the three volume scattering models can provide promising inversion results of soil moisture with rmses ranging from 2 89 to 7 43 vol compared with the other two models the snvsm simulates the vegetation contribution more accurately in this framework and it provides a stable soil moisture inversion performance at different crop phenological stages with an optimal overall accuracy of rmse 4 99 vol and a correlation coefficient of r 0 78 keywords agriculture soil moisture polarimetric synthetic aperture radar polsar model based decomposition generalized volume scattering model radarsat 2 data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a crucial element affecting global hydrology and meteorology which governs the distribution of infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration adnan et al 2021 ostad ali askari 2022a vishwakarma et al 2022 wei et al 2022 accurate sm information is critical for effective irrigation scheduling of crops and efficient allocation of water resources on agricultural production di martino et al 2016 el hajj et al 2019 kisi et al 2022 kong et al 2018 lei et al 2020 ostad ali askari 2022b talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 traditional ground measurements provide accurate sm values at the sampling locations for which equipment such as the time domain reflectometer tdr is used however due to evaporation of sm and transpiration of vegetation caused by solar radiation as well as to natural phenomena such as rainfall the sm content rapidly changes over time and space bhogapurapu et al 2022 ostad ali askari et al 2017 therefore sm can vary considerably between two locations within a short distance due to difference in soil properties and the sm of a fixed location can change rapidly within a short period of time due to precipitation in this case traditional measurements of sm over large areas are time consuming and labor intensive synthetic aperture radar sar with active and high resolution imaging capabilities provides an effective way for sm mapping at global and local scales with high spatial resolution sar signal is sensitive to the physical properties of the scattering target such as soil dielectric constant and roughness and the microwaves can penetrate a certain depth in the ground depending on the frequencies used hajnsek et al 2003 polarimetric sar polsar contains rich information in form of intensity and phase at different polarization combinations or channels additionally it provides extra dimensional observation information offering sensitivity to all scattering mechanisms present in the scene with these unique advantages polsar technology facilitates finding the relationship between the observed data and the surface parameters even at complex scenarios therefore polsar has been widely employed for continuous sm monitoring at the field scale huang et al 2016a jagdhuber et al 2013 nguyen et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 xing et al 2019 over a vegetated field sar backscatter is composed of soil scattering vegetation scattering and the interaction of the two terms therefore the key to accurately estimate sm is to effectively remove the contribution of vegetation backscattering and retain only the backscattered signal which is associated with the soil surface scattering model based polarimetric target decomposition methods firstly proposed by freeman and durden 1998 can separate to some extent the contributions from different scattering mechanisms coming from ground and vegetation by establishing a physical model of the scene the surface sm in vegetated areas can be retrieved hajnsek et al 2009 investigated the potential of model based decomposition method for sm inversion under crops and obtained promising results using a modified three component decomposition and l band polsar images the decomposition algorithm for sm estimation was implemented with one single image for each date the surface model adopted the extended bragg x bragg model under a uniform distribution the volume scattering was described by three types of canonical models considering the orientation distributions and the particle shape subsequently more efforts have been put into improving the accuracy of sm estimation using polsar decomposition with the aim of enriching the measured information jagdhuber et al 2013 considered multi angle observation diversity and proposed a multi angular polarimetric decomposition method for sm inversion which achieved improved inversion rates and stable inversion quality over all crop fields shi et al 2021b combined polsar multi temporal and multi angle images to increase the number of observations and adopted a nonlinear least squares fitting method to solve the unknown parameters this approach effectively improved the decoupling of surface and vegetation volume scattering and obtained high inversion rates and accurate inversion results from the perspective of surface modeling suitable for wider surface roughness especially using sar observations with shorter wavelengths e g c band huang et al 2016b considered the x bragg surface scattering under a zero mean normal distribution and proposed an adaptive two component decomposition for sm inversion over sparse wheat fields at the early phenological stages using c band polsar images subsequently huang et al 2016a used the calibrated integral equation model ciem to simulate the surface with high roughness and developed an integrated two component decomposition algorithm for sm estimation under low crop cover wang et al 2018 incorporated the oh model oh et al 1992 which is applicable for wide surface roughness conditions and an attenuation factor considering vegetation induced attenuation effects into the two component polarimetric decomposition procedure to estimate sm in addition xiao et al 2021 selected the dubois model to describe the backscattering from the underlying soil after removing the effect of canopy scattering and attenuation using polarimetric decomposition technique an optimum surface roughness determined using a priori knowledge was applied to calibrate the dubois model and then sm was derived directly one of the most challenging aspects for accurate estimation of sm over vegetated areas with polsar decomposition technology is volume scattering modeling a volume scattering model is usually expressed as the integral of the scattering matrix corresponding to the vegetation particles with respect to the probability density function pdf of particle orientation the volume scattering model from the traditional polarimetric decomposition method freeman and durden 1998 assumes that the scattering particles are dipoles following a randomly oriented and uniformly distributed pdf yamaguchi et al 2005 later developed two volume scattering models describing horizontal and vertical dipoles to consider the orientation effects moreover corresponding to purely random scattering a maximum entropy volume scattering model was developed by an et al 2010 however the obvious differences in the structural features of different vegetation types and different growth stages of the same vegetation type result in different scattering characteristics which cannot be fully simulated by a single discrete volume scattering model that is designed for specific scenes in this case the accuracy of the sm retrieval is limited over vegetated areas as it was pointed out by chen et al 2014 and wang et al 2017 more dynamic and generalized volume scattering models should be integrated in the decomposition framework a generalized volume scattering model considering particle anisotropy and scattering randomness of the vegetation scatterers can adaptively model the seasonal structure changes of different vegetation types and it can describe the scattering mechanisms of complex volume scenes more accurately however generalized volume scattering models usually introduce new parameters to describe the particles and scene morphology increasing the complexity of parameter inversion for example jagdhuber et al 2015 introduced two dipole shape parameters into the sm inversion model for more adaptively characterizing the volume scattering of different vegetation types nevertheless the solution process becomes complicated due to the limited number of available radar observations to overcome this limitation a generalized volume scattering model gvsm based on the co polarization ratio was proposed by antropov et al 2011 huang et al 2015 developed a simplified adaptive volume scattering model savsm assuming that vegetation orientation angles obey the nth order sine and cosine distributions in addition xie et al 2018 simplified the neumann volume scattering model snvsm neumann et al 2010 by considering only the particle orientation randomness these three generalized volume scattering models fix the model parameters in advance according to the characteristics of the observed data and some physics based assumptions thus avoiding aggravating the problem of underdetermination although these models have been extensively employed in studies of scattering mechanism interpretation image classification and crop growth monitoring mandal et al 2020 xie et al 2019 2017 their effectiveness in sm retrieval is open to be further investigated and compared moreover due to the difficulty in obtaining ground truth data the existing approaches to validate the performance of polarimetric decomposition models are usually limited to the empirical explanation of the scattering powers over different land cover types and few efforts have been devoted to their quantitative evaluation at the application level consequently the main motivation of this research is to fill this gap by implementing a comprehensive assessment of these three generalized volume scattering models in a systematic and unified framework from the perspective of their application in sm retrieval multiple radarsat 2c band images covering an agricultural region were selected for validation specifically their performance in depicting different types of vegetation i e different crops in this study on different dates was evaluated and their application potentials in the field of sm inversion were compared the major scientific innovations and contributions of this study are summarized as follows 1 a modified two component decomposition method is proposed which considers the ability to describe the scene scattering and the invertibility of the scattering models three types of generalized volume scattering models i e gvsm savsm and snvsm are incorporated into the decomposition framework separately accounting for the influence of soil roughness upon the observations at short wavelength the x bragg model based on the zero mean normal distribution is employed to characterize the underlying ground and extract the soil dielectric constant 2 to avoid non physical values of the dielectric constant due to the mismatch between the scattering model and the measured scenario a physical constraint algorithm is incorporated in the decomposition framework to obtain the physical range of the dielectric constant based on a semi empirical model i e dubois model 3 performance of generalized volume scattering models is evaluated from the perspective of modeling theory scattering power characterization and soil moisture retrieval two typical crops i e wheat and soybean imaged on different dates are tested for validation purposes a complementary analysis of the scattering mechanisms based on the h α decomposition is conducted 2 study area and dataset the two adjacent study fields selected in this paper are located in southwestern ontario canada an area with flat topography suitable for agricultural production as shown in fig 1 since the crop planting dates are similar each year in this region the crop phenological stages in these two fields are identical for the same period eight radarsat 2 c band fully polarimetric images covering two study fields acquired from may to september in 2013 and 2015 were employed for validation corresponding to the satellite acquisition dates the ground truth photographs collected at different periods are shown in fig 2 wheat presents a relatively sparse distribution in may with a height of around 5 40 cm and it starts to tassel in june soybean is sown in may and reaches an average height of over 25 cm in july in august soybean stalks become strong and produce vigorous leaves september is the mature season of soybean with the leaves starting to wilt field sampling campaigns were performed using a tdr probe with a sampling depth of 5 cm to mitigate the spatial variability error each ground sampling site was repetitively measured six times and the final surface sm measurement was set to their statistical average for this site table 1 lists the details of the dataset and the dynamic range of sm in the study areas for each sampling period covering a large interval from 4 to 40 vol a total of 118 sm measurements were collected from the wheat fields on five dates corresponding to may 9 may 23 2013 and may 6 may 20 june 23 2015 the total number of sm measurements from the soybean fields was 67 corresponding to three dates july 17 august 10 and september 3 2015 3 methodology soil scattering components related to dielectric properties can be extracted from the complex microwave backscatter signals for sm inversion using model based polarimetric decomposition technique in this case it is critical to establish the volume scattering model that can accurately separate vegetation canopy scattering to reduce the complexity of the model inversion and to keep the ability of the model to describe the scattering from the scene we assume that the dihedral scattering component is negligible therefore this study employs a two component decomposition framework consisting of surface and volume scattering the performance of three generalized volume scattering models for canopy scattering simulation and sm retrieval under vegetation cover is compared the scattering models and the inversion scheme are described in this section 3 1 generalized volume scattering models 3 1 1 gvsm antropov et al 2011 considered the case where the reflection symmetry assumption does not hold and developed the gvsm for modeling the canopy scattering based on the co polarization ratio γ and a shape parameter fixed at 1 3 i e assuming the scattering particle shape to be a dipole the coherency matrix is written as 1 t v γ 1 3 1 γ 2 γ 3 1 γ 2 γ 3 γ 1 2 0 γ 1 2 1 γ 2 γ 3 0 0 0 1 γ 2 γ 3 where γ is expressed in linear units the relationship between volume coherency matrix elements and γ expressed in db is shown in fig 3 a note that the closer the γ tends to 0 db the stronger the degree of particle orientation randomness when γ is equal to 4 26 db 0 db and 4 26 db respectively the coherency matrix elements of gvsm are consistent with the three volume scattering models random horizontal and vertical dipole models provided by traditional decomposition methods freeman and durden 1998 yamaguchi et al 2005 furthermore gvsm extends the range of the co polarization ratio to continuously represent more generalized volume scattering cases than previous models 3 1 2 savsm by simplifying the generalized volume scattering model proposed by arii et al 2010 huang et al 2015 assumed that the particle shape is a dipole and the orientation angles obey a nth order sine or cosine distribution with a zero mean value characterizing vertical and horizontal volume scattering respectively the pdf is integrated within the scattering range and the corresponding coherency matrix is expressed as follows 2 t v h n 1 a t 11 h t 12 h 0 t 12 h t 22 h 0 0 0 t 33 h t v v n 1 a t 11 v t 12 v 0 t 12 v t 22 v 0 0 0 t 33 v t 11 h t 11 v π γ n 1 2 2 γ n 2 1 t 12 h t 12 v n π γ n 1 2 4 γ n 2 2 t 22 h t 22 v n 2 2 n 4 π γ n 1 2 8 γ n 2 3 t 33 h t 33 v π γ n 3 2 γ n 2 3 a 0 π sin n θ d θ π 2 π 2 cos n θ d θ π γ n 1 2 γ n 2 1 3 γ x 0 e t t x 1 d t where t v h and t v v denote the horizontal and vertical volume coherency matrices respectively as shown in fig 3 b when the value of n is 0 the model corresponds to the completely random volume case freeman and durden 1998 larger values of n indicate smaller particle scattering randomness when n 1 it conforms to the two typical volume scattering models proposed by yamaguchi et al 2005 when n increases gradually and is greater than 10 the change of model parameters tends to be gentle 3 1 3 snvsm neumann et al 2010 assumed that the particle orientation obeys a circular gaussian distribution and modeled the volume scattering process based on particle anisotropy δ and orientation randomness τ xie et al 2018 introduced the condition that the particles are horizontal dipoles δ 1 or vertical dipoles δ 1 and developed the snvsm which is expressed as 4 t v h τ 1 2 1 1 τ 0 1 τ 1 τ 0 0 0 τ τ 1 2 1 2 1 1 τ 0 1 τ 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 τ 1 2 5 t v v τ 1 2 1 τ 1 0 τ 1 τ 1 0 0 0 τ τ 1 2 1 2 1 τ 1 0 τ 1 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 τ 1 2 where τ 0 1 and it indicates an increasing degree of orientation randomness as τ grows fig 3 c exhibits the linear variation of the volume coherency matrix elements to the range of τ it is noteworthy that the three special volume scattering models from the freeman durden and yamaguchi decomposition methods freeman and durden 1998 yamaguchi et al 2005 correspond to the cases of τ 1 and τ 2 3 respectively 3 2 x bragg surface scattering model given that the bragg model is only applicable to surfaces with small roughness and cannot express the contribution of cross polarization and the influence of depolarization the polarization rotation angle caused by the change of orientation slope is introduced assuming that the random variation of particle orientation angles follows the pdf based on the zero mean normal distribution proposed by schuler et al 2002 the x bragg model is constructed by rotating the bragg model along the radar line of sight and integrating over the orientation angles the derived coherency matrix is expressed as 6 t g 1 β e 2 σ 2 0 β e 2 σ 2 1 2 β 2 1 e 8 σ 2 0 0 0 1 2 β 2 1 e 8 σ 2 7 β r h r v r h r v 8 r h c o s θ ε r sin 2 θ c o s θ ε r sin 2 θ 9 r v ε r 1 sin 2 θ ε r 1 sin 2 θ ε r c o s θ ε r sin 2 θ 2 where β 1 0 denotes the scattering coefficient determined by the incidence angle θ and the dielectric constant ε r β denotes the conjugate of β σ 2 denotes the variance of the orientation angle distribution which is related to soil surface roughness and incidence angle r h and r v denote the bragg reflection coefficients for horizontal and vertical polarization respectively 3 3 soil moisture estimation using two component polarimetric decomposition the dihedral scattering contribution is assumed negligible in comparison with the surface and volume contributions the radar backscatter signal in the area covered by crops e g wheat soybean etc consists of two components from the underlying soil and the vegetation layer then the observed coherency matrix t 3 is expressed as 10 t 3 f g t g f v t v t r where f g and f v are the amplitudes of surface scattering and volume scattering respectively t r denotes the residual matrix further the equation to be solved based on the observations can be written as 11 t 11 f g f v t v 11 t 12 f g β e 2 σ 2 f v t v 12 t 22 1 2 f g β 2 1 e 8 σ 2 f v t v 22 t 33 1 2 f g β 2 1 e 8 σ 2 f v t v 33 where t ij and t vij represent the elements of the observed and volume coherency matrix respectively to avoid the situation in which the surface scattering power is negative due to the priority of model inversion the volume scattering power f v is derived by the well known non negative eigenvalue decomposition nned process van zyl et al 2011 the nned concept requires the remainder matrix t 3 f v t v to be positive semidefinite to avoid negative powers the f v is corresponding to the maximum possible volume scattering which is actually the minimum root i e f v m i n f v 1 f v 2 f v 3 in solving cubic equations by setting the determinate of the reminder matrix to zero cui et al 2014 12 d e t t 3 f v t v 0 where d e t is the matrix determinant and f v 1 f v 2 and f v 3 are the solved three roots then the analytical expression of β can be solved from the set of equations and is given as 13 β t 12 f v t v 12 t 11 f v t v 11 e 2 σ 2 to obtain the best fit solution a look up table of the volume scattering model randomness parameters i e γ n and τ and the residual matrix power is constructed the optimal value of β is determined by minimizing the power in the residual matrix i e minp t r after removing the volume scattering component then soil dielectric constant ε r can be extracted depending on the specific functional relationship as shown in eq 7 9 hajnsek et al 2009 as it is known the dielectric constant of natural soils presents a valid empirical physical range i e ε r 2 41 hajnsek et al 2003 however non physical values of ε r may be obtained under the condition of pursuing the minimum power in the residual matrix previous studies used some semi empirical models to optimize the solution range of the dielectric constant while considering the spatial heterogeneity of sm ouellette et al 2017 shi et al 2021a the experimental results show that this approach can effectively improve the inversion accuracy however the optimization methods for the constraints in these studies require a priori knowledge of soil roughness making the inversion costly in this vein we designed an algorithm of dielectric constant boundary constraint based on a semi empirical model and for which no prior information of soil roughness is required the semi empirical model was established by dubois et al 1995 and it describes the radar backscattering coefficients as functions of dielectric constant ε r and surface roughness ks for a truck mounted x c and l band dataset 14 σ hh 10 2 75 c o s θ 1 5 s i n θ 5 10 0 028 ε r t a n θ k s s i n θ 1 4 λ 0 7 15 σ vv 10 2 35 c o s θ 3 s

on the calculation of the dielectric constant constraint boundary the yamaguchi volume scattering model yamaguchi et al 2005 is used to remove the vegetation scattering component and to obtain the surface backscattering coefficient given a typical range of soil roughness 0 1 k s 3 0 and dielectric constant 2 ε r 41 simulated values of backscattering in the scene can be derived using the dubois model then a look up table correlating the real and the simulated values of the backscattering coefficients is constructed and the soil dielectric constant ε r dubois in the study fields can be preliminarily estimated using the following cost function 16 f σ hh real σ hh simu 2 σ vv real σ vv simu 2 later by fitting the distribution of the obtained dielectric constants over the entire study area using a gaussian function the upper and lower boundaries of the confidence interval with 95 probability are taken as the maximum and minimum values of the constraint range of the dielectric constants finally the dielectric hybrid model proposed by topp et al 1980 is utilized to estimate the sm 17 sm 5 3 2 92 ε r 0 055 ε r 2 0 00043 ε r 3 fig 4 summarizes the schematic diagram for retrieving sm using the generalized two component polarimetric decomposition method based on the physical constraint of the dielectric constant 4 results and discussion 4 1 scattering mechanism analysis the eigenvalue eigenvector based h α decomposition cloude and pottier 1997 which can provide an interpretation of information based on mathematical properties is used to analyze the dominant scattering mechanism present over the soybean and wheat fields polarimetric entropy h is a measurement of scattering randomness in a statistical sense and the basic scattering mechanisms are identified by α angle fig 5 plots the h α plane for all eight images measured in the wheat and soybean fields since the wheat plants in early may are relatively short and sparse the scattering consists mainly of two components surface and volume the pixels located in the low entropy region correspond to the bragg surface scattering case while the surface scattering of pixels in the medium entropy region is influenced by soil roughness as expected with the growth of wheat the canopy structure becomes more complex and the entropy increases gradually in late june most of the pixels in the wheat fields are dominated by volume scattering it is noteworthy that the surface scattering contribution of wheat in the same period is greater in may 2015 than that in may 2013 this is due to the larger incidence angle of the may images in 2015 see table 1 compared with that of 2013 which favors the surface backscatter due to a reduced attenuation by vegetation because of a shorter path through the vegetation canopy this is consistent with the description provided by wang et al 2018 for soybean although it is at the early phenological growth stage on july 17 volume scattering is dominant due to the crop residues from the previous season which are left on the field in august the residues are completely covered by the soybean plants when the canopy closes hence more pixels are dominated by surface scattering as shown in fig 5 g although the soybean canopy is further developed on september 3 the anisotropic component is slightly decreased relative to the previous period this can be attributed to the reduced vegetation water content improving the penetration of the microwave signal agreeing with the wilted leaves shown in the ground truth photograph overall the dihedral scattering contribution over the crop fields observed is insignificant because of the limited penetration capability of the c band radar signal it somehow demonstrates the reasonability of using two component decomposition model in this study in addition various degrees of anisotropic volume scattering are found at different growth stages of the same crop type and at the same growth stage of different crop types indicating the necessity of using a generalized volume scattering model in the decomposition framework 4 2 comparison of scattering powers to verify the application performance of the three generalized volume scattering models under different vegetation cover conditions we selected six images in 2015 and analyzed their decomposition results of scattering powers under the proposed two component decomposition framework as shown in fig 6 the forest region in each image is always dominated by volume scattering component over the farmland area surface scattering is mainly dominant at the early phenological stages and volume scattering gradually increases benefiting from favorable geometric configurations with the development of crop phenological stages replacing surface scattering as the dominant contribution some crops such as soybean and corn are reaching maturity in september the surface scattering signal increases due to enhanced signal penetration these decomposition results obtained from all three volume scattering models seem to illustrate the temporal evolution of different land cover types for further comparison histograms of the two scattering power contributions are shown in fig 7 which correspond to the dates in fig 6 the temporal evolution of the scattering power distributions is apparently consistent with the crop development characteristics the contribution of volume scattering increases as the phenological stage of wheat evolves whereas the opposite phenomenon is found over soybean fields due to the influence of crop residues and vegetation moisture content which agrees with the conclusions obtained from the h α planes in addition both the surface and volume scattering powers of soybean exhibit a wider distribution range this is expected since the stems and leaves of soybean have a more diverse geometric structure regarding the comparison among volume models it is found that the volume scattering powers obtained from snvsm on the six dates are slightly higher than those from savsm in contrast the gvsm obtains obviously lower volume scattering power than the other two models especially on june 23 i e in the grain filling period of wheat these observations can be interpreted by the structure of volume scattering models refer to fig 3 the volume scattering power strongly depends on the structure of volume scattering matrix in theory the smaller the value of t v 33 in volume scattering matrix the higher the possible derived maximum volume scattering power pvmax within the physical ranges of the randomness parameters the overall variation trends of the elements in the savsm and snvsm coherency matrix are consistent as the particle orientation randomness increases i e n is close to 0 or τ is approaching to 1 the absolute values of t v 12 and t v 22 decrease whereas t v 33 increases it is noteworthy that t v 33 0 5 when τ 1 2 in snvsm corresponding to the obtained pvmax of 8 s hv 2 which is consistent with the freeman durden volume scattering model this case is satisfied only when n 0 in savsm however t v 33 in savsm has an upward trend for an interval near n 0 as a result the obtained pvmax with savsm is less than 8 s hv 2 in this stage thus the decomposition results using snvsm present higher volume scattering power than savsm when the canopy particle scattering is more random for example during the late growth stage of wheat or soybean in contrast gvsm is based on symmetric properties in the scene leading to the persistent assumption that t v 22 is equal to t v 33 nevertheless this is a strict condition that holds true only in the case of purely random volume xie et al 2018 this assumption also leads to the fact that t v 33 decreases until 0 5 with the increase of orientation randomness i e γ tends to 0 showing the opposite trend to the other two models therefore the maximum pvmax obtained with gvsm during the whole range of the randomness parameter is 8 s hv 2 while the other two models can obtain higher pvmax in low randomness volume cases 4 3 comparison of retrieved soil moisture to quantitatively analyze the sm inversion results the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient are adopted as evaluation indices to compare the estimated sm results from the three generalized volume scattering models against the field measurements on each date the average sm value of all pixels within a 5 5 window around the sample point site is taken as the inversion result the scatterplots of the inversion results using different methods are represented in fig 8 and the rmses of all cases are listed in table 2 according to the growth stages of the two different crops the sm inversion accuracy tends to decrease with the crop phenological development an interesting observation is that the accuracies of all methods on both days in 2013 are higher than those at the same growth stage in 2015 this is mainly caused by the weak sensitivity of β to the change of soil dielectric constant at low incidence angles hajnsek et al 2009 in addition the incidence angle on may 20 2015 is outside the best applicable range 30 θ 70 of the dubois model dubois et al 1995 resulting in an inaccurate calculation of the constraint range of the dielectric constant hence induces the worst inversion results in the wheat fields the sm inversion performance of all models in the soybean fields is worse than that in the wheat fields due to the uncertainty of decomposition result caused by the complex canopy shape and structure of soybean the sm retrieval algorithm shows a better performance at a later phenological stage of soybean it mainly stems from the higher signal penetration under dry vegetation conditions however the dubois model is insensitive to the dielectric constant under dry soil conditions xiao et al 2021 leading to a systematic overestimation of the inversion results on september 3 2015 these results indicate that the of sm retrieval capability under vegetation cover is influenced by the microwave properties incidence angle and penetrability and crop growth stage that regulates the vegetation structure and water content among the three methods sm estimation with snvsm obtains most of the optimal rmses in the wheat fields especially at the later development stages and all of the optimal rmses in the soybean fields as a result snvsm achieves the lowest overall rmse 4 99 vol and the highest correlation coefficient r 0 78 the sm inversion results using gvsm show the largest deviation with respect to the ground reference data among the three models with an overall rmse of 6 16 vol and a correlation coefficient of r 0 69 compared with gvsm savsm obtains similar results during the early growing season of wheat and soybean while it provides better performance of sm inversion after leaf development and obtains an overall rmse of 5 74 vol and a correlation coefficient of r 0 72 in addition it can be seen in fig 8 that the correlation between the estimated and measured values obtained by gvsm is weak in fields with large spatial variability of sm this can be attributed to the insufficient quantification of the spatial heterogeneity in crop shape and structure in contrast snvsm obtains sm estimates closer to the true values and provides a robust inversion performance the differences in performance among methods depend on the ability of the volume scattering model employed to simulate and remove the signal induced by the vegetation layer this result confirms that snvsm can best characterize the volume scattering component and hence remove the canopy effect better than the other two models in this decomposition framework fig 9 illustrates the temporal dynamics of the mean sm retrieved on each date by the three volume scattering models the time series evolution of the sm inversion results is relatively consistent with the reference data this suggests that the two component decomposition method has a high application potential for sm estimation in vegetated agricultural areas where the contribution of dihedral scattering is sufficiently small using c band data all three methods show different degrees of underestimation of sm on may 23 2013 this error is probably caused by the saturation of sar signal under high sm conditions which is in line with previous studies baghdadi et al 2008 wang et al 2017 it is noteworthy that during the periods highly dominated by volume scattering higher sm is retrieved using gvsm compared with the other two models the reason is that gvsm removes less volume scattering component and retains more surface scattering component associated with sm except for dates with low vegetation cover i e may 09 and may 23 2013 the average value of sm obtained by snvsm is closest to the ground measurements supporting its best performance in removing the volume scattering component it should be noted that volume scattering is removed first before sm retrieval using different surface scattering models in other two component decomposition inversion methods huang et al 2016a wang et al 2018 xiao et al 2021 hence incorporating the assumption of model priority in contrast the combination of the minimum residual power criterion and the dielectric constant constraint implemented in the two component decomposition framework proposed in this research can theoretically make the obtained surface scattering component more adapted to the ground response thus the overestimation of volume scattering can be effectively mitigated and more accurate sm estimates can be obtained however the method proposed in this study ignores dihedral scattering which may be significant for some crop types with big stalks such as corn moreover the inaccuracy of the dielectric constant constraint obtained by the dubois model affects the inversion performance outside the applicable conditions 5 conclusion in this paper three generalized volume scattering models i e gvsm savsm and snvsm are incorporated in a polsar decomposition methodology and evaluated for soil moisture retrieval a modified two component decomposition which includes a physical constraint of the dielectric constant is proposed as the basic framework for soil moisture inversion regarding the limited height of crop and the complexity of scattering models the dihedral component is neglected in the proposed soil moisture retrieval framework besides the inversion technique does not require any external prior information like the vegetation index in semi empirical soil moisture retrieval models e g water cloud model whose retrieval result is directly determined by the numerical solution of the parameters under a minimum residual power criterion multiple radarsat 2 c band images over an agriculture region and two typical crops i e wheat and soybean are selected for testing purposes according to the model definition the snvsm can remove more volume scattering component under complex vegetation cover than the other two models whereas gvsm has the lowest volume scattering removal efficiency due to the assumption that t v 22 t v 33 the soil moisture inversion results for different phenological stages in wheat and soybean fields show that the inversion performance is influenced by the microwave properties incidence angle and penetrability the crop growth status and the inherent limitation of the surface scattering model the three volume models provide reasonable soil moisture inversion performance during the crop growing season with rmses between 2 89 and 7 43 vol it confirms that the synergy between the physical constraint and the minimum residual power criterion in the proposed decomposition method can mitigate the overestimation of volume scattering and provide more accurate surface components in particular soil moisture estimates obtained by snvsm at different phenological stages are more consistent with ground measurements than the other two models with an overall rmse of 4 99 vol and a correlation coefficient of 0 78 although the inversion accuracy decreases in general as the spatial variability of soil moisture increases or with higher vegetation presence e g the late crop phenological stage snvsm still shows robust performance in soil moisture retrieval and can accurately reflect the time series dynamics of soil moisture under a crop cover since the accuracy of the soil moisture inversion under vegetation cover depends largely on the performance of the volume scattering model this study demonstrates that snvsm simulates the scattering characteristics of vegetation canopy at a quantitative level better than the other two generalized volume scattering models in the proposed two component decomposition framework future studies will be conducted for testing the methods proposed in this paper with other crop types soil types and varying surface roughness moreover the effect of dihedral scattering component could be considered for soil moisture retrieval over dense vegetated fields with prominent stalks funding this work was supported in part by the national natural science

2738,model based polarimetric decomposition can separate to some extent the backscattered radar signals from the vegetation canopy and the underlying ground hence enabling a strategy for soil moisture retrieval in vegetated agricultural fields however the volume scattering models used in previous studies are only applicable to specific cases making it difficult to completely remove the volume component induced by the vegetation layer in this paper three generalized volume scattering models i e generalized volume scattering model gvsm simplified adaptive volume scattering model savsm and simplified neumann volume scattering model snvsm are incorporated in the decomposition and evaluated for soil moisture retrieval considering the complexity and descriptive ability of the available physical models a modified two component model based decomposition is proposed as the basic decomposition framework this decomposition is also based on the physical constraint of the dielectric constants included in the model the employed models combine an x bragg surface scattering model with three continuous generalized volume scattering models the analytic solution of the parameters is obtained and the minimum residual power criterion is used to determine the optimal solution to fit the model by using the proposed model based decomposition framework the performance of the three models to simulate the canopy scattering and as a result to later estimate soil moisture under agricultural vegetation is evaluated fully polarimetric radarsat 2 c band images acquired on eight dates in 2013 and 2015 over fields covered by two crops wheat and soybean were employed for validation results show that the proposed decomposition method using any of the three volume scattering models can provide promising inversion results of soil moisture with rmses ranging from 2 89 to 7 43 vol compared with the other two models the snvsm simulates the vegetation contribution more accurately in this framework and it provides a stable soil moisture inversion performance at different crop phenological stages with an optimal overall accuracy of rmse 4 99 vol and a correlation coefficient of r 0 78 keywords agriculture soil moisture polarimetric synthetic aperture radar polsar model based decomposition generalized volume scattering model radarsat 2 data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a crucial element affecting global hydrology and meteorology which governs the distribution of infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration adnan et al 2021 ostad ali askari 2022a vishwakarma et al 2022 wei et al 2022 accurate sm information is critical for effective irrigation scheduling of crops and efficient allocation of water resources on agricultural production di martino et al 2016 el hajj et al 2019 kisi et al 2022 kong et al 2018 lei et al 2020 ostad ali askari 2022b talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 traditional ground measurements provide accurate sm values at the sampling locations for which equipment such as the time domain reflectometer tdr is used however due to evaporation of sm and transpiration of vegetation caused by solar radiation as well as to natural phenomena such as rainfall the sm content rapidly changes over time and space bhogapurapu et al 2022 ostad ali askari et al 2017 therefore sm can vary considerably between two locations within a short distance due to difference in soil properties and the sm of a fixed location can change rapidly within a short period of time due to precipitation in this case traditional measurements of sm over large areas are time consuming and labor intensive synthetic aperture radar sar with active and high resolution imaging capabilities provides an effective way for sm mapping at global and local scales with high spatial resolution sar signal is sensitive to the physical properties of the scattering target such as soil dielectric constant and roughness and the microwaves can penetrate a certain depth in the ground depending on the frequencies used hajnsek et al 2003 polarimetric sar polsar contains rich information in form of intensity and phase at different polarization combinations or channels additionally it provides extra dimensional observation information offering sensitivity to all scattering mechanisms present in the scene with these unique advantages polsar technology facilitates finding the relationship between the observed data and the surface parameters even at complex scenarios therefore polsar has been widely employed for continuous sm monitoring at the field scale huang et al 2016a jagdhuber et al 2013 nguyen et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 xing et al 2019 over a vegetated field sar backscatter is composed of soil scattering vegetation scattering and the interaction of the two terms therefore the key to accurately estimate sm is to effectively remove the contribution of vegetation backscattering and retain only the backscattered signal which is associated with the soil surface scattering model based polarimetric target decomposition methods firstly proposed by freeman and durden 1998 can separate to some extent the contributions from different scattering mechanisms coming from ground and vegetation by establishing a physical model of the scene the surface sm in vegetated areas can be retrieved hajnsek et al 2009 investigated the potential of model based decomposition method for sm inversion under crops and obtained promising results using a modified three component decomposition and l band polsar images the decomposition algorithm for sm estimation was implemented with one single image for each date the surface model adopted the extended bragg x bragg model under a uniform distribution the volume scattering was described by three types of canonical models considering the orientation distributions and the particle shape subsequently more efforts have been put into improving the accuracy of sm estimation using polsar decomposition with the aim of enriching the measured information jagdhuber et al 2013 considered multi angle observation diversity and proposed a multi angular polarimetric decomposition method for sm inversion which achieved improved inversion rates and stable inversion quality over all crop fields shi et al 2021b combined polsar multi temporal and multi angle images to increase the number of observations and adopted a nonlinear least squares fitting method to solve the unknown parameters this approach effectively improved the decoupling of surface and vegetation volume scattering and obtained high inversion rates and accurate inversion results from the perspective of surface modeling suitable for wider surface roughness especially using sar observations with shorter wavelengths e g c band huang et al 2016b considered the x bragg surface scattering under a zero mean normal distribution and proposed an adaptive two component decomposition for sm inversion over sparse wheat fields at the early phenological stages using c band polsar images subsequently huang et al 2016a used the calibrated integral equation model ciem to simulate the surface with high roughness and developed an integrated two component decomposition algorithm for sm estimation under low crop cover wang et al 2018 incorporated the oh model oh et al 1992 which is applicable for wide surface roughness conditions and an attenuation factor considering vegetation induced attenuation effects into the two component polarimetric decomposition procedure to estimate sm in addition xiao et al 2021 selected the dubois model to describe the backscattering from the underlying soil after removing the effect of canopy scattering and attenuation using polarimetric decomposition technique an optimum surface roughness determined using a priori knowledge was applied to calibrate the dubois model and then sm was derived directly one of the most challenging aspects for accurate estimation of sm over vegetated areas with polsar decomposition technology is volume scattering modeling a volume scattering model is usually expressed as the integral of the scattering matrix corresponding to the vegetation particles with respect to the probability density function pdf of particle orientation the volume scattering model from the traditional polarimetric decomposition method freeman and durden 1998 assumes that the scattering particles are dipoles following a randomly oriented and uniformly distributed pdf yamaguchi et al 2005 later developed two volume scattering models describing horizontal and vertical dipoles to consider the orientation effects moreover corresponding to purely random scattering a maximum entropy volume scattering model was developed by an et al 2010 however the obvious differences in the structural features of different vegetation types and different growth stages of the same vegetation type result in different scattering characteristics which cannot be fully simulated by a single discrete volume scattering model that is designed for specific scenes in this case the accuracy of the sm retrieval is limited over vegetated areas as it was pointed out by chen et al 2014 and wang et al 2017 more dynamic and generalized volume scattering models should be integrated in the decomposition framework a generalized volume scattering model considering particle anisotropy and scattering randomness of the vegetation scatterers can adaptively model the seasonal structure changes of different vegetation types and it can describe the scattering mechanisms of complex volume scenes more accurately however generalized volume scattering models usually introduce new parameters to describe the particles and scene morphology increasing the complexity of parameter inversion for example jagdhuber et al 2015 introduced two dipole shape parameters into the sm inversion model for more adaptively characterizing the volume scattering of different vegetation types nevertheless the solution process becomes complicated due to the limited number of available radar observations to overcome this limitation a generalized volume scattering model gvsm based on the co polarization ratio was proposed by antropov et al 2011 huang et al 2015 developed a simplified adaptive volume scattering model savsm assuming that vegetation orientation angles obey the nth order sine and cosine distributions in addition xie et al 2018 simplified the neumann volume scattering model snvsm neumann et al 2010 by considering only the particle orientation randomness these three generalized volume scattering models fix the model parameters in advance according to the characteristics of the observed data and some physics based assumptions thus avoiding aggravating the problem of underdetermination although these models have been extensively employed in studies of scattering mechanism interpretation image classification and crop growth monitoring mandal et al 2020 xie et al 2019 2017 their effectiveness in sm retrieval is open to be further investigated and compared moreover due to the difficulty in obtaining ground truth data the existing approaches to validate the performance of polarimetric decomposition models are usually limited to the empirical explanation of the scattering powers over different land cover types and few efforts have been devoted to their quantitative evaluation at the application level consequently the main motivation of this research is to fill this gap by implementing a comprehensive assessment of these three generalized volume scattering models in a systematic and unified framework from the perspective of their application in sm retrieval multiple radarsat 2c band images covering an agricultural region were selected for validation specifically their performance in depicting different types of vegetation i e different crops in this study on different dates was evaluated and their application potentials in the field of sm inversion were compared the major scientific innovations and contributions of this study are summarized as follows 1 a modified two component decomposition method is proposed which considers the ability to describe the scene scattering and the invertibility of the scattering models three types of generalized volume scattering models i e gvsm savsm and snvsm are incorporated into the decomposition framework separately accounting for the influence of soil roughness upon the observations at short wavelength the x bragg model based on the zero mean normal distribution is employed to characterize the underlying ground and extract the soil dielectric constant 2 to avoid non physical values of the dielectric constant due to the mismatch between the scattering model and the measured scenario a physical constraint algorithm is incorporated in the decomposition framework to obtain the physical range of the dielectric constant based on a semi empirical model i e dubois model 3 performance of generalized volume scattering models is evaluated from the perspective of modeling theory scattering power characterization and soil moisture retrieval two typical crops i e wheat and soybean imaged on different dates are tested for validation purposes a complementary analysis of the scattering mechanisms based on the h α decomposition is conducted 2 study area and dataset the two adjacent study fields selected in this paper are located in southwestern ontario canada an area with flat topography suitable for agricultural production as shown in fig 1 since the crop planting dates are similar each year in this region the crop phenological stages in these two fields are identical for the same period eight radarsat 2 c band fully polarimetric images covering two study fields acquired from may to september in 2013 and 2015 were employed for validation corresponding to the satellite acquisition dates the ground truth photographs collected at different periods are shown in fig 2 wheat presents a relatively sparse distribution in may with a height of around 5 40 cm and it starts to tassel in june soybean is sown in may and reaches an average height of over 25 cm in july in august soybean stalks become strong and produce vigorous leaves september is the mature season of soybean with the leaves starting to wilt field sampling campaigns were performed using a tdr probe with a sampling depth of 5 cm to mitigate the spatial variability error each ground sampling site was repetitively measured six times and the final surface sm measurement was set to their statistical average for this site table 1 lists the details of the dataset and the dynamic range of sm in the study areas for each sampling period covering a large interval from 4 to 40 vol a total of 118 sm measurements were collected from the wheat fields on five dates corresponding to may 9 may 23 2013 and may 6 may 20 june 23 2015 the total number of sm measurements from the soybean fields was 67 corresponding to three dates july 17 august 10 and september 3 2015 3 methodology soil scattering components related to dielectric properties can be extracted from the complex microwave backscatter signals for sm inversion using model based polarimetric decomposition technique in this case it is critical to establish the volume scattering model that can accurately separate vegetation canopy scattering to reduce the complexity of the model inversion and to keep the ability of the model to describe the scattering from the scene we assume that the dihedral scattering component is negligible therefore this study employs a two component decomposition framework consisting of surface and volume scattering the performance of three generalized volume scattering models for canopy scattering simulation and sm retrieval under vegetation cover is compared the scattering models and the inversion scheme are described in this section 3 1 generalized volume scattering models 3 1 1 gvsm antropov et al 2011 considered the case where the reflection symmetry assumption does not hold and developed the gvsm for modeling the canopy scattering based on the co polarization ratio γ and a shape parameter fixed at 1 3 i e assuming the scattering particle shape to be a dipole the coherency matrix is written as 1 t v γ 1 3 1 γ 2 γ 3 1 γ 2 γ 3 γ 1 2 0 γ 1 2 1 γ 2 γ 3 0 0 0 1 γ 2 γ 3 where γ is expressed in linear units the relationship between volume coherency matrix elements and γ expressed in db is shown in fig 3 a note that the closer the γ tends to 0 db the stronger the degree of particle orientation randomness when γ is equal to 4 26 db 0 db and 4 26 db respectively the coherency matrix elements of gvsm are consistent with the three volume scattering models random horizontal and vertical dipole models provided by traditional decomposition methods freeman and durden 1998 yamaguchi et al 2005 furthermore gvsm extends the range of the co polarization ratio to continuously represent more generalized volume scattering cases than previous models 3 1 2 savsm by simplifying the generalized volume scattering model proposed by arii et al 2010 huang et al 2015 assumed that the particle shape is a dipole and the orientation angles obey a nth order sine or cosine distribution with a zero mean value characterizing vertical and horizontal volume scattering respectively the pdf is integrated within the scattering range and the corresponding coherency matrix is expressed as follows 2 t v h n 1 a t 11 h t 12 h 0 t 12 h t 22 h 0 0 0 t 33 h t v v n 1 a t 11 v t 12 v 0 t 12 v t 22 v 0 0 0 t 33 v t 11 h t 11 v π γ n 1 2 2 γ n 2 1 t 12 h t 12 v n π γ n 1 2 4 γ n 2 2 t 22 h t 22 v n 2 2 n 4 π γ n 1 2 8 γ n 2 3 t 33 h t 33 v π γ n 3 2 γ n 2 3 a 0 π sin n θ d θ π 2 π 2 cos n θ d θ π γ n 1 2 γ n 2 1 3 γ x 0 e t t x 1 d t where t v h and t v v denote the horizontal and vertical volume coherency matrices respectively as shown in fig 3 b when the value of n is 0 the model corresponds to the completely random volume case freeman and durden 1998 larger values of n indicate smaller particle scattering randomness when n 1 it conforms to the two typical volume scattering models proposed by yamaguchi et al 2005 when n increases gradually and is greater than 10 the change of model parameters tends to be gentle 3 1 3 snvsm neumann et al 2010 assumed that the particle orientation obeys a circular gaussian distribution and modeled the volume scattering process based on particle anisotropy δ and orientation randomness τ xie et al 2018 introduced the condition that the particles are horizontal dipoles δ 1 or vertical dipoles δ 1 and developed the snvsm which is expressed as 4 t v h τ 1 2 1 1 τ 0 1 τ 1 τ 0 0 0 τ τ 1 2 1 2 1 1 τ 0 1 τ 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 τ 1 2 5 t v v τ 1 2 1 τ 1 0 τ 1 τ 1 0 0 0 τ τ 1 2 1 2 1 τ 1 0 τ 1 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 τ 1 2 where τ 0 1 and it indicates an increasing degree of orientation randomness as τ grows fig 3 c exhibits the linear variation of the volume coherency matrix elements to the range of τ it is noteworthy that the three special volume scattering models from the freeman durden and yamaguchi decomposition methods freeman and durden 1998 yamaguchi et al 2005 correspond to the cases of τ 1 and τ 2 3 respectively 3 2 x bragg surface scattering model given that the bragg model is only applicable to surfaces with small roughness and cannot express the contribution of cross polarization and the influence of depolarization the polarization rotation angle caused by the change of orientation slope is introduced assuming that the random variation of particle orientation angles follows the pdf based on the zero mean normal distribution proposed by schuler et al 2002 the x bragg model is constructed by rotating the bragg model along the radar line of sight and integrating over the orientation angles the derived coherency matrix is expressed as 6 t g 1 β e 2 σ 2 0 β e 2 σ 2 1 2 β 2 1 e 8 σ 2 0 0 0 1 2 β 2 1 e 8 σ 2 7 β r h r v r h r v 8 r h c o s θ ε r sin 2 θ c o s θ ε r sin 2 θ 9 r v ε r 1 sin 2 θ ε r 1 sin 2 θ ε r c o s θ ε r sin 2 θ 2 where β 1 0 denotes the scattering coefficient determined by the incidence angle θ and the dielectric constant ε r β denotes the conjugate of β σ 2 denotes the variance of the orientation angle distribution which is related to soil surface roughness and incidence angle r h and r v denote the bragg reflection coefficients for horizontal and vertical polarization respectively 3 3 soil moisture estimation using two component polarimetric decomposition the dihedral scattering contribution is assumed negligible in comparison with the surface and volume contributions the radar backscatter signal in the area covered by crops e g wheat soybean etc consists of two components from the underlying soil and the vegetation layer then the observed coherency matrix t 3 is expressed as 10 t 3 f g t g f v t v t r where f g and f v are the amplitudes of surface scattering and volume scattering respectively t r denotes the residual matrix further the equation to be solved based on the observations can be written as 11 t 11 f g f v t v 11 t 12 f g β e 2 σ 2 f v t v 12 t 22 1 2 f g β 2 1 e 8 σ 2 f v t v 22 t 33 1 2 f g β 2 1 e 8 σ 2 f v t v 33 where t ij and t vij represent the elements of the observed and volume coherency matrix respectively to avoid the situation in which the surface scattering power is negative due to the priority of model inversion the volume scattering power f v is derived by the well known non negative eigenvalue decomposition nned process van zyl et al 2011 the nned concept requires the remainder matrix t 3 f v t v to be positive semidefinite to avoid negative powers the f v is corresponding to the maximum possible volume scattering which is actually the minimum root i e f v m i n f v 1 f v 2 f v 3 in solving cubic equations by setting the determinate of the reminder matrix to zero cui et al 2014 12 d e t t 3 f v t v 0 where d e t is the matrix determinant and f v 1 f v 2 and f v 3 are the solved three roots then the analytical expression of β can be solved from the set of equations and is given as 13 β t 12 f v t v 12 t 11 f v t v 11 e 2 σ 2 to obtain the best fit solution a look up table of the volume scattering model randomness parameters i e γ n and τ and the residual matrix power is constructed the optimal value of β is determined by minimizing the power in the residual matrix i e minp t r after removing the volume scattering component then soil dielectric constant ε r can be extracted depending on the specific functional relationship as shown in eq 7 9 hajnsek et al 2009 as it is known the dielectric constant of natural soils presents a valid empirical physical range i e ε r 2 41 hajnsek et al 2003 however non physical values of ε r may be obtained under the condition of pursuing the minimum power in the residual matrix previous studies used some semi empirical models to optimize the solution range of the dielectric constant while considering the spatial heterogeneity of sm ouellette et al 2017 shi et al 2021a the experimental results show that this approach can effectively improve the inversion accuracy however the optimization methods for the constraints in these studies require a priori knowledge of soil roughness making the inversion costly in this vein we designed an algorithm of dielectric constant boundary constraint based on a semi empirical model and for which no prior information of soil roughness is required the semi empirical model was established by dubois et al 1995 and it describes the radar backscattering coefficients as functions of dielectric constant ε r and surface roughness ks for a truck mounted x c and l band dataset 14 σ hh 10 2 75 c o s θ 1 5 s i n θ 5 10 0 028 ε r t a n θ k s s i n θ 1 4 λ 0 7 15 σ vv 10 2 35 c o s θ 3 s

on the calculation of the dielectric constant constraint boundary the yamaguchi volume scattering model yamaguchi et al 2005 is used to remove the vegetation scattering component and to obtain the surface backscattering coefficient given a typical range of soil roughness 0 1 k s 3 0 and dielectric constant 2 ε r 41 simulated values of backscattering in the scene can be derived using the dubois model then a look up table correlating the real and the simulated values of the backscattering coefficients is constructed and the soil dielectric constant ε r dubois in the study fields can be preliminarily estimated using the following cost function 16 f σ hh real σ hh simu 2 σ vv real σ vv simu 2 later by fitting the distribution of the obtained dielectric constants over the entire study area using a gaussian function the upper and lower boundaries of the confidence interval with 95 probability are taken as the maximum and minimum values of the constraint range of the dielectric constants finally the dielectric hybrid model proposed by topp et al 1980 is utilized to estimate the sm 17 sm 5 3 2 92 ε r 0 055 ε r 2 0 00043 ε r 3 fig 4 summarizes the schematic diagram for retrieving sm using the generalized two component polarimetric decomposition method based on the physical constraint of the dielectric constant 4 results and discussion 4 1 scattering mechanism analysis the eigenvalue eigenvector based h α decomposition cloude and pottier 1997 which can provide an interpretation of information based on mathematical properties is used to analyze the dominant scattering mechanism present over the soybean and wheat fields polarimetric entropy h is a measurement of scattering randomness in a statistical sense and the basic scattering mechanisms are identified by α angle fig 5 plots the h α plane for all eight images measured in the wheat and soybean fields since the wheat plants in early may are relatively short and sparse the scattering consists mainly of two components surface and volume the pixels located in the low entropy region correspond to the bragg surface scattering case while the surface scattering of pixels in the medium entropy region is influenced by soil roughness as expected with the growth of wheat the canopy structure becomes more complex and the entropy increases gradually in late june most of the pixels in the wheat fields are dominated by volume scattering it is noteworthy that the surface scattering contribution of wheat in the same period is greater in may 2015 than that in may 2013 this is due to the larger incidence angle of the may images in 2015 see table 1 compared with that of 2013 which favors the surface backscatter due to a reduced attenuation by vegetation because of a shorter path through the vegetation canopy this is consistent with the description provided by wang et al 2018 for soybean although it is at the early phenological growth stage on july 17 volume scattering is dominant due to the crop residues from the previous season which are left on the field in august the residues are completely covered by the soybean plants when the canopy closes hence more pixels are dominated by surface scattering as shown in fig 5 g although the soybean canopy is further developed on september 3 the anisotropic component is slightly decreased relative to the previous period this can be attributed to the reduced vegetation water content improving the penetration of the microwave signal agreeing with the wilted leaves shown in the ground truth photograph overall the dihedral scattering contribution over the crop fields observed is insignificant because of the limited penetration capability of the c band radar signal it somehow demonstrates the reasonability of using two component decomposition model in this study in addition various degrees of anisotropic volume scattering are found at different growth stages of the same crop type and at the same growth stage of different crop types indicating the necessity of using a generalized volume scattering model in the decomposition framework 4 2 comparison of scattering powers to verify the application performance of the three generalized volume scattering models under different vegetation cover conditions we selected six images in 2015 and analyzed their decomposition results of scattering powers under the proposed two component decomposition framework as shown in fig 6 the forest region in each image is always dominated by volume scattering component over the farmland area surface scattering is mainly dominant at the early phenological stages and volume scattering gradually increases benefiting from favorable geometric configurations with the development of crop phenological stages replacing surface scattering as the dominant contribution some crops such as soybean and corn are reaching maturity in september the surface scattering signal increases due to enhanced signal penetration these decomposition results obtained from all three volume scattering models seem to illustrate the temporal evolution of different land cover types for further comparison histograms of the two scattering power contributions are shown in fig 7 which correspond to the dates in fig 6 the temporal evolution of the scattering power distributions is apparently consistent with the crop development characteristics the contribution of volume scattering increases as the phenological stage of wheat evolves whereas the opposite phenomenon is found over soybean fields due to the influence of crop residues and vegetation moisture content which agrees with the conclusions obtained from the h α planes in addition both the surface and volume scattering powers of soybean exhibit a wider distribution range this is expected since the stems and leaves of soybean have a more diverse geometric structure regarding the comparison among volume models it is found that the volume scattering powers obtained from snvsm on the six dates are slightly higher than those from savsm in contrast the gvsm obtains obviously lower volume scattering power than the other two models especially on june 23 i e in the grain filling period of wheat these observations can be interpreted by the structure of volume scattering models refer to fig 3 the volume scattering power strongly depends on the structure of volume scattering matrix in theory the smaller the value of t v 33 in volume scattering matrix the higher the possible derived maximum volume scattering power pvmax within the physical ranges of the randomness parameters the overall variation trends of the elements in the savsm and snvsm coherency matrix are consistent as the particle orientation randomness increases i e n is close to 0 or τ is approaching to 1 the absolute values of t v 12 and t v 22 decrease whereas t v 33 increases it is noteworthy that t v 33 0 5 when τ 1 2 in snvsm corresponding to the obtained pvmax of 8 s hv 2 which is consistent with the freeman durden volume scattering model this case is satisfied only when n 0 in savsm however t v 33 in savsm has an upward trend for an interval near n 0 as a result the obtained pvmax with savsm is less than 8 s hv 2 in this stage thus the decomposition results using snvsm present higher volume scattering power than savsm when the canopy particle scattering is more random for example during the late growth stage of wheat or soybean in contrast gvsm is based on symmetric properties in the scene leading to the persistent assumption that t v 22 is equal to t v 33 nevertheless this is a strict condition that holds true only in the case of purely random volume xie et al 2018 this assumption also leads to the fact that t v 33 decreases until 0 5 with the increase of orientation randomness i e γ tends to 0 showing the opposite trend to the other two models therefore the maximum pvmax obtained with gvsm during the whole range of the randomness parameter is 8 s hv 2 while the other two models can obtain higher pvmax in low randomness volume cases 4 3 comparison of retrieved soil moisture to quantitatively analyze the sm inversion results the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient are adopted as evaluation indices to compare the estimated sm results from the three generalized volume scattering models against the field measurements on each date the average sm value of all pixels within a 5 5 window around the sample point site is taken as the inversion result the scatterplots of the inversion results using different methods are represented in fig 8 and the rmses of all cases are listed in table 2 according to the growth stages of the two different crops the sm inversion accuracy tends to decrease with the crop phenological development an interesting observation is that the accuracies of all methods on both days in 2013 are higher than those at the same growth stage in 2015 this is mainly caused by the weak sensitivity of β to the change of soil dielectric constant at low incidence angles hajnsek et al 2009 in addition the incidence angle on may 20 2015 is outside the best applicable range 30 θ 70 of the dubois model dubois et al 1995 resulting in an inaccurate calculation of the constraint range of the dielectric constant hence induces the worst inversion results in the wheat fields the sm inversion performance of all models in the soybean fields is worse than that in the wheat fields due to the uncertainty of decomposition result caused by the complex canopy shape and structure of soybean the sm retrieval algorithm shows a better performance at a later phenological stage of soybean it mainly stems from the higher signal penetration under dry vegetation conditions however the dubois model is insensitive to the dielectric constant under dry soil conditions xiao et al 2021 leading to a systematic overestimation of the inversion results on september 3 2015 these results indicate that the of sm retrieval capability under vegetation cover is influenced by the microwave properties incidence angle and penetrability and crop growth stage that regulates the vegetation structure and water content among the three methods sm estimation with snvsm obtains most of the optimal rmses in the wheat fields especially at the later development stages and all of the optimal rmses in the soybean fields as a result snvsm achieves the lowest overall rmse 4 99 vol and the highest correlation coefficient r 0 78 the sm inversion results using gvsm show the largest deviation with respect to the ground reference data among the three models with an overall rmse of 6 16 vol and a correlation coefficient of r 0 69 compared with gvsm savsm obtains similar results during the early growing season of wheat and soybean while it provides better performance of sm inversion after leaf development and obtains an overall rmse of 5 74 vol and a correlation coefficient of r 0 72 in addition it can be seen in fig 8 that the correlation between the estimated and measured values obtained by gvsm is weak in fields with large spatial variability of sm this can be attributed to the insufficient quantification of the spatial heterogeneity in crop shape and structure in contrast snvsm obtains sm estimates closer to the true values and provides a robust inversion performance the differences in performance among methods depend on the ability of the volume scattering model employed to simulate and remove the signal induced by the vegetation layer this result confirms that snvsm can best characterize the volume scattering component and hence remove the canopy effect better than the other two models in this decomposition framework fig 9 illustrates the temporal dynamics of the mean sm retrieved on each date by the three volume scattering models the time series evolution of the sm inversion results is relatively consistent with the reference data this suggests that the two component decomposition method has a high application potential for sm estimation in vegetated agricultural areas where the contribution of dihedral scattering is sufficiently small using c band data all three methods show different degrees of underestimation of sm on may 23 2013 this error is probably caused by the saturation of sar signal under high sm conditions which is in line with previous studies baghdadi et al 2008 wang et al 2017 it is noteworthy that during the periods highly dominated by volume scattering higher sm is retrieved using gvsm compared with the other two models the reason is that gvsm removes less volume scattering component and retains more surface scattering component associated with sm except for dates with low vegetation cover i e may 09 and may 23 2013 the average value of sm obtained by snvsm is closest to the ground measurements supporting its best performance in removing the volume scattering component it should be noted that volume scattering is removed first before sm retrieval using different surface scattering models in other two component decomposition inversion methods huang et al 2016a wang et al 2018 xiao et al 2021 hence incorporating the assumption of model priority in contrast the combination of the minimum residual power criterion and the dielectric constant constraint implemented in the two component decomposition framework proposed in this research can theoretically make the obtained surface scattering component more adapted to the ground response thus the overestimation of volume scattering can be effectively mitigated and more accurate sm estimates can be obtained however the method proposed in this study ignores dihedral scattering which may be significant for some crop types with big stalks such as corn moreover the inaccuracy of the dielectric constant constraint obtained by the dubois model affects the inversion performance outside the applicable conditions 5 conclusion in this paper three generalized volume scattering models i e gvsm savsm and snvsm are incorporated in a polsar decomposition methodology and evaluated for soil moisture retrieval a modified two component decomposition which includes a physical constraint of the dielectric constant is proposed as the basic framework for soil moisture inversion regarding the limited height of crop and the complexity of scattering models the dihedral component is neglected in the proposed soil moisture retrieval framework besides the inversion technique does not require any external prior information like the vegetation index in semi empirical soil moisture retrieval models e g water cloud model whose retrieval result is directly determined by the numerical solution of the parameters under a minimum residual power criterion multiple radarsat 2 c band images over an agriculture region and two typical crops i e wheat and soybean are selected for testing purposes according to the model definition the snvsm can remove more volume scattering component under complex vegetation cover than the other two models whereas gvsm has the lowest volume scattering removal efficiency due to the assumption that t v 22 t v 33 the soil moisture inversion results for different phenological stages in wheat and soybean fields show that the inversion performance is influenced by the microwave properties incidence angle and penetrability the crop growth status and the inherent limitation of the surface scattering model the three volume models provide reasonable soil moisture inversion performance during the crop growing season with rmses between 2 89 and 7 43 vol it confirms that the synergy between the physical constraint and the minimum residual power criterion in the proposed decomposition method can mitigate the overestimation of volume scattering and provide more accurate surface components in particular soil moisture estimates obtained by snvsm at different phenological stages are more consistent with ground measurements than the other two models with an overall rmse of 4 99 vol and a correlation coefficient of 0 78 although the inversion accuracy decreases in general as the spatial variability of soil moisture increases or with higher vegetation presence e g the late crop phenological stage snvsm still shows robust performance in soil moisture retrieval and can accurately reflect the time series dynamics of soil moisture under a crop cover since the accuracy of the soil moisture inversion under vegetation cover depends largely on the performance of the volume scattering model this study demonstrates that snvsm simulates the scattering characteristics of vegetation canopy at a quantitative level better than the other two generalized volume scattering models in the proposed two component decomposition framework future studies will be conducted for testing the methods proposed in this paper with other crop types soil types and varying surface roughness moreover the effect of dihedral scattering component could be considered for soil moisture retrieval over dense vegetated fields with prominent stalks funding this work was supported in part by the national natural science

2739,tropical regions have experienced the fastest land use land cover change lulcc in the last decades coupled with climate change cc this has affected the hydrological and geomorphological processes of river systems with the increased demand for land the general trend has been the loss of forest land to agriculture and settlements these changes have altered the water balance components through enhanced or reduced evaporation peak flow flooding and river morphology the aim of this review paper is to provide a meta analysis on the effects of spatiotemporal changes in climate and lulc on river hydro morphology in the tropics following a systematic search 60 case studies were identified of which the majority 68 experienced forest loss due to agricultural and urban expansion resulting in increased streamflow surface flow and total water yield and decreased et and groundwater recharge 12 of the case studies showed the impacts of lulcc on channel morphology features through sediment transport and riverbank erosion results from this study show limited correlation between lulcc and hydrological variables indicating that there are likely other factors controlling hydrological processes catchment heterogeneity including soil and topography play an important role based on studies that project these changes into the future similar trends are expected over the next decades with differences based on lu and climate scenarios there are still limited studies on river hydro morphology responses to lulcc and cc in the tropics despite the major changes taking place there in light of future changes more studies are needed to improve our understanding keywords land use land cover change climate change hydro morphology tropical regions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it has been estimated that about 17 of the earth s land surface has changed at least once between 1960 and 2019 resulting in a global forest loss of 0 8 million km2 and 1 0 million km2 increase of agricultural land among other changes winkler et al 2021 these widespread land use land cover changes lulcc mainly attributed to human causes anthropogenic affect watershed hydrologic systems in diverse ways bridgewater et al 2018 primarily through the alteration of rainfall and runoff processes gebremicael et al 2019 furthermore they contribute to changes in river channel morphology through soil erosion and deposition chuenchum et al 2020 maaβ et al 2021 along with these anthropogenic factors climate change cc influences the intensity and frequency of rainfall and temperature koneti et al 2018 which have direct effects on quantities of evapotranspiration et and runoff according to ipcc ar6 2021 since the 1970s each decade has been successively warmer than the preceding one mainly due to anthropogenic green house gas ghg emissions resulting from economic and population growth furthermore cc will likely intensify these changes rainfall and temperature patterns in the future leading to increased frequency of extreme hydrologic events ipcc ar6 2021 ipcc 2014 the tropics have experienced the fastest rate of lulcc especially deforestation with estimates of 8 0 million ha year in the 1990s and 7 6 million ha year in the 2000s achard et al 2014 the tropics lost 11 1 million hectares of tree cover in 2021 liz mikaela 2022 these changes were largely driven by demographic and socio economic growth gashaw et al 2018 the pressure exerted on tropical river basins due to lulcc has been steadily increasing over recent decades farinosi et al 2019 naomie 2020 wiejaczka et al 2014 agriculture has been the dominant force driving lulcc in the last century with more than half of all new agricultural land in the tropics converted from forest between 1980 and 2000 lambin meyfroidt 2011 river hydro morphology describes the hydrological and geomorphological processes and properties of a river system their interactions and their spatial distribution and variability jba 2021 it deals with physical processes determining river behavior hajdukiewicz et al 2017 and the resulting configurations or morphology lulcc translates into changes in the water balance components through enhanced or reduced evaporation peak flow and flooding teklay et al 2021 additionally to lulcc changes in water balance components such as peak flows quantity timing and duration impact morphological properties langat et al 2020 land cover plays an important role in these processes as it defines the soil state the magnitude of these effects depends on the watershed characteristics including the size extent of change topography soil characteristics and weather conditions allan et al 1997 moraes et al 2018 fig 1 illustrates the interrelations between these different components lulcc and cc are inter linked as changes in land cover affect the atmospheric energy balance which influences rainfall and temperature patterns while at the same time lulc is affected by changes in weather patterns the same feedback mechanism exists between lulc and catchment hydrology as well as on river morphology climate change and hydrology have one way effects on river morphology understanding the watershed hydro morphological responses to changes in both climate and lulc especially in tropical regions where rainy seasons are followed by dry seasons gomes et al 2021 is vital for effective and sustainable land and water resources management despite extensive reviews on the effects of lulcc and cc on basin hydrology there is limited focus on both morphological and hydrological feedbacks in tropical regions focusing on the tropics we undertook a meta analysis of existing studies analyzing these aspects in order to better understand the effects of spatiotemporal changes in climate and lulc on river hydro morphology an overview of the lulcc transitions in the region is provided process steps to identify relevant research publications related to this topic are outlined including both empirical research and simulation modelling works subsequently we provide an overview of the associated historical and potential future impacts of the lulcc and cc on river hydro morphology 2 literature review lulcc impacts on river hydro morphological processes 2 1 lulc transitions and their impacts on hydrological components water balance is at the heart of all hydrological processes that occur in a watershed akpoti et al 2016 cc affects the rainfall and temperature patterns chuenchum et al 2020 while lulcc affects how the watershed responds to rainfall by altering different components of the water balance including rates of interception infiltration evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge rates santillan et al 2019 consequently lulcc affect the timing and amount of surface runoff baker miller 2013 in this section we summarize the mechanisms that underlie the changes in hydro morphology of tropical catchments in response to lulc transitions lulc categories considered include forests agriculture urban areas degraded land and pastureland the lulc transitions investigated in this paper and their impacts on the water balance components are illustrated in fig 2 forest is known to consume a lot of water through evapotranspiration trees water consumption and promote groundwater recharge aladejana et al 2018 tan et al 2015 the forest deep roots serve as flow paths for recharging the ground water and increase the base flow farinosi et al 2019 ogden et al 2013 in addition forest increases the infiltration rate and improves the water holding capacity of the soil obahoundje et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 therefore deforestation decreases the infiltration processes due to a decrease in soil permeability less rainfall interception leading to an increase in runoff decrease in baseflow and less ground water recharge naha et al 2021 olang et al 2011 conversely afforestation has been linked with reduced river streamflow and water yield as a result of increased evapotranspiration aragaw et al 2021 agriculture practices can lead to soil crusting which reduces the soil infiltration rate teklay et al 2021 cultivated land is prone to surface runoff generation näschen et al 2019 since the land is less covered at the beginning of the rainy season bekele et al 2018 therefore there is more rapid conversion of rainfall to runoff naha et al 2021 dias et al 2015 found that the streamflow in soy catchments was about three times greater than that of forest catchments in brazil the expansion of cultivated land at the expense of natural vegetation tends to decrease soil and water storage thus decreases the rainfall infiltration rate and leads to an increase in surface flow sinha eldho 2018 sulamo et al 2021 as well as the rate at which it reaches the stream network getu engida et al 2021 a horton et al 2021 additionally the absence of deep rooting system and extensive canopies leads to less et and groundwater recharge and amplifies runoff das et al 2018 koneti et al 2018 urban expansion is associated with an increase in impermeable areas hence decreasing the infiltration and groundwater recharge rates associated with an increase in runoff conveyance and flow peaks akpoti et al 2016 viola et al 2014 the extension of built up areas in place of natural vegetation cover alters the water resources through changes in biophysical properties e g vegetation canopy cover getu engida et al 2021 pastureland extension tends to decrease the infiltration rate due to soil compaction by grazing thus increasing the surface runoff and the streamflow magnitude hassaballah et al 2017 hengade eldho 2019 as a result of soil compaction higher proportion of rainfall is being converted into surface runoff instead of infiltrating the soil and contributing to groundwater gw recharge baker miller 2013 in summary large scale transition of tropical forest to non forest land affects the water cycle it decreases infiltration and interception increases surface runoff and significantly decreases the evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge therefore the compacted bare soil exposed to intense rainfall increases the discharge rate rapidly and suddenly increasing flood risk a j horton et al 2021 sugianto et al 2022 moreover deforestation impacts atmospheric water input causing more intense dry seasons which exacerbates drought risks qi et al 2020 staal et al 2020 2 2 river morphology responses to lulcc according to ofb 2010 there exist two morphological factors of a river control factors including water discharge and sediment load and response factors river planform and channel cross section the dynamics in channel morphology are attributed to flow velocity riverbank erosion sediment deposition and changes in riverine vegetation cover that are induced by both human activities and climate change langat et al 2019 verma et al 2021 vegetation cover and hydrological regimes play an important role in the morphological processes of a river kijowska strugała et al 2017 consequently the transition from natural vegetation to unvegetated landscape often decreases the surface roughness and increases the flow velocity which causes soil erosion and sediment transport bekele et al 2018 the changes in the magnitude and timing of river flows and sedimentation lead to alteration and instability of river systems ibitoye 2021 roy sahu 2016 moreover a reduction in water yield and or a drop in groundwater levels and associated reduction in baseflow may alter the small perennial rivers into intermittent regime yifru et al 2021 ultimatey altering channel morphology in response to flow volumes human activities such as dam construction mining and agriculture affect river morphology through altering the channel geometry as well as the dynamics of water and sediment movement bhattacharya et al 2019 ramani et al 2021 the same applies to upstream lulcc within catchments which directly contribute to the changes in water and sediment movement wiejaczka et al 2014 woldesenbet et al 2018 prokop et al 2020 found that long term lulcc have accelerated water and sediment fluxes hence resulted in riverbank erosion bed aggradation and an increased risk of flooding streams in forested landscapes tend to be hydrologically and geomorphologically more stable than in other landscapes roy sahu 2016 they usually have wider and more stable channels with less sediments allan 2004 wubalem yihunie 2021 this is in part because of the higher water retention capacity lower discharge reduce streamflow velocities and lesser sediment load as well as a stable bank slopes wubalem yihunie 2021 usually forests provide effective protection from shallow landslides and soil erosion primarily because of root binding and a lower water deficit in the soil vanacker et al 2005 therefore deforestation accelerates runoff response such as the timing of peak flows and may result in an increased flood volumes and sediment transport hassaballah et al 2017 long term afforestation has been accompanied with river adjustment channels becoming more narrowed with reduced sinuosity and secondary channels tending to be abandoned fernandes et al 2020 scorpio piégay 2021 agricultural lands are characterized by increased surface runoff and sediment transports compared to forests baker miller 2013 as such streams in agricultural landscapes are characterized by sediment laden beds and deeply incised valleys with severe bank erosion roy sahu 2016 additionally transition from vegetated to uncovered lands after crop harvest increases the stream discharge and sediment yield from end of growing season rainfalls which are a major determinant of river morphology dynamics ibitoye 2021 obahoundje et al 2018 sinha eldho 2018 a study in lake tana beles ethiopia found that erosion rates on agricultural lands were much higher compared to all other land due to the cropping on steep slopes woldesenbet et al 2018 indicating the important interaction of lulc and topography an extension of bare land and grazing land over vegetated lands results in increased surface water and sediment flows thus making stream channels wider and shallower from active channel erosion and sediment deposition yousefi et al 2019 in addition it leads to an increase in peak flows and a reduction in the time of concentration moraes et al 2018 allan et al 1997 study revealed that sediment yields increased dramatically with agricultural expansion less dramatically with increase in urban lands and reduced with forest cover increase moreover rivers draining agricultural lands have a higher sediment yield compared to other land cover types 3 material and methods 3 1 geographical description areas of study the tropics are regions between the tropic of cancer 23 degrees north latitude and the tropic of capricorn 23 degrees south latitude they cover about 40 of the planet s land surface within the boundaries of at least 70 countries racke et al 1997 the region is home to around 40 of the world s population which is expected to increase to over 50 by 2050 marcotullio et al 2021 un 2010 based on köppen climate classification climate in the tropics is classified into three types 1 tropical rainforest af 2 tropical monsoon am and 3 tropical wet and dry savanna aw or as the general pattern of the tropical climate is warm temperatures with a monthly mean temperature ranging from 18 degreesc in am to 25 c in af rainfall patterns vary from af with plenty of rain throughout the year 2000 mm to am 1000 mm and aw 1000 mm where there is a seasonal shift in rainfall patterns beck et al 2018 chen chen 2013 while specific land cover types differ between different areas forests abound in the tropical region tropical forest covers 17 million km2 about 31 of ice free land dry forest accounts for 4 and tropical savannah takes up 15 marcotullio et al 2021 3 2 inventory of case studies in this review we synthesized peer reviewed papers published between 2010 and 2021 focusing on the assessment of hydro morphological responses to lulcc and cc in the tropical regions the literature search was carried out using the web of science database https www webofscience com search results were categorized into two components 1 hydrology of tropical rivers and 2 morphology of tropical rivers fig 3 outlines the filtering process used to screen the existing literature the first filter yielded 1 140 papers on hydrology and 149 papers on river morphology a set of pre defined criteria was set to screen the identified papers these criteria are grouped under the label 1 and are as follow land use land cover change river hydrology streamflow surface runoff groundwater baseflow water yield sediment yield and evapotranspiration river morphology channel cross section channel erosion channel aggradation and riverbank characteristics publication time 2010 to 2021 for articles related to river hydrology after manually screening using criteria 1 202 articles were identified a second filter that considered the spatial region tropical areas in this case yielded 52 articles we used the same approach for river morphology component ultimately we found 20 out of 149 references on morphology after the first screening of which 10 were within the area of interest two articles were identified under both components in total 60 peer reviewed papers fig 3 were used for our analysis of which 30 are related to africa 19 for asia and the remaining 11 for south america fig 4 3 3 general framework of the methods applied geospatial data are important for understanding the way in which the earth surface changes and how its hydrological system works mulungu and kashaigili 2012 the hydrological responses to lulcc and cc have been widely analyzed with most of the studies using integrated approaches involving geographical information systems gis remote sensing statistical analysis and other models e g hydrological models a combination of remote sensing data and gis provides an efficient and affordable method for exploring changes in the earth surface shahrood et al 2020 singh et al 2015 and river morphological dynamics tariq shu 2020 on a spatial and temporal scale as well as simulating the future change scenarios hamad et al 2018 this is only possible because of the satellite imageries that are repetitive andualem et al 2018 for the identified case studies fig 5 presents the range of application of methods used in the analyses these methods are classified into change analysis for lulc and climate and the hydrological and morphological impacts assessment 3 3 1 lulc assessment techniques the majority of the reviewed articles used satellite images to generate lulc classification maps techniques for classifying images include object based image analysis koneti et al 2018 as well as pixel based methods including supervised sinha eldho 2018 unsupervised and hybrid aragaw et al 2021 out of 60 reviewed papers 41 applied per pixel classification methods especially supervised approaches others used existing classified maps sourced from government departments or global data such as modis lc globeland30 ngcc and indian space research organization isro thereafter the transition matrix derived from classified lulc maps together with socio economic and biophysical driving factors were used to simulate potential future lu scenarios teklay et al 2021 the simulation were conducted using either land use models abe et al 2018 or statistical methods and assumptions getachew et al 2021 some models apply the aspect of land demand based on the historical trend then spatially allocate them based on the dependent variables das et al 2018 khoi et al 2021 three types of models are commonly used such as empirical statistical based on mathematical equations spatially explicit or rule based and agent based models han et al 2015 a total of 12 reviewed papers used a variety of models to predict the spatial pattern of lu scenarios based on historical trends transition based or the simulated hypothesis predictive based models with ca markov being the most used model 3 3 2 climate change assessment methods in addition to lulcc studies also considered the impact of cc on historical and future hydro morphological changes the meteorological time series were used for statistical trend analysis as a basis of historical cc rientjes et al 2011 while future cc was simulated using climate models sridhar et al 2019 or based on scenario assumptions legesse et al 2010 future cc was simulated based on the four different representative concentration pathways rcps defined by the ipcc teklay et al 2021 studies have been using global climate models gcms datasets for large scale cc data or the regional climate models rcms derived from downscaled gcms kumar 2019 pachauri et al 2014 yifru et al 2021 to improve the accuracy of climate data at a small scale studies combined several climate projection models at varying spatial resolution rather than relying on a single model bessah et al 2019 pandey et al 2021 sridhar et al 2019 other studies used the ensemble mean of multiple rcms in their precipitation and temperature projections to avoid substantial differences between individual rcms dibaba et al 2020 3 3 3 hydrology features most of the case studies applied an integrated approach involving gis remote sensing statistical analysis and hydrological models there are two major categories of methods applied statistical and simulation based statistical methods are used to analyze historical data whereas simulation models are used to predict future scenarios though there is tendency in combining both methods to analyze historical trends wei et al 2013 hydrological models can be classified into three types namely lumped semi distributed and fully distributed models wei et al 2013 zhuo et al 2014 lumped models describe a watershed as a single unit whereas distributed models discretize the watershed into hydrologic response units with homogenous land characteristics e g slope and soils jajarmizadeh et al 2012 mohammed et al 2018 fully distributed models are generally more detailed compared to semi distributed with each grid cell representing one lu type pina et al 2016 the swat model is an example of a physically based semi distributed hydrological model and it has been used in about a third of the reviewed papers 3 3 4 morphology features the morphological assessment includes assessing the channel forms geomorphic adjustment and human interventions belletti et al 2015 the methods range from image classification and change detection to field assessment and models satellite images are commonly used to detect changes in river morphology by identifying how the channel migrates or shifts over time mohamad et al 2018 wubalem yihunie 2021 in the reviewed papers three methods were applied including image classification and change detection statistical methods and physical models all along with field surveys the assessed morphological features include erosion deposition of the banks bank line migration bar growth channel bed elevations and channel cross sectional geometry langat et al 2019 tariq shu 2020 empirical models were used to analyze the diverse morphological elements and hydro dynamic features of a river shahrood et al 2020 predictive models such as conceptual models based on historical trends and numerical models have been used to simulate future morphological scenarios surian ziliani 2012 arima autoregressive integrated moving average is an example of autoregressive model used to predict the future river behaviors verma et al 2021 3 3 5 uncertainties in hydrological climate and lulc models climate land use and hydro morphological models contain uncertainties derived from parameters and model structure teklay et al 2021 this is known as equifinality and it is one of the most prominent source of uncertainty naha et al 2021 uncertainties also arise from input data such as soil classified lulc and both observed and simulated climate data araza et al 2021 sinha eldho 2018 models for small catchments are often subjected to uncertainties when applied to coarse resolution data araza et al 2021 raihan et al 2021 however large scale basins also represent uncertainty risks due to the difficulty of accounting for spatial heterogeneity of basin characteristics pandey et al 2021 moreover projections are uncertain due to lack of socio economic data policy and regulation information related to future development as well as in situ data gomes et al 2021 pandey et al 2021 in order to minimize uncertainties models parameters are typically calibrated generally based on observations araza et al 2021 regarding uncertainty in climate input data a variety of bias correction methods have been developed to reduce uncertainties from different climate models such as the delta method for temperature and quantile mapping qm for precipitation raihan et al 2021 or more advanced methods such as multivariate bias correction vrac 2018 in addition monte carlo simulations have been used in the reviewed articles to identify behavioral model simulations accounting for parameterization uncertainties naha et al 2021 3 4 meta analysis based on studies that investigate temporal changes we examined the impact of spatiotemporal changes of land use land cover on river hydro morphology we found that 45 of 60 case studies included in this review examined lulcc and their responses over several decades before and after comparison as for the remaining 15 studies some compared catchments with different lulc types dias et al 2015 ogden et al 2013 prokop et al 2020 others explored general terms such as water balance chemura et al 2020 infiltration rate olang et al 2011 peak flow and flood a horton et al 2021 moraes et al 2018 additionally we differentiated historical observed and future simulated periods creating 69 different datasets from 45 case studies supplementary material summarizes the findings from the 60 articles including cc scenarios considered for each case study 4 results table 1 illustrates the findings for lulcc percentage change per catchment and their hydro morphological responses percentage change based on the baseline as well as their climate classifications we considered four major lulc classes including forest agriculture built up and bush shrub grass and five hydrological components such as streamflow surface runoff surq evapotranspiration et ground water gw and water yield wyld based on the results from table 1 the major changes in the lulc are the expansion of agriculture and the decline of forest cover with few occasions of forest expansion according to our analysis findings are categorized into four main outcomes i the general trend has been the natural vegetation forest loss primarily associated to agricultural and or urban expansion while other classes bushes shrubs and grasslands have fluctuated such changes resulted in an increased streamflow surface flow and water yield coupled with a decreased et and groundwater recharge for example gidabo river basin aragaw et al 2021 benin owena river basin aladejana et al 2018 and upper brantas river basin setyorini et al 2017 ii increase in forest land associated with a decrease in agriculture grassland and or shrubland mainly the reforestation scenarios gomes et al 2021 teklay et al 2021 resulted in decreased streamflow and surface flow while et increased this is consistent with past afforestation forest gain in nyong river basin ewane lee 2020 godavari river basin hengade eldho 2019 iii in terms of morphology the expansion of agricultural lands coupled with increased water and sediment yields kenea et al 2021 has contributed to riverbank erosion and channel sedimentation additionally due to sediment deposition and riverbank erosion river niger resulted in dual centerlines and the channel width increased from 2 8 to 3 5 km ibitoye 2021 similar conditions also impacted the gomit river leading to channel degradation and aggradation wubalem yihunie 2021 the channel width increases due to lateral erosion and channel depth decreases due to sedimentation wubalem yihunie 2021 iv in farmlands the majority of rainfall is converted into streamflow however some studies showed a decrease in streamflow and an increase in et as cultivated lands have expanded on forestland rientjes et al 2011 sridhar et al 2019 this is primarily due to high evaporation rates on irrigated lands and irrigation water use teklay et al 2021 to better understand the relations between lulcc and hydrological variables we developed scatter plots fig 6 that represent streamflow surface runoff and et gw to forest and agriculture across the reviewed case studies each dot in those figures represent one case study including scenarios and their common behavior informs general trends negative correlation exists between forest cover and streamflow while et has a positive correlation with forest cover fig 6a expansion of agricultural land is associated with increased streamflow and negatively correlated with et fig 6b surface runoff decreases with forest cover gain and groundwater recharge is positively correlated with forest cover gain fig 6c reverse trends exist with agricultural land expansion fig 6d 5 discussion 5 1 historical change trends our analysis shows that all lulc types have impacts on hydrological components however basin catchment characteristics and lulcc dynamics affect the river system processes dibaba et al 2020 vanacker et al 2005 as represented in fig 6 agriculture land area is directly proportional to streamflow and surface runoff and inversely proportional to et and groundwater recharge while forests have the opposite relationship aladejana et al 2018 gashaw et al 2018 woldesenbet et al 2017 et is the key element in understanding the effect of lulcc especially in tropical regions as it constitutes a significant percentage of the precipitation over the land surface robertson et al 2021 and constitutes the major water consumption through transpiration canopy interception and eventual evaporation and soil evaporation twisa et al 2020 tropical regions are largely located in developing countries where demographic and socio economic growth are the driving forces for increased exploitation of natural resources ewane lee 2020 kenea et al 2021 changes in lulc have been attributed to rapid population growth and the resulting increase in land demands for subsistence agriculture settlements and the use of wood and biomass fuel guzha et al 2018 we found that the most pronounced changes in lulc happened before 2000s the period when the greatest deforestation and expansion of cultivated and built up was reported however since 2000s the trends changed as the magnitude of forest cover loss has decreased this is attributed to global initiatives and government measures towards afforestation and restoration programs bekele et al 2018 hassaballah et al 2017 raihan et al 2021 some global and regional initiatives towards increasing forest cover include afr100 the african forest landscape restoration initiative the bonn challenge targeting to bring 350 million hectares of forests under restoration radhika dave et al 2018 these initiatives are in addition to country laws and policies aimed at conservation and reforestation efforts andrade ribeiro 2019 brazil s xopotó river basin experienced an increase in forest cover due to the new forest code moraes et al 2018 there has been an increase in forest cover in godavari river basin as a result of india s effort to protect and restore natural and plantation resorts hengade eldho 2019 koneti et al 2018 in addition different countries adopted environmental friendly agriculture methods such as soil and water conservation measures through different projects such as the national sustainable land management mekonnen et al 2018 the forest cover increase trend is evident from several studies table 1 including the forest loss 5 2 in the upper blue nile river basin in ethiopia 1973 to 1995 followed by the 3 4 increase afterwards such changes were attributed to the afforestation and soil and water conservation programs that the government initiated mekonnen et al 2018 a synthesis of impacts of forest cover increase in the andes indicate that afforestation reduced water erosion risk of moderate floods increasing soil infiltration rate soil water storage and reduced bonnesoeur et al 2019 natural and human activities such as mining and construction of reservoirs induce riverine land cover changes these changes lead to accelerated sediment transport and riverbank erosion triggering thalweg shifting channel incision and gradual change in the river cross sections bhattacharya et al 2019 ramani et al 2021 tropical rivers are more prone to morphology changes as a result of increased sediments in their channels due to uncontrolled practices such as illegal mining operations deforestation land tillage and overgrazing coupled with higher precipitation leading to frequent flooding tanaka et al 2021 the findings indicated that cropland bare soil and urban areas contribute significantly to soil erosion and sediment transport compared to forest sinha eldho 2018 morphological assessment in darjeeling himalayas revealed that forested catchments tend to have deep and narrow channels while agricultural channel streams were shallow wide and braided due to large sediment depositions in streams in agricultural lands prokop et al 2020 5 2 future scenarios of river hydro morphological responses to lulcc and cc land use and climate projections offer insights into likely future impacts gomes et al 2021 among the 60 case studies 12 studied the impacts of future lulc and climate on basin hydro morphology by using scenario based prediction the simulations revealed similar change trends on hydro morphological variables future predicted lulcc are not as significant as has been in the past and therefore their hydrological responses are patterned differently according to the different lu scenarios future lu scenarios include business as usual bau economic growth eg only and economic growth and reforestation egr models considering the implementation of government measures for afforestation reforestation abe et al 2018 aduah et al 2018 expansion of irrigation crop eic expansion of forestland efl teklay et al 2021 the green roads development and fossil fuel based on strong and low implementation of environmental protection government directives respectively gomes et al 2021 oliveira et al 2018 the bau and fossil fuel scenarios will lead to the most drastic changes negative impacts in terms of forest loss and economic expansion resulting in an increased streamflow and decreased et increased frequency of floods in contrast to the afforestation and green roads scenarios thus showing the influence of vegetation cover on water flow dynamics quantities and occurrence of extreme hydrological events abe et al 2018 eg is also expected to cause an increase in surface runoff and total water yield followed by a decline in et and gw recharge khoi et al 2021 the expansion of forest cover scenario showed a potential decrease in surface runoff river streamflow and water yields favoring water infiltration ground recharge and soil erosion control farinosi et al 2019 human activities will continue to impact river morphology along with riverine land cover dynamics like sand mining and channel deviations for irrigation purposes riverbank erosion and sediment deposition have been found to be the major cause for the future river migration and riparian vegetation cover increase has been proposed as a means of control verma et al 2021 the results revealed that increasing cultivated land will cause severe threats on the future river hydro morphology if no proper measures are taken twisa et al 2020 soil erosion in mekong river basin china is predicted to increase by more than half in 2040 under rcp 8 5 both cc and lulcc will affect mekong river basin due to the conversion of forest to agricultural and urban areas with erosion in the central part predicted to decrease over time chuenchum et al 2020 the combined impact of cc and lulcc is predicted to have a more significant impact on basin hydro morphology cc is predicted to change weather patterns rainfall and temperature differently in different regions affecting all hydrological components raihan et al 2021 yifru et al 2021 according to ipcc ar6 2021 human induced climate change is projected to increase in the future resulting in more frequent droughts in some places and greater flood hazards in others due to global warming and an alteration in precipitation patterns respectively the annual streamflow is expected to increase by 10 40 in the wet tropical zones and decrease by 10 30 in the dry tropical zones by mid century ipcc 2007 5 3 correlations between lulcc and hydrologic variables the trends in lulcc forest and agriculture and hydrological components streamflow surface runoff vs et and groundwater are similar across several studies reviewed in spite of this our review reveals that lulcc impacts are highly scale dependent and depend on several factors including the catchment characteristics as evidenced by low correlations in fig 6 wang et al 2011 have reported similar findings in northern china wei et al 2003 attributed the inconsistent findings to potential masking effects of catchment size biases and errors from different measurement methods and heterogeneity in catchment characteristics näschen et al 2019 there is still limited research on thresholds or tipping points for lulcc and hydrological indicator alterations findings by tarigan et al 2018 suggest that a watershed should contain 30 forest cover and a maximum of 40 plantation cover for maintaining sustainable waterflow regulation ecosystem services however the weak correlations between forest cover loss and stream flow show the potential masking effects with increased catchment area as outlined by hess et al 2010 king et al 2014 o connell et al 2007 robinson 1990 viglione et al 2016 in rogger et al 2017 the impacts of lulcc on flow characteristics including the magnitudes become more difficult to isolate with increased catchment scale and non homogeneity patterns such as soil type and flow aggregation similar masking effects are likely to result from precipitation variability within a catchment therefore there is a need to undertake further research at finer scales catchment area in order to capture individual catchment hydrological behavior to inform decision making in land use and water resources management 5 4 contrasting effects of cc or lulcc on hydro morphological changes there is often a discussion about whether cc or lulcc has the most influence on river hydro morphological changes from 60 reviewed articles 26 analyzed the isolated and combined impacts of these changes three hypotheses were formulated based for the analyses 1 cc impacts are greater than lulcc 2 both changes are equally significant and 3 lulcc impacts are greater than cc in the first hypothesis cc has greater impacts on hydrological components than lulcc gomes et al 2021 tan et al 2015 the main reason is the fact that runoff volume and et depends heavily on rainfall and temperature respectively pandey et al 2021 half of the cases studies revealed that changes in hydrological components are mostly explained by cc patterns such as increased decreased rainfall intensity and change in temperature raihan et al 2021 yifru et al 2021 findings indicate that cc is expected to worsen in the future situation raihan et al 2021 even though the cc simulations show high uncertainties näschen et al 2019 the second hypothesis contends that both changes impact hydrological components at a similar level araza et al 2021 with lulcc being more prominent in the past and cc more prevalent in the future naha et al 2021 in support of this hypothesis only five studies have been cited araza et al 2021 bessah et al 2019 chimdessa et al 2019 naha et al 2021 pandey et al 2021 whereby changes in hydrological components resulted from lulcc coupled with less cc in the past however according to simulations the trend is expected to be the opposite in the future this hypothesis highlight that changes in lulcc resulted in an increase in less permeable land and decline in vegetative lands leading to more surface runoff and less et pandey et al 2021 moreover runoff and et are expected to change due to cc in the future and lulcc will be less significant compared to the past trends bessah et al 2019 lastly 8 out of 26 case studies supported the fact that lulcc impacts are more significant than cc chemura et al 2020 obahoundje et al 2018 this is attributed to the relative minor changes in climate and or substantial lulcc during the study period birhanu et al 2019 marhaento et al 2017 scale appears to play a significant role as changes are more noticeable in small catchment than large basins aragaw et al 2021 in relation to morphology results from 4 out 10 cases studies demonstrated that human induced activities dam construction and mining have a greater impact on sediment production soil erosion and riverine vegetation dynamics more than cc ahmed fawzi 2011 setyorini et al 2017 song et al 2016 according to the reviewed articles the dynamics of river hydro morphology are controlled by two factors rainfall and temperature input and the processes influenced by the input and the basin characteristics therefore cc governs the input and the lulcc describes the basin characteristics this implies that both lulcc and cc affect river flow regimes and extreme events in an intertwined way kumar et al 2022 nkhoma et al 2020 whereby the magnitude and extent of changes are influenced both by basin characteristics and climate dynamics based on the extent of each change and their interaction furthermore lulcc impacts cc by changing energy balances water and greenhouse gases from the land to the atmosphere while climate variables also affects lulc sleeter et al 2013 tan et al 2022 6 conclusion tropical regions have experienced the fastest lulcc in the last decades coupled with cc this has affected the hydrological and geomorphological processes of river systems the main objective of this paper is to review the impacts of changes in lulc and climate on tropical river basins in terms of hydrology and morphology components from our analysis based on 60 case studies several conclusions can be drawn lulcc and cc lead to diverse changes in hydro morphological properties with extent of impact strongly influenced by the scale magnitude of change driver cc affects the river basin hydrology in terms of rainfall amounts and temperature while lulcc enhances or decreases its impacts by defining the water conveyance moreover cc and lulcc are interrelated factors that affect extreme events such as droughts and floods furthermore cc impacts lulcc and vice versa and their interactions are nonlinear the main trend of lulcc has been an increase in cultivated and urban land and a decline in forest land along with cc these changes resulted in an increased streamflow surface flow and total water and sediment yields erosion rates and a decrease in et and groundwater recharge the future is expected to follow the same trend with variations based on implementation of conservation measures including reversing forest cover losses and optimization of development trajectories with due consideration of land cover the changing hydrology combined with human induced activities such as mining reservoir construction and riverine vegetation changes have led to increased riverbank erosion channel migration and changed rivers cross sections the relatively low correlation between lulcc and hydrological variables indicates that other catchment characteristics such as soil climate or topography also play an important role a number of the case studies analyzed in this review use models land use change hydrological climate change it is crucial to consider uncertainties from model parameterization and structure in the change impact assessment and include the uncertainty analyses in model outputs to ensure more robust and reliable results since most studies used in this review analyzed impacts of forest transition to other lu types more research is needed on other lulc transitions to better comprehend the wide ranging effects of lulcc on river hydro morphology the majority of the reviewed papers 37 out of 60 papers are from three countries ethiopia india and brazil therefore more studies in other parts of the tropical region are required to improve our understanding of river morphology land and water resource management in light of future changes research should

2739,tropical regions have experienced the fastest land use land cover change lulcc in the last decades coupled with climate change cc this has affected the hydrological and geomorphological processes of river systems with the increased demand for land the general trend has been the loss of forest land to agriculture and settlements these changes have altered the water balance components through enhanced or reduced evaporation peak flow flooding and river morphology the aim of this review paper is to provide a meta analysis on the effects of spatiotemporal changes in climate and lulc on river hydro morphology in the tropics following a systematic search 60 case studies were identified of which the majority 68 experienced forest loss due to agricultural and urban expansion resulting in increased streamflow surface flow and total water yield and decreased et and groundwater recharge 12 of the case studies showed the impacts of lulcc on channel morphology features through sediment transport and riverbank erosion results from this study show limited correlation between lulcc and hydrological variables indicating that there are likely other factors controlling hydrological processes catchment heterogeneity including soil and topography play an important role based on studies that project these changes into the future similar trends are expected over the next decades with differences based on lu and climate scenarios there are still limited studies on river hydro morphology responses to lulcc and cc in the tropics despite the major changes taking place there in light of future changes more studies are needed to improve our understanding keywords land use land cover change climate change hydro morphology tropical regions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it has been estimated that about 17 of the earth s land surface has changed at least once between 1960 and 2019 resulting in a global forest loss of 0 8 million km2 and 1 0 million km2 increase of agricultural land among other changes winkler et al 2021 these widespread land use land cover changes lulcc mainly attributed to human causes anthropogenic affect watershed hydrologic systems in diverse ways bridgewater et al 2018 primarily through the alteration of rainfall and runoff processes gebremicael et al 2019 furthermore they contribute to changes in river channel morphology through soil erosion and deposition chuenchum et al 2020 maaβ et al 2021 along with these anthropogenic factors climate change cc influences the intensity and frequency of rainfall and temperature koneti et al 2018 which have direct effects on quantities of evapotranspiration et and runoff according to ipcc ar6 2021 since the 1970s each decade has been successively warmer than the preceding one mainly due to anthropogenic green house gas ghg emissions resulting from economic and population growth furthermore cc will likely intensify these changes rainfall and temperature patterns in the future leading to increased frequency of extreme hydrologic events ipcc ar6 2021 ipcc 2014 the tropics have experienced the fastest rate of lulcc especially deforestation with estimates of 8 0 million ha year in the 1990s and 7 6 million ha year in the 2000s achard et al 2014 the tropics lost 11 1 million hectares of tree cover in 2021 liz mikaela 2022 these changes were largely driven by demographic and socio economic growth gashaw et al 2018 the pressure exerted on tropical river basins due to lulcc has been steadily increasing over recent decades farinosi et al 2019 naomie 2020 wiejaczka et al 2014 agriculture has been the dominant force driving lulcc in the last century with more than half of all new agricultural land in the tropics converted from forest between 1980 and 2000 lambin meyfroidt 2011 river hydro morphology describes the hydrological and geomorphological processes and properties of a river system their interactions and their spatial distribution and variability jba 2021 it deals with physical processes determining river behavior hajdukiewicz et al 2017 and the resulting configurations or morphology lulcc translates into changes in the water balance components through enhanced or reduced evaporation peak flow and flooding teklay et al 2021 additionally to lulcc changes in water balance components such as peak flows quantity timing and duration impact morphological properties langat et al 2020 land cover plays an important role in these processes as it defines the soil state the magnitude of these effects depends on the watershed characteristics including the size extent of change topography soil characteristics and weather conditions allan et al 1997 moraes et al 2018 fig 1 illustrates the interrelations between these different components lulcc and cc are inter linked as changes in land cover affect the atmospheric energy balance which influences rainfall and temperature patterns while at the same time lulc is affected by changes in weather patterns the same feedback mechanism exists between lulc and catchment hydrology as well as on river morphology climate change and hydrology have one way effects on river morphology understanding the watershed hydro morphological responses to changes in both climate and lulc especially in tropical regions where rainy seasons are followed by dry seasons gomes et al 2021 is vital for effective and sustainable land and water resources management despite extensive reviews on the effects of lulcc and cc on basin hydrology there is limited focus on both morphological and hydrological feedbacks in tropical regions focusing on the tropics we undertook a meta analysis of existing studies analyzing these aspects in order to better understand the effects of spatiotemporal changes in climate and lulc on river hydro morphology an overview of the lulcc transitions in the region is provided process steps to identify relevant research publications related to this topic are outlined including both empirical research and simulation modelling works subsequently we provide an overview of the associated historical and potential future impacts of the lulcc and cc on river hydro morphology 2 literature review lulcc impacts on river hydro morphological processes 2 1 lulc transitions and their impacts on hydrological components water balance is at the heart of all hydrological processes that occur in a watershed akpoti et al 2016 cc affects the rainfall and temperature patterns chuenchum et al 2020 while lulcc affects how the watershed responds to rainfall by altering different components of the water balance including rates of interception infiltration evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge rates santillan et al 2019 consequently lulcc affect the timing and amount of surface runoff baker miller 2013 in this section we summarize the mechanisms that underlie the changes in hydro morphology of tropical catchments in response to lulc transitions lulc categories considered include forests agriculture urban areas degraded land and pastureland the lulc transitions investigated in this paper and their impacts on the water balance components are illustrated in fig 2 forest is known to consume a lot of water through evapotranspiration trees water consumption and promote groundwater recharge aladejana et al 2018 tan et al 2015 the forest deep roots serve as flow paths for recharging the ground water and increase the base flow farinosi et al 2019 ogden et al 2013 in addition forest increases the infiltration rate and improves the water holding capacity of the soil obahoundje et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 therefore deforestation decreases the infiltration processes due to a decrease in soil permeability less rainfall interception leading to an increase in runoff decrease in baseflow and less ground water recharge naha et al 2021 olang et al 2011 conversely afforestation has been linked with reduced river streamflow and water yield as a result of increased evapotranspiration aragaw et al 2021 agriculture practices can lead to soil crusting which reduces the soil infiltration rate teklay et al 2021 cultivated land is prone to surface runoff generation näschen et al 2019 since the land is less covered at the beginning of the rainy season bekele et al 2018 therefore there is more rapid conversion of rainfall to runoff naha et al 2021 dias et al 2015 found that the streamflow in soy catchments was about three times greater than that of forest catchments in brazil the expansion of cultivated land at the expense of natural vegetation tends to decrease soil and water storage thus decreases the rainfall infiltration rate and leads to an increase in surface flow sinha eldho 2018 sulamo et al 2021 as well as the rate at which it reaches the stream network getu engida et al 2021 a horton et al 2021 additionally the absence of deep rooting system and extensive canopies leads to less et and groundwater recharge and amplifies runoff das et al 2018 koneti et al 2018 urban expansion is associated with an increase in impermeable areas hence decreasing the infiltration and groundwater recharge rates associated with an increase in runoff conveyance and flow peaks akpoti et al 2016 viola et al 2014 the extension of built up areas in place of natural vegetation cover alters the water resources through changes in biophysical properties e g vegetation canopy cover getu engida et al 2021 pastureland extension tends to decrease the infiltration rate due to soil compaction by grazing thus increasing the surface runoff and the streamflow magnitude hassaballah et al 2017 hengade eldho 2019 as a result of soil compaction higher proportion of rainfall is being converted into surface runoff instead of infiltrating the soil and contributing to groundwater gw recharge baker miller 2013 in summary large scale transition of tropical forest to non forest land affects the water cycle it decreases infiltration and interception increases surface runoff and significantly decreases the evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge therefore the compacted bare soil exposed to intense rainfall increases the discharge rate rapidly and suddenly increasing flood risk a j horton et al 2021 sugianto et al 2022 moreover deforestation impacts atmospheric water input causing more intense dry seasons which exacerbates drought risks qi et al 2020 staal et al 2020 2 2 river morphology responses to lulcc according to ofb 2010 there exist two morphological factors of a river control factors including water discharge and sediment load and response factors river planform and channel cross section the dynamics in channel morphology are attributed to flow velocity riverbank erosion sediment deposition and changes in riverine vegetation cover that are induced by both human activities and climate change langat et al 2019 verma et al 2021 vegetation cover and hydrological regimes play an important role in the morphological processes of a river kijowska strugała et al 2017 consequently the transition from natural vegetation to unvegetated landscape often decreases the surface roughness and increases the flow velocity which causes soil erosion and sediment transport bekele et al 2018 the changes in the magnitude and timing of river flows and sedimentation lead to alteration and instability of river systems ibitoye 2021 roy sahu 2016 moreover a reduction in water yield and or a drop in groundwater levels and associated reduction in baseflow may alter the small perennial rivers into intermittent regime yifru et al 2021 ultimatey altering channel morphology in response to flow volumes human activities such as dam construction mining and agriculture affect river morphology through altering the channel geometry as well as the dynamics of water and sediment movement bhattacharya et al 2019 ramani et al 2021 the same applies to upstream lulcc within catchments which directly contribute to the changes in water and sediment movement wiejaczka et al 2014 woldesenbet et al 2018 prokop et al 2020 found that long term lulcc have accelerated water and sediment fluxes hence resulted in riverbank erosion bed aggradation and an increased risk of flooding streams in forested landscapes tend to be hydrologically and geomorphologically more stable than in other landscapes roy sahu 2016 they usually have wider and more stable channels with less sediments allan 2004 wubalem yihunie 2021 this is in part because of the higher water retention capacity lower discharge reduce streamflow velocities and lesser sediment load as well as a stable bank slopes wubalem yihunie 2021 usually forests provide effective protection from shallow landslides and soil erosion primarily because of root binding and a lower water deficit in the soil vanacker et al 2005 therefore deforestation accelerates runoff response such as the timing of peak flows and may result in an increased flood volumes and sediment transport hassaballah et al 2017 long term afforestation has been accompanied with river adjustment channels becoming more narrowed with reduced sinuosity and secondary channels tending to be abandoned fernandes et al 2020 scorpio piégay 2021 agricultural lands are characterized by increased surface runoff and sediment transports compared to forests baker miller 2013 as such streams in agricultural landscapes are characterized by sediment laden beds and deeply incised valleys with severe bank erosion roy sahu 2016 additionally transition from vegetated to uncovered lands after crop harvest increases the stream discharge and sediment yield from end of growing season rainfalls which are a major determinant of river morphology dynamics ibitoye 2021 obahoundje et al 2018 sinha eldho 2018 a study in lake tana beles ethiopia found that erosion rates on agricultural lands were much higher compared to all other land due to the cropping on steep slopes woldesenbet et al 2018 indicating the important interaction of lulc and topography an extension of bare land and grazing land over vegetated lands results in increased surface water and sediment flows thus making stream channels wider and shallower from active channel erosion and sediment deposition yousefi et al 2019 in addition it leads to an increase in peak flows and a reduction in the time of concentration moraes et al 2018 allan et al 1997 study revealed that sediment yields increased dramatically with agricultural expansion less dramatically with increase in urban lands and reduced with forest cover increase moreover rivers draining agricultural lands have a higher sediment yield compared to other land cover types 3 material and methods 3 1 geographical description areas of study the tropics are regions between the tropic of cancer 23 degrees north latitude and the tropic of capricorn 23 degrees south latitude they cover about 40 of the planet s land surface within the boundaries of at least 70 countries racke et al 1997 the region is home to around 40 of the world s population which is expected to increase to over 50 by 2050 marcotullio et al 2021 un 2010 based on köppen climate classification climate in the tropics is classified into three types 1 tropical rainforest af 2 tropical monsoon am and 3 tropical wet and dry savanna aw or as the general pattern of the tropical climate is warm temperatures with a monthly mean temperature ranging from 18 degreesc in am to 25 c in af rainfall patterns vary from af with plenty of rain throughout the year 2000 mm to am 1000 mm and aw 1000 mm where there is a seasonal shift in rainfall patterns beck et al 2018 chen chen 2013 while specific land cover types differ between different areas forests abound in the tropical region tropical forest covers 17 million km2 about 31 of ice free land dry forest accounts for 4 and tropical savannah takes up 15 marcotullio et al 2021 3 2 inventory of case studies in this review we synthesized peer reviewed papers published between 2010 and 2021 focusing on the assessment of hydro morphological responses to lulcc and cc in the tropical regions the literature search was carried out using the web of science database https www webofscience com search results were categorized into two components 1 hydrology of tropical rivers and 2 morphology of tropical rivers fig 3 outlines the filtering process used to screen the existing literature the first filter yielded 1 140 papers on hydrology and 149 papers on river morphology a set of pre defined criteria was set to screen the identified papers these criteria are grouped under the label 1 and are as follow land use land cover change river hydrology streamflow surface runoff groundwater baseflow water yield sediment yield and evapotranspiration river morphology channel cross section channel erosion channel aggradation and riverbank characteristics publication time 2010 to 2021 for articles related to river hydrology after manually screening using criteria 1 202 articles were identified a second filter that considered the spatial region tropical areas in this case yielded 52 articles we used the same approach for river morphology component ultimately we found 20 out of 149 references on morphology after the first screening of which 10 were within the area of interest two articles were identified under both components in total 60 peer reviewed papers fig 3 were used for our analysis of which 30 are related to africa 19 for asia and the remaining 11 for south america fig 4 3 3 general framework of the methods applied geospatial data are important for understanding the way in which the earth surface changes and how its hydrological system works mulungu and kashaigili 2012 the hydrological responses to lulcc and cc have been widely analyzed with most of the studies using integrated approaches involving geographical information systems gis remote sensing

possible because of the satellite imageries that are repetitive andualem et al 2018 for the identified case studies fig 5 presents the range of application of methods used in the analyses these methods are classified into change analysis for lulc and climate and the hydrological and morphological impacts assessment 3 3 1 lulc assessment techniques the majority of the reviewed articles used satellite images to generate lulc classification maps techniques for classifying images include object based image analysis koneti et al 2018 as well as pixel based methods including supervised sinha eldho 2018 unsupervised and hybrid aragaw et al 2021 out of 60 reviewed papers 41 applied per pixel classification methods especially supervised approaches others used existing classified maps sourced from government departments or global data such as modis lc globeland30 ngcc and indian space research organization isro thereafter the transition matrix derived from classified lulc maps together with socio economic and biophysical driving factors were used to simulate potential future lu scenarios teklay et al 2021 the simulation were conducted using either land use models abe et al 2018 or statistical methods and assumptions getachew et al 2021 some models apply the aspect of land demand based on the historical trend then spatially allocate them based on the dependent variables das et al 2018 khoi et al 2021 three types of models are commonly used such as empirical statistical based on mathematical equations spatially explicit or rule based and agent based models han et al 2015 a total of 12 reviewed papers used a variety of models to predict the spatial pattern of lu scenarios based on historical trends transition based or the simulated hypothesis predictive based models with ca markov being the most used model 3 3 2 climate change assessment methods in addition to lulcc studies also considered the impact of cc on historical and future hydro morphological changes the meteorological time series were used for statistical trend analysis as a basis of historical cc rientjes et al 2011 while future cc was simulated using climate models sridhar et al 2019 or based on scenario assumptions legesse et al 2010 future cc was simulated based on the four different representative concentration pathways rcps defined by the ipcc teklay et al 2021 studies have been using global climate models gcms datasets for large scale cc data or the regional climate models rcms derived from downscaled gcms kumar 2019 pachauri et al 2014 yifru et al 2021 to improve the accuracy of climate data at a small scale studies combined several climate projection models at varying spatial resolution rather than relying on a single model bessah et al 2019 pandey et al 2021 sridhar et al 2019 other studies used the ensemble mean of multiple rcms in their precipitation and temperature projections to avoid substantial differences between individual rcms dibaba et al 2020 3 3 3 hydrology features most of the case studies applied an integrated approach involving gis remote sensing statistical analysis and hydrological models there are two major categories of methods applied statistical and simulation based statistical methods are used to analyze historical data whereas simulation models are used to predict future scenarios though there is tendency in combining both methods to analyze historical trends wei et al 2013 hydrological models can be classified into three types namely lumped semi distributed and fully distributed models wei et al 2013 zhuo et al 2014 lumped models describe a watershed as a single unit whereas distributed models discretize the watershed into hydrologic response units with homogenous land characteristics e g slope and soils jajarmizadeh et al 2012 mohammed et al 2018 fully distributed models are generally more detailed compared to semi distributed with each grid cell representing one lu type pina et al 2016 the swat model is an example of a physically based semi distributed hydrological model and it has been used in about a third of the reviewed papers 3 3 4 morphology features the morphological assessment includes assessing the channel forms geomorphic adjustment and human interventions belletti et al 2015 the methods range from image classification and change detection to field assessment and models satellite images are commonly used to detect changes in river morphology by identifying how the channel migrates or shifts over time mohamad et al 2018 wubalem yihunie 2021 in the reviewed papers three methods were applied including image classification and change detection statistical methods and physical models all along with field surveys the assessed morphological features include erosion deposition of the banks bank line migration bar growth channel bed elevations and channel cross sectional geometry langat et al 2019 tariq shu 2020 empirical models were used to analyze the diverse morphological elements and hydro dynamic features of a river shahrood et al 2020 predictive models such as conceptual models based on historical trends and numerical models have been used to simulate future morphological scenarios surian ziliani 2012 arima autoregressive integrated moving average is an example of autoregressive model used to predict the future river behaviors verma et al 2021 3 3 5 uncertainties in hydrological climate and lulc models climate land use and hydro morphological models contain uncertainties derived from parameters and model structure teklay et al 2021 this is known as equifinality and it is one of the most prominent source of uncertainty naha et al 2021 uncertainties also arise from input data such as soil classified lulc and both observed and simulated climate data araza et al 2021 sinha eldho 2018 models for small catchments are often subjected to uncertainties when applied to coarse resolution data araza et al 2021 raihan et al 2021 however large scale basins also represent uncertainty risks due to the difficulty of accounting for spatial heterogeneity of basin characteristics pandey et al 2021 moreover projections are uncertain due to lack of socio economic data policy and regulation information related to future development as well as in situ data gomes et al 2021 pandey et al 2021 in order to minimize uncertainties models parameters are typically calibrated generally based on observations araza et al 2021 regarding uncertainty in climate input data a variety of bias correction methods have been developed to reduce uncertainties from different climate models such as the delta method for temperature and quantile mapping qm for precipitation raihan et al 2021 or more advanced methods such as multivariate bias correction vrac 2018 in addition monte carlo simulations have been used in the reviewed articles to identify behavioral model simulations accounting for parameterization uncertainties naha et al 2021 3 4 meta analysis based on studies that investigate temporal changes we examined the impact of spatiotemporal changes of land use land cover on river hydro morphology we found that 45 of 60 case studies included in this review examined lulcc and their responses over several decades before and after comparison as for the remaining 15 studies some compared catchments with different lulc types dias et al 2015 ogden et al 2013 prokop et al 2020 others explored general terms such as water balance chemura et al 2020 infiltration rate olang et al 2011 peak flow and flood a horton et al 2021 moraes et al 2018 additionally we differentiated historical observed and future simulated periods creating 69 different datasets from 45 case studies supplementary material summarizes the findings from the 60 articles including cc scenarios considered for each case study 4 results table 1 illustrates the findings for lulcc percentage change per catchment and their hydro morphological responses percentage change based on the baseline as well as their climate classifications we considered four major lulc classes including forest agriculture built up and bush shrub grass and five hydrological components such as streamflow surface runoff surq evapotranspiration et ground water gw and water yield wyld based on the results from table 1 the major changes in the lulc are the expansion of agriculture and the decline of forest cover with few occasions of forest expansion according to our analysis findings are categorized into four main outcomes i the general trend has been the natural vegetation forest loss primarily associated to agricultural and or urban expansion while other classes bushes shrubs and grasslands have fluctuated such changes resulted in an increased streamflow surface flow and water yield coupled with a decreased et and groundwater recharge for example gidabo river basin aragaw et al 2021 benin owena river basin aladejana et al 2018 and upper brantas river basin setyorini et al 2017 ii increase in forest land associated with a decrease in agriculture grassland and or shrubland mainly the reforestation scenarios gomes et al 2021 teklay et al 2021 resulted in decreased streamflow and surface flow while et increased this is consistent with past afforestation forest gain in nyong river basin ewane lee 2020 godavari river basin hengade eldho 2019 iii in terms of morphology the expansion of agricultural lands coupled with increased water and sediment yields kenea et al 2021 has contributed to riverbank erosion and channel sedimentation additionally due to sediment deposition and riverbank erosion river niger resulted in dual centerlines and the channel width increased from 2 8 to 3 5 km ibitoye 2021 similar conditions also impacted the gomit river leading to channel degradation and aggradation wubalem yihunie 2021 the channel width increases due to lateral erosion and channel depth decreases due to sedimentation wubalem yihunie 2021 iv in farmlands the majority of rainfall is converted into streamflow however some studies showed a decrease in streamflow and an increase in et as cultivated lands have expanded on forestland rientjes et al 2011 sridhar et al 2019 this is primarily due to high evaporation rates on irrigated lands and irrigation water use teklay et al 2021 to better understand the relations between lulcc and hydrological variables we developed scatter plots fig 6 that represent streamflow surface runoff and et gw to forest and agriculture across the reviewed case studies each dot in those figures represent one case study including scenarios and their common behavior informs general trends negative correlation exists between forest cover and streamflow while et has a positive correlation with forest cover fig 6a expansion of agricultural land is associated with increased streamflow and negatively correlated with et fig 6b surface runoff decreases with forest cover gain and groundwater recharge is positively correlated with forest cover gain fig 6c reverse trends exist with agricultural land expansion fig 6d 5 discussion 5 1 historical change trends our analysis shows that all lulc types have impacts on hydrological components however basin catchment characteristics and lulcc dynamics affect the river system processes dibaba et al 2020 vanacker et al 2005 as represented in fig 6 agriculture land area is directly proportional to streamflow and surface runoff and inversely proportional to et and groundwater recharge while forests have the opposite relationship aladejana et al 2018 gashaw et al 2018 woldesenbet et al 2017 et is the key element in understanding the effect of lulcc especially in tropical regions as it constitutes a significant percentage of the precipitation over the land surface robertson et al 2021 and constitutes the major water consumption through transpiration canopy interception and eventual evaporation and soil evaporation twisa et al 2020 tropical regions are largely located in developing countries where demographic and socio economic growth are the driving forces for increased exploitation of natural resources ewane lee 2020 kenea et al 2021 changes in lulc have been attributed to rapid population growth and the resulting increase in land demands for subsistence agriculture settlements and the use of wood and biomass fuel guzha et al 2018 we found that the most pronounced changes in lulc happened before 2000s the period when the greatest deforestation and expansion of cultivated and built up was reported however since 2000s the trends changed as the magnitude of forest cover loss has decreased this is attributed to global initiatives and government measures towards afforestation and restoration programs bekele et al 2018 hassaballah et al 2017 raihan et al 2021 some global and regional initiatives towards increasing forest cover include afr100 the african forest landscape restoration initiative the bonn challenge targeting to bring 350 million hectares of forests under restoration radhika dave et al 2018 these initiatives are in addition to country laws and policies aimed at conservation and reforestation efforts andrade ribeiro 2019 brazil s xopotó river basin experienced an increase in forest cover due to the new forest code moraes et al 2018 there has been an increase in forest cover in godavari river basin as a result of india s effort to protect and restore natural and plantation resorts hengade eldho 2019 koneti et al 2018 in addition different countries adopted environmental friendly agriculture methods such as soil and water conservation measures through different projects such as the national sustainable land management mekonnen et al 2018 the forest cover increase trend is evident from several studies table 1 including the forest loss 5 2 in the upper blue nile river basin in ethiopia 1973 to 1995 followed by the 3 4 increase afterwards such changes were attributed to the afforestation and soil and water conservation programs that the government initiated mekonnen et al 2018 a synthesis of impacts of forest cover increase in the andes indicate that afforestation reduced water erosion risk of moderate floods increasing soil infiltration rate soil water storage and reduced bonnesoeur et al 2019 natural and human activities such as mining and construction of reservoirs induce riverine land cover changes these changes lead to accelerated sediment transport and riverbank erosion triggering thalweg shifting channel incision and gradual change in the river cross sections bhattacharya et al 2019 ramani et al 2021 tropical rivers are more prone to morphology changes as a result of increased sediments in their channels due to uncontrolled practices such as illegal mining operations deforestation land tillage and overgrazing coupled with higher precipitation leading to frequent flooding tanaka et al 2021 the findings indicated that cropland bare soil and urban areas contribute significantly to soil erosion and sediment transport compared to forest sinha eldho 2018 morphological assessment in darjeeling himalayas revealed that forested catchments tend to have deep and narrow channels while agricultural channel streams were shallow wide and braided due to large sediment depositions in streams in agricultural lands prokop et al 2020 5 2 future scenarios of river hydro morphological responses to lulcc and cc land use and climate projections offer insights into likely future impacts gomes et al 2021 among the 60 case studies 12 studied the impacts of future lulc and climate on basin hydro morphology by using scenario based prediction the simulations revealed similar change trends on hydro morphological variables future predicted lulcc are not as significant as has been in the past and therefore their hydrological responses are patterned differently according to the different lu scenarios future lu scenarios include business as usual bau economic growth eg only and economic growth and reforestation egr models considering the implementation of government measures for afforestation reforestation abe et al 2018 aduah et al 2018 expansion of irrigation crop eic expansion of forestland efl teklay et al 2021 the green roads development and fossil fuel based on strong and low implementation of environmental protection government directives respectively gomes et al 2021 oliveira et al 2018 the bau and fossil fuel scenarios will lead to the most drastic changes negative impacts in terms of forest loss and economic expansion resulting in an increased streamflow and decreased et increased frequency of floods in contrast to the afforestation and green roads scenarios thus showing the influence of vegetation cover on water flow dynamics quantities and occurrence of extreme hydrological events abe et al 2018 eg is also expected to cause an increase in surface runoff and total water yield followed by a decline in et and gw recharge khoi et al 2021 the expansion of forest cover scenario showed a potential decrease in surface runoff river streamflow and water yields favoring water infiltration ground recharge and soil erosion control farinosi et al 2019 human activities will continue to impact river morphology along with riverine land cover dynamics like sand mining and channel deviations for irrigation purposes riverbank erosion and sediment deposition have been found to be the major cause for the future river migration and riparian vegetation cover increase has been proposed as a means of control verma et al 2021 the results revealed that increasing cultivated land will cause severe threats on the future river hydro morphology if no proper measures are taken twisa et al 2020 soil erosion in mekong river basin china is predicted to increase by more than half in 2040 under rcp 8 5 both cc and lulcc will affect mekong river basin due to the conversion of forest to agricultural and urban areas with erosion in the central part predicted to decrease over time chuenchum et al 2020 the combined impact of cc and lulcc is predicted to have a more significant impact on basin hydro morphology cc is predicted to change weather patterns rainfall and temperature differently in different regions affecting all hydrological components raihan et al 2021 yifru et al 2021 according to ipcc ar6 2021 human induced climate change is projected to increase in the future resulting in more frequent droughts in some places and greater flood hazards in others due to global warming and an alteration in precipitation patterns respectively the annual streamflow is expected to increase by 10 40 in the wet tropical zones and decrease by 10 30 in the dry tropical zones by mid century ipcc 2007 5 3 correlations between lulcc and hydrologic variables the trends in lulcc forest and agriculture and hydrological components streamflow surface runoff vs et and groundwater are similar across several studies reviewed in spite of this our review reveals that lulcc impacts are highly scale dependent and depend on several factors including the catchment characteristics as evidenced by low correlations in fig 6 wang et al 2011 have reported similar findings in northern china wei et al 2003 attributed the inconsistent findings to potential masking effects of catchment size biases and errors from different measurement methods and heterogeneity in catchment characteristics näschen et al 2019 there is still limited research on thresholds or tipping points for lulcc and hydrological indicator alterations findings by tarigan et al 2018 suggest that a watershed should contain 30 forest cover and a maximum of 40 plantation cover for maintaining sustainable waterflow regulation ecosystem services however the weak correlations between forest cover loss and stream flow show the potential masking effects with increased catchment area as outlined by hess et al 2010 king et al 2014 o connell et al 2007 robinson 1990 viglione et al 2016 in rogger et al 2017 the impacts of lulcc on flow characteristics including the magnitudes become more difficult to isolate with increased catchment scale and non homogeneity patterns such as soil type and flow aggregation similar masking effects are likely to result from precipitation variability within a catchment therefore there is a need to undertake further research at finer scales catchment area in order to capture individual catchment hydrological behavior to inform decision making in land use and water resources management 5 4 contrasting effects of cc or lulcc on hydro morphological changes there is often a discussion about whether cc or lulcc has the most influence on river hydro morphological changes from 60 reviewed articles 26 analyzed the isolated and combined impacts of these changes three hypotheses were formulated based for the analyses 1 cc impacts are greater than lulcc 2 both changes are equally significant and 3 lulcc impacts are greater than cc in the first hypothesis cc has greater impacts on hydrological components than lulcc gomes et al 2021 tan et al 2015 the main reason is the fact that runoff volume and et depends heavily on rainfall and temperature respectively pandey et al 2021 half of the cases studies revealed that changes in hydrological components are mostly explained by cc patterns such as increased decreased rainfall intensity and change in temperature raihan et al 2021 yifru et al 2021 findings indicate that cc is expected to worsen in the future situation raihan et al 2021 even though the cc simulations show high uncertainties näschen et al 2019 the second hypothesis contends that both changes impact hydrological components at a similar level araza et al 2021 with lulcc being more prominent in the past and cc more prevalent in the future naha et al 2021 in support of this hypothesis only five studies have been cited araza et al 2021 bessah et al 2019 chimdessa et al 2019 naha et al 2021 pandey et al 2021 whereby changes in hydrological components resulted from lulcc coupled with less cc in the past however according to simulations the trend is expected to be the opposite in the future this hypothesis highlight that changes in lulcc resulted in an increase in less permeable land and decline in vegetative lands leading to more surface runoff and less et pandey et al 2021 moreover runoff and et are expected to change due to cc in the future and lulcc will be less significant compared to the past trends bessah et al 2019 lastly 8 out of 26 case studies supported the fact that lulcc impacts are more significant than cc chemura et al 2020 obahoundje et al 2018 this is attributed to the relative minor changes in climate and or substantial lulcc during the study period birhanu et al 2019 marhaento et al 2017 scale appears to play a significant role as changes are more noticeable in small catchment than large basins aragaw et al 2021 in relation to morphology results from 4 out 10 cases studies demonstrated that human induced activities dam construction and mining have a greater impact on sediment production soil erosion and riverine vegetation dynamics more than cc ahmed fawzi 2011 setyorini et al 2017 song et al 2016 according to the reviewed articles the dynamics of river hydro morphology are controlled by two factors rainfall and temperature input and the processes influenced by the input and the basin characteristics therefore cc governs the input and the lulcc describes the basin characteristics this implies that both lulcc and cc affect river flow regimes and extreme events in an intertwined way kumar et al 2022 nkhoma et al 2020 whereby the magnitude and extent of changes are influenced both by basin characteristics and climate dynamics based on the extent of each change and their interaction furthermore lulcc impacts cc by changing energy balances water and greenhouse gases from the land to the atmosphere while climate variables also affects lulc sleeter et al 2013 tan et al 2022 6 conclusion tropical regions have experienced the fastest lulcc in the last decades coupled with cc this has affected the hydrological and geomorphological processes of river systems the main objective of this paper is to review the impacts of changes in lulc and climate on tropical river basins in terms of hydrology and morphology components from our analysis based on 60 case studies several conclusions can be drawn lulcc and cc lead to diverse changes in hydro morphological properties with extent of impact strongly influenced by the scale magnitude of change driver cc affects the river basin hydrology in terms of rainfall amounts and temperature while lulcc enhances or decreases its impacts by defining the water conveyance moreover cc and lulcc are interrelated factors that affect extreme events such as droughts and floods furthermore cc impacts lulcc and vice versa and their interactions are nonlinear the main trend of lulcc has been an increase in cultivated and urban land and a decline in forest land along with cc these changes resulted in an increased streamflow surface flow and total water and sediment yields erosion rates and a decrease in et and groundwater recharge the future is expected to follow the same trend with variations based on implementation of conservation measures including reversing forest cover losses and optimization of development trajectories with due consideration of land cover the changing hydrology combined with human induced activities such as mining reservoir construction and riverine vegetation changes have led to increased riverbank erosion channel migration and changed rivers cross sections the relatively low correlation between lulcc and hydrological variables indicates that other catchment characteristics such as soil climate or topography also play an important role a number of the case studies analyzed in this review use models land use change hydrological climate change it is crucial to consider uncertainties from model parameterization and structure in the change impact assessment and include the uncertainty analyses in model outputs to ensure more robust and reliable results since most studies used in this review analyzed impacts of forest transition to other lu types more research is needed on other lulc transitions to better comprehend the wide ranging effects of lulcc on river hydro morphology the majority of the reviewed papers 37 out of 60 papers are from three countries ethiopia india and brazil therefore more studies in other parts of the tropical region are required to improve our understanding of river morphology land and water resource management in light of future changes research should
