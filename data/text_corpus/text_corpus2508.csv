12540,photocatalytic membrane pm has been broadly used for industrial wastewater treatment however most developed photocatalytic materials are only responsive to uv light irradiation in this study mos2 wo3 composite was hydrothermally synthesized and added to pvdf membranes for rubber wastewater treatment the diffuse reflectance spectra drs results prove that the mos2 wo3 composite is responsive to visible light irradiation with a 1 49 ev band gap according to the sem edx result the mos2 wo3 composite has been successfully embedded and evenly dispersed on the membrane surface and matrix the addition of mos2 wo3 increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane with the initial flux value up to 44 26 l min 2 h 1 and 63 69 l min 2 h 1 in dark and vis light irradiation respectively the rejection values reached 97 04 90 63 and 95 64 for cod tds and nh3 n respectively and showed excellent reusability after 5 recovery cycles upon vis light irradiation it has been proven that pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane shows the highest constant rate k values 2 93 10 3 min 1 and 2 72 10 3 min 1 for cod and nh3 n respectively the scavenger analysis confirmed that oh radical is the primary responsible species to organic pollutant degradation all results have proven that mos2 wo3 affects the membrane performance from the physical separation process through filtration and photocatalytic degradation mechanisms therefore the pvdf mos2 wo3 photocatalytic membrane offers a promising potential to improve the performance of the existing rubber wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords degradation hydrophilicity photocatalytic rubber vis light irradiation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater is abundantly generated by several operating stages of natural rubber processing 1 generally natural rubber nr wastewater is highly loaded with organic substances and nutrients such as carbohydrates fats and proteins these nutrients are present in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus which are originated from the addition of necessary chemicals during the production process the existence of organic matter can be determined through chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod 2 while the nitrogen and phosphorus can be examined based on the values of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n phosphorus phosphate po4 p 3 to allow safe disposal to the environment natural rubber wastewater must undergo prior treatment for the reduction of pollutant content until the achievement of the quality standards of wastewater commonly nr wastewater treatment employs filtration coagulation biological treatment ozonation flocculation and sedimentation processes 4 5 however these treatments require a large area and a long processing time furthermore they also still generate sludge as the by product which requires an additional post treatment numerous investigations have been carried out to process rubber wastewater to obtain clean water currently the development of membrane technology for rubber wastewater treatment has been receiving more attention from both membrane and wastewater treatment experts so far the use of membrane in various applications provides several advantages such as versatile hybridization with other methods a smaller geometrical dimension less chemical consumption excellent separation efficiency and easy of scale adjustment 6 7 in general the most widely used membranes in wastewater treatment are derived from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polymers these polymers are more advantageous than other polymers such as polysulfone psf and polyethersulfone pes specifically in terms of chemical resistance and thermal stability 8 however most traditional membranes have inherent shortcomings which are related to fouling problems in addition to remarkably reduce membrane performance and lifetime fouling can considerably increase energy consumption and cleaning expenses 9 10 recently photocatalytic membranes pms have been extensively studied due to their ability to decompose harmful pollutants in wastewater by the generated reactive oxygen species ross forming safer compounds under light irradiation this photocatalytic degradation prevents the formation of foulants on the membrane surface and pores which leads to reduce membrane pores blocking 11 12 meanwhile the membrane matrix acts as a selective hurdle that splits the pollutants in the feed and supports the photocatalyst to forestall the leaching of nanosized photocatalysts some uv light responsive and visible light responsive photocatalysts such as cds 13 tio2 14 zno 15 zro2 16 mno2 17 mos2 18 and wo3 19 are currently still undergoing development for example the introduction of zno mos2 material into membrane for methylene blue degradation achieved 81 76 degradation efficiency under uv visible light and increased the 96 of flux recovery ratio frr 20 photocatalytic materials are employed to improve pollutant rejection and minimize fouling by integrating filtration and photocatalytic degradation processes as a uv light responsive photocatalyst with a large band gap of 3 2 ev tio2 dominates the photocatalytic materials used to enhance membrane s photocatalytic activity 21 the large band gap value suggests that tio2 being merely responsive to uv light irradiation unfortunately uv light irradiation can induce membrane structure damage due to harsh destruction by both uv light and reactive oxygen species i e oh leading to adverse impacts on the polymeric membrane 22 hence visible light responsive materials are currently being developed to be incorporated into membranes to overcome these issues meanwhile tungsten trioxide wo3 with a 2 4 2 8 ev band gap is an excellent candidate for a responsive visible light photocatalyst this material possesses a stable physicochemical structure 23 25 and high oxidation power of photo generated holes based on their investigation singh et al 19 observed a pollutant degradation rate constant of 0 0419 min 1 leading to a degradation efficiency of 92 37 however wo3 suffers from a serious weakness namely low photochemical activity that is caused by the rapid recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs and low conduction band level 0 7 ev 26 combining two photocatalytic materials can be expected to maximize the use of photocatalytic materials through the reduction of the band gap formation of heterojunctions and diminishing the recombination tendency that lead to considerable reduction of energy and maintenance cost additionally combining selective photocatalysts can avoid the recombination of electrons and holes 18 in a previous study conducted by cui et al 27 the combination of fe3o4 and tio2 decreased the band gap energy value in the range of 3 12 ev to 1 41 ev the combining photocatalyst materials can cause a decrease in the band gap energy so that it is responsive to visible light with a lower photon energy source lately molybdenum disulfide mos2 has become one of the most widely used photocatalysts for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants mos2 particles are advantageous for their environmentally benign large surface area good stability and small band gap 2 4 ev that makes them become more responsive to visible light irradiation 28 as expected the incorporation of mos2 into the membrane led to the achievement of 12 l m 2 h 1 permeate flux with a 95 cod rejection 13 sonowane et al 29 modified pvdf membrane by adding mos2 ag3po4 visible light driven photocatalyst material which has a band gap value of 2 38 for drimaren orange p2r dye removal and was found to successfully degraded up to 98 of the dye with a k value of 0 04093 min 1 furthermore the photocatalytic activity test also revealed the observable effect of mos2 on the degradation of the pollutant the use of mos2 wo3 composite materials was studied by singla et al 18 the mos2 wo3 composite was used directly to degrade pollutants in wastewater and resulted in a maximum degradation efficiency of 90 2 at a degradation rate constant of 0 020 min 1 this composite material successfully breaks down the organic pollutant under sunlight irradiation however the direct use of nanoscale mos2 wo3 photocatalyst materials in waste treatment with makes them susceptible to leach to the environment difficult to separate and become the secondary pollution which finally can be associated to environmental toxicity 30 to significantly reduce the leaching tendency the photocatalyst materials can be combined with membranes by immobilizing photocatalysts on the membrane surface or in the membrane matrix mos2 wo3 materials which have been proven to exhibit excellent performance in industrial waste treatment can be combined with membranes so that wastewater treatment does not only work by physical separation but can also work by photocatalytic degradation as far as the literature survey has been performed the incorporation of photocatalytic mos2 wo3 composites into the membrane matrix has yet to be studied the significant effect of using mos2 wo3 composite for pollutant degradation opens its potential incorporation into a membrane for the development of a membrane with an excellent photocatalytic degradation ability to the best of our knowledge the incorporation of photocatalytic mos2 wo3 composites into the membrane matrix has yet to be investigated presumably this is the first study that incorporates mos2 wo3 into the pvdf membrane matrix to enhance both membrane characteristics and performance the resulting photocatalytic membrane pm is expected to be capable to treat rubber wastewater to obtain clean water through the proposed integrated filtration separation and photocatalytic degradation processes a remarkable potential can be developed by using light responsive photocatalytic membranes for treating natural rubber wastewater into clean water with the best performance 2 material and method 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf powder pvdf solef 6020 1001 99 as polymeric membrane material was procured from solvay advanced materials usa meanwhile n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 as solvent was the product of merck germany in addition tungsten oxide wo3 99 molybdenum disulfide mos2 and potassium

preparation of chemical solutions and all experiments the nr wastewater samples were collected at different time intervals in january and april 2022 as a kind donation from ptpn vii indonesia the waste taken from different collection days was mixed and its characteristics are presented in table 1 2 2 synthesis of mos2 wo3 composite fig 1 illustrates the process scheme used for the synthesis of mos2 wo3 according to the one step hydrothermal method 18 the hydrothermal method can be defined as a heterogeneous chemical reaction with a water based solvent at high temperature 25 c and high pressure 1 atm in a closed system a total of 10 g of mos2 dispersion and 5 g of wo3 powder were dissolved in 100 ml of di water the mixture was then stirred for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution then the solution was transferred into an autoclave for further heating at 180 c for 24 h the autoclaved solution was then cooled and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times to ensure a complete impurities removal the obtained composite was then oven dried at 60 c for 7 h in order to activate the mos2 wo3 composite photocatalyst and perfectly remove the residual organic compound left in the its pores the mos2 wo3 composite was further heated at 500 c for 5 h finally the composite was crushed and ball milled to attain nanosized particles 2 3 synthesis of pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane the wet phase inversion method was selected to prepare the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane the polymer concentration used was 17 wt with the addition of 2 wt mos2 wo3 composite based on the weight of pvdf a pre determined amount of pvdf powder was dissolved in nmp employing a beaker glass and hot plate stirrer at 60 c for 1 h to achieve homogeneity in another beaker glass a pre weighed mos2 wo3 composite was dispersed in nmp and ultrasonicated at 40 000 hz for 1 h the composite dispersion was then poured into the polymer solution and was further stirred for 12 h at 60 c the resulting mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and degassed to completely remove the bubbles in the solution before the casting process could be made the dope solution was then evenly spread on a glass plate using a 150 μm thickness casting knife the casted membrane was then put into a coagulation bath filled with di water and let to immerse for 24 h for a complete removal of the remaining solvent the membrane is then let to equilibrate to room temperature 2 4 mos2 wo3 composite characterization the fabricated mos2 wo3 composite was analyzed for its physical and chemical characteristics the surface morphology of the composite was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem jeolseries jsm 6510 la japan employing 3000 magnification meanwhile the elemental dispersion chemical composition and elemental and oxide content of the composite were examined using energy dispersion x ray edx jeol series japan functional groups exist in the composite were identified using fourier transform infrared ftir perkin elmer usa with a wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 the composite s particle size distribution was determined using a laser particle size analyzer psa lab instrument uk whereas the photocatalytic activity and the optical properties of the nanoparticles were examined using a uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra uv vis drs analyzer this analysis was conducted by measuring the absorbance of the composite solution using a spectrophotometer uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan at 250 700 nm the results of the uv vis drs analysis were presented with the interaction between absorbance and photon energy at various wavelengths from uv to visible light range finally the band gap energy of the composite was estimated with the help of the tauc plot 2 5 membrane characterization 2 5 1 sem edx analysis a scanning electron microscope sem jeolseries membrane jsm 6510 la japan was assigned to figure out the morphological structure of the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane surface and cross section at 3000 and 1000 magnifications respectively the membrane s elemental dispersion chemical composition and elemental and oxide content were examined using energy dispersive x ray edx jeol series japan then an edx mapping was carried out to analyze the distribution of particles in the membrane and the homogeneity of the membrane 2 5 2 functional group and structural properties of the membrane functional groups present in the membrane matrix were detected using fourier transform infrared ftir perkin elmer usa with a wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 by material absorbance in the infrared spectra in addition the membrane s crystalline structure and crystalline phase were analyzed using x ray diffraction analysis xrd shimadzu japan using cu kα at 30 ma and 30 kv with a 20 scanning speed of 30 min 1 in the range of 2theta 10 80 2 5 3 hydrophilicity analysis membrane hydrophilicity was determined based on the contact angle value which was measured using a contact angle meter oca25 dataphysic instruments gmbh germany while membrane s water uptake ability was observed employing the gravimetric method the water uptake ability analysis was conducted by immersing the membrane in di water for 24 h the weight of the wetted membrane was then recorded accordingly the weight of the dried membrane upon oven drying at 60 c for 24 h was also recorded to ensure an accurate measurement each membrane sample was subjected to contact angle measurement with 4 replications hence membrane s water uptake ability can be calculated using eq 1 1 w w w w d w d x 100 where w is the water uptake ability ww and wd are the weight of the wet and dry membrane respectively gr 2 5 4 pore and mechanical properties analysis the membrane porosity value can be further estimated using the membrane s wet and dry weight data according to eq 2 2 ε w w w d ρ w a δ 100 where ε is the membrane porosity ww and wd represent the weights of the wet and dry membranes respectively gr ρ w is the water density at room temperature 0 997 g cm 3 a is the effective surface area cm 2 and δ is the membrane thickness cm the average pore radius was also approximated using the guerout elford ferry 18 correlation

uts h001 china some of the important mechanical strength parameters measured to the membranes were the thickness tensile strength and elongation break the square shaped membrane sheet 5 5 cm2 was placed on the sample holder and then clamped the sample was stretched and the elongation rate was fixed at 20 mm min the measurements were subjected to each membrane sample in 4 replications 3 evaluation of membrane photo filtration process performance the membrane photo filtration process was performed using a cross flow system using natural rubber wastewater as a feed the membrane was installed on a testing module with a size of 12 57 cm2 the prototype of the membrane filtration system is depicted in fig 2 the membrane module was equipped with a visible light lamp 80 w halogen tungsten lamp with a 400 800 nm wavelength range to supply the visible light the membrane performance in the photo filtration process was tested through flux and rejection of cod tds and nh3 n concentrations measurements in both feed and permeate 3 1 permeability the membrane permeation flux test was studied using a laboratory scale cross flow filtration system as depicted in fig 2 the di water was mounted into the module for 30 min at 6 bar until it reached a steady flux and then the pure water permeate volumes were recorded for the permeate flux the filtration was conducted using nr wastewater for 6 h with 6 bars of pressure the resulting permeate was sampled and analyzed periodically at every 30 min interval the pure water and permeate membrane flux were then quantified using eq 4 4 j w j ww v a t where jw and jww are the permeate flux of pure water and permeate l m 2 h 1 respectively v is the volume of the permeate l a is the effective membrane area m2 and t is the filtration time h 3 2 rejection membrane membrane rejection was determined by analyzing the rejection of cod tds and nh3 n in feed and permeate the cod concentration was analyzed using dichromate analysis 32 while the concentration of nh3 n was determined using hi3824 025 reagent employing uv vis spectrophotometry the tds concentration was quantified using a tds meter hi98301 dist 1 hanna instruments usa the membrane rejection was then calculated using eq 5 5 r 1 c p c f x 100 where r is rejection efficiency c p and cf are the pollutant concentration in permeate and feed solution respectively mg l 3 3 evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of membranes the photocatalytic activity of the membrane was investigated by measuring the concentration of cod and nh3 n analysis of the photocatalytic activity of the membrane was carried out using natural rubber nr wastewater as a feed a photocatalytic study was performed to evaluate the degradation performance of pvdf mos2 wo3 visible light irradiation a membrane with an effective area of 12 57 cm2 was immersed in the nr solution consisting of 50 ml of nr wastewater and 50 ml of di water under vis light irradiation prior to visible light irradiation the membrane was immersed in the dark condition for 60 min so the adsorption desorption equilibrium was established then 10 ml nr solution was withdrawn every 30 for 180 min and the cod and nh3 n concentration was measured the reaction rate of cod and nh3 n was calculated based on langmuir hinshelwood kinetics using pseudo first order models as determined by the following eq 6 6 ln c 0 c t k t where co and ct are the concentrations of organic pollutants at t 0 and t t respectively mg l k is rate constant min 1 and t is time min the scavenger analysis investigated the significant reactive species on pollutant degradation oxalic acid oa benzoquinone bq and methanol were used as the scavengers for h o2 and oh respectively 33 the photocatalytic activity of the pvdf mos2 wo3 membranes was tested in 100 ml nr wastewater with 2 mmol of the scavengers at 30 c for 120 min under vis light irradiation then both cod and nh3 n concentrations were measured to study the effect of scavengers on photocatalytic activity 4 result and discussion 4 1 synthesis and characterization of mos2 wo3 composite the surface morphology of the fabricated mos2 wo3 composites generated from sem analysis is presented in fig 3 a as expected the mos2 and wo3 particles tend to stick to each other producing a relatively uniform size composite in this study the sem analysis confirmed that the mos2 wo3 composite was successfully synthesized with mos2 particles was the reinforcement materials were uniformly distributed in the wo3 matrix as seen in fig 3 a the two photocatalytic materials appear to adhere to each other due to van der waals forces 34 indeed the hydrothermal method influenced the product s physical characteristics in terms of crystal size crystallinity crystal microstructure morphology particle size and agglomeration tendency 35 previous research reported that a smaller crystal size was obtained at higher hydrothermal temperatures 36 therefore the particles produced are expected to be small and evenly distributed to produce a more uniform force nano sized composite materials have been reported to possess a large surface area and good photocatalytic activity 37 molybdenum mo sulfide s and tungsten w distribution can be observed with a uniform dispersion in fig 3 c the mos2 wo3 particle size lay at 50 80 nm and mainly at 60 70 nm with an average particle size of 63 59 nm in fig 3 c molybdenum mo sulfide s and tungsten w are completely dispersed in the composite to further confirm the successful synthesis of the mos2 wo3 composite the xrd analysis and elemental dispersion mapping were also conducted fig 4 c exhibits the crystalline structure of mos2 and wo3 with some strong peaks the mos2 diffractogram data obtained from the reference data of jpds no 017 20 245 indicates that the mos2 material has several unique peaks at 14 9 39 54 49 78 and 70 14 which are consistent with the 002 100 110 and 201 crystal planes of mos2 accordingly the significant peak of wo3 can be observed at 22 9 23 4 24 3 26 5 28 7 41 6 47 1 49 9 and 55 9 will indicate the 002 020 200 120 112 202 222 004 140 240 monoclinic phase of wo3 the diffractogram of wo3 exactly corresponds with the phase structure of wo3 from the reference data of jcpds no 83 0950 the diffractogram of the composite exhibit a closely similar pattern to wo3 but with higher peak intensity some sharp peaks were seen at 23 2 24 44 26 6 41 5 49 98 and 53 54 however the 2θ of the mos2 wo3 composites also demonstrates two distinctive diffraction peaks at 14 38 and 56 92 which correspond to the characteristics of mos2 therefore the diffractogram of the composite confirmed the monoclinic geometric shape of wo3 with some mos2 peaks that corroborated the successful embedment of mos2 and wo3 materials in the composite the mos2 material is dispersed in the wo3 matrix with no prominent phase separation this could be due to the uniform distribution of the mos2 material across the wo3 matrix and the well connected similar ionic radius of 0 60 å for w and 0 59 å for mo a similar phenomenon was also reported in previous study that doped tio2 material with mo and w materials the ionic radius of ti is 0 6 which is similar to the ionic radius of mo and w resulting in no prominent phase separation 38 as expected the diffractogram also does not show any impurity peaks that indicate a successful synthesis of high purity mos2 wo3 composite this result is also in good agreement with the energy dispersive x ray edx results the elemental and oxide composition of the mos2 wo3 composite obtained from edx analyzes are presented in fig 4 it was found that w mo and s contributed respectively 51 91 11 02 and 4 04 weight in the mos2 wo3 composite the presence of c element which is an organic material can occur due to carbon contamination formed during x ray spectroscopy edx 39 the mos2 wo3 and mos2 wo3 composite materials were further characterized using ftir to observe any possible changes in functional groups after the synthesis process in fig 4 b the wo3 material shows a board peak in the range of 500 100 cm 1 attributed to o w o stretching vibration there are small and sharp peaks on the 810 cm 1 that corresponds to the wo stretching the broad absorption bands were also identified in the mos2 spectra namely at 496 900 cm 1 which are assigned to presence mos2 39 the band at 496 cm 1 corresponds to the ss bond and the peak at 620 cm 1 is associated to mos stretching vibration bond 40 the peak at 1173 cm 1 can correspond to the sulfate groups the significant peaks at about 3334 cm 1 belong to the unique characteristic bands of the oh group 41 42 the mos2 wo3 composite present the board absorption band in the range 500 1000 cm 1 which can be assigned to the o w o stretching with a small and sharp peak at 820 cm 1 which corresponds to the wo the band at 1169 and 1620 cm 1 moved to the lower wavenumber in mos2 wo3 composite indicating the mos2 placement on matrix wo3 in fig 5 a druv vis spectra were performed to analyze the optical absorption properties as expected both pure wo3 and mos2 materials showed a high absorption value at 510 nm and 420 nm respectively it is clearly shown that mos2 wo3 composite also demonstrated a significant absorbance value in the visible light range between mos2 and wo3 with 0 809 a u therefore mos2 wo3 composite can be expected to actively respond to visible light as the redshift increases due to the chemical bonds of wo and mos 18 according to the drs results mos2 wo3 and mos2 wo3 are responsive in the visible light range 420 nm the drs result was further transformed into tauc plot αhv n vs hv and the outcome is depicted in fig 5 b the estimation value of band gap energy can be calculated using the tauc plot with eq 7 43 7 αh v n h v eg where α is absorption coefficient h is planck constant v is light frequency and eg is band gap energy a tangent line was extrapolated to the x axis to obtain the band gap of each material the band gap value of pure wo3 mos2 and mos2 wo3 was noted to be 2 10 ev 1 25 ev and 1 49 ev respectively the coupling of wo3 and mos2 narrowed down the band gap of wo3 indicating an improved visible light absorption capability of the mos2 wo3 composite which later became beneficial to enhance the wo3 photochemical activity the photocatalytic mechanism further explains this photocatalytic effect of the mos2 wo3 composite 4 2 characterization of pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane 4 2 1 membrane morphology and elemental dispersion the morphological characteristics of the successfully fabricated membranes neat pvdf pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 were tested using scanning electron microscope elemental dispersion x ray sem edx the analysis was performed to find out the clear picture of the surface and cross section of the fabricated membrane as well as the distribution of the mos2 wo3 composite particles in the pvdf membrane the results of the surface and cross section of fabricated membrane observed at 3000 and 1000 magnifications are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a presents some obvious defects at the surface of the neat membranes this observed phenomenon might be the result of the high precipitation state of the polymeric casting solution forming numerous macro voids on the membrane surface which leads to an asymmetric membrane morphology 44 these defects and unselective voids may influence membrane s selectivity and subsequently reduce its rejection values for cod tds and nh3 n based on fig 6 b and c both photocatalytic membranes pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 showed no physical defects on their surface and the evenly distributed voids indicate excellent dispersion of the inorganic material and interactions between the polymeric membrane solution and the introduced photocatalytic materials the photocatalyst added membrane exhibited the presence of several photocatalyst material embedment to the membrane as seen in fig 6 c more white dots on the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane than that of pvdf wo3 membrane the white dots appear due to the agglomeration of mos2 wo3 composite the surface and pores of the membrane specifically when the concentration of nanoparticles is considerably high 45 basically inorganic nanomaterials have a strong agglomeration tendency in organic solvents and organic polymer solutions a similar phenomenon was also observed in the previous study conducted by kusworo et al 46 where tio2 material agglomerated in the psf membrane resulted in many large holes and unpleasant membrane performance as a remark photocatalyst dosage and its dispersion pattern in the dope solution strongly determine the characteristics of the produced membrane in fig 6 the cross section of all fabricated membranes shows a finger like structure as an indication of the common characteristic of asymmetric membranes it can be clearly observed that the incorporation of photocatalytic composite mos2 wo3 exhibits a finger like structure with an enormous pore structure compared with both neat pvdf and pvdf wo3 membranes usually this finger like structure provides a good effect on the membrane performance the existence of massive pores in the membrane s matrix will increase membrane s porosity leading to an enhanced membrane s permeability 47 fig 6 c demonstrates the appearance of the mos2 wo3 composite in the cross section of the membrane surprisingly the mos2 wo3 composite material was successfully embedded on the membrane surface and in its pores the presence of mos2 wo3 composites on the membrane surface can be expected to increase membrane s hydrophilicity for easier photon energy absorption by the composite materials to obtain excellent photocatalytic activity theoretically the strongly embedded composite materials have the potential to reduce fouling in the membrane pores and minimize their leaching from the membrane a clearer elemental composition and the dispersion of composites on membranes are presented in fig 7 in fig 7 a the f and c materials are dominant with 41 02 and 18 43 respectively indicating the use of pvdf as a base membrane s polymer accordingly w mo and s oxides were also present at 14 75 10 62 and 4 06 indicating that the pvdf mos2 wo3 was successfully synthesized and contained wo3 and mos2 with no impurity in addition these three materials are also evenly dispersed on the pvdf membrane as seen in fig 7 d in fig 7 b the neat pvdf membrane demonstrates some foulant deposits with a sort of foulant layer that covers the visible pores on the membrane surface the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane shows less foulant deposit on the membrane surface with no observable foulant layer the presence of mos2 wo3 composites enhances the antifouling properties thereby reducing the formation of foulant deposits on the membrane surface the filtration process which is carried out under vis light light to promote composites ability to break down foulant materials into simpler and harmless molecules such as co2 and h2o and subsequently reduces the occurrence of fouling 48 indeed these two substances are easier to be separated using a membrane this shows that pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane has lower fouling tendency than that of the neat pvdf membrane 4 2 2 functional group analysis structural properties the fabricated membranes were analyzed for their functional groups using ftir analysis at the wavenumber range between 4000 and 400 cm 1 fig 8 a reveals the presence of several particular functional groups in neat pvdf membrane namely the saturated cf bonds at 1500 1200 cm 1 cf3 at 1200 cm 1 and cc at 1100 1200 cm 1 a typical functional group from the oh stretching vibration was found in the range of wavenumber 3500 3000 cm 1 meanwhile a new strong peak can be observed in the ir spectra of pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 membranes as expected the ir spectra of both membranes also showed the same peak at 870 cm 1 which corresponds to the chemical structure of pvdf additionally some new peaks were found at 3400 cm 1 indicating stretching vibration modes of the o oh group 49 the broad peak at 500 1000 cm 1 which corresponds to the asymmetric vibration of o w o bonds is identified in the ir spectra of both pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 50 it confirms the successful incorporation of wo3 into the membrane it was also found that a new peak at 1664 cm 1 on the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane is slightly red shifted compared to the neat pvdf indicating the strong interfacial interaction between the mos2 wo3 composite and the pvdf polymer 51 fig 8 b shows no sharp peak on the diffractogram of the neat pvdf membrane which confirm that the neat pvdf membrane is amorphous on the other hand the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane diffractogram exhibits a broad peak at 10 20 which can be assigned as the unique peak of the pvdf polymer 8 several significant peaks were also identified at 24 66 26 90 and 79 88 indicating the successful embedment of the mos2 wo3 composite into the membrane the edx result also supports this successful mos2 wo3 incorporation in other words the existence of mos2 wo3 in the membrane is clearly confirmed by all characterization methods namely the x ray diffraction ftir and sem edx 4 2 3 membrane hydrophilicity fig 9 a shows a decrease in the contact angle value 90 as a result of the addition of the composite which confirms that the membrane surface becomes more hydrophilic according to kusworo et al 32 the addition of nanoparticles to a membrane could increase membrane hydrophilicity due to the more intensive dipole dipole interactions between water molecules and membrane surface indeed these intense interactions promotes the enhancement of membrane s absorption ability this observation is in line with the increase in water uptake ability of the pvdf mos2 wo3 composite incorporated membrane both parameters contact angle value and water uptake ability indicate that mos2 wo3 composite addition has significantly boosted the hydrophilicity of the membrane 4 2 4 mechanical strength and pore properties analysis mechanical strength analysis was carried out to determine the membrane strength and durability the addition of mos2 wo3 composite to the membrane was found to weaken the membrane s mechanical properties as presented in fig 9 b the elongation break and tensile strength of the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane were the lowest compared to the other membranes their values were 11 2 and 3 81 respectively coherent with the sem analysis where the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane was more porous than the neat pvdf membrane hence a lower mechanical force should be sufficient to break its structure this concept suggests a reduction of the mechanical strength of the composite incorporated membrane 52 however table 2 shows that the addition of mos2 wo3 composite in the membrane did not significantly increase the membrane thickness which was around 70 μm this result is advantageous because in a thinner membrane the separation process will occur more rapidly than the thick ones 53 pore properties which consist of thickness pore size and porosity of the membrane are presented in table 2 practically a larger membrane pore size will increase the volume of permeate passing through the membrane the pore structure of the membrane affects the flux value and the porosity value increases along with the addition of the mos2 wo3 composite these results also concur with the sem results exhibited in fig 2 c which shows a more massive pore structure in the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane compared to the other membranes 4 3 photo filtration membrane performance 4 3 1 permeability membrane performance can be evaluated based on its permeability flux and selectivity rejection the flux value was determined from the permeate volume through the membrane per membrane area per time and its value should depend on the membrane porosity and hydrophilicity meanwhile membrane selectivity is determined by the membrane s ability to remove the targeted pollutant from the feed selectively membrane permeability was analyzed by carrying out a filtration process under two different conditions dark and visible light irradiation the filtration process with visible light irradiation was carried out to initiate the expected photocatalytic reaction on the membrane surface fig 10 a demonstrates a significant difference in the pure water flux pwf value of all membranes in visible light irradiation since the pwf was performed using di water as the feed with negligible contaminant content the permeate flux value of the pwf membrane would be higher the increase in pwf value can also indicate the subsequent effect of hydrophilicity increase on membrane permeability the oxygen vacancies in the photocatalytic materials could bind and react with water molecules h2o and subsequently generate oh groups therefore the hydrophilicity of the photocatalytic materials embedded membranes increased 54 fig 10 b proves that the photocatalytic membranes demonstrate promising normalized flux values the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane showed a more stable flux value with increasing filtration time than other tested membranes as expected no significant differences in permeate value were demonstrated by neat pvdf membrane under dark and visible light irradiated conditions fig 10 c pvdf polymer is not a photocatalytic material so its permeability was not influenced by visible light irradiation in the dark filtration condition membranes with incorporated photocatalytic materials showed good performance compared to the neat pvdf and clearly indicated the effect of incorporating photocatalytic materials in the separation process based on the results of sem and porosity data the addition of photocatalytic material resulted in the formation of more pores the addition of this material also shows an increase in hydrophilicity according to the contact angle data based on this characterization the photocatalytic materials have been proven to help improve membrane permeability by increasing the hydrophilicity and porosity under a dark environment under a visible light irradiated environment a significant effect was observed on both membranes with the addition of photocatalytic materials namely the wo3 and mos2 wo3 the pvdf wo3 membrane showed an increase in the initial permeate flux from 45 70 l m 2 h 1 to 46 49 l m 2 h 1 and pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane from 44 26 l m 2 h 1 to 63 69 l m 2 h 1 the addition of mos2 wo3 composite cause an even higher effect on the membrane permeate flux value than that of wo3 the coupling of mos2 and wo3 photocatalytic materials positively affects the membrane flux value with a higher possibility of heterojunction formation heterojunction produces a more stable membrane against visible light irradiation reduces photocatalyst recombination and increases the membrane s photocatalytic activity photocatalytic activity on the membrane improves the membrane s ability to degrade the pollutants contained in the rubber waste into co2 and h2o the separation process does not only occur physically through filtration but also through photocatalytic degradation by the composite on the surface and pores of the membrane with this degradation capability the possibility of membrane fouling can be minimized 4 3 2 selectivity membrane selectivity was analyzed by looking at the membrane s ability the removal of cod tds and nh3 n under visible light irradiation photo filtration analysis was carried out in 2 different conditions dark and vis light irradiation in 240 min under visible light a neat pvdf membrane has a 59 34 56 52 and 69 54 of cod tds and nh3 n respectively and increased in pvdf mos2 wo3 with 97 04 90 63 and 95 64 of cod tds and nh3 n respectively in fig 10 d f the three parameters significantly increased especially in the cod and nh3 n under visible light irradiation the mos2 wo3 composite in the membrane serves as a photocatalyst increasing the membrane s selectivity through the photocatalytic activity degradation site based on the sem results in fig 2 c the composite material was dispersed both on the surface and in the membrane s pores the mos2 wo3 composite on the surface of the membrane is easily activated with visible light so that it can later be in direct contact with the organic pollutants this degradation process lightens the burden on the membrane in separating organic pollutants by degrading pollutants into co2 and h2o in this way the organic pollutant present in the natural rubber wastewater treatment is not only separated through the membrane but also degraded following a photocatalytic mechanism 4 3 3 photoactivity and stability the photocatalytic activity of the membrane was evaluated by determining the degradation of pollutant rates of the fabricated membrane previously the membrane was immersed in natural rubber wastewater in an isolated box for 60 min so adsorption desorption equilibrium testing was performed on the membrane in fig 11 a and b the photocatalytic activity of the fabricated membrane was investigated by analyzing cod and nh3 n degradation behavior under visible light irradiation in the dark condition adsorption region both pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 show a decrease in c co indicating the ability of surface adsorption of the membrane kusworo et al 32 explained that the rich oxygen sites on the membrane surface generate strong van der waals attraction forces to the charged pollutant molecules which causes the adsorption performance 55 in the visible light irradiation section there was a significant change in the degradation of cod and nh3 n in contrast to dark conditions where adsorption becomes the dominant mechanism the photocatalytic activity plays a significant role in visible light irradiation on the neat pvdf membrane it can be seen that there is no significant cod and nh3 n degradation while on the membrane with the addition of photocatalyst material both wo3 and mos2 showed a significant difference the photocatalytic materials present in the membrane are responsive to visible light according to the results of the druv vis analysis in the existence of visible light irradiation the photon energy in the vis light is absorbed to generate the photocatalyst s photocatalytic activity pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane showed a better degradation response than the pvdf wo3 membrane the coupling of the two photocatalytic materials reduces the recombination process and increases its photocatalytic activity 56 57 in fig 11 c and d it was found that all membranes had an r2 value 0 95 so this plot could be used to analyze the constant rate value in fig 12 a in both cod and nh3 n parameters the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane shows the highest constant rate k values 2 93 10 3 min 1 and 2 72 10 3 min 1 for cod and nh3 n respectively these constant rate values indicate an increase in photocatalytic activity in the membrane with the addition of mos2 wo3 composite material these results are also supported by the degradation efficiency of pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane ass seen in fig 12 c the scavenger analysis was carried out to investigate the possible major species involved in the photocatalytic degradation process in fig 12 b the addition of a scavenger is done by adding ammonium oxalate oa benzoquinone bq and methanol for capturing the active species h oh and o2 respectively 33 the addition of a capture agent causes all degradation rates of organic pollutants both cod and nh3 n to decrease these results indicate that the major active species that affect are present in the photocatalytic process are oh o2 h based on these results oh became the major contributor to the organic pollutant degradation cod and nh3 n while o2 and h just played an auxiliary role this result is in accordance with the results conducted by zhang et al 26 and zeng et al 58 on the use of wo3 and mos2 for pollutant degradation in fig 12 d a cycle test analysis is performed to see the reusability of the membrane this analysis was carried out by using a membrane for the filtration process for 5 cycles and analyzing the degradation of the cod value before each cycle started the membrane was washed with di water and irradiated with visible light for 30 min to remove the adsorbed organic pollutant on the membrane surface and pores based on the results the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane performance did not significantly decrease during cod degradation indicating a membrane with high stability to degrade organic pollutants 4 3 4 photocatalytic mechanism an analysis of the potential value vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe was carried out to learn more about the photocatalytic mechanism that occurs as seen in fig 13 based on uv vis drs result and tauc plot the mos2 wo3 composite shows the highest absorbance at 450 nm with 1 49 ev of the direct band gap the conduction bands ecb and valence bands evb from wo3 mos2 and mos2 wo3 were calculated and determined using eq 8 and 9 mulliken s electronegativity value 18 8 e vb χ e e 0 5 eg 9 e cb e vb e g where χ is mulliken electronegativity ee is free electron energy on the hydrogen scale 4 5 ev evb is valence s band maximum ecb is conduction band s maximum and eg is band gap energy according to the tauc plot the band gap eg of wo3 mos2 and mos2 wo3 were 2 10 ev 1 25 ev and 1 49 ev respectively based on the literature data the value of χ from wo3 and mos2 was 6 59 ev 59 and 5 28 ev 60 respectively in this study the conduction band cb and valance band vb potential values of wo3 were 0 95 ev and 3 05 ev respectively and those of mos2 was 0 15 ev and 1 40 ev versus a normal hydrogen electrode nhe respectively the proposed mechanism of mitigation and separation of electron and hole pairs in mos2 wo3 composite under visible light irradiation is illustrated in fig 13 the visible light was irradiated to the composite materials then photo induced electrons were active and moved from the valance band to the conduction band by absorbing photon energy 61 this process will leave photo induced holes in the valence band the electrons in mos2 tend to move from cb mos2 to cb wo3 because of the band alignment similarly holes in vb wo3 tend to move from vb wo3 to vb mos2 62 since electrons e and holes h are accumulated in wo3 and mos2 respectively a high efficiency separation of photo generated electron holes can occur which later can effectively suppress the charge recombination in the composites further the pair of photo generated electron holes then react with oxygen and hydroxyl groups in water to form various reactive oxygen species ros oh and o2 with a wide range of oxidation capabilities 18 22 63 the electrons e in cb mos2 will react with oxygen to produce superoxide radical o2 and subsequently react with water to form hydroxyl radicals oh meanwhile the hole h in vb wo3 reacts with water h2o or hydroxyl oh molecules to generate hydroxyl radicals oh however the electrons in cb wo3 cannot react by dissolving oxygen to form o2 because the standard redox potential value of o2 o2 v vs nhe o2 o2 0 33 ev was more negative than the conduction band wo3 of 0 95 ev similarly the hole in vb mos2 cannot oxidize water molecules to oh because the vb of mos2 1 40 ev was more negative than the oxidation potential of water or oh to produce oh radicals v vs nhe h2o oh 1 99 ev the presence of radicals produced by the composite oh and o2 enhances membrane performance to degrade pollutants organic pollutants and nh3 n in rubber wastewater both radicals break down organic pollutants into smaller and milder pollutants and finally turn them into co2 n2 and h2o the mechanism that occurs is in line with the results of permeability and rejection which show promising results with the addition of the mos2 wo3 composite the complete steps of photocatalytic reaction have listened in eq 10 20 the photogenerated electron under visible light irradiation in the conduction band of mos2 10 mos 2 h v h mos

2 o 4 3 5 comparison of the results with other similar studies reported in the literature the use of photocatalytic membranes in industrial waste treatment is currently under development stage the selected visible light responsive photocatalytic materials are directly used for wastewater treatment however the nanoscaled photocatalyst has a higher leaching tendency and trigger secondary pollution with a considerable toxicity additionally the nanoscaled photocatalyst is also difficult to separate therefore to prevent leaching photocatalyst materials can be combined with membranes by immobilizing photocatalysts on the membrane surface in the membrane matrix or both combining membrane materials with photocatalytic materials to become photocatalytic membranes can enhance membrane performance in terms of permeability and selectivity the use of photocatalytic membranes as an integrated process has been applied using various types of polymers photocatalysts synthesis methods and contaminant characteristics as the comparison can be seen in table 3 based on the comparison results with other previously developed photocatalytic membranes the mos2 wo3 material added to the membrane has a lower energy band gap value than other composite materials so that it will reduce the amount of energy source required for the photocatalytic process in addition some photocatalyst materials such as wo3 can potentially be used for energy storage in the dark photocatalysis process 64 65 future research areas were suggested and the prospects of using wo3 based materials for other applications were highlighted based on table 3 the pollutant removal of natural rubber wastewater using pvdf mos2 wo3 is superior to photocatalytic membranes it was also found that there were no other studies reported regarding the use of pvdf mos2 wo3 membranes in the natural rubber wastewater treatment process by integrating processing through filtration and photocatalytic degradation processes finally based on all results the use of pvdf mos2 wo3 membranes under vis light irradiation which combines the process of filtration and photocatalytic degradation provides a large potential as an effective and energy efficient method for industrial wastewater treatment not just for natural rubber waste water but also can be applied to other industrial wastewater 5 conclusion this study elaborates the hydrothermal coupling of mos2 and wo3 particles for the synthesis of mos2 wo3 composite and the embedment of this composite into pvdf polymer to form a complex photocatalytic membrane matrix the addition of mos2 can control the composite s particle size and remarkably enhances its surface area and photocatalytic performance the mos2 wo3 composite has been successfully embedded in the pvdf polymer membrane s surface and pores the incorporation of mos2 wo3 composite to the membrane matrix significantly increased the membrane s hydrophilicity and water uptake ability an excellent membrane performance increase was also observed where the initial flux of the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane reached 63 69 l min 2 h 1 under visible light irradiation furthermore the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane also demonstrated an excellent photocatalytic activity compared to the other membranes mos2 wo3 can degrade organic pollutants through its photocatalytic mechanism under visible light irradiation by converting the organic pollutants cod and nh3 n into less harmful degraded pollutants namely co2 n2 and h2o the addition of mos2 wo3 composites significantly influenced membrane performance in terms of filtration and photocatalytic degradation the incorporation of mos2 wo3 in pvdf membranes provides encouraging potential in the rubber wastewater treatment through an integrated photocatalytic separation and degradation processes the use of mos2 wo3 composite in pvdf membrane offers a promising feature to minimize energy use increasing the efficiency of the natural rubber wastewater

12540,photocatalytic membrane pm has been broadly used for industrial wastewater treatment however most developed photocatalytic materials are only responsive to uv light irradiation in this study mos2 wo3 composite was hydrothermally synthesized and added to pvdf membranes for rubber wastewater treatment the diffuse reflectance spectra drs results prove that the mos2 wo3 composite is responsive to visible light irradiation with a 1 49 ev band gap according to the sem edx result the mos2 wo3 composite has been successfully embedded and evenly dispersed on the membrane surface and matrix the addition of mos2 wo3 increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane with the initial flux value up to 44 26 l min 2 h 1 and 63 69 l min 2 h 1 in dark and vis light irradiation respectively the rejection values reached 97 04 90 63 and 95 64 for cod tds and nh3 n respectively and showed excellent reusability after 5 recovery cycles upon vis light irradiation it has been proven that pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane shows the highest constant rate k values 2 93 10 3 min 1 and 2 72 10 3 min 1 for cod and nh3 n respectively the scavenger analysis confirmed that oh radical is the primary responsible species to organic pollutant degradation all results have proven that mos2 wo3 affects the membrane performance from the physical separation process through filtration and photocatalytic degradation mechanisms therefore the pvdf mos2 wo3 photocatalytic membrane offers a promising potential to improve the performance of the existing rubber wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords degradation hydrophilicity photocatalytic rubber vis light irradiation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater is abundantly generated by several operating stages of natural rubber processing 1 generally natural rubber nr wastewater is highly loaded with organic substances and nutrients such as carbohydrates fats and proteins these nutrients are present in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus which are originated from the addition of necessary chemicals during the production process the existence of organic matter can be determined through chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod 2 while the nitrogen and phosphorus can be examined based on the values of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n phosphorus phosphate po4 p 3 to allow safe disposal to the environment natural rubber wastewater must undergo prior treatment for the reduction of pollutant content until the achievement of the quality standards of wastewater commonly nr wastewater treatment employs filtration coagulation biological treatment ozonation flocculation and sedimentation processes 4 5 however these treatments require a large area and a long processing time furthermore they also still generate sludge as the by product which requires an additional post treatment numerous investigations have been carried out to process rubber wastewater to obtain clean water currently the development of membrane technology for rubber wastewater treatment has been receiving more attention from both membrane and wastewater treatment experts so far the use of membrane in various applications provides several advantages such as versatile hybridization with other methods a smaller geometrical dimension less chemical consumption excellent separation efficiency and easy of scale adjustment 6 7 in general the most widely used membranes in wastewater treatment are derived from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polymers these polymers are more advantageous than other polymers such as polysulfone psf and polyethersulfone pes specifically in terms of chemical resistance and thermal stability 8 however most traditional membranes have inherent shortcomings which are related to fouling problems in addition to remarkably reduce membrane performance and lifetime fouling can considerably increase energy consumption and cleaning expenses 9 10 recently photocatalytic membranes pms have been extensively studied due to their ability to decompose harmful pollutants in wastewater by the generated reactive oxygen species ross forming safer compounds under light irradiation this photocatalytic degradation prevents the formation of foulants on the membrane surface and pores which leads to reduce membrane pores blocking 11 12 meanwhile the membrane matrix acts as a selective hurdle that splits the pollutants in the feed and supports the photocatalyst to forestall the leaching of nanosized photocatalysts some uv light responsive and visible light responsive photocatalysts such as cds 13 tio2 14 zno 15 zro2 16 mno2 17 mos2 18 and wo3 19 are currently still undergoing development for example the introduction of zno mos2 material into membrane for methylene blue degradation achieved 81 76 degradation efficiency under uv visible light and increased the 96 of flux recovery ratio frr 20 photocatalytic materials are employed to improve pollutant rejection and minimize fouling by integrating filtration and photocatalytic degradation processes as a uv light responsive photocatalyst with a large band gap of 3 2 ev tio2 dominates the photocatalytic materials used to enhance membrane s photocatalytic activity 21 the large band gap value suggests that tio2 being merely responsive to uv light irradiation unfortunately uv light irradiation can induce membrane structure damage due to harsh destruction by both uv light and reactive oxygen species i e oh leading to adverse impacts on the polymeric membrane 22 hence visible light responsive materials are currently being developed to be incorporated into membranes to overcome these issues meanwhile tungsten trioxide wo3 with a 2 4 2 8 ev band gap is an excellent candidate for a responsive visible light photocatalyst this material possesses a stable physicochemical structure 23 25 and high oxidation power of photo generated holes based on their investigation singh et al 19 observed a pollutant degradation rate constant of 0 0419 min 1 leading to a degradation efficiency of 92 37 however wo3 suffers from a serious weakness namely low photochemical activity that is caused by the rapid recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs and low conduction band level 0 7 ev 26 combining two photocatalytic materials can be expected to maximize the use of photocatalytic materials through the reduction of the band gap formation of heterojunctions and diminishing the recombination tendency that lead to considerable reduction of energy and maintenance cost additionally combining selective photocatalysts can avoid the recombination of electrons and holes 18 in a previous study conducted by cui et al 27 the combination of fe3o4 and tio2 decreased the band gap energy value in the range of 3 12 ev to 1 41 ev the combining photocatalyst materials can cause a decrease in the band gap energy so that it is responsive to visible light with a lower photon energy source lately molybdenum disulfide mos2 has become one of the most widely used photocatalysts for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants mos2 particles are advantageous for their environmentally benign large surface area good stability and small band gap 2 4 ev that makes them become more responsive to visible light irradiation 28 as expected the incorporation of mos2 into the membrane led to the achievement of 12 l m 2 h 1 permeate flux with a 95 cod rejection 13 sonowane et al 29 modified pvdf membrane by adding mos2 ag3po4 visible light driven photocatalyst material which has a band gap value of 2 38 for drimaren orange p2r dye removal and was found to successfully degraded up to 98 of the dye with a k value of 0 04093 min 1 furthermore the photocatalytic activity test also revealed the observable effect of mos2 on the degradation of the pollutant the use of mos2 wo3 composite materials was studied by singla et al 18 the mos2 wo3 composite was used directly to degrade pollutants in wastewater and resulted in a maximum degradation efficiency of 90 2 at a degradation rate constant of 0 020 min 1 this composite material successfully breaks down the organic pollutant under sunlight irradiation however the direct use of nanoscale mos2 wo3 photocatalyst materials in waste treatment with makes them susceptible to leach to the environment difficult to separate and become the secondary pollution which finally can be associated to environmental toxicity 30 to significantly reduce the leaching tendency the photocatalyst materials can be combined with membranes by immobilizing photocatalysts on the membrane surface or in the membrane matrix mos2 wo3 materials which have been proven to exhibit excellent performance in industrial waste treatment can be combined with membranes so that wastewater treatment does not only work by physical separation but can also work by photocatalytic degradation as far as the literature survey has been performed the incorporation of photocatalytic mos2 wo3 composites into the membrane matrix has yet to be studied the significant effect of using mos2 wo3 composite for pollutant degradation opens its potential incorporation into a membrane for the development of a membrane with an excellent photocatalytic degradation ability to the best of our knowledge the incorporation of photocatalytic mos2 wo3 composites into the membrane matrix has yet to be investigated presumably this is the first study that incorporates mos2 wo3 into the pvdf membrane matrix to enhance both membrane characteristics and performance the resulting photocatalytic membrane pm is expected to be capable to treat rubber wastewater to obtain clean water through the proposed integrated filtration separation and photocatalytic degradation processes a remarkable potential can be developed by using light responsive photocatalytic membranes for treating natural rubber wastewater into clean water with the best performance 2 material and method 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf powder pvdf solef 6020 1001 99 as polymeric membrane material was procured from solvay advanced materials usa meanwhile n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 as solvent was the product of merck germany in addition tungsten oxide wo3 99 molybdenum disulfide mos2 and potassium

pressure 1 atm in a closed system a total of 10 g of mos2 dispersion and 5 g of wo3 powder were dissolved in 100 ml of di water the mixture was then stirred for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution then the solution was transferred into an autoclave for further heating at 180 c for 24 h the autoclaved solution was then cooled and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times to ensure a complete impurities removal the obtained composite was then oven dried at 60 c for 7 h in order to activate the mos2 wo3 composite photocatalyst and perfectly remove the residual organic compound left in the its pores the mos2 wo3 composite was further heated at 500 c for 5 h finally the composite was crushed and ball milled to attain nanosized particles 2 3 synthesis of pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane the wet phase inversion method was selected to prepare the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane the polymer concentration used was 17 wt with the addition of 2 wt mos2 wo3 composite based on the weight of pvdf a pre determined amount of pvdf powder was dissolved in nmp employing a beaker glass and hot plate stirrer at 60 c for 1 h to achieve homogeneity in another beaker glass a pre weighed mos2 wo3 composite was dispersed in nmp and ultrasonicated at 40 000 hz for 1 h the composite dispersion was then poured into the polymer solution and was further stirred for 12 h at 60 c the resulting mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and degassed to completely remove the bubbles in the solution before the casting process could be made the dope solution was then evenly spread on a glass plate using a 150 μm thickness casting knife the casted membrane was then put into a coagulation bath filled with di water and let to immerse for 24 h for a complete removal of the remaining solvent the membrane is then let to equilibrate to room temperature 2 4 mos2 wo3 composite characterization the fabricated mos2 wo3 composite was analyzed for its physical and chemical characteristics the surface morphology of the composite was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem jeolseries jsm 6510 la japan employing 3000 magnification meanwhile the elemental dispersion chemical composition and elemental and

activity and the optical properties of the nanoparticles were examined using a uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra uv vis drs analyzer this analysis was conducted by measuring the absorbance of the composite solution using a spectrophotometer uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan at 250 700 nm the results of the uv vis drs analysis were presented with the interaction between absorbance and photon energy at various wavelengths from uv to visible light range finally the band gap energy of the composite was estimated with the help of the tauc plot 2 5 membrane characterization 2 5 1 sem

3000 and 1000 magnifications respectively the membrane s elemental dispersion chemical composition and elemental and oxide content were examined using energy dispersive x ray edx jeol series japan then an edx mapping was carried out to analyze the distribution of particles in the membrane and the homogeneity of the membrane 2 5 2 functional group and structural properties of the membrane functional groups present in the membrane matrix were detected using fourier transform infrared ftir perkin elmer usa with a wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 by material absorbance in the infrared spectra in addition the membrane s crystalline structure and crystalline phase were analyzed using x ray diffraction analysis xrd shimadzu japan using cu kα at 30 ma and 30 kv with a 20 scanning speed of 30 min 1 in the range of 2theta 10 80 2 5 3 hydrophilicity analysis membrane hydrophilicity was determined based on the contact angle value which was measured using a contact angle meter oca25 dataphysic instruments gmbh germany while membrane s water uptake ability was observed employing the gravimetric method the water uptake ability analysis was conducted by immersing the membrane in di water for 24 h the weight of the wetted membrane was then recorded accordingly the weight of the dried membrane upon oven drying at 60 c for 24 h was also recorded to ensure an accurate measurement

uts h001 china some of the important mechanical strength parameters measured to the membranes were the thickness tensile strength and elongation break the square shaped membrane sheet 5 5 cm2 was placed on the sample holder and then clamped the sample was stretched and the elongation rate was fixed at 20 mm min the measurements were subjected to each membrane sample in 4 replications 3 evaluation of membrane photo filtration process performance the membrane photo filtration process was performed using a cross flow system using natural rubber wastewater as a feed the membrane was installed on a testing module with a size of 12 57 cm2 the prototype of the membrane filtration system is depicted in fig 2 the membrane module was equipped with a visible light lamp 80 w halogen tungsten lamp with a 400 800 nm wavelength range to supply the visible light the membrane performance in the photo filtration process was tested through flux and rejection of cod tds and nh3 n concentrations measurements in both feed and permeate 3 1 permeability the membrane permeation flux test was studied using a laboratory scale cross flow filtration system as depicted in fig 2 the di water was mounted into the module for 30 min at 6 bar until it reached a steady flux and then the pure water permeate volumes were recorded for the permeate flux the filtration was conducted using nr wastewater for 6 h with 6 bars of pressure the resulting permeate was sampled and analyzed periodically at every 30 min interval the pure water and permeate membrane flux were then quantified using eq

filtration time h 3 2 rejection membrane membrane rejection was determined by analyzing the rejection of cod tds and nh3 n in feed and permeate the cod concentration was analyzed using dichromate analysis 32 while the concentration of nh3 n was determined using hi3824 025 reagent employing uv vis spectrophotometry the tds concentration was quantified using a tds meter hi98301 dist 1 hanna instruments usa the membrane rejection was then calculated using eq 5 5 r 1 c p c f x 100 where r is rejection efficiency c p and cf are the pollutant concentration in permeate and feed solution respectively mg l 3 3 evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of membranes the photocatalytic activity of the membrane was investigated by measuring the concentration of cod and nh3 n analysis of the photocatalytic activity of the membrane was carried out using natural rubber nr wastewater as a feed a photocatalytic study was performed to evaluate the degradation performance of pvdf mos2 wo3 visible light irradiation a membrane with an effective area of 12 57 cm2 was immersed in the nr solution consisting of 50 ml of nr wastewater and 50 ml of di water under vis light irradiation prior to visible light irradiation the membrane was immersed in the dark condition for 60 min so the adsorption desorption equilibrium was established then 10 ml nr solution was withdrawn every 30 for 180 min

effect of scavengers on photocatalytic activity 4 result and discussion 4 1 synthesis and characterization of mos2 wo3 composite the surface morphology of the fabricated mos2 wo3 composites generated from sem analysis is presented in fig 3 a as expected the mos2 and wo3 particles tend to stick to each other producing a relatively uniform size composite in this study the sem analysis confirmed that the mos2 wo3 composite was successfully synthesized with mos2 particles was the reinforcement materials were uniformly distributed in the wo3 matrix as seen in fig 3 a the two photocatalytic materials appear to adhere to each other due to van der waals forces 34 indeed the hydrothermal method influenced the product s physical characteristics in terms of crystal size crystallinity crystal microstructure morphology particle size and agglomeration tendency 35 previous research reported that a smaller crystal size was obtained at higher hydrothermal temperatures 36 therefore the particles produced are expected to be small and evenly distributed to produce a more uniform force nano sized composite materials have been reported to possess a large surface area and good photocatalytic activity 37 molybdenum mo sulfide s and tungsten w distribution can be observed with a uniform dispersion in fig 3 c the mos2 wo3 particle size lay at 50 80 nm and mainly at 60 70 nm with an average particle size of 63 59 nm in fig 3 c molybdenum mo sulfide s and tungsten w are completely dispersed in the composite to further confirm the successful synthesis of the mos2 wo3 composite the xrd analysis and elemental dispersion mapping were also conducted fig 4 c exhibits the crystalline structure of mos2 and wo3 with some strong peaks the mos2 diffractogram data obtained from the reference data of jpds no 017 20 245 indicates that the mos2 material has several unique peaks at 14 9 39 54 49 78 and 70 14 which are consistent with the 002 100 110 and 201 crystal planes of mos2 accordingly the significant peak of wo3 can be observed at 22 9 23 4 24 3 26 5 28 7 41 6 47 1 49 9 and 55 9 will indicate the 002 020 200 120 112 202 222 004 140 240 monoclinic phase of wo3 the diffractogram of wo3 exactly corresponds with the phase structure of wo3 from the reference data of jcpds no 83 0950 the diffractogram of the composite exhibit a closely similar pattern to wo3 but with higher peak intensity some sharp peaks were seen at 23 2 24 44 26 6 41 5 49 98 and 53 54 however the 2θ of the mos2 wo3 composites also demonstrates two distinctive diffraction peaks at 14 38 and 56 92 which correspond to the characteristics of mos2 therefore the diffractogram of the composite confirmed the monoclinic geometric shape of wo3 with some mos2 peaks that corroborated the successful embedment of mos2 and wo3 materials in the composite the mos2 material is dispersed in the wo3 matrix with no prominent phase separation this could be due to the uniform distribution of the mos2 material across the wo3 matrix and the well connected similar ionic radius of 0 60 å for w and 0 59 å for mo a similar phenomenon was also reported in previous study that doped tio2 material with mo and w materials the ionic radius of ti is 0 6 which is similar to the ionic radius of mo and w resulting in no prominent phase separation 38 as expected the diffractogram also does not show any impurity peaks that indicate a successful synthesis of high purity mos2 wo3 composite this result is also in good agreement with the energy dispersive x ray edx results the elemental and oxide composition of the mos2 wo3 composite obtained from edx analyzes are presented in fig 4 it was found that w mo and s contributed respectively 51 91 11 02 and 4 04 weight in the mos2 wo3 composite the presence of c element which is an organic material can occur due to carbon contamination formed during x ray spectroscopy edx 39 the mos2 wo3 and mos2 wo3 composite materials were further characterized using ftir to observe any possible changes in functional groups after the synthesis process in fig 4 b the wo3 material shows a board peak in the range of 500 100 cm 1 attributed to o w o stretching vibration there are small and sharp peaks on the 810 cm 1 that corresponds to the wo stretching the broad absorption bands were also identified in the mos2 spectra namely at 496 900 cm 1 which are assigned to presence mos2 39 the band at 496 cm 1 corresponds to the ss bond and the peak at 620 cm 1 is associated to mos stretching vibration bond 40 the peak at 1173 cm 1 can correspond to the sulfate groups the significant peaks at about 3334 cm 1 belong to the unique characteristic bands of the oh group 41 42 the mos2 wo3 composite present the board absorption band in the range 500 1000 cm 1 which can be assigned to the o w o stretching with a small and sharp peak at 820 cm 1 which corresponds to the wo the band at 1169 and 1620 cm 1 moved to the lower wavenumber in mos2 wo3 composite indicating the mos2 placement on matrix wo3 in fig 5 a druv vis spectra were performed to analyze the optical absorption properties as expected both pure wo3 and mos2 materials showed a high absorption value at 510 nm and 420 nm respectively it is clearly shown that mos2 wo3 composite also demonstrated a significant absorbance value in the visible light range between mos2 and wo3 with 0 809 a u therefore mos2 wo3 composite can be expected to actively respond to visible light as the redshift increases due to the chemical bonds of wo and mos 18 according to the drs results mos2 wo3 and mos2 wo3 are responsive in the visible light range 420 nm the drs result was further transformed into tauc plot αhv n vs hv and the outcome is depicted in fig 5 b the estimation value of band gap energy can be calculated using the tauc plot with eq 7 43 7 αh v n h v eg where α is absorption coefficient h is planck constant v is light frequency and eg is band gap energy a tangent line was extrapolated to the x axis to obtain the band gap of each material the band gap value of pure wo3 mos2 and mos2 wo3 was noted to be 2 10 ev 1 25 ev and 1 49 ev respectively the coupling of wo3 and mos2 narrowed down the band gap of wo3 indicating an improved visible light absorption capability of the mos2 wo3 composite which later became beneficial to enhance the wo3 photochemical activity the photocatalytic mechanism further explains this photocatalytic effect of the mos2 wo3 composite 4 2 characterization of pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane 4 2 1 membrane morphology and elemental dispersion the morphological characteristics of the successfully fabricated membranes neat pvdf pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 were tested using scanning electron microscope elemental dispersion x ray sem edx the analysis was performed to find out the clear picture of the surface and cross section of the fabricated membrane as well as the distribution of the mos2 wo3 composite particles in the pvdf membrane the results of the surface and cross section of fabricated membrane observed at 3000 and 1000 magnifications are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a presents some obvious defects at the surface of the neat membranes this observed phenomenon might be the result of the high precipitation state of the polymeric casting solution forming numerous macro voids on the membrane surface which leads to an asymmetric membrane morphology 44 these defects and unselective voids may influence membrane s selectivity and subsequently reduce its rejection values for cod tds and nh3 n based on fig 6 b and c both photocatalytic membranes pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 showed no physical defects on their surface and the evenly distributed voids indicate excellent dispersion of the inorganic material and interactions between the polymeric membrane solution and the introduced photocatalytic materials the photocatalyst added membrane exhibited the presence of several photocatalyst material embedment to the membrane as seen in fig 6 c more white dots on the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane than that of pvdf wo3 membrane the white dots appear due to the agglomeration of mos2 wo3 composite the surface and pores of the membrane specifically when the concentration of nanoparticles is considerably high 45 basically inorganic nanomaterials have a strong agglomeration tendency in organic solvents and organic polymer solutions a similar phenomenon was also observed in the previous study conducted by kusworo et al 46 where tio2 material agglomerated in the psf membrane resulted in many large holes and unpleasant membrane performance as a remark photocatalyst dosage and its dispersion pattern in the dope solution strongly determine the characteristics of the produced membrane in fig 6 the cross section of all fabricated membranes shows a finger like structure as an indication of the common characteristic of asymmetric membranes it can be clearly observed that the incorporation of photocatalytic composite mos2 wo3 exhibits a finger like structure with an enormous pore structure compared with both neat pvdf and pvdf wo3 membranes usually this finger like structure provides a good effect on the membrane performance the existence of massive pores in the membrane s matrix will increase membrane s porosity leading to an enhanced membrane s permeability 47 fig 6 c demonstrates the appearance of the mos2 wo3 composite in the cross section of the membrane surprisingly the mos2 wo3 composite material was successfully embedded on the membrane surface and in its pores the presence of mos2 wo3 composites on the membrane surface can be expected to increase membrane s hydrophilicity for easier photon energy absorption by the composite materials to obtain excellent photocatalytic activity theoretically the strongly embedded composite materials have the potential to reduce fouling in the membrane pores and minimize their leaching from the membrane a clearer elemental composition and the dispersion of composites on membranes are presented in fig 7 in fig 7 a the f and c materials are dominant with 41 02 and 18 43 respectively indicating the use of pvdf as a base membrane s polymer accordingly w mo and s oxides were also present at 14 75 10 62 and 4 06 indicating that the pvdf mos2 wo3 was successfully synthesized and contained wo3 and mos2 with no impurity in addition these three materials are also evenly dispersed on the pvdf membrane as seen in fig 7 d in fig 7 b the neat pvdf membrane demonstrates some foulant deposits with a sort of foulant layer that covers the visible pores on the membrane surface the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane shows less foulant deposit on the membrane surface with no observable foulant layer the presence of mos2 wo3 composites enhances the antifouling properties thereby reducing the formation of foulant deposits on the membrane surface the filtration process which is carried out under vis light light to promote composites ability to break down foulant materials into simpler and harmless molecules such as co2 and h2o and subsequently reduces the occurrence of fouling 48 indeed these two substances are easier to be separated using a membrane this shows that pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane has lower fouling tendency than that of the neat pvdf membrane 4 2 2 functional group analysis structural properties the fabricated membranes were analyzed for their functional groups using ftir analysis at the wavenumber range between 4000 and 400 cm 1 fig 8 a reveals the presence of several particular functional groups in neat pvdf membrane namely the saturated cf bonds at 1500 1200 cm 1 cf3 at 1200 cm 1 and cc at 1100 1200 cm 1 a typical functional group from the oh stretching vibration was found in the range of wavenumber 3500 3000 cm 1 meanwhile a new strong peak can be observed in the ir spectra of pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 membranes as expected the ir spectra of both membranes also showed the same peak at 870 cm 1 which corresponds to the chemical structure of pvdf additionally some new peaks were found at 3400 cm 1 indicating stretching vibration modes of the o oh group 49 the broad peak at 500 1000 cm 1 which corresponds to the asymmetric vibration of o w o bonds is identified in the ir spectra of both pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 50 it confirms the successful incorporation of wo3 into the membrane it was also found that a new peak at 1664 cm 1 on the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane is slightly red shifted compared to the neat pvdf indicating the strong interfacial interaction between the mos2 wo3 composite and the pvdf polymer 51 fig 8 b shows no sharp peak on the diffractogram of the neat pvdf membrane which confirm that the neat pvdf membrane is amorphous on the other hand the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane diffractogram exhibits a broad peak at 10 20 which can be assigned as the unique peak of the pvdf polymer 8 several significant peaks were also identified at 24 66 26 90 and 79 88 indicating the successful embedment of the mos2 wo3 composite into the membrane the edx result also supports this successful mos2 wo3 incorporation in other words the existence of mos2 wo3 in the membrane is clearly confirmed by all characterization methods namely the x ray diffraction ftir and sem edx 4 2 3 membrane hydrophilicity fig 9 a shows a decrease in the contact angle value 90 as a result of the addition of the composite which confirms that the membrane surface becomes more hydrophilic according to kusworo et al 32 the addition of nanoparticles to a membrane could increase membrane hydrophilicity due to the more intensive dipole dipole interactions between water molecules and membrane surface indeed these intense interactions promotes the enhancement of membrane s absorption ability this observation is in line with the increase in water uptake ability of the pvdf mos2 wo3 composite incorporated membrane both parameters contact angle value and water uptake ability indicate that mos2 wo3 composite addition has significantly boosted the hydrophilicity of the membrane 4 2 4 mechanical strength and pore properties analysis mechanical strength analysis was carried out to determine the membrane strength and durability the addition of mos2 wo3 composite to the membrane was found to weaken the membrane s mechanical properties as presented in fig 9 b the elongation break and tensile strength of the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane were the lowest compared to the other membranes their values were 11 2 and 3 81 respectively coherent with the sem analysis where the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane was more porous than the neat pvdf membrane hence a lower mechanical force should be sufficient to break its structure this concept suggests a reduction of the mechanical strength of the composite incorporated membrane 52 however table 2 shows that the addition of mos2 wo3 composite in the membrane did not significantly increase the membrane thickness which was around 70 μm this result is advantageous because in a thinner membrane the separation process will occur more rapidly than the thick ones 53 pore properties which consist of thickness pore size and porosity of the membrane are presented in table 2 practically a larger membrane pore size will increase the volume of permeate passing through the membrane the pore structure of the membrane affects the flux value and the porosity value increases along with the addition of the mos2 wo3 composite these results also concur with the sem results exhibited in fig 2 c which shows a more massive pore structure in the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane compared to the other membranes 4 3 photo filtration membrane performance 4 3 1 permeability membrane performance can be evaluated based on its permeability flux and selectivity rejection the flux value was determined from the permeate volume through the membrane per membrane area per time and its value should depend on the membrane porosity and hydrophilicity meanwhile membrane selectivity is determined by the membrane s ability to remove the targeted pollutant from the feed selectively membrane permeability was analyzed by carrying out a filtration process under two different conditions dark and visible light irradiation the filtration process with visible light irradiation was carried out to initiate the expected photocatalytic reaction on the membrane surface fig 10 a demonstrates a significant difference in the pure water flux pwf value of all membranes in visible light irradiation since the pwf was performed using di water as the feed with negligible contaminant content the permeate flux value of the pwf membrane would be higher the increase in pwf value can also indicate the subsequent effect of hydrophilicity increase on membrane permeability the oxygen vacancies in the photocatalytic materials could bind and react with water molecules h2o and subsequently generate oh groups therefore the hydrophilicity of the photocatalytic materials embedded membranes increased 54 fig 10 b proves that the photocatalytic membranes demonstrate promising normalized flux values the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane showed a more stable flux value with increasing filtration time than other tested membranes as expected no significant differences in permeate value were demonstrated by neat pvdf membrane under dark and visible light irradiated conditions fig 10 c pvdf polymer is not a photocatalytic material so its permeability was not influenced by visible light irradiation in the dark filtration condition membranes with incorporated photocatalytic materials showed good performance compared to the neat pvdf and clearly indicated the effect of incorporating photocatalytic materials in the separation process based on the results of sem and porosity data the addition of photocatalytic material resulted in the formation of more pores the addition of this material also shows an increase in hydrophilicity according to the contact angle data based on this characterization the photocatalytic materials have been proven to help improve membrane permeability by increasing the hydrophilicity and porosity under a dark environment under a visible light irradiated environment a significant effect was observed on both membranes with the addition of photocatalytic materials namely the wo3 and mos2 wo3 the pvdf wo3 membrane showed an increase in the initial permeate flux from 45 70 l m 2 h 1 to 46 49 l m 2 h 1 and pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane from 44 26 l m 2 h 1 to 63 69 l m 2 h 1 the addition of mos2 wo3 composite cause an even higher effect on the membrane permeate flux value than that of wo3 the coupling of mos2 and wo3 photocatalytic materials positively affects the membrane flux value with a higher possibility of heterojunction formation heterojunction produces a more stable membrane against visible light irradiation reduces photocatalyst recombination and increases the membrane s photocatalytic activity photocatalytic activity on the membrane improves the membrane s ability to degrade the pollutants contained in the rubber waste into co2 and h2o the separation process does not only occur physically through filtration but also through photocatalytic degradation by the composite on the surface and pores of the membrane with this degradation capability the possibility of membrane fouling can be minimized 4 3 2 selectivity membrane selectivity was analyzed by looking at the membrane s ability the removal of cod tds and nh3 n under visible light irradiation photo filtration analysis was carried out in 2 different conditions dark and vis light irradiation in 240 min under visible light a neat pvdf membrane has a 59 34 56 52 and 69 54 of cod tds and nh3 n respectively and increased in pvdf mos2 wo3 with 97 04 90 63 and 95 64 of cod tds and nh3 n respectively in fig 10 d f the three parameters significantly increased especially in the cod and nh3 n under visible light irradiation the mos2 wo3 composite in the membrane serves as a photocatalyst increasing the membrane s selectivity through the photocatalytic activity degradation site based on the sem results in fig 2 c the composite material was dispersed both on the surface and in the membrane s pores the mos2 wo3 composite on the surface of the membrane is easily activated with visible light so that it can later be in direct contact with the organic pollutants this degradation process lightens the burden on the membrane in separating organic pollutants by degrading pollutants into co2 and h2o in this way the organic pollutant present in the natural rubber wastewater treatment is not only separated through the membrane but also degraded following a photocatalytic mechanism 4 3 3 photoactivity and stability the photocatalytic activity of the membrane was evaluated by determining the degradation of pollutant rates of the fabricated membrane previously the membrane was immersed in natural rubber wastewater in an isolated box for 60 min so adsorption desorption equilibrium testing was performed on the membrane in fig 11 a and b the photocatalytic activity of the fabricated membrane was investigated by analyzing cod and nh3 n degradation behavior under visible light irradiation in the dark condition adsorption region both pvdf wo3 and pvdf mos2 wo3 show a decrease in c co indicating the ability of surface adsorption of the membrane kusworo et al 32 explained that the rich oxygen sites on the membrane surface generate strong van der waals attraction forces to the charged pollutant molecules which causes the adsorption performance 55 in the visible light irradiation section there was a significant change in the degradation of cod and nh3 n in contrast to dark conditions where adsorption becomes the dominant mechanism the photocatalytic activity plays a significant role in visible light irradiation on the neat pvdf membrane it can be seen that there is no significant cod and nh3 n degradation while on the membrane with the addition of photocatalyst material both wo3 and mos2 showed a significant difference the photocatalytic materials present in the membrane are responsive to visible light according to the results of the druv vis analysis in the existence of visible light irradiation the photon energy in the vis light is absorbed to generate the photocatalyst s photocatalytic activity pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane showed a better degradation response than the pvdf wo3 membrane the coupling of the two photocatalytic materials reduces the recombination process and increases its photocatalytic activity 56 57 in fig 11 c and d it was found that all membranes had an r2 value 0 95 so this plot could be used to analyze the constant rate value in fig 12 a in both cod and nh3 n parameters the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane shows the highest constant rate k values 2 93 10 3 min 1 and 2 72 10 3 min 1 for cod and nh3 n respectively these constant rate values indicate an increase in photocatalytic activity in the membrane with the addition of mos2 wo3 composite material these results are also supported by the degradation efficiency of pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane ass seen in fig 12 c the scavenger analysis was carried out to investigate the possible major species involved in the photocatalytic degradation process in fig 12 b the addition of a scavenger is done by adding ammonium oxalate oa benzoquinone bq and methanol for capturing the active species h oh and o2 respectively 33 the addition of a capture agent causes all degradation rates of organic pollutants both cod and nh3 n to decrease these results indicate that the major active species that affect are present in the photocatalytic process are oh o2 h based on these results oh became the major contributor to the organic pollutant degradation cod and nh3 n while o2 and h just played an auxiliary role this result is in accordance with the results conducted by zhang et al 26 and zeng et al 58 on the use of wo3 and mos2 for pollutant degradation in fig 12 d a cycle test analysis is performed to see the reusability of the membrane this analysis was carried out by using a membrane for the filtration process for 5 cycles and analyzing the degradation of the cod value before each cycle started the membrane was washed with di water and irradiated with visible light for 30 min to remove the adsorbed organic pollutant on the membrane surface and pores based on the results the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane performance did not significantly decrease during cod degradation indicating a membrane with high stability to degrade organic pollutants 4 3 4 photocatalytic mechanism an analysis of the potential value vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe was carried out to learn more about the photocatalytic mechanism that occurs as seen in fig 13 based on uv vis drs result and tauc plot the mos2 wo3 composite shows the highest absorbance at 450 nm with 1 49 ev of the direct band gap the conduction bands ecb and valence bands evb from wo3 mos2 and mos2 wo3 were calculated and determined using eq 8 and 9 mulliken s electronegativity value 18 8 e vb χ e e 0 5 eg 9 e cb e vb e g where χ is mulliken electronegativity ee is free electron energy on the hydrogen scale 4 5 ev evb is valence s band maximum ecb is conduction band s maximum and eg is band gap energy according to the tauc plot the band gap eg of wo3 mos2 and mos2 wo3 were 2 10 ev 1 25 ev and 1 49 ev respectively based on the literature data the value of χ from wo3 and mos2 was 6 59 ev 59 and 5 28 ev 60 respectively in this study the conduction band cb and valance band vb potential values of wo3 were 0 95 ev and 3 05 ev respectively and those of mos2 was 0 15 ev and 1 40 ev versus a normal hydrogen electrode nhe respectively the proposed mechanism of mitigation and separation of electron and hole pairs in mos2 wo3 composite under visible light irradiation is illustrated in fig 13 the visible light was irradiated to the composite materials then photo induced electrons were active and moved from the valance band to the conduction band by absorbing photon energy 61 this process will leave photo induced holes in the valence band the electrons in mos2 tend to move from cb mos2 to cb wo3 because of the band alignment similarly holes in vb wo3 tend to move from vb wo3 to vb mos2 62 since electrons e and holes h are accumulated in wo3 and mos2 respectively a high efficiency separation of photo generated electron holes can occur which later can effectively suppress the charge recombination in the composites further the pair of photo generated electron holes then react with oxygen and hydroxyl groups in water to form various reactive oxygen species ros oh and o2 with a wide range of oxidation capabilities 18 22 63 the electrons e in cb mos2 will react with oxygen to produce superoxide radical o2 and subsequently react with water to form hydroxyl radicals oh meanwhile the hole h in vb wo3 reacts with water h2o or hydroxyl oh molecules to generate hydroxyl radicals oh however the electrons in cb wo3 cannot react by dissolving oxygen to form o2 because the standard redox potential value of o2 o2 v vs nhe o2 o2 0 33 ev was more negative than the conduction band wo3 of 0 95 ev similarly the hole in vb mos2 cannot oxidize water molecules to oh because the vb of mos2 1 40 ev was more negative than the oxidation potential of water or oh to produce oh radicals v vs nhe h2o oh 1 99 ev the presence of radicals produced by the composite oh and o2 enhances membrane performance to degrade pollutants organic pollutants and nh3 n in rubber wastewater both radicals break down organic pollutants into smaller and milder pollutants and finally turn them into co2 n2 and h2o the mechanism that occurs is in line with the results of permeability and rejection which show promising results with the addition of the mos2 wo3 composite the complete steps of photocatalytic reaction have listened in eq 10 20 the photogenerated electron under visible light irradiation in the conduction band of mos2 10 mos 2 h v h mos

2 o 4 3 5 comparison of the results with other similar studies reported in the literature the use of photocatalytic membranes in industrial waste treatment is currently under development stage the selected visible light responsive photocatalytic materials are directly used for wastewater treatment however the nanoscaled photocatalyst has a higher leaching tendency and trigger secondary pollution with a considerable toxicity additionally the nanoscaled photocatalyst is also difficult to separate therefore to prevent leaching photocatalyst materials can be combined with membranes by immobilizing photocatalysts on the membrane surface in the membrane matrix or both combining membrane materials with photocatalytic materials to become photocatalytic membranes can enhance membrane performance in terms of permeability and selectivity the use of photocatalytic membranes as an integrated process has been applied using various types of polymers photocatalysts synthesis methods and contaminant characteristics as the comparison can be seen in table 3 based on the comparison results with other previously developed photocatalytic membranes the mos2 wo3 material added to the membrane has a lower energy band gap value than other composite materials so that it will reduce the amount of energy source required for the photocatalytic process in addition some photocatalyst materials such as wo3 can potentially be used for energy storage in the dark photocatalysis process 64 65 future research areas were suggested and the prospects of using wo3 based materials for other applications were highlighted based on table 3 the pollutant removal of natural rubber wastewater using pvdf mos2 wo3 is superior to photocatalytic membranes it was also found that there were no other studies reported regarding the use of pvdf mos2 wo3 membranes in the natural rubber wastewater treatment process by integrating processing through filtration and photocatalytic degradation processes finally based on all results the use of pvdf mos2 wo3 membranes under vis light irradiation which combines the process of filtration and photocatalytic degradation provides a large potential as an effective and energy efficient method for industrial wastewater treatment not just for natural rubber waste water but also can be applied to other industrial wastewater 5 conclusion this study elaborates the hydrothermal coupling of mos2 and wo3 particles for the synthesis of mos2 wo3 composite and the embedment of this composite into pvdf polymer to form a complex photocatalytic membrane matrix the addition of mos2 can control the composite s particle size and remarkably enhances its surface area and photocatalytic performance the mos2 wo3 composite has been successfully embedded in the pvdf polymer membrane s surface and pores the incorporation of mos2 wo3 composite to the membrane matrix significantly increased the membrane s hydrophilicity and water uptake ability an excellent membrane performance increase was also observed where the initial flux of the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane reached 63 69 l min 2 h 1 under visible light irradiation furthermore the pvdf mos2 wo3 membrane also demonstrated an excellent photocatalytic activity compared to the other membranes mos2 wo3 can degrade organic pollutants through its photocatalytic mechanism under visible light irradiation by converting the organic pollutants cod and nh3 n into less harmful degraded pollutants namely co2 n2 and h2o the addition of mos2 wo3 composites significantly influenced membrane performance in terms of filtration and photocatalytic degradation the incorporation of mos2 wo3 in pvdf membranes provides encouraging potential in the rubber wastewater treatment through an integrated photocatalytic separation and degradation processes the use of mos2 wo3 composite in pvdf membrane offers a promising feature to minimize energy use increasing the efficiency of the natural rubber wastewater

arabia department of chemistry king fahd university of petroleum minerals dhahran 31261 saudi arabia corresponding author smart ph bidirectional responsive material has been presented based on zinc nanoparticles with smart surfaces adaptably transform wettability in mutual directions between the superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and the superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity depending on the ph the smart material fabrication was prepared by immersing the fabric in aa co vtes zno composite a and aptes fots zno composite b reactions the material was synthesized by free radical polymerization characterization by ftir and sem edx explained that the chemical compositions were uniformly distributed through the smart fabric surface caused by the strong chelating bond between the hydroxide carboxylates and silane active surfaces the chemical stability mechanical durability and separation test results revealed selective separation efficiency for oil water separation with efficacy 99 and high satisfactory oil flux 7000 8000 l h 1 m 2 and water flux 5500 6500 l h 1 m 2 moreover the water contact angle wca for neutral water was showing at 167 indicating powerful superhydrophobic properties and for acidic basic water was absorbing from 143 153 to 0 over time indicating superhydrophylic properties underwater treatment showed that the smart fabric has superoleophobic behavior with around 150 oil contact angle oac various weights and nacl immersion tests also have been applied for mechanical and chemical stability tests the results displayed brilliant stability under severe conditions confirming great wca after repeating and increasing mass and concentration for oil removal and emulsion test dyed oil was rapidly absorbed within 2 s and oil water emulsions were easily separated by developed fabric with a good flux and separation efficacy of over 97 interestingly the prepared materials can also be efficiently and continuously separated for complicated oil water oil mixtures without particular treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cleaner environment multifunctional materials ph responsive wastewater separation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction oil spills have raised global problems owing to their huge discharge in industrial fields as well as oily wastewater contaminant 1 during the rapid improvement of the economy these environmental issues are acquiring more critical and severe accidents caused by many chemical leakages 2 human health and ecological environment threats will be the tremendous effects since wastewater containing oil and organic contaminant play a dominant catastrophe 3 yearly million tonnes of crude oils are discharged into marine fields therefore many studies and methods have been proposed to solve these areas to get rid of the current situation 4 the available oil water separation approaches such as centrifugation absorption and filtration cannot be utilized for these intractable and large scale issues 5 6 nevertheless these methods are facing limitations such as time consuming and high cost for reagents which are practically restricted for larger industrial applications 7 furthermore these methods also cannot be used for controlling the wettability between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity in one material promising membrane separation methods are widely applied for oil water separation however the complex components of the contaminations in industrial wastewater can be harmful and detrimental to human beings and the environment since numerous printing dyeing and bacteria are non biodegradable highly toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic features 8 9 current ongoing solution includes the design of smart switchable super wetting materials which are practically acting as water absorbing and oil absorbing materials in various environments and separation forms 10 11 water absorbing feature mainly has superhydrophylic superoleophobic behavior in air and underwater treatment 12 while the oil absorbing feature has superhydrophobic superoleophilic behavior in air and underwater 13 because their surface wettability can be switched depending on the environmental concentration these simple fabrication of material wettability are strongly immutable over time 14 based on interfacial science smart superwettable materials with diverse wettability for water and oil absorption have proposed a facile and effective innovation for this current environmental issue 15 predictably this excellent material for oil water separation has highly sustainable and controllable features due to the easiness of reversing from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity in response to various conditions including temperature ph light forces electric field and magnetic field 16 19 due to the simple and rapid response mechanism ph responsive materials are the most common way to develop smart superwettable materials 20 besides for academic and industrial purposes ph responsive super wetting materials have gradually risen the attention up because of their convenient operation extreme wettability and easy equipment without spending high cost for further modification 21 their surface area has specific functional groups carboxyl sulfonate amine long organic branch and hydroxyl which can be either protonated becoming a positive charge or deprotonated becoming a negative charge depending on the aqueous solution concentration 22 this phenomenon typically happened with various ph solutions to get controllable and switchable surface wettability properties on smart ph responsive materials researchers in this field have spent more concern on developing smart ph responsive material with controllable superhydrophilic superoleophobic property 23 in case when oil water system reached the super wetting hydrophilic surface the water phase can rapidly absorb and penetrate through the material while oil completely blocked the surface on the other hand when the oil water mixture reached a super wetting hydrophobic surface the water phase was blocked and oil could penetrate through the fabric surface therefore smart ph responsive material can be a promising fabrication that protects from any contamination pollution of oil during the separation process 24 recently smart ph responsive materials were prepared via acrylic acid and acrylic amide grafted on cellulose membrane which showed high oil separation 24 qu et al also reported their fabrication by combining methyl methacrylate trimethoxysilyl propyl acrylate and aptes silica nanoparticles on fabric surfaces used for efficient in situ separation of multiphase oil water 25 jiao et al presented their work by depositing magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles and long organic branch dodecylamine dda functionalized tio2 on the top fabric surface which possessed outstanding separation efficiency and high flux rate 26 one of the proposed solutions is the fabrication of ph responsive materials that remained challenged which only contained a single response either acidic sensitive amine nitrogen group or basic sensitive carboxylic group for this case the smart surfaces can operate wettability transformation in one direction which highly limited the broad application in the actual problem 27 thus for the new generation of smart ph responsive material it is highly required to combine the carboxyl containing group and amine nitrogen containing group to restore the original surface wettability this method can flexibly switch wettability on both sides alkaline and acidic and increase the usage of the smart material with low cost convenience and environmentally friendly 28 29 herein a novel smart ph bidirectional responsive nanocomposite via a facile strategy which can be continuously repeated with outstanding durable recyclability without fouling typically aa co vtes zno composite a which was first synthesized acted as a carboxyl containing group and combined with aptes fots zno composite b which acted as an amine nitrogen containing group and fluorine rich compound as a superhydrophobic side by adjusting the ph concentration from the neutral condition the acidic and basic solution will transform the initial superhydrophobic superoleophilic features into superhydrophilicity superoleophobicity within a short time moreover the objective of this work is to develop fabrics that can maintain remarkable mechanical and chemical durability and stability under severe media by displaying an adequate water contact angle wca after repeating it many times this great water repellence in the neutral solution can take some amount of weight floating on the water taking advantage of the elaborate structure of the rough hierarchical structure smart ph bidirectional responsive fabric exhibits outstanding ph induced switchable superwettability which can be considered a most promising smart material in both practical and scientific applications in the future the prospects of this material can be applied to many industrial issues such as organic component separation oil water separation and dyes bacteria removal under a harsh and complex environment which are urgently needed to be solved 2 materials and methods 2 1 material acrylic acid aa 99 vinyltriethoxysilane

chloroform and tetrachloromethane were attained from fluka the reagents were of analytical grade and utilized as received non woven fabrics detergents olive oil and various daily beverages were purchased from a local market 2 2 fabric pre treatment to begin with the non woven fabric was cut into 2 2 cm 5 pieces and ultrasonically washed with ethanol deionized water and acetone for 1 h at 50 c the as cleaned fabric with the hierarchical rough surface structures was dried before continuing to another treatment then the dried fabric was immersed in mixed aqueous solutions of 0 1 m nh4 2s2o8

surfaces up to 5000 magnifications the digital images of materials are captured by the charge coupled device ccd camera which shows the images on a computer screen for additional analysis 2 6 oil absorption capacity and oil water mixture separation test oil absorption capacity will be performed in six different types of oil compounds there are heptane toluene olive oil dichloromethane and tetrachloromethane typically 40 ml of each oil volume was added into a 100 ml beaker that contains 20 ml of deionized water then 0 06 g absorbent was put inside the beaker the beaker was left for 2 min to let the fabric absorb the oil after treatment the absorbent was removed spontaneously from the beaker followed by measuring the current weight to determine the oil absorption capacity ca lastly the weighted fabric of the absorbed oil will be considered as wt the initial weight of the fabric wo and the oil absorbed wt wo so the formula was expressed using the following eq 1 the whole treatment will be assigned as 1 cycle after that the test was repeated for 20 consecutive cycles 1 ca wt wo wo 2 7 separation efficiency and flux the separation efficiency sef test has been evaluated where mo is the initial mass of the oil and mt is the final mass of the oil after the separation test generally 10 ml of dyed water and oil were prepared in the beaker obtaining two separated layers then the modified material was inserted inside the funnel hole followed by pouring the particular solution into it the separation efficacy was computed by eq 2 moreover the oil water permeate flux was displayed in eq 3 2 sef mt mo x 100 3 flux v a x δt where v l represents the volume of oil water used which permeates across the a m2 area of fabric surface in δt time h 2 8 oil water emulsion separation test various organic solvents such as hexane heptane toluene dichloromethane and tetrachloromethane around 5 ml were introduced into 35 ml of acidic and basic aqueous media with 10 mg of detergent as an emulsifier in order to make oil water emulsion in shear stirring for 20 min the prepared emulsion was applied for evaluating the efficiency of smart fabric in the separation of oil water the oil and water flux of the smart fabric was assessed by a gravity driven filtration the change in the permeate flux corresponded to time and was considered by eq 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 smart ph bidirectional responsive material the ph sensitive chemicals low surface energy material and micro nano hierarchical rough structures are mostly prominent substances for realizing the switchable wettability of smart materials 31 32 in fig 1a the synthesis of aa co vtes zno which is used as a basic sensitive co polymer was prepared by the free radical polymerization with aibn initiator both highly reactive double bonds from aa and vtes could easily react to each other to create aa co vtes after initiator addition the prepared zno nanoparticle was attached to the center of the copolymer aa co vtes chain and could expand with more oh groups onto the zinc surface to form zno bonds as a core furthermore the free carboxylic groups which come from acrylic acid aa were extended outside on the top surface for the basic sensitive group while the remaining silane groups displayed from vtes would be connected to the zno nanoparticle after hydrolysis treatment with water therefore the as prepared copolymer composite a was successfully synthesized with the rough surface for further obtaining the superhydrophilic wettability that can be absorbed in water additionally zno nanoparticle was also modified with aptes for the acidic sensitive group and fots for the superhydrophobic agent in ph neutral conditions in fig 1b due to a large number of the hydroxyl group oh on zno it could be simply connected to the both organosilane agents aptes and fots after hydrolysis treatment the high surface energy of the hydroxyl groups presents that a small amount of water molecules h2o are connected to the fabric surface interestingly the resulted aptes fots zno composite b has two major sensitive groups both superhydrophilic due to the amine branch and superhydrophobic due to the fluorine rich compound to realize the ph bidirectional responsive fabric composite a and composite b were mixed on the top of pre treated fabric constituting the micro nano scale and rough structure of the resulted modification the resultant smart fabric was capable of making two direction wettability conversion from either neutral to acidic and neutral to basic from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity which mainly attributed to amine and carboxyl group existence respectively on the other hand fluorine rich chemical substance fots was selected as a strong superhydrophobic agent in neutral conditions due to its low surface energy it was worthy to note that both amine and the carboxylic group could remain stable leading to the surface energy reduction after protonation becoming ammonium ions nh3 and deprotonation becoming carboxylate anions coo with low and high ph solution respectively these phenomena appeared to switchable superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity in a short time without any specific remediation more surprisingly the obtained solution between a and b composites can be also used for further fabric preparation to obtain smart surface materials even 20 times without new preparation due to their powerful silane functional groups embedded into the zinc nanoparticles it also needs heat and ultrasonication energy to approach the organosilane functional groups as described in fig 2 the detailed synthesis steps were schematically shown in fig 2a the pristine fabric was washed with distilled water ethanol and acetone and etched by mixed naoh nh4 2s2o8 solution for 1 h this treatment was importantly carried out for fabric surface activation to obtain low surface energy the physical cleaning step would remove any impurities on the fabric while the alkaline pre treatment step would replace an old surface oxide with a more reactive layer and increase functional groups such as oh nh2 and cooh after the rough surface area construction the pre treated fabric was then refluxed with composite a to obtain a carboxylic cooh branch on the top fabric surface finally composite b was added to the above solution containing fabric to introduce the fluorine superhydrophobic agent f and amine nh2 on the rough nanoneedles smart fabric surface through the dip coating method due to its simple fabrication dip coating is the most universally used technique for achieving superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic on the material surface 33 the dip coating method exhibits an excellent fouling resistance by depositing a thin layer on the fabric pores additionally superhydrophobic superoleophilic feature of the fabric is attained via the corresponding effect of chemistry as well as surface mechanics stimulated by the anti wetting phenomenon of water droplets 34 thus introducing a superhydrophobic superoleophilic layer on the porous fabric via a combination of chemistry as well as hierarchical structures is a capable method for achieving high separation efficiency in oil water separation applications besides the mechanism of smart ph bidirectional responsive fabrics was explained in fig 2b beginning from the neutral condition ph 7 the amine group grafted onto the fabric was protonated after acidic treatment ph 1 the lone pair from the amine group nh2 is very reactive to attack h in an acidic solution to produce ammonium ions nh3 such ionic moieties establish strong hydrogen bond interaction with water h2o and replace the fluorine rich chain dominance 29 as a result the surface polarity of the material increased and the wettability of the surface was switched from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity into superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity 35 to return to the initial behavior the h from ammonium ions was deprotonated and captured by k2hpo4 when the smart surface was dipped in a buffer of ph 7 consequently the smart fabric was restored to its original behavior as superhydrophobic superoleophilic property on the other hand h ions from the cooh react with basic oh ions to perform h2o and the carboxyl group would become carboxylate group coo when the material was dipped in a basic aqueous media this carboxylate group coo would replace the fluorine rich chain dominance and allow the smart material to retain superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity due to surface polarity increase dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 was also used for returning its original superhydrophobicity by immersing the particular fabric into a buffer ph 7 solution by reacting free h with the carboxylate group this mechanism revealed the flexible wettability transformation in the entire ph range which can be beneficial for the multiorganic and complicated oil water separation 31 to conclude the significant transformation into two side superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity was mainly attributed to the amine protonation and carboxyl groups deprotonation whereas superhydrophobic superoleophilic property can be returned because of amine deprotonation and carboxyl groups protonation 29 3 2 ftir and sem edx results ftir measurements were analyzed to confirm the chemical composition and functional groups of the pristine fabric copolymers and the final modified fabric in fig 3a it could be investigated from the fabric composite modification that there are eight dominant peaks shown on the transmission spectra eight peaks at 570 796 1173 1355 1667 1730 2920 and 3475 3350 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of zno nanoparticle bond sio silane bond sic c o c c c o zn co ch3 ch2 and oh nh 36 37 specifically doublet peaks is containing two joining bands of the co and cc at 1355 cm 1 after modification besides the ftir spectra of the non fabric preparation were also observed in fig 3b there are several peaks displayed at 570 796 1173 1355 1667 2920 and 3475 3350 cm 1 are corresponded to the stretching vibration of zno nanoparticle bond sio silane bond sic c o c c co ch3 ch2 and oh nh it could be found that the composite a and b spectra were significantly different in comparison to the full composite spectra the appearance of these peaks would confirm the chemical reaction on the modified particle surface of the smart material more importantly the characteristic peaks of the co bond due to cooh adsorption and nh from free amines at 1667 cm 1 and 3475 3350 cm 1 are conforming to the successful synthesis of the basic and acid sensitive the smart fabric surface for further 3d rough network observation the surface morphological structure and elemental composition information of the smart ph bidirectional responsive surface were investigated by sem and edx spectroscopy in fig 3c f the original fabric displayed the fiber surface was a smooth and porous surface structure in which every fiber was connected to another network structure fig 3c for the modified smart fabric its morphology displayed that the micro nano scale of the zno nanoparticle anchored through the fibers fig 3d after being functionalized the skeleton roughness and agglomeration appear in the micro nano level structure indicating all the loaded chemicals have been uniformly distributed fig 3e f furthermore edx measurement displayed that the elements were uniformly dispersed onto the fabric surfaces area showing that the fabric was modified with the particular substances the rough surface created by such materials led to a surface with high superhydrophobicity features 3 3 oil and water absorption capacity test for further versatility investigation the ph bidirectional responsive superwetting material was dipped into the prepared solution containing water and various organic solvent water and oil such as heptane toluene olive oil water dichloromethane and tetrachloromethane these chosen liquids were selected based on their density from below up to above 1 0 g ml to understand the density effect owing to its outstanding superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity in air and neutral water it could be utilized for absorbing and removing contaminative and poisonous floating oil below or above the water surface such phenomena are explained when the oil is absorbed into the superhydrophobic superoleophilic material it is filled in the small pores to attain the aim of absorbing oil selectively while repelling water 38 after being immersed the fabric would immediately absorb the oil and the final mass of the fabric was containing the absorbed oil mass after 1 2 min of absorption the fabric will be removed for drying weighing and squeezed until 20 repeated cycles fig 4a b displays the various absorption capacity data in 20 cycles of the modified fabric for different oils and low and high density organic solvents according to the data it was found that the smallest capacity was for heptane which was around 11 12 times fabric weight due to its rapid solvent evaporation on the other side the highest capacity was for tetrachloromethane which was around 18 19 times as much as the fabric s weight after immersing the fabric in the acidic basic media the behavior from superhydrophobicity was changed into superhydrophilicity used for water absorption for the water absorption capacity test the value was ranging from 15 to 16 g g without no obvious decline after 20 cycles and the underwater oca of its surface was maintained above 150 as given in table 1 these observed data varied based on the density as well as the viscosity of the used solvent for instance the density and viscosity of the dichloromethane are relatively high so the fabric attraction to absorb dichloromethane will also be larger than in other oils which the density and viscosity under dichloromethane furthermore absorption capacity data for the smart material still maintained a high capacity and did not significantly change even until 20 cycles wca value maintained around 160 these good reusability results revealed that the smart material possessed an excellent and promising application in larger oil water separation purposes 3 4 switchable surface wettability generally the appropriate chemical composition of the smart stimuli responsiveness wettability is essential to be discussed to create uniform rough morphology material 32 to get the efficient relative volume comparison of aptes and fots some needed experiments have been done for volume ratio aptes fots 1 1 3 2 2 1 5 2 3 1 7 2 and 4 1 the effect on the ph responsiveness and surface wetting behaviors play an important role in the wettability and optimum water contact angle from different ph solutions fig 5a showed the water contact angle wca as well as oil contact angle oca of the resulted superwettable fabric after 3 min treatment with ph 1 ph 7 and ph 13 water solution the graph displayed that the fabric has a prominent superhydrophobicity condition wca 150 ph 7 and superhydrophilicity wca 0 ph 1 and 13 when the volume proportion was 3 1 it can be found when the volume ratio was lower than 3 1 the long fluorine rich chains performed a dominant role in governing the wettability and displayed a powerful hydrophobicity for different ph solutions while the function of the amine group was weakened it can also be seen that even in ph 1 and ph 13 solutions the wca showed high contact angle which was not profitable for oil water separation and smart fabric behavior furthermore when the volume ratio was higher than 3 1 the primary amines would deteriorate and predominate over the long fluorine rich chain resulting in weakened hydrophobicity wca 140 for confirming the excellent reversible wettability alteration of the as formed ph bidirectional responsive superwetting material variation wettability of the water and oil are significantly important to be evaluated as shown in fig 5b neutral water and various daily liquids were tested onto modified fabric with stable spherical shapes indicating strong superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity in the air at the same time when the fabric was soaked under acidic basic water several oil and organic solvents dichloromethane tetrachloromethane n hexane toluene olive oil and lubricating oil were also analyzed then displayed great superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity oca 150 which remain stable spherical shape onto the surface of the prepared fabric fig 5e the sliding angle image also showed a great underwater superoleophobicity for chloroform droplets since it can be quickly rolled with a sliding angle of 4 in a few milliseconds interestingly when the oil jet was sprayed to the material surface all the droplets from the syringe were spread out and refused to contact the coated surface subsequently when the material was dipped in the buffer ph 7 solution dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 the smart fabric surface wettability did recover to the original superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity fig 5g the surface wettability performance of the developed material is a significant feature for practical oil water separation 39 40 in fig 5c and f acidic droplet ph 1 blue dyed neutral water droplet ph 7 and basic water droplet ph 13 orange dyed were slowly dropped around 5 μl on pure unmodified fabric and the smart fabric surfaces as can be seen for pure fabric all the water droplets from various ph were rapidly permeated on the surface within 2 s due to its highly hydrophylic features on the contrary for developed smart fabric it is observed that the three water droplets preserved spherical states at the beginning of the procedure fig 5i nevertheless after 20 s the blue dyed acidic water droplet gradually penetrated through the surface and absorbed completely in 1 min whereas the basic water droplet remained in a spherical state furthermore after 100 s the orange dyed basic water droplet becomes a hemispherical state and is completely absorbed after 200 s more importantly the transparent neutral water remained in a stable spherical state without significant change δwca 6 18 from 1 0 to 5 0 min indicating strong superhydrophobicity and water repellence in addition underwater oil contact angle treatment was also conducted by using smart foam and fabric material as can be seen a red dyed chloroform droplet was gradually dropped on the material surface with a spherical state displaying great superoleophobicity in acidic basic solution in other words the material has clearly shown that the surface wettability has been reserved from superhydrophobic superoleophylic to superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic features due to the external ph stimuli in short the obtained superwettable fabric possessed a super water repellence in neutral ph and oil repellence in both an acidic and basic environment water and various daily used liquids such as coffee juice milk lemon and tea were also tested for their repellence on the prepared surfaces exhibiting a high static contact angle 150 according to the above mentioned results satisfactory outcomes can be achieved from the smart ph bidirectional responsive materials due to their two required factors which can produce powerful water oil repellence and transformation wettability these factors are mainly ascribed to the synergistic influence of the ph sensitive selection and hierarchal micro nano lumpy structures from the surface area 38 better understanding is urgently needed to be explained from the wetting model for oil and water fig 6a b in these models the external stimuli environment ph is the main parameter to be changed for analyzing the reversible wettability of the developed fabric interestingly it is imperative to note that on the superhydrophobic surfaces the capacity to anticipate unconstrained phase change of the water oil droplets from the cassie baxter to wenzel state is ascribed to the advanced droplet contact on the fabric surface the developed fabric surface can stand for a certain liquid intrusion pressure δp from the droplets which can be estimated by the following equation eq 4 41 4 δp 2 γ r lγ cos θa a where γ is the fluid surface tension r refers to the meniscus radius l and a are the pore perimeter and area and θa refers to the advancing oil or water contact angle on the fabric surface accordingly it can be concluded from the equation that when the water contact angle θa 90 the δp must be higher than 0 indicating a hydrophobic surface and the material can bear a certain pressure of the water droplet 42 in contrast when the oil contact angle θa 90 the δp is 0 indicating an oleophilic surface meaning the fabric is not supporting oil droplet pressure fig 6a so the liquid droplet water oil permeates via the surface of the material 38 herein the water contact angle of the developed smart fabric is 160 in neutral water thus the droplet keeps the stable spherical form on the coated surface nevertheless in corrosive media acidic basic water the contact angle is 0 revealing the good water penetration on the coated surface δp 0 fig 6b after penetration the surface was fulfilled with water resulting in highly hydrophilic behavior and leading to great oil repellence thus oca is 90 153 experimentally and δp 0 thus oil droplets cannot undergo on the material surface in brief these smart materials are efficiently utilized for controllable water oil and emulsion separation tests because of the switchable wettability in fig 6c d it was significantly explained that the transition wettability of the smart fabric from the superhydrophilicity ph 1 and 13 wca 15 0 to superhydrophobicity ph 7 wca 165 149 would be repeated 20 times to observe the switchability between two sides ph 1 to ph 7 and ph 13 to ph 7 solution these patterns showed that the changed fabric had a consistent ph responsiveness fig 7 displayed a 5 μl droplet of different ph of water and oil tested for measuring interfacial tension between droplet and fabric surface area both in air and underwater treatment at the beginning of the tests the spherical state of the droplets appeared from the pipette mouth before contacting the fabric surface water and oil droplets were then pressed to the surface area for some time and after that released again interestingly neutral water droplet and oil droplet underwater treatment were showing amazing superhydrophobicity and underwater superhydrophilicity respectively they refused to contact with the surface and returned to the pipette mouth back while the shape and size of the droplet stayed the same on the contrary acidic and basic water droplets in the air were rapidly attaching to the fabric surface and refused to return to the pipette owing to their highly superhydrophilicity 3 5 oil removal and ternary oil water oil mixture emulsion systems since the modified fabric showed satisfactory superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity in air and neutral water several evaluations are crucially needed to be demonstrated for the performance assessment the superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties of the smart fabric were successfully conducted for capturing the oil phase from water fig 8a displays the results of oil removal applied for oil water mixtures separation under various ph water solutions as can be seen the dyed chloroform was dropped into the dyed water undyed ph 7 blue dyed ph 1 and orange dyed ph 13 it was selected as a high density organic solvent for easy observation which sank under the water surface when the modified fabric was placed in different concentrations of water different observations of the chloroform droplets were investigated in a neutral water system chloroform was spontaneously absorbed into the fabric without any residual within few seconds while water was repelled outside the foams in contrast chloroform was repelled and refused to permeate inside the fabric surface due to its underwater superoleophobic in the acidic and basic water system the modified fabric has outstanding superhydrophilicity superoleophilicity in neutral water and superhydrophilicity superoleophobicity in acidic basic water according to these findings furthermore the complex oil water emulsion was investigated to assess its ph responsive sensitive separation capability providing massive importance for the application by mixing the surfactant emulsion with the hexane water system the corresponding separation process was depicted in fig 8b in this work when the 40 ml of hexane in water emulsion ph 13 and water in hexane emulsion ph 7 was added to the filtration system the continuous water and oil phase in the emulsion were permeated through the smart fabric surface into the graduated cylinder this phenomenon would induce a switch surface wettability from superhydrophobicity into superhydrophilicity due to the basic environment for hexane in water emulsion however no wettability changes for water in hexane due to its original superhydrophobicity a clear transparent filtrate could be observed after a few minutes of the separation process from milky emulsion which could be confirmed under microscopic measurement it was found that before separation lots of tiny spherical oil droplets and surfactant nanometer sizes 20 30 nm were spreading in emulsion feed in contrast after separation there were no visible oil and water droplets that could be observed in filtrate optical images indicating successful emulsion separation tests for further assessment of the materials separation ability a complex oil water separation experiment was carried out by a gravity driven method 43 simple device for continuous oil water separation was designed to manifest the complex oil water separation process with a graduated cylinder and funnel fig 9a b by fixing the smart fabric inside the cone funnel connected to the cylinder the 30 ml mixtures of chloroform water were poured inside the system to let the heavy oil permeate due to its original superhydrophobicity behavior within a few seconds all the chloroform phases orange dyed were separated and penetrated into the cylinder the remaining blocked 15 ml neutral water phases were then added by 15 ml orange dyed n hexane to let the hexane into the above surface of the new system moreover different water concentrations were added to switch the fabric wettability into superhydrophilicity acidic water blue and basic water pink by adding 15 ml water ph 1 into the hexane water mixture the final water ph would be 1 7 indicating an acid environment similarly 15 ml red dyed water ph 13 was added into the hexane water mixture the final water ph would be 12 7 indicating a basic environment as a result the fabric immediately converted its wettability to absorb the acidic and basic water in the cylinder when the superhydrophilicity feature was achieved by acid and basic conditions the upper n hexane was reserved in the funnel to separate the oil from the new oil water system so all components of the complicated systems were effectively separated by smart fabric indicating the superior separation of oil water the whole separation process was simply conducted without any force furthermore the developed ph bidirectional responsive superwetting fabrics can be used for the separation of other types of acidic basic water low density as well as high density oil organic solvents like heptane toluene dichloromethane and tetrachloromethane this fabric capability can be occurred due to its easy reversibility between superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity for oil absorption and superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophilicity for corrosive water concentration the separation efficiency of the various solvents was tested over 20 cycles as shown in fig 9c more importantly their efficiency to separate between oil and water mixture was still 97 5 which was a successful result given from the smart fabric at the same time the separation flux of the low and high density oils exceeded 7400 l m 2 h 1 and 8200 l m 2 h 1 which was a satisfactory outcome fig 9d high density oil had a greater flux than low density due to its higher absorption quality when in contact with the fabric surfaces whereas for acidic and basic water separation the separation flux surpassed 6399 l m 2 h 1 and 5400 l m 2 h 1 indicated a lower result than oil flux for the emulsion test between oil water as well as water oil emulsion the separation flux of low and high density oils acidic and basic water exceeded 6500 l m 2 h 1 7600 l m 2 h 1 5500 l m 2 h 1 and 4800 l m 2 h 1 respectively with exceeding 97 separation efficiency this oil water emulsion owe results displayed a slightly lower value of the flux and separation efficacy than the oil water mixture owm due to the interference of the surfactant overall the results show that the as synthesized stable ph responsive superwetting fabrics can be used in real world oil water applications 3 6 test of mechanical durability due to their crucial request for a long service time mechanical durability as well as chemical stability tests of the smart materials have gained extensive concern due to their indispensable factor in practical application the obtained material should maintain a great result after several harsh interferences to keep its performance for evaluating mechanical durability and chemical stability the abrasion and nacl salt resistance were required to be measured as depicted in fig 10a the smart fabric was placed on 600 grits sandpaper under several weights 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1kg on the top surface fig 20a after placing weights the fabric was clamped by a tweezer and pulled at 2 0 cm s speed until reaching 100 cm for the final distance the wca was observed on the smart fabric surface by dropping water droplets at each 10 cm distance to assess its wettability the wca of the fabric was around 165 before pulling the weights 0 cm and it degraded gradually each cycle to the final wca at 155 100 g weight 148 200 g weight 145 500 g weight 140 1000 g weight fig 10b in the other words the wca degradation varied by the weight mass only about 10 25 during the whole pulling process and still maintained a great superhydrophobicity despite such a long distance abrasion moreover apart from robust durability corrosive interferences are also likely to suffer from a high salinity environment to applying superwetting materials in surface corrosion prevention 44 hence the developed material was also immersed in various concentration of sodium chloride 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 for 2 h to assess salt resistance similarly the wcas of the smart fabrics was measured and found that the contact angles were not significantly changed exhibiting good water repellence and superhydrophobicity in high salinity condition the wca values were slightly reduced by increasing nacl concentration about 2 4 was decreased by enhancing 5 of each nacl concentration fig 10c the wca of the fabric was around 167 0 nacl and it degraded slowly by increasing each 5 nacl where wca was at 158 5 nacl 155 10 nacl 154 15 nacl 152 20 nacl 150 25 nacl 146 30 nacl and 145 35 nacl unavoidably the rough structure s surface of the fabrics could be damaged and the wettability efficiency could be reduced under these severe conditions mechanical abrasion wear and salt immersion interestingly the results of the above explained two severe tests presented that the smart fabric possessed satisfactory mechanical durability as well as favourable chemical stability tests these phenomena confirmed that all chemical reactions were strongly bonded on the fabric surface 3 7 buoyancy and loading capacity test inspired by daily life we can find such as surfing boards and water striders they can float slide and even jump flexibly on the water surface amazingly because of their unique superhydrophobicity structure they can support about 10 15 times of body weight showing outstanding loading capacity from one leg which is composed of millions of same way micro nano structure bristles 45 46 taking advantage of this phenomenon some working devices on the water surface can serve favourable properties to considerably increase buoyancy and decrease water or oil resistance to observe the buoyancy and capacity of the smart fabrics on water glass filter paper and modified fabric were typically used at various substrates they were cut to a rectangular shape and kept inside the water surface after that blue dyed water droplets and orange dyed oil droplets were dropped on the surface fig 11a the spherical drops of water were stably found while oil drops were immediately absorbed and flat out on the surface which possessed outstanding water repellence furthermore the prepared fabrics were gently placed in the middle of the disk containing water and oil for further loading capacity determination fig 11b as explained in a model fig 11c although their densities are relatively higher than oil the coated glass fabric and filter paper have shown their maximum carrying capacity of 1 50 g 5 70 g and 9 40 g which steadily float on the oil surface likewise the coated glass filter paper and fabric have displayed their maximum loading capacity of 2 60 g 9 50 g and 13 10 g floating on the water surface which was primarily because of the high wca greater surface tension and high density 72 8 mn m 1 of water fig 11d this behavior of water could give a greater supporting force to the modified samples resulting in higher loading capacity in comparison to the oil 47 49 all of such results show that the synthesized smart fabric material exhibited outstanding buoyancy and loading capacity which is potentially needed in practical application 4 conclusion to sum up the simple modified smart fabric was attained with multiple brilliant performances such as two directional switchable wettability favourable durability and stability greater separation efficiency and wastewater purification the convenient fabrication has been successfully presented via the monomers polymerization as a result of the external stimuli or ph the developed fabric exhibited a flexible bidirectional wettability from inside either under acidic or basic concentration from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity this showed high mechanical durability in addition to good chemical stability against rigorous mechanical abrasion and high salt concentration it was competent to separate complicated oil water in long term applicability with high oil and water flux and separation efficacy 97 moreover due to the superior oil and water repellence the smart fabric also could carry high weights floating stably onto water and oil surfaces with satisfactory buoyancy and loading capacity to show both theoretical and practical significance based on the above mentioned performances the smart ph bidirectional responsive superwetting fabrics will grab significant prospects in multiple fields specifically for oil spills clean up wastewater remediation multi organic component separation

nanoparticles with smart surfaces adaptably transform wettability in mutual directions between the superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and the superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity depending on the ph the smart material fabrication was prepared by immersing the fabric in aa co vtes zno composite a and aptes fots zno composite b reactions the material was synthesized by free radical polymerization characterization by ftir and sem edx explained that the chemical compositions were uniformly distributed through the smart fabric surface caused by the strong chelating bond between the hydroxide carboxylates and silane active surfaces the chemical stability mechanical durability and separation test results revealed selective separation efficiency for oil water separation with efficacy 99 and high satisfactory oil flux 7000 8000 l h 1 m 2 and water flux 5500 6500 l h 1 m 2 moreover the water contact angle wca for neutral water was showing at 167 indicating powerful superhydrophobic properties and for acidic basic water was absorbing from 143 153 to 0 over time indicating superhydrophylic properties underwater treatment showed that the smart fabric has superoleophobic behavior with around 150 oil contact angle oac various weights and nacl immersion tests also have been applied for mechanical and chemical stability tests the results displayed brilliant stability under severe conditions confirming great wca after repeating and increasing mass and concentration for oil removal and emulsion test dyed oil was rapidly absorbed within 2 s and oil water emulsions were easily separated by developed fabric with a good flux and separation efficacy of over 97 interestingly the prepared materials can also be efficiently and continuously separated for complicated oil water oil mixtures without particular treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cleaner environment multifunctional materials ph responsive wastewater separation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction oil spills have raised global problems owing to their huge discharge in industrial fields as well as oily wastewater contaminant 1 during the rapid improvement of the economy these environmental issues are acquiring more critical and severe accidents caused by many chemical leakages 2 human health and ecological environment threats will be the tremendous effects since wastewater containing oil and organic contaminant play a dominant catastrophe 3 yearly million tonnes of crude oils are discharged into marine fields therefore many studies and methods have been proposed to solve these areas to get rid of the current situation 4 the available oil water separation approaches such as centrifugation absorption and filtration cannot be utilized for these intractable and large scale issues 5 6 nevertheless these methods are facing limitations such as time consuming and high cost for reagents which are practically restricted for larger industrial applications 7 furthermore these methods also cannot be used for controlling the wettability between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity in one material promising membrane separation methods are widely applied for oil water separation however the complex components of the contaminations in industrial wastewater can be harmful and detrimental to human beings and the environment since numerous printing dyeing and bacteria are non biodegradable highly toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic features 8 9 current ongoing solution includes the design of smart switchable super wetting materials which are practically acting as water absorbing and oil absorbing materials in various environments and separation forms 10 11 water absorbing feature mainly has superhydrophylic superoleophobic behavior in air and underwater treatment 12 while the oil absorbing feature has superhydrophobic superoleophilic behavior in air and underwater 13 because their surface wettability can be switched depending on the environmental concentration these simple fabrication of material wettability are strongly immutable over time 14 based on interfacial science smart superwettable materials with diverse wettability for water and oil absorption have proposed a facile and effective innovation for this current environmental issue 15 predictably this excellent material for oil water separation has highly sustainable and controllable features due to the easiness of reversing from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity in response to various conditions including temperature ph light forces electric field and magnetic field 16 19 due to the simple and rapid response mechanism ph responsive materials are the most common way to develop smart superwettable materials 20 besides for academic and industrial purposes ph responsive super wetting materials have gradually risen the attention up because of their convenient operation extreme wettability and easy equipment without spending high cost for further modification 21 their surface area has specific functional groups carboxyl sulfonate amine long organic branch and hydroxyl which can be either protonated becoming a positive charge or deprotonated becoming a negative charge depending on the aqueous solution concentration 22 this phenomenon typically happened with various ph solutions to get controllable and switchable surface wettability properties on smart ph responsive materials researchers in this field have spent more concern on developing smart ph responsive material with controllable superhydrophilic superoleophobic property 23 in case when oil water system reached the super wetting hydrophilic surface the water phase can rapidly absorb and penetrate through the material while oil completely blocked the surface on the other hand when the oil water mixture reached a super wetting hydrophobic surface the water phase was blocked and oil could penetrate through the fabric surface therefore smart ph responsive material can be a promising fabrication that protects from any contamination pollution of oil during the separation process 24 recently smart ph responsive materials were prepared via acrylic acid and acrylic amide grafted on cellulose membrane which showed high oil separation 24 qu et al also reported their fabrication by combining methyl methacrylate trimethoxysilyl propyl acrylate and aptes silica nanoparticles on fabric surfaces used for efficient in situ separation of multiphase oil water 25 jiao et al presented their work by depositing magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles and long organic branch dodecylamine dda functionalized tio2 on the top fabric surface which possessed outstanding separation efficiency and high flux rate 26 one of the proposed solutions is the fabrication of ph responsive materials that remained challenged which only contained a single response either acidic sensitive amine nitrogen group or basic sensitive carboxylic group for this case the smart surfaces can operate wettability transformation in one direction which highly limited the broad application in the actual problem 27 thus for the new generation of smart ph responsive material it is highly required to combine the carboxyl containing group and amine nitrogen containing group to restore the original surface wettability this method can flexibly switch wettability on both sides alkaline and acidic and increase the usage of the smart material with low cost convenience and environmentally friendly 28 29 herein a novel smart ph bidirectional responsive nanocomposite via a facile strategy which can be continuously repeated with outstanding durable recyclability without fouling typically aa co vtes zno composite a which was first synthesized acted as a carboxyl containing group and combined with aptes fots zno composite b which acted as an amine nitrogen containing group and fluorine rich compound as a superhydrophobic side by adjusting the ph concentration from the neutral condition the acidic and basic solution will transform the initial superhydrophobic superoleophilic features into superhydrophilicity superoleophobicity within a short time moreover the objective of this work is to develop fabrics that can maintain remarkable mechanical and chemical durability and stability under severe media by displaying an adequate water contact angle wca after repeating it many times this great water repellence in the neutral solution can take some amount of weight floating on the water taking advantage of the elaborate structure of the rough hierarchical structure smart ph bidirectional responsive fabric exhibits outstanding ph induced switchable superwettability which can be considered a most promising smart material in both practical and scientific applications in the future the prospects of this material can be applied to many industrial issues such as organic component separation oil water separation and dyes bacteria removal under a harsh and complex environment which are urgently needed to be solved 2 materials and methods 2 1 material acrylic acid aa 99 vinyltriethoxysilane

chloroform and tetrachloromethane were attained from fluka the reagents were of analytical grade and utilized as received non woven fabrics detergents olive oil and various daily beverages were purchased from a local market 2 2 fabric pre treatment to begin with the non woven fabric was cut into 2 2 cm 5 pieces and ultrasonically washed with ethanol deionized water and acetone for 1 h at 50 c the as cleaned fabric with the hierarchical rough surface structures was dried before continuing to another treatment then the dried fabric was immersed in mixed aqueous solutions of 0 1 m nh4 2s2o8 and 2 5 m naoh for around 1 h at rt then the etched fabrics were rinsed with distilled water again and kept to dry at 50 c 30 2 3 synthesis of aa co vtes and aa co vtes zno responsive copolymers firstly 0 05 g aibn was dissolved in 30 ml toluene with the ultrasonic condition for 1 h at 50 c to let them be homogenous after that 1 5 g vtes and 1 5 g aa were introduced to the previous solution and stirred for 10 h at 70 c to carry the free radical copolymerization the precipitated result aa co vtes was centrifugated washed with hexane dried at 50 c and used for further modification furthermore 0 5 g aa co vtes copolymer was dissolved ultrasonically with 30 ml absolute ethanol lastly 0 4 g zno nanoparticle after being pretreated with naoh was poured in the solution and vigorously stirred for about 5 h at 70 c to let the copolymer be modified on the zno surface composite a 2 4 preparation of smart ph bidirectional responsive superwetting surfaces for further steps 1 0 ml aptes

fots zn composite b after all the as prepared fabric and composite b were slowly put onto the composite a solution continued by stirring for 6 h at 60 c the modified fabrics were cleaned with deionized water and kept to dry at about 85 c to completely generate smart ph bidirectional responsive fabric 2 5 characterization numerous measurements of characterizations were applied for characterizing the as developed smart fabric nanocomposites hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and surface wettability of the obtained materials were characterized by contact angle ca analyzer using attension theta optical tensiometer biolin scientific finland with 5 μl droplet of deionized water and oil at room temperature accuracy is 1 the optical images were taken by an instrument digital camera scanning electron microscope sem tescan lyra 3 dual beam tescan coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx oxford instruments were achieved to detect morphology of the modified

groups observation was collected by fourier transform infrared ftir spectra smart itr nicolet is10 in wavelength range of 400 to 4000 cm 1 with 64 scans and 32 cm 1 resolution the samples were

surfaces up to 5000 magnifications the digital images of materials are captured by the charge coupled device ccd camera which shows the images on a computer screen for additional analysis 2 6 oil absorption capacity and oil water mixture separation test oil absorption capacity will be performed in six different types of oil compounds there are heptane toluene olive oil dichloromethane and tetrachloromethane typically 40 ml of each oil volume was added into a 100 ml beaker that contains 20 ml of deionized water then 0 06 g absorbent was put inside the beaker the beaker was left for 2 min to let the fabric absorb the oil after treatment the absorbent was removed spontaneously from the beaker followed by measuring the current weight to determine the oil absorption capacity ca lastly the weighted fabric of the absorbed oil will be considered as wt the initial weight of the fabric wo and the oil absorbed wt wo so the formula was expressed using the following eq 1 the whole treatment will be assigned as 1 cycle after that the test was repeated for 20 consecutive cycles 1 ca wt wo wo 2 7 separation efficiency and flux the separation efficiency sef test has been evaluated where mo is the initial mass of the oil and mt is the final mass of the oil after the separation test generally 10 ml of dyed water and oil were prepared in the beaker obtaining two separated layers then the modified material was inserted inside the funnel hole followed by pouring the particular solution into it the separation efficacy was computed by eq 2 moreover the oil water permeate flux was displayed in eq 3 2 sef mt mo x 100 3 flux v a x δt where v l represents the volume of oil water used which permeates across the a m2 area of fabric surface in δt time h 2 8 oil water emulsion separation test various organic solvents such as hexane heptane toluene dichloromethane and tetrachloromethane around 5 ml were introduced into 35 ml of acidic and basic aqueous media with 10 mg of detergent as an emulsifier in order to make oil water emulsion in shear stirring for 20 min the prepared emulsion was applied for evaluating the efficiency of smart fabric in the separation of oil water the oil and water flux of the smart fabric was assessed by a gravity driven filtration the change in the permeate flux corresponded to time and was considered by eq 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 smart ph bidirectional responsive material the ph sensitive chemicals low surface energy material and micro nano hierarchical rough structures are mostly prominent substances for realizing the switchable wettability of smart materials 31 32 in fig 1a the synthesis of aa co vtes zno which is used as a basic sensitive co polymer was prepared by the free radical polymerization with aibn initiator both highly reactive double bonds from aa and vtes could easily react to each other to create aa co vtes after initiator addition the prepared zno nanoparticle was attached to the center of the copolymer aa co vtes chain and could expand with more oh groups onto the zinc surface to form zno bonds as a core furthermore the free carboxylic groups which come from acrylic acid aa were extended outside on the top surface for the basic sensitive group while the remaining silane groups displayed from vtes would be connected to the zno nanoparticle after hydrolysis treatment with water therefore the as prepared copolymer composite a was successfully synthesized with the rough surface for further obtaining the superhydrophilic wettability that can be absorbed in water additionally zno nanoparticle was also modified with aptes for the acidic sensitive group and fots for the superhydrophobic agent in ph neutral conditions in fig 1b due to a large number of the hydroxyl group oh on zno it could be simply connected to the both organosilane agents aptes and fots after hydrolysis treatment the high surface energy of the hydroxyl groups presents that a small amount of water molecules h2o are connected to the fabric surface interestingly the resulted aptes fots zno composite b has two major sensitive groups both superhydrophilic due to the amine branch and superhydrophobic due to the fluorine rich compound to realize the ph bidirectional responsive fabric composite a and composite b were mixed on the top of pre treated fabric constituting the micro nano scale and rough structure of the resulted modification the resultant smart fabric was capable of making two direction wettability conversion from either neutral to acidic and neutral to basic from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity which mainly attributed to amine and carboxyl group existence respectively on the other hand fluorine rich chemical substance fots was selected as a strong superhydrophobic agent in neutral conditions due to its low surface energy it was worthy to note that both amine and the carboxylic group could remain stable leading to the surface energy reduction after protonation becoming ammonium ions nh3 and deprotonation becoming carboxylate anions coo with low and high ph solution respectively these phenomena appeared to switchable superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity in a short time without any specific remediation more surprisingly the obtained solution between a and b composites can be also used for further fabric preparation to obtain smart surface materials even 20 times without new preparation due to their powerful silane functional groups embedded into the zinc nanoparticles it also needs heat and ultrasonication energy to approach the organosilane functional groups as described in fig 2 the detailed synthesis steps were schematically shown in fig 2a the pristine fabric was washed with distilled water ethanol and acetone and etched by mixed naoh nh4 2s2o8 solution for 1 h this treatment was importantly carried out for fabric surface activation to obtain low surface energy the physical cleaning step would remove any impurities on the fabric while the alkaline pre treatment step would replace an old surface oxide with a more reactive layer and increase functional groups such as oh nh2 and cooh after the rough surface area construction the pre treated fabric was then refluxed with composite a to obtain a carboxylic cooh branch on the top fabric surface finally composite b was added to the above solution containing fabric to introduce the fluorine superhydrophobic agent f and amine nh2 on the rough nanoneedles smart fabric surface through the dip coating method due to its simple fabrication dip coating is the most universally used technique for achieving superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic on the material surface 33 the dip coating method exhibits an excellent fouling resistance by depositing a thin layer on the fabric pores additionally superhydrophobic superoleophilic feature of the fabric is attained via the corresponding effect of chemistry as well as surface mechanics stimulated by the anti wetting phenomenon of water droplets 34 thus introducing a superhydrophobic superoleophilic layer on the porous fabric via a combination of chemistry as well as hierarchical structures is a capable method for achieving high separation efficiency in oil water separation applications besides the mechanism of smart ph bidirectional responsive fabrics was explained in fig 2b beginning from the neutral condition ph 7 the amine group grafted onto the fabric was protonated after acidic treatment ph 1 the lone pair from the amine group nh2 is very reactive to attack h in an acidic solution to produce ammonium ions nh3 such ionic moieties establish strong hydrogen bond interaction with water h2o and replace the fluorine rich chain dominance 29 as a result the surface polarity of the material increased and the wettability of the surface was switched from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity into superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity 35 to return to the initial behavior the h from ammonium ions was deprotonated and captured by k2hpo4 when the smart surface was dipped in a buffer of ph 7 consequently the smart fabric was restored to its original behavior as superhydrophobic superoleophilic property on the other hand h ions from the cooh react with basic oh ions to perform h2o and the carboxyl group would become carboxylate group coo when the material was dipped in a basic aqueous media this carboxylate group coo would replace the fluorine rich chain dominance and allow the smart material to retain superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity due to surface polarity increase dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 was also used for returning its original superhydrophobicity by immersing the particular fabric into a buffer ph 7 solution by reacting free h with the carboxylate group this mechanism revealed the flexible wettability transformation in the entire ph range which can be beneficial for the multiorganic and complicated oil water separation 31 to conclude the significant transformation into two side superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity was mainly attributed to the amine protonation and carboxyl groups deprotonation whereas superhydrophobic superoleophilic property can be returned because of amine deprotonation and carboxyl groups protonation 29 3 2 ftir and sem edx results ftir measurements were analyzed to confirm the chemical composition and functional groups of the pristine fabric copolymers and the final modified fabric in fig 3a it could be investigated from the fabric composite modification that there are eight dominant peaks shown on the transmission spectra eight peaks at 570 796 1173 1355 1667 1730 2920 and 3475 3350 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of zno nanoparticle bond sio silane bond sic c o c c c o zn co ch3 ch2 and oh nh 36 37 specifically doublet peaks is containing two joining bands of the co and cc at 1355 cm 1 after modification besides the ftir spectra of the non fabric preparation were also observed in fig 3b there are several peaks displayed at 570 796 1173 1355 1667 2920 and 3475 3350 cm 1 are corresponded to the stretching vibration of zno nanoparticle bond sio silane bond sic c o c c co ch3 ch2 and oh nh it could be found that the composite a and b spectra were significantly different in comparison to the full composite spectra the appearance of these peaks would confirm the chemical reaction on the modified particle surface of the smart material more importantly the characteristic peaks of the co bond due to cooh adsorption and nh from free amines at 1667 cm 1 and 3475 3350 cm 1 are conforming to the successful synthesis of the basic and acid sensitive the smart fabric surface for further 3d rough network observation the surface morphological structure and elemental composition information of the smart ph bidirectional responsive surface were investigated by sem and edx spectroscopy in fig 3c f the original fabric displayed the fiber surface was a smooth and porous surface structure in which every fiber was connected to another network structure fig 3c for the modified smart fabric its morphology displayed that the micro nano scale of the zno nanoparticle anchored through the fibers fig 3d after being functionalized the skeleton roughness and agglomeration appear in the micro nano level structure indicating all the loaded chemicals have been uniformly distributed fig 3e f furthermore edx measurement displayed that the elements were uniformly dispersed onto the fabric surfaces area showing that the fabric was modified with the particular substances the rough surface created by such materials led to a surface with high superhydrophobicity features 3 3 oil and water absorption capacity test for further versatility investigation the ph bidirectional responsive superwetting material was dipped into the prepared solution containing water and various organic solvent water and oil such as heptane toluene olive oil water dichloromethane and tetrachloromethane these chosen liquids were selected based on their density from below up to above 1 0 g ml to understand the density effect owing to its outstanding superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity in air and neutral water it could be utilized for absorbing and removing contaminative and poisonous floating oil below or above the water surface such phenomena are explained when the oil is absorbed into the superhydrophobic superoleophilic material it is filled in the small pores to attain the aim of absorbing oil selectively while repelling water 38 after being immersed the fabric would immediately absorb the oil and the final mass of the fabric was containing the absorbed oil mass after 1 2 min of absorption the fabric will be removed for drying weighing and squeezed until 20 repeated cycles fig 4a b displays the various absorption capacity data in 20 cycles of the modified fabric for different oils and low and high density organic solvents according to the data it was found that the smallest capacity was for heptane which was around 11 12 times fabric weight due to its rapid solvent evaporation on the other side the highest capacity was for tetrachloromethane which was around 18 19 times as much as the fabric s weight after immersing the fabric in the acidic basic media the behavior from superhydrophobicity was changed into superhydrophilicity used for water absorption for the water absorption capacity test the value was ranging from 15 to 16 g g without no obvious decline after 20 cycles and the underwater oca of its surface was maintained above 150 as given in table 1 these observed data varied based on the density as well as the viscosity of the used solvent for instance the density and viscosity of the dichloromethane are relatively high so the fabric attraction to absorb dichloromethane will also be larger than in other oils which the density and viscosity under dichloromethane furthermore absorption capacity data for the smart material still maintained a high capacity and did not significantly change even until 20 cycles wca value maintained around 160 these good reusability results revealed that the smart material possessed an excellent and promising application in larger oil water separation purposes 3 4 switchable surface wettability generally the appropriate chemical composition of the smart stimuli responsiveness wettability is essential to be discussed to create uniform rough morphology material 32 to get the efficient relative volume comparison of aptes and fots some needed experiments have been done for volume ratio aptes fots 1 1 3 2 2 1 5 2 3 1 7 2 and 4 1 the effect on the ph responsiveness and surface wetting behaviors play an important role in the wettability and optimum water contact angle from different ph solutions fig 5a showed the water contact angle wca as well as oil contact angle oca of the resulted superwettable fabric after 3 min treatment with ph 1 ph 7 and ph 13 water solution the graph displayed that the fabric has a prominent superhydrophobicity condition wca 150 ph 7 and superhydrophilicity wca 0 ph 1 and 13 when the volume proportion was 3 1 it can be found when the volume ratio was lower than 3 1 the long fluorine rich chains performed a dominant role in governing the wettability and displayed a powerful hydrophobicity for different ph solutions while the function of the amine group was weakened it can also be seen that even in ph 1 and ph 13 solutions the wca showed high contact angle which was not profitable for oil water separation and smart fabric behavior furthermore when the volume ratio was higher than 3 1 the primary amines would deteriorate and predominate over the long fluorine rich chain resulting in weakened hydrophobicity wca 140 for confirming the excellent reversible wettability alteration of the as formed ph bidirectional responsive superwetting material variation wettability of the water and oil are significantly important to be evaluated as shown in fig 5b neutral water and various daily liquids were tested onto modified fabric with stable spherical shapes indicating strong superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity in the air at the same time when the fabric was soaked under acidic basic water several oil and organic solvents dichloromethane tetrachloromethane n hexane toluene olive oil and lubricating oil were also analyzed then displayed great superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity oca 150 which remain stable spherical shape onto the surface of the prepared fabric fig 5e the sliding angle image also showed a great underwater superoleophobicity for chloroform droplets since it can be quickly rolled with a sliding angle of 4 in a few milliseconds interestingly when the oil jet was sprayed to the material surface all the droplets from the syringe were spread out and refused to contact the coated surface subsequently when the material was dipped in the buffer ph 7 solution dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 the smart fabric surface wettability did recover to the original superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity fig 5g the surface wettability performance of the developed material is a significant feature for practical oil water separation 39 40 in fig 5c and f acidic droplet ph 1 blue dyed neutral water droplet ph 7 and basic water droplet ph 13 orange dyed were slowly dropped around 5 μl on pure unmodified fabric and the smart fabric surfaces as can be seen for pure fabric all the water droplets from various ph were rapidly permeated on the surface within 2 s due to its highly hydrophylic features on the contrary for developed smart fabric it is observed that the three water droplets preserved spherical states at the beginning of the procedure fig 5i nevertheless after 20 s the blue dyed acidic water droplet gradually penetrated through the surface and absorbed completely in 1 min whereas the basic water droplet remained in a spherical state furthermore after 100 s the orange dyed basic water droplet becomes a hemispherical state and is completely absorbed after 200 s more importantly the transparent neutral water remained in a stable spherical state without significant change δwca 6 18 from 1 0 to 5 0 min indicating strong superhydrophobicity and water repellence in addition underwater oil contact angle treatment was also conducted by using smart foam and fabric material as can be seen a red dyed chloroform droplet was gradually dropped on the material surface with a spherical state displaying great superoleophobicity in acidic basic solution in other words the material has clearly shown that the surface wettability has been reserved from superhydrophobic superoleophylic to superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic features due to the external ph stimuli in short the obtained superwettable fabric possessed a super water repellence in neutral ph and oil repellence in both an acidic and basic environment water and various daily used liquids such as coffee juice milk lemon and tea were also tested for their repellence on the prepared surfaces exhibiting a high static contact angle 150 according to the above mentioned results satisfactory outcomes can be achieved from the smart ph bidirectional responsive materials due to their two required factors which can produce powerful water oil repellence and transformation wettability these factors are mainly ascribed to the synergistic influence of the ph sensitive selection and hierarchal micro nano lumpy structures from the surface area 38 better understanding is urgently needed to be explained from the wetting model for oil and water fig 6a b in these models the external stimuli environment ph is the main parameter to be changed for analyzing the reversible wettability of the developed fabric interestingly it is imperative to note that on the superhydrophobic surfaces the capacity to anticipate unconstrained phase change of the water oil droplets from the cassie baxter to wenzel state is ascribed to the advanced droplet contact on the fabric surface the developed fabric surface can stand for a certain liquid intrusion pressure δp from the droplets which can be estimated by the following equation eq 4 41 4 δp 2 γ r lγ cos θa a where γ is the fluid surface tension r refers to the meniscus radius l and a are the pore perimeter and area and θa refers to the advancing oil or water contact angle on the fabric surface accordingly it can be concluded from the equation that when the water contact angle θa 90 the δp must be higher than 0 indicating a hydrophobic surface and the material can bear a certain pressure of the water droplet 42 in contrast when the oil contact angle θa 90 the δp is 0 indicating an oleophilic surface meaning the fabric is not supporting oil droplet pressure fig 6a so the liquid droplet water oil permeates via the surface of the material 38 herein the water contact angle of the developed smart fabric is 160 in neutral water thus the droplet keeps the stable spherical form on the coated surface nevertheless in corrosive media acidic basic water the contact angle is 0 revealing the good water penetration on the coated surface δp 0 fig 6b after penetration the surface was fulfilled with water resulting in highly hydrophilic behavior and leading to great oil repellence thus oca is 90 153 experimentally and δp 0 thus oil droplets cannot undergo on the material surface in brief these smart materials are efficiently utilized for controllable water oil and emulsion separation tests because of the switchable wettability in fig 6c d it was significantly explained that the transition wettability of the smart fabric from the superhydrophilicity ph 1 and 13 wca 15 0 to superhydrophobicity ph 7 wca 165 149 would be repeated 20 times to observe the switchability between two sides ph 1 to ph 7 and ph 13 to ph 7 solution these patterns showed that the changed fabric had a consistent ph responsiveness fig 7 displayed a 5 μl droplet of different ph of water and oil tested for measuring interfacial tension between droplet and fabric surface area both in air and underwater treatment at the beginning of the tests the spherical state of the droplets appeared from the pipette mouth before contacting the fabric surface water and oil droplets were then pressed to the surface area for some time and after that released again interestingly neutral water droplet and oil droplet underwater treatment were showing amazing superhydrophobicity and underwater superhydrophilicity respectively they refused to contact with the surface and returned to the pipette mouth back while the shape and size of the droplet stayed the same on the contrary acidic and basic water droplets in the air were rapidly attaching to the fabric surface and refused to return to the pipette owing to their highly superhydrophilicity 3 5 oil removal and ternary oil water oil mixture emulsion systems since the modified fabric showed satisfactory superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity in air and neutral water several evaluations are crucially needed to be demonstrated for the performance assessment the superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties of the smart fabric were successfully conducted for capturing the oil phase from water fig 8a displays the results of oil removal applied for oil water mixtures separation under various ph water solutions as can be seen the dyed chloroform was dropped into the dyed water undyed ph 7 blue dyed ph 1 and orange dyed ph 13 it was selected as a high density organic solvent for easy observation which sank under the water surface when the modified fabric was placed in different concentrations of water different observations of the chloroform droplets were investigated in a neutral water system chloroform was spontaneously absorbed into the fabric without any residual within few seconds while water was repelled outside the foams in contrast chloroform was repelled and refused to permeate inside the fabric surface due to its underwater superoleophobic in the acidic and basic water system the modified fabric has outstanding superhydrophilicity superoleophilicity in neutral water and superhydrophilicity superoleophobicity in acidic basic water according to these findings furthermore the complex oil water emulsion was investigated to assess its ph responsive sensitive separation capability providing massive importance for the application by mixing the surfactant emulsion with the hexane water system the corresponding separation process was depicted in fig 8b in this work when the 40 ml of hexane in water emulsion ph 13 and water in hexane emulsion ph 7 was added to the filtration system the continuous water and oil phase in the emulsion were permeated through the smart fabric surface into the graduated cylinder this phenomenon would induce a switch surface wettability from superhydrophobicity into superhydrophilicity due to the basic environment for hexane in water emulsion however no wettability changes for water in hexane due to its original superhydrophobicity a clear transparent filtrate could be observed after a few minutes of the separation process from milky emulsion which could be confirmed under microscopic measurement it was found that before separation lots of tiny spherical oil droplets and surfactant nanometer sizes 20 30 nm were spreading in emulsion feed in contrast after separation there were no visible oil and water droplets that could be observed in filtrate optical images indicating successful emulsion separation tests for further assessment of the materials separation ability a complex oil water separation experiment was carried out by a gravity driven method 43 simple device for continuous oil water separation was designed to manifest the complex oil water separation process with a graduated cylinder and funnel fig 9a b by fixing the smart fabric inside the cone funnel connected to the cylinder the 30 ml mixtures of chloroform water were poured inside the system to let the heavy oil permeate due to its original superhydrophobicity behavior within a few seconds all the chloroform phases orange dyed were separated and penetrated into the cylinder the remaining blocked 15 ml neutral water phases were then added by 15 ml orange dyed n hexane to let the hexane into the above surface of the new system moreover different water concentrations were added to switch the fabric wettability into superhydrophilicity acidic water blue and basic water pink by adding 15 ml water ph 1 into the hexane water mixture the final water ph would be 1 7 indicating an acid environment similarly 15 ml red dyed water ph 13 was added into the hexane water mixture the final water ph would be 12 7 indicating a basic environment as a result the fabric immediately converted its wettability to absorb the acidic and basic water in the cylinder when the superhydrophilicity feature was achieved by acid and basic conditions the upper n hexane was reserved in the funnel to separate the oil from the new oil water system so all components of the complicated systems were effectively separated by smart fabric indicating the superior separation of oil water the whole separation process was simply conducted without any force furthermore the developed ph bidirectional responsive superwetting fabrics can be used for the separation of other types of acidic basic water low density as well as high density oil organic solvents like heptane toluene dichloromethane and tetrachloromethane this fabric capability can be occurred due to its easy reversibility between superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity for oil absorption and superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophilicity for corrosive water concentration the separation efficiency of the various solvents was tested over 20 cycles as shown in fig 9c more importantly their efficiency to separate between oil and water mixture was still 97 5 which was a successful result given from the smart fabric at the same time the separation flux of the low and high density oils exceeded 7400 l m 2 h 1 and 8200 l m 2 h 1 which was a satisfactory outcome fig 9d high density oil had a greater flux than low density due to its higher absorption quality when in contact with the fabric surfaces whereas for acidic and basic water separation the separation flux surpassed 6399 l m 2 h 1 and 5400 l m 2 h 1 indicated a lower result than oil flux for the emulsion test between oil water as well as water oil emulsion the separation flux of low and high density oils acidic and basic water exceeded 6500 l m 2 h 1 7600 l m 2 h 1 5500 l m 2 h 1 and 4800 l m 2 h 1 respectively with exceeding 97 separation efficiency this oil water emulsion owe results displayed a slightly lower value of the flux and separation efficacy than the oil water mixture owm due to the interference of the surfactant overall the results show that the as synthesized stable ph responsive superwetting fabrics can be used in real world oil water applications 3 6 test of mechanical durability due to their crucial request for a long service time mechanical durability as well as chemical stability tests of the smart materials have gained extensive concern due to their indispensable factor in practical application the obtained material should maintain a great result after several harsh interferences to keep its performance for evaluating mechanical durability and chemical stability the abrasion and nacl salt resistance were required to be measured as depicted in fig 10a the smart fabric was placed on 600 grits sandpaper under several weights 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1kg on the top surface fig 20a after placing weights the fabric was clamped by a tweezer and pulled at 2 0 cm s speed until reaching 100 cm for the final distance the wca was observed on the smart fabric surface by dropping water droplets at each 10 cm distance to assess its wettability the wca of the fabric was around 165 before pulling the weights 0 cm and it degraded gradually each cycle to the final wca at 155 100 g weight 148 200 g weight 145 500 g weight 140 1000 g weight fig 10b in the other words the wca degradation varied by the weight mass only about 10 25 during the whole pulling process and still maintained a great superhydrophobicity despite such a long distance abrasion moreover apart from robust durability corrosive interferences are also likely to suffer from a high salinity environment to applying superwetting materials in surface corrosion prevention 44 hence the developed material was also immersed in various concentration of sodium chloride 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 for 2 h to assess salt resistance similarly the wcas of the smart fabrics was measured and found that the contact angles were not significantly changed exhibiting good water repellence and superhydrophobicity in high salinity condition the wca values were slightly reduced by increasing nacl concentration about 2 4 was decreased by enhancing 5 of each nacl concentration fig 10c the wca of the fabric was around 167 0 nacl and it degraded slowly by increasing each 5 nacl where wca was at 158 5 nacl 155 10 nacl 154 15 nacl 152 20 nacl 150 25 nacl 146 30 nacl and 145 35 nacl unavoidably the rough structure s surface of the fabrics could be damaged and the wettability efficiency could be reduced under these severe conditions mechanical abrasion wear and salt immersion interestingly the results of the above explained two severe tests presented that the smart fabric possessed satisfactory mechanical durability as well as favourable chemical stability tests these phenomena confirmed that all chemical reactions were strongly bonded on the fabric surface 3 7 buoyancy and loading capacity test inspired by daily life we can find such as surfing boards and water striders they can float slide and even jump flexibly on the water surface amazingly because of their unique superhydrophobicity structure they can support about 10 15 times of body weight showing outstanding loading capacity from one leg which is composed of millions of same way micro nano structure bristles 45 46 taking advantage of this phenomenon some working devices on the water surface can serve favourable properties to considerably increase buoyancy and decrease water or oil resistance to observe the buoyancy and capacity of the smart fabrics on water glass filter paper and modified fabric were typically used at various substrates they were cut to a rectangular shape and kept inside the water surface after that blue dyed water droplets and orange dyed oil droplets were dropped on the surface fig 11a the spherical drops of water were stably found while oil drops were immediately absorbed and flat out on the surface which possessed outstanding water repellence furthermore the prepared fabrics were gently placed in the middle of the disk containing water and oil for further loading capacity determination fig 11b as explained in a model fig 11c although their densities are relatively higher than oil the coated glass fabric and filter paper have shown their maximum carrying capacity of 1 50 g 5 70 g and 9 40 g which steadily float on the oil surface likewise the coated glass filter paper and fabric have displayed their maximum loading capacity of 2 60 g 9 50 g and 13 10 g floating on the water surface which was primarily because of the high wca greater surface tension and high density 72 8 mn m 1 of water fig 11d this behavior of water could give a greater supporting force to the modified samples resulting in higher loading capacity in comparison to the oil 47 49 all of such results show that the synthesized smart fabric material exhibited outstanding buoyancy and loading capacity which is potentially needed in practical application 4 conclusion to sum up the simple modified smart fabric was attained with multiple brilliant performances such as two directional switchable wettability favourable durability and stability greater separation efficiency and wastewater purification the convenient fabrication has been successfully presented via the monomers polymerization as a result of the external stimuli or ph the developed fabric exhibited a flexible bidirectional wettability from inside either under acidic or basic concentration from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity this showed high mechanical durability in addition to good chemical stability against rigorous mechanical abrasion and high salt concentration it was competent to separate complicated oil water in long term applicability with high oil and water flux and separation efficacy 97 moreover due to the superior oil and water repellence the smart fabric also could carry high weights floating stably onto water and oil surfaces with satisfactory buoyancy and loading capacity to show both theoretical and practical significance based on the above mentioned performances the smart ph bidirectional responsive superwetting fabrics will grab significant prospects in multiple fields specifically for oil spills clean up wastewater remediation multi organic component separation

world e g usa china and mediterranean basin as case studies of contaminated areas e the relation of occurrences with specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds f the legislation and regulations implemented by countries states governments were summarized and discussed and finally g future perspectives for research on ppcps in the aquatic environment which are explained regarded to the research gaps in current knowledge the findings of this review indicate that the concentrations of ppcps in the influents and effluents of wwtps of the selected regions are much higher than in other water matrices additionally there are significant variations in ppcps concentrations between different countries and regions due to certain reasons graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ppcps aquatic environment characteristics frequently detected compounds legislations and regulations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years many of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have been widely investigated due to their continuous release into aquatic systems and newly developed state of the art analytical techniques ppcps are recognized as emerging contaminants in water resources and considered one of the most hazardous active ingredients of medicinal products used in human and veterinary medicines the occurrence and distribution of ppcps in aquatic environment particularly in tap drinking water surface water groundwater and wastewater have intrigued the scientific community ppcps are natural or synthetic chemicals used in treating and preventing diseases in humans and animals in the form of prescription drugs ppcps are frequently detected in drinking water sewage treatment plants stps wastewater treatment plants wwtps and groundwater 1 2 due to their universal consumption improper manufacturer disposal low human metabolic capability and biologically active structures 3 7 after use the major sources of ppcps in the aquatic systems are mainly via sewage treatment plants stps wwtps effluents landfill leaching improper disposal and manufacturing processes 8 11 usually pharmaceuticals are not completely and accurately eliminated during sewage and wastewater treatment processes therefore they are detected in surface water at concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l the physicochemical properties of many pharmaceutical substances render them not easily to be eliminated by conventional processes as observed by their existence in tap drinking water 12 although most of ppcps are less persistent than legacy persistent organic pollutants many of them are not readily degraded due to the massive discharge rates recently there is growing scientific concern regarding to ppcps occurrence fate and potential effects on the aquatic environment and human health major concern is attributed to their existence in the environment such as endocrine disruptors development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and carcinogenic activity in addition to human risks of long term chronic exposure at trace levels 5 13 14 one of the most problems for the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment maybe lead to the development of new species or strains of microorganism e g bacteria algae fungi and viruses which resist the effects of antibiotics known as antibiotic resistant bacteria 15 currently about 4000 of pharmaceutical substances are accessible in the global markets with annual world consumption of approximately 100 000 tons y 3 in 2010 the growth of antibiotics used for treatment of livestock reached 63 151 tons and is predicted to rise by 67 in 2030 16 from 2000 to 2015 the using of antibiotics in 76 countries were raised by 65 in terms of defined daily doses ddd with about 21 35 billion ddd while the rate of consumption per day increased by 39 17 in china it was reported that the percentage of antibiotics use 41 60 are higher than recommended by the world health organization who 30 18 globally in 2015 antibiotic consumption reached 34 8 billion ddd with an unusual rise of 65 from 2000 that reported 21 1billion ddd 19 in 2020 global medicines use reached 4 5 trillion doses 20 where in this year approximately more than half of the world s population consumed 1 dose person day of drugs this higher consumption rate was reported by china india indonesia and brazil due to their high populations and increasing demand on animal proteins usage of medicines in middle eastern and african countries reached 500 billion doses in 2020 20 the european markets alone contain approximately more than 3000 pharmaceutical substances 21 approximatley 20 of the total world production of ppcps are produced from china appearanltly the majority of counties have a minimal or no specific programs to assess ppcps use in the environment and food products 22 a web of science a tool from clarivate analytics 2022 search performed on july 20 2022 using the keywords of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water resulted in 5077 articles fig 1 presents an analysis of the number of publications on this topic per year with the number of studies on the topic of concern being shown by region combined asia and europe represent more than 72 of the total articles published between 2014 and 2022 whereas china and spain are the most published countries in each continent respectively notably only 4 of published studies originated from africa where south africa is the most published country 37 80 fig 1 this analysis draws an increasing interest from researchers and organizations which implies that more comprehensive studies should be conducted the presence of ppcps and their metabolites in environmental compartments has become a global challenge that requires local and global multi sectors and multi stakeholder approaches to reduce prevent and manage their entry into the environment for example a recent policy aimed to address this issue known as the strategic approach to international chemicals management saicm 23 both the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the european union eu have listed and developed the priority pollutants by identifying a variety of chemicals existed in stormwater runoff and wastewaters that may cause a risk to receiving water matrices the eu water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec in the year 2000 identified the initial list of 33 priority substances to be applied as a control measure for the next two decades 24 in the year 2007 some of ppcps were recognized as future emerging priority substances such as carbamazepine diclofenac musks and iopamidol some other candidates are proposed to be included in this list such as bisphenol a triclosan ibuprofen clofibric acid and phthalates 12 25 owing to the large number and chemical natures of ppcps the environment agency ea of wales and england suggested a ranking system for these compounds based on their relative risk which aimed to identify compounds with a potential to cause a risk to the aquatic ecosystem this proposed ranking system depends on the combining of criteria and procedures such as risk assessment persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity occurrences result from different countries employed analytical methods and concentrations of ppcps from different therapeutic classes 26 in this regard the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north east atlantic ospar commission and dynamic selection and prioritisation mechanism for hazardous substances dynamec provided another list of priority compounds such as trimethoprim tramadol thioridazine tamoxifen sulfamethoxazole procyclidine paracetamol mebeverine lofepramine fluoxetine fenofibrate1 diclofenac clotrimazole and aminophylline according to ospar commission 2002 27 to fill the gap of knowledge this review is critically focused on the following areas a the global occurrence of ppcp residues in aquatic systems particularly in drinking tap water surface water groundwater and wwtps mainly in the period from 2012 to 2022 b widely prescribed pharmaceutical classes such as antibiotics antidepressants β blockers lipid regulators nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids etc due to their potential risk effects on human and wildlife c the spatial distribution of ppcps in water bodies based on recently published data d different regions in the world e g usa china and the mediterranean basin as case studies of contaminated areas e the relations of occurrences with specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds f reviewing the emphasized guidelines and legislations that are implemented by countries states governments to regulate the use and discharge ppcps and finally g future perspectives for research on ppcps in the aquatic systems 1 1 classification of emerging contaminants in this section emerging contaminants are classified into different groups number of groups were varied from reference to another as illustrated in table 1 emerging contaminants includes personal care products pharmaceuticals steroid hormones surfactants and industrial chemicals each group includes subclasses as reported in table 1 1 2 physicochemical properties of ppcps different ppcps possess wide variation in their physical and chemical properties therefore wide behaviour variation could be assumed hydrophobicity water solubility volatility etc which could contribute to ppcps fate occurrence and distribution into the aquatic environment 34 35 additionally dissociation constants pka octanol water partition coefficients log kow organic carbon based sorption coefficients log koc solid water distribution coefficients log kd also influence the fate and behaviour of ppcps by varying partition sorption adsorption biodegradation and photodegradation 34 36 a lot of ppcps have a basic and or acidic functional groups in their structures therefore neutral cationic anionic or zwitterion forms can be exist in different environmental ph conditions 3 37 these based on the values of kow and pka which are widely varied as shown in table 2 these functional groups may regulate the behaviour of ppcps in aquatic environment moreover henry s coefficient kh is also called the air water partition coefficient which is an important partition parameter for dissolved contaminants in the environment it usually acts on the volatilization as a function of the concentrations of contaminants in solutions and the contaminant s partial pressure previous studies suggested that the removal of some pharmaceutical residues phrs by volatilization could be neglected owing to low values of henry coefficient 38 39 table 1 1 3 potential distribution of ppcps in the aquatic environment in different regions of the world the spatial distribution of ppcps in the aquatic systems varies significantly depending on their consumption rates and their mobility properties many studies and surveys confirmed the widespread of ppcps in the aquatic environment municipal wastewater and effluents that have been classified as major sources of these compounds in water bodies fig 2 40 to date available studies have stated that concentrations of phrs in groundwater surface waters and treated water are below 100 ng l and their concentrations in treated water are less than 50 ng l 40 the first occurrence of medicines in aquatic environment in treated wastewater was reported in the usa in kansas city in 1976 where clofibric acid was found in the range of 800 2000 ng l 41 subsequently in 1981 the presence of 25 pharmaceutical substances were investigated in the river lee which consider the source of drinking water for north london with concentration approximately 1000 ng l assuming no degradation or metabolism processes occurred 12 42 from that time across the globe many studies have quantified the presence of ppcps and their ingredients in environmental compartments in this regard studies exhibited that the administration and discharge of ppcps in the aquatic environment vary between countries and between different areas in the same country meanwhile the presence and concentrations of ppcps in wwtps influents fluctuate between different regions according to consumption patterns the socioeconomic composition of the population that provides the sewage and wastewater treatment plants climatic conditions and water uses 43 44 in addition the distribution and quantities of ppcps in the effluents of wwtps depend on their physicochemical properties e g pka log kow volatility solubility etc properties characteristics of wastewater influents e g acidity alkalinity total dissolved solid tds dissolved oxygen do turbidity chemical oxygen demand cod etc adsorption sorption of ppcps to suspended solids and applied treatment processes 45 46 germany s ministry for the environment 47 have prepared a review for investigation of ppcps in the aquatic environment for 71 countries of all five un regions fig 3 they have found about 631 of pharmaceuticals were detected above analytical detection limits of the 713 tested substances in which at least the concentration of one substance was measured in the environment was presented in the literatures they found more than 100 of different compounds that have been detected in the aquatic environment tap drinking water surface water and groundwater in the usa and many of european countries fig 3 and more than 30 substances were detected in other eastern and western european countries asia the pacific and in gru lac latin america and caribbean states in addition they declared that 30 pharmaceutical substances were detected in most countries of eastern europe africa and the pacific in a global critical evaluation about 203 of ppcps were reported in 41 different countries 48 national japanese monitoring of 12 different medicines were detected in 37 rivers and their sum concentrations were 626 ng l 49 petrović and coworkers 50 applied a multiresidue method for the analysis of 81 pharmaceutical drugs from different therapeutic classes in different water matrices i e water surface underground and wastewater from serbia forty seven compounds of 81 drugs were found in four different types of analyzed water a nationwide usa first study investigated about 95 of ppcps and other organic compounds in 139 different streams from 30 states during 1999 2000 the detected organic wastewater compounds were represented a wide range of different resources including industrial anthropogenic agricultural origins and uses with 82 of the 95 compounds being detected 51 other previous reviews 3 4 12 52 54 explored many tools and environmental conditions about ppcps of occurrences data based on the available data that was previously published western european countries such as spain largest contribution germany france italy switzerland portugal and england have detected ppcps in their aquatic environment 48 asian countries were not far away from that issue whereas many studies carried out in china japan malaysia and south korea as well however in the rest of the world the conducted studies are limited or may be missing this indicates that the detection of ppcps in some developing regions such as africa are of significant interest 2 characteristics of frequently detected ppcps and their relationship with potential occurrence in aquatic systems 2 1 occurrence of antibiotics antibiotics are one of the most valuable drugs where they are considered a significant pharmaceuticals class that is usually used in human and veterinary medicines globally the consumption of antibiotics has been evaluated to be approximately 100 000 200 000 tons annually 55 throughout the world more than 250 substances are registered as antibiotic drugs for human health and animals use 56 over the past 10 years according to data analysis from literatures regional and national surveillance systems from 71 different countries reported that antibiotics usage are growing by 30 worldwide mainly owing to rising consumption in the low and middle income countries 57 after humans or animals intake antibiotics may be partially metabolized and then metabolites are excreted into the urine and feces in germany it was reported that all antibiotics had a metabolization rate about 30 58 this is leading to say that approximately 70 are excreted without change and discharged into sewage systems in a recent work pei et al reported that only about 15 of antibiotic drugs are metabolized and absorbed while 85 are unaltered and released into environmental systems 59 the top 10 list of generic antibiotic drugs are sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim ciprofloxacin amoxicillin clindamycin doxycycline amoxicillin and clavulanate cephalexin metronidazole levofloxacin and azithromycin 60 in the last couple of decades a lot of studies have been carried out to investigate the occurrence of antibiotics in wwtps most of studies have been concentrated on a limited number of antibiotics between 2 and 33 target compounds 56 studies about comparing between varied countries are relatively absent but in case of a single country such as united kingdom sweden greece portugal croatia and china the drugs were analysed while between 2 and 19 compounds within each country have been studied in a limited number of wwtps 56 58 61 64 in the following the occurrence of most common antibiotics are discussed sulfamethoxazole is an antibiotic commonly found in water matrices belong to the class of sulfonamides which is considered as the oldest antibiotic classes still in use for both human and animal health care sulfonamides or sulfa drugs bacteriostatic compounds inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as fungi protozoa and some bacteria 65 and depend on the synthesis of folate for nucleotides synthesis pyrimidine and purine 66 occurrence and distribution of sulfonamides e g sulfamethoxazole in surface water of european countries were investigated 4 65 in european freshwaters studies concentrations of sulfamethazine are in the range of sulfamethoxazole as it was reported by 67 moreover in the llobregat river spain concentrations of sulfamethoxazole were up to 6000 ng l 68 and up to 12 000 ng l in river receiving industrial wastewater in croatia 69 in aqueous acidic medium sulfamethoxazole is a highly photolabile drug resulted in many primary photoproducts photolysis of sulfamethoxazole leads to formation of an imido isomer which produced from the photoisomerization of isoxazole ring to 1 3 oxazole product the photodegradation products involve sulfanilic acid aniline and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole 70 trimethoprim is an antibiotic belonging to a class of chemotherapeutic agents it is used to treat bacterial infections as well as the treatment of intestinal skin urinary and respiratory tract infections and other diseases such as severe attacks of otitis enterocolitis and bronchitis in children 18 trimethoprim has a broad antimicrobial function and it is effective to most kinds of bacteria similar to sulfamethoxazole 71 approximately 80 of trimethoprim is excreted by users through urine and the feces 72 because it is poorly metabolized in animal digestive tracts and human bodies 73 furthermore some of ppcps are released in sinks or in toilets through hospital or domestic routes as undesired drugs due to expiration and others are coming from pharmaceutical industries which enter to water resources through sewage systems 74 trimethoprim is observed to be more persistent where its rate of degradation in the aquatic systems is relatively slow with half life about 30 days 75 ciprofloxacin is one of the second generation of fluoroquinolones drug class with a solubility of 30 g l and is the most widely used as bactericidal antibiotics worldwide 76 ciprofloxacin acts as a broad spectrum drug used to treat gram negative and gram positive bacteria 77 generally it is used to treat infections of respiratory tract bone and joint infections malignant otitis externa gastroenteritis chancroid cellulitis endocarditis anthrax urinary tract infections and prostatitis 78 2 2 occurrence of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids nsaids are the most commonly quantified medicine classes widely used to relieve pain analgesic fever reducing antipyretic and to reduce inflammation they are usually used to relieve symptoms of painful periods headaches colds and flu sprains and strains arthritis and others 79 the most frequently detected nsaids are acetaminophen diclofenac ketoprofen naproxen and ibuprofen as follows acetaminophen is called paracetamol n acetyl p aminophenol it is the most frequently detected compound in water matrices it is an effective and widely used drug for fever pains and headache 80 it was introduced into medical practice in the uk in 1956 and in the usa in 1955 81 acetaminophen becomes toxic and causes acute liver and kidney failure when it is overdosed 82 it enters into water matrices from medical waste pharmaceutical effluents and from veterinary use indeed increasing concentrations of acetaminophen in aquatic environment maybe related to their less or not degradable compounds under normal environmental conditions as it is not biodegradable it is easily to accumulate in the aquatic environment leading to an adverse effect on the human health and other living organisms 83 diclofenac is widely used of nsaids and highly consumed by hundreds of tons annually by human and veterinary medical care it is a weak electrolyte which is characterized by an acid dissociation constant of pka 4 0 where molecular and anionic forms can coexist in aqueous solutions 84 it is recognized as an effective cyclooxygenase inhibitor with analgesic antipyretic and anti inflammatory properties 85 approximately 65 of consumed diclofenac can be released through feces and urine due to its low digestibility extensive use and the generation of related metabolites 86 the low biodegradability of diclofenac usually causes a low removal rate through biological treatment process and a few quantities of diclofenac can be absorbed into sludge studies conducted by agüera et al 87 revealed that 8 chloro 9 hcarbazole 1yl acetic acid is main derivative of photoproduct of diclofenac drug different pharmaceuticals photolysis have broad ranges of half life t 1 2 for instance gemfibrozil exhibited a t1 2 of 15 h while ketoprofen showed a half life 4 min at the same conditions 88 ibuprofen is a propionic drug prescribed as anti inflammatory antipyretic and analgesic it is used for pain relief in some diseases including rheumatoid arthritis muscle aches toothache migraine and for lowering the fever 89 it is highly soluble in water 21 0 mg l at 25 c with a pka 4 90 around 30 kilotons of ibuprofen is synthesized annually due to its high consumption rate and globally extensive demand 90 high water solubility and low volatility of ibuprofen cause extensive mobility in the aquatic streams and reservoirs the discarded of drug from aquaculture and pharmaceutical industries the excretion of metabolized and non metabolized drug in the urine of animals and humans upon medical treatment are the main sources of ibuprofen contamination in environmental systems 89 it was noticed that about 15 of ibuprofen therapeutic dose is unchanged in the excretion whereas about 26 of it passes the body as metabolized derivatives hydroxyl ibuprofen and 43 as carboxy ibuprofen which are more toxic than the parent compound 91 the conducted studies revealed that oxidation of benzylic group introduced a hydroxyl group which occurs in photolytic degradation of ibuprofen as it was indicated by the mechanism suggested by 92 this is leading to the formation of 1 hydroxyibuprofen and 2 hydroxyibuprofen which are the main products of ibuprofen degradation 92 93 as a result ibuprofen is present in drinking water up to 1 3 μg l and in surface water up to 0 4 μg l 90 94 therefore become ecotoxic and significant dangerous for aquatic ecosystems and human health naproxen is a derivative of bicyclic propionic acid and is commonly known as nsaids it is working through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzyme which is entered in the synthesis of thromboxane prostacyclin and prostaglandins from arachidonic acid ara 95 96 among analgesic drugs and nsaids naproxen is widely used class with around 30 million user international daily and in the usa about more than 100 million prescriptions every year 96 around 3000 tons of naproxen drug were manufactured in the world in 2003 97 in 2016 naproxen was prescribed approximately 11 470 076 times in the usa 98 in the living organisms naproxen is metabolized into naproxen glucuronide and o desmethylnaproxen 99 also these metabolites are released in surface water and wastewater naproxen does not subject to complete mineralization in sewage treatment plants stps due to its relatively high degree of transformation consequently leading to releases into the environment from treatment plants 100 101 from more than 100 european monitored rivers naproxen was detected in 69 of more than 100 water samples at quantitation up to 2 027 μg l 102 investigation of european union water has revealed that the concentrations of naproxen in surface waters and wwtps exceed the recommended concentration stated by the european medicines agency ema by 10 to 500 fold 103 2 3 occurrence of anticonvulsants anticonvulsants are known as antiepileptic drugs which are used in treatment of neuropathic pain epilepsy and psychiatric disorders 104 and have a global consumption volume about 1014 tons year 105 anticonvulsants drugs are including carbamazepine diazepam gabapentin lorazepam phenytoin pregabalin etc from tables 3 4 5 and literatures it is noted that carbamazepine is the most frequently detected and widely distributed in the aquatic systems carbamazepine drug is highly metabolized in humans mainly excreted in the form of hydroxylate and conjugated metabolites and revealed minimum unchanged eliminated amounts 2 106 despite of its continuous discharge to aquatic environment the low removal rate from treatment processes of wastewater is less than 45 and sludge is less than 10 107 108 besides the resistance to photochemical and biological transformations in the environment 109 all of these factors contribute the existence and persistence of carbamazepine in the aquatic environment chiron et al reported that the products of carbamazepine photodegradation are more toxic than the parent compound where acridine is highly mutagenic and carcinogenic product of carbamazepine photodegradation 110 from table 2 gabapentin pka is 3 7 and 10 7 therefore it is freely dissolved in both of acidic and basic aqueous solutions and in water the data obtained from tables 3 4 and 5 indicated there are extremely increasing in the concentration of carbamazepine in sewage and wastewater of most of countries this is attributed to the chemical structure of carbamazepine which has an olefinic double bond on the central of heterocyclic ring is difficult to be photo or biodegradation and this enhance their concentration in aquatic environment 2 4 occurrence of β blockers β blockers are the most broadly used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases hypertension as well as patients recovering from heart attacks angina pectoris arrhythmia and migraine 111 112 their mechanism of work is based on blocking the action or effects of adrenaline on β receptors of the body which subsequently slow down impulses of the nerve to the heart and as a result they reduce its work load 52 the most commonly used β blockers are metoprolol atenolol sotalol and propranolol the biodegradation of organic compounds in aquatic media and is the dominant pathway for removal of ppcps in wwtps 113 however it was reported atenolol propranolol indomethacin acetaminophen ibuprofen carbamazepine ifenprodil and mefenamic acid resist biodegradation process and remain unchanged in the effluents of wwtp and aquatic environment 36 on the other hand it was reported that in activated sludge the biodegradation of valsartan atenolol oseltamivir bezafibrate and diazepam produces many of transformation ingredients 114 metoprolol is one of the most commonly used β blockers it is quite frequently detected in the aquatic environment in some of european countries β blockers annual consumption rate exceeded by 0 1 1 1 and 3 2 g per person in finland switzerland and uk respectively 115 these extremely high concentrations of metoprolol drugs in the advanced countries are attributed to a significant high consumption rate of β blockers drugs for treatment of heart diseases which spread in these countries on contrast its concentrations in surface water and drinking water were low degradation efficiency of β blockers such as propranolol atenolol and metoprolol has been explored in electro fenton ef process where most of these substances can be undergone degradation in 5 to 30 min and totally mineralized in several hours 116 high detected concentrations of atenolol in wwtps are attributed to its relatively high emission as unchanged drugs 50 by comparing with 0 5 and 15 for propranolol and metoprolol respectively 1 furthermore β blockers are considered pseudo persistent compounds that have been exhibited half life of 3 to 8 7 days in the aqueous medium 112 continuous releasing of these substances into aquatic environment will lead to a significant potential risks and threats to the aquatic ecosystems 2 5 occurrence of antidepressants psychiatric antidepressant medications are frequently prescribed to treat anxiety depression disorder chronic pain or insomnia its mechanism of work is based on increasing and regulating the levels of two different neurotransmitters in the brain neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and serotonin also called norepinephrine may affect pain signals sent by nerves 117 in canada in the year of 2007 more than 22 000 kg of antidepressant medicines were authorized to patients 118 between the periods 2005 and 2008 in the usa about 11 of persons aged between 18 and 44 years were gotten rid of antidepressant medications antidepressants class was listed the third of most commonly authorized drugs consumed by americans 1 antidepressants are usually released to drinking water surface water wastewater and wwtps in their metabolized or parent form during human excreta and improper discharges for instance fluoxetine an antidepressant medicine approximately 20 30 is metabolized in the human body to produce the norfluoxetine and fluoxetine glucuronide metabolites while the remaining is passed unaltered to sewage systems 119 the neuroactive compounds or antidepressant drugs from the class s serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor snari and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris have been detected in surface waters and wwtps venlafaxine is one of the most widely used antidepressants drug and acts as a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snari 120 venlafaxine is used to treat panic disorders major depressive disorder and anxiety 121 o desmethylvenlafaxine is the main venlafaxine human metabolite and also known as a snari 120 122 nevertheless after ingestion venlafaxine cannot be completely absorbed by human body and enters to aquatic environment 123 in this review the occurrence of frequently prescribed antidepressants venlafaxine fluoxetine and diazepam in drinking tap water surface water and the influents and effluents of wwtps in different countries have been reported 2 6 occurrence of endocrine disrupting estrogens synthetic and natural endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are significant environmental pollutants that usually interfere and affect the normal function of the endocrine system of humans and wildlife a broad range of substances including both of natural and synthetic chemicals has been shown to elicit endocrine disruption 124 steroid estrogens are derived from cholesterol belonging to a group of biologically active compounds and have a cyclopentan o perhydrophenanthrene in their common structure it is well known that estrogens are dominantly female hormones that keep the health of reproductive systems breast brain and skin 125 from medicinal point of view natural estrogens such as estriol e3 17β estradiol e2 and estrone e1 are secreted by the ovary testis the adrenal cortex and placenta in animals and humans while synthetic estrogens such as 17β ethinylestradiol ee2 are the main ingredients in hormone therapy and oral contraceptive pills 126 these steroid hormones which are belonging to edcs have a highly estrogenic influence activity approximately 10 000 100 000 times higher than that of other edcs such as bisphenols alkylphenols and organochlorine aromatic compounds 127 128 duncan and coworkers 129 reported that the concentrations of e2 in the range of 1 10 ng l show a potential risk effect on aquatic species where its detection of exposure found to be in a combination of e1 and e2 than its individual exposure hormone urinary and fecal excretions of all of humans and animals usually contain both of synthetic and natural estrogens which potentially end up in the environment through waste disposal or sewage discharge the physical and chemical properties revealed that the steroid estrogens dissolve poorly in water where synthetic estrogens have a solubility of about 4 8 mg l and natural compounds have a solubility of around 13 mg l 125 moreover steroid estrogens have very low vapor pressure ranging from 2 3 10 10 to 6 7 10 15 mmhga leading to their low volatility 130 furthermore the octanol water partition coefficient kow values of steroid estrogens varied between 2 81 and 4 15 indicates that they are hydrophobic compounds table 2 their physicochemical properties showed that steroid estrogens have low tendency for dissolving in aqueous media and prefer sorption on sediments and soils 131 the most frequently detected estrogens are estriol e3 β estradiol e2 estrone e1 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 and diethylstilbestrol des were quantified in surface water wastewater and wwtps tables 3 4 and 5 2 7 occurrence of endocrine disrupting phenols the most frequently detected phenolic endocrine disrupting compounds are bisphenol a bpa octylphenol op nonylphenol np diethylstilbestrol des and corresponding ethoxylates nowadays these substances have become omnipresent in the environment owing to their utilization in a wide range of products e g ppcps surfactants food and beverage packaging adhesives flame retardants building materials electronic components and paper coatings they can cause a potential pose risk to human health as decreasing reproductive fitness and increase cancer diseases in humans due to exposure to estrogenic compounds e g phenolic compounds especially through drinking water 132 bisphenol a bpa large uses in the manufacture of epoxy resin and polycarbonate plastics leads to be one of the most frequently detected compounds in tap drinking water surface water and wwtps 133 bisphenol a is recognized as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs which can impact the hormonal systems of humans and wildlife at relative low concentrations furthermore alkylphenols compounds are the main products of alkylphenol ethoxylates apeos degradation which is considered as one of the most important non ionic surfactants utilized as dispersants solubilizers and detergents 134 2 8 occurrence of lipid lowering drugs lipid lowering medicines are prescribed medicines that are given to patients suffering from excess cholesterol fat or triglycerides an ester derived from glycerol and three fatty acids to reduce the amount of lipids present in human blood 135 in general to regulate and control elevated levels of various forms of lipids in patients suffering from hyperlipidemia the main sources of lipid lowering drugs contaminants in wastewater are from discharges of wastes from pharmaceuticals manufacturing processes and human excretions where about 70 excreted in urine and 30 from faeces 136 this class of medicines is composed of a broad range of synthetic and natural organic substances which contain nicotinic acid omega 3 fatty acids bile acid sequestrates ezetimibe or cholesterol absorption inhibitor 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme a hmg coa reductase inhibitor or fibrates and statins 137 as it was reported in literatures this class are divided into two main groups i statins which include seven pharmaceutical substances simvastatin rosuvastatin lovastatin pravastatin pitavastatin fluvastatin and atorvastatin ii fibrates which include fenofibrate gemfibrozil ciprofibrate and bezafibrate 138 statin compounds include a carboxylic hydrophilic tail and a hydrophobic core therefore the relative interactions are favoured to take place between the sorbent organic matter and the hydrophobic groups of the molecule while the hydrophilic functional part of the compound oriented towards the aqueous solution 135 based on performed studies the gemfibrozil drug showed high persistent in aquatic medium with half lives ranging from 70 to 288 days 103 139 on the other hand the environmental residence time of clofibric acid reach up to 21 years and it was not biodegradable in the laboratory scale reactors 140 3 occurrence of ppcps in tap drinking water over the last three decades extensive researches conducted on chemical pollution concerning the conventional persistent organic pollutants pops nowadays scientists and new scientific projects are oriented towards compounds that are found in low concentrations but have direct harmful effects and could cause a potential threat to the aquatic systems with long time through bioaccumulation and metabolism the presence of ppcps in surface water could be a worrying problem when it is utilized for drinking water a current challenge is attributed to the presence of degradation by products of ppcps in water matrices in many cases these by products have not been detected and could be persistent and hazardous as their parent compounds 52 from table 3 it found that raw tap drinking water is not highly polluted by ppcps because of their concentrations in treated water were at trace amounts or below the detection limits as illustrated in table 3 the global concentrations of frequently detected ppcps such as antibiotics β blockers antiulcer agents antiepileptics antiasthma drugs antihistamines calcium channel blockers lipid regulating agent and hormones in tap drinking water across the world are reported the discussed data were collected from various published papers and reviews including different pharmaceutical classes that are usually focused on the maximum concentration values and all individual listed values for drinking water there is variability in the concentrations in different countries over the world for example high concentrations of ppcps were detected in tap drinking water in china which reported high levels of caffeine 607 85 ng l erythromycin 515 69 ng l and codeine 313 29 ng l by comparing the same compounds with respect to other countries the highest concentration of caffeine was found in poland 308 ng l and taiwan 263 2 ng l for specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds see section 2 table 3 shows that the maximum concentration of antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole was 113 ng l in usa drinking water and ibuprofen nsaids quantities in tap drinking water ranged from 9 23 ng l to 223 6 ng l for china and poland respectively in addition the concentrations of antidepressant drugs such as venlafaxine in drinking water of china was 0 1 ng l and fluoxetine was 19 2 ng l in usa drinking water table 3 endocrine disrupting substances as bisphenol a bpa in tap drinking water of poland 203 ng l spain 51 2 ng l and usa 44 3 ng l table 3 revealed the highest concentrations of bpa because of many of industries and goods contain plastics and epoxy resins in their various production on the other hand the highest concentration of lipid lowering drugs in tap drinking water of bezafibrate 120 ng l was reported in japan while the highest concentration of gemfibrozil 98 2 ng l was reported in the netherlands table 3 the highest concentration of carbamazepine as anticonvulsants or anti epileptic drug detected in tap drinking water was 176 06 ng l in hungary and 72 ng l in the usa the observed data indicated that the highest concentrations of ppcps in spain were valsartan 1300 ng l atenolol 900 ng l losartan 620 ng l metoprolol 380 ng l bisoprolol 250 ng l and primidone 200 ng l valsartan is an antihypertensive drug and a tetrazole derivative that contains carboxylic pka 3 9 and acid pka 4 73 groups that result in the compound being soluble within the neutral ph range 141 thus it can exist as a solution at normal physiological ph values by rising the ph value from 4 to 6 the solubility of valsartan will increase by a factor of 1000 times but it prefers the anionic form with decreasing lipophilicity 142 caffeine is a central nervous system cns stimulant belonging to the methylxanthine class it is the most widely consumed psychoactive stimulant and it was regarded as one of the most commonly detected drugs in aquatic environment 143 caffeine is highly persistent in water due to its extreme stability with a half life of 100 to 240 days 144 due to its high concentrations high detection frequency and relatively high stability and suitability as indicator of untreated wastewater it has been considered as an effective indicator of the emergence of pharmaceutical active compounds phacs 145 146 previous study reported that the presence of 90 ppcps were investigated in tap water treated water and reservoirs in france italy germany finland canada and the usa 147 among 90 of studied ppcps diclofenac bezafibrate ibuprofen clofibric acid triclosan and gemfibrozil were revealed at concentrations of 2 5 734 ng l vulliet et al reported that the salicylic acid was the most detected compound among 25 pharmaceuticals in drinking water samples while the others atenolol and carbamazepine were detected in more than 30 of polluted water supplies but at low quantities or 2 ng l 148 in valencia spain the results declared that parabens were investigated at relatively high concentrations in wtps and low quantities of pharmaceuticals 100 ng l were found in mineral and tap waters according to the study performed by carmona and coworkers 149 their study was performed on the tap water samples which showed that salicylic acid and naproxen were frequently detected while ibuprofen diclofenac and propylparaben showed the greatest concentrations 1 39 ng l in mineral water methylparaben was measured at 40 ng l salicylic acid is an important organic synthetic compound and is extensively utilized in medicines perfumes pesticides foods dyes and rubber due to its wide usage salicylic acid has become an emerging contaminant in the aquatic systems and has been frequently measured in surface waters 150 contamination of water with residuals of salicylic acid can cause significant harmful effects on human health e g blood circulation failure and central nervous system disorders 151 salicylic acid is not soluble in water at room temperature it needs to be transformed to salicylate to dissolve completely in water with its solubility depending on the ph of the medium notably it dissolves well in water at ph 3 152 from table 3 it is shown that european countries reported the highest values of salicylic acid in tap drinking water of france 102 ng l netherlands 98 0 and 58 7 ng l and poland 33 3 ng l this is attributed to high rate of medicinal consumption dyes industries food production in addition to the insolubility of salicylic acid in water liu and coworkers 153 carried out their study on the fate and elimination of six medicines in an industrial scale wtp in china and found that the effluent quantities of these substances ranged from 1 to 43 ng l and were from below the limit of detection to 6 ng l it was reported that very low levels of phacs were detected in finished drinking water in the usa 40 besides phacs were found in tap water in several european countries including the netherlands germany and italy 154 in germany an analgesic drug phenazone and an antipyretic medicine propyphenazone were detected in berlin drinking water at concentrations of 120 ng l and 400 ng l respectively 155 this high value was due to the use of groundwater as a source of drinking water which was contaminated with sewage system 156 in germany for both of human and veterinary use the annual consumption of drugs antibiotics is between 700 and 800 t indicating high loads of antibiotic residues that can enter the wastewater stream 13 157 in the period between october 2007 and march 2012 the u s geological survey usgs and the u s environmental protection agency usepa carried out a joint study to examine the sources and treated water from 25 drinking water treatment plants dwtps across the usa 158 the collected samples were analyzed 24 pharmaceutical substances in phase i and 118 compounds in phase ii it was reported that in phase i about 11 medicines were measured in all source water samples fewer quantifiable pharmaceuticals were detected with a maximum of five substances in any one sample and a median for all samples of two on the other hand in phase ii about 47 of different substances were quantified in all source water samples with a maximum of 41 compounds investigated in any one sample the median number of drugs for all 25 samples was 8 median concentrations in source water were lower than 113 ng l for 37 substances quantified in phase ii the most persistent pharmaceuticals through treatment processes were cotinine bupropion metoprolol and carbamazepine by comparing available data pharmaceuticals existed in tap drinking water is less than of surface water and wastewater especially in developing countries fig 4 in germany and spain more than 30 medicines have been identified and about 11 to 30 were investigated in france canada sweden china and usa these data confirmed the report of who 2012 which contains less data on medicines in drinking water 47 bexfield and coworkers 159 carried out the first large scale 1000 sites in 46 states for assessment the spatial distribution and presence of pharmaceuticals and hormones in groundwater used in drinking water throughout the usa fig 5 they analyzed samples from 1091 locations in principal aquifers representing 60 of the total volume used as a source of drinking water supply and found the data of 103 pharmaceuticals and 21 hormones across 15 principal aquifers including 844 sites which indicate the resources used for public supply at least one compound was detected at 5 9 and was measured at 11 3 in 247 sites indicating the resources of domestic supply over 9 principal aquifers about 34 compounds were detected three pharmaceutical substances carbamazepine an anticonvulsant mood stabilizer sulfamethoxazole an antibiotic meprobamate an antianxiety medication one plastics component bisphenol a and caffeine metabolite 1 7 dimethylxanthine where each was measured between 0 7 and 1 6 of all sites most of common detections in shallow wells included recent discharge ingredients the obtained results revealed the vulnerability of contaminated groundwater utilized for drinking water in the usa is generally limited they reported that all detections of hormones and pharmaceuticals that were prepared were 102 in addition to any of 2 or more uncommon compounds of 1091 sites its results included for pharmaceuticals and hormones three or four substances were determined at four sites two compounds were determined at 14 sites whereas a single pharmaceutical or hormone compound was determined at 60 locations fig 5 at least one pharmaceutical compound was detected at 5 1 of principal aquifer survey pas sites and 9 6 of major aquifer study mas sites where pharmaceutical substances were more frequently detected than hormones the concentrations of hormones ranged from 3 0 ng l to 570 ng l and cholesterol has been revealed the highest concentration while concentrations of pharmaceuticals ranged from 1 7 ng l to 677 ng l and caffeine has been revealed the highest the obtained data revealed that the highest concentrations for the five medicines and hormones that were quantified at more than 0 5 of sites were ranged from 120 ng l to 430 ng l for sulfamethoxazole and bisphenol a respectively belitz and coworkers 160 stated that the most detected compounds have relatively high solubility and low tendency to adsorb onto sediments or soils in conclusion information obtained from this work can be utilized to regulate and control the medicines and environmental settings for future research and monitoring environmental fate and evaluate of their potential threats to human health 4 occurrence and distribution of ppcps in surface water as it is shown in fig 6 and table 4 a wide range of ppcps is existed in surface waters from many sources mainly sewage treatment plants stps as it had been reported in uk italy africa and the us 189 whereas the effluents from stps are considered the dominant pathway for the presence of a huge number of ppcps in surface water accordingly this review has scanned recent published articles that reported different ppcps residues in surface waters and about 94 of ppcps were quantified the prevalence of ppcps is observed mainly in regions such as asia e g japan china korea india bangladesh and malaysia africa e g egypt morocco south africa nigeria and uganda europe e g greece serbia italy and spain north and south america e g usa canada brazil and mexico and australia in surface water the available data revealed that the highest concentrations of ppcps were observed in africa and south america in relative to other regions with an average concentration of 11 8093 μg l in 27 frequently detected compounds in nigeria and 8 0368 μg l of 22 compounds in brazil fig 6 it was observed that the highest quantities of ppcps were occurred in the surface water of the developing countries compared to the developed countries this may be related to the low efficient of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and chemical manufacturing plants residues furthermore the relatively high concentrations of ppcps in surface water are mainly referred to some factors such as their low digestion rate into human or animal guts high consumption rates and low solubility in this regard table 4 shows the highest detected ppcps in surface water with large variations in the scanned regions these variations could be attributed to some factors such as sampling modes climate conditions and their consumption rate in high income nations such as north america and europe the concentrations of investigated ppcps were lower compared to that with low income nations these maybe due to i behavior of nations to protect their environment ii application of guidelines and legislations iii healthcare where these countries provide high quality medical care for their nations thus decrease the consumption of drugs leading to reduction of ppcps contamination and iv restriction rules to prevent factories industries veterinary and agriculture uses of prohibited ppcps while nations such as nigeria and brazil based on the collected data above their pharmaceuticals consumption maybe high and therefore elevated levels of ppcps were observed in the environment additionally improper practices i e livestock wastewater effluent to cropland prolonged storage of manure composting ground drainage water from manured soils and sewage lines or effluent infiltration have forced the presence of pharmaceuticals e g veterinary antibiotics into livestock surrounding environments i e groundwater rivers and lakes intensively and persisted for long time 190 additionally ppcps residues in surface water maybe indicate the medication habits and human attitude furthermore pharmaceuticals mobility from one medium to another as clearly seen in table 4 for instance bisphenol a bpa was the most frequently detected compound in the surface water of china 1286 25 ng l morocco 302 ng l poland 277 9 ng l malaysia 203 ng l and uk 159 ng l this is attributed to its poor solubility in water and its widely utilized in the production of plastics to a direct contact with foods including plastic packaging jar caps inner coatings of cans and kitchenware 191 for specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds see section 2 the existence of caffeine in surface water acts as indicator of anthropogenic pollution caffeine was observed in high levels in greece 3508 ng l india 1104 8 ng l brazil 127 000 ng l spain 1092 ng l and nigeria 1080 ng l table 4 because of its high solubility and low octanol water partition coefficient caffeine is most likely to persist in the water column moreover caffeine is not only a component of medications but also an ingredient in drinks food and cosmetics in which explain its high exist in environment acetylsalicylic acid aspirin was also observed in high levels in korea 1 1726 μg l and brazil 20 960 μg l these substances are medications used to reduce pain fever or inflammation thus its consumption rate and usage may explain why it was observed in high levels amoxicillin is highly detected in surface water of some regions such as nigeria 272 150 ng l because of it is a widely used in number of bacterial infections for both human and animals which leading to increasing of its consumption rate table 4 table 4 illustrates the antibiotics concentrations in surface water the concentration of the reported antibiotics were found to be varied from region to another as reported in table 4 the maximum concentrations of antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole were detected in some african countries such as uganda 5600 ng l nigeria 3180 ng l ghana 2861 ng l and south africa 2017 ng l also sulfamethoxazole was detected by elevated concentrations in other regions such as china 715 3 ng l mexico 722 ng l and usa 576 4 ng l straub 65 reported that sulfamethoxazole was determined in the surface water of the most of european countries with quantifications lower than 286 ng l with a median of 52 ng l in comparsion the presences of ciprofloxacin in tap drinking water were very low concentrations but its frequently detection in surface water was high with moderate concentrations however ciprofloxacin was detected by high concentration in some countries especially african countries at 1168 ng l in ghana 14 331 ng l and 12 987 ng l in south africa while ciprofloxacin was detected in china and spain at concentrations of 1727 11 ng l and 540 ng l respectively the concentrations of carbamazepine were relatively increased in the surface water of developing countries such as nigeria 342 ng l and greece 406 ng l also higher concentrations were detected in the developed countries such as south korea 899 9 ng l usa 249 ng l and uk 200 ng l the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants compounds in surface water the concentration of frequently detected venlafaxine was 127 62 ng l in spain and fluoxetine was 24 8 ng l in usa table 4 in surface water bpa compounds exhibited higher concentrations in china 1286 25 ng l poland 277 9 ng l and malaysia 203 ng l these results confirmed the reason of higher production of plastic materials lipid lowering drugs it was found that the maximum concentrations of bezafibrate were increased to 233 ng l and 2100 ng l in south africa and mexico respectively table 4 while the maximum concentrations of gemfibrozil were 620 ng l 552 ng l and 368 ng l in surface water of greece nigeria and mexico respectively table 4 these varied concentration levels of different antibiotics may reflect the method of use consumption rate removal mechanism technique of treatment and applied policies that helped in their spreed into surface waters bodies additionally wang et al 192 estimated the occurrence of 36 pharmaceutical compounds in urban rivers water samples obtained from shenzhen beijing and changzhou whereas 28 compounds were frequently detected including indomethacin 50 9 ng l atenolol 52 9 ng l sulpiride 77 3 ng l and sulfadimethoxine 164 ng l which showed the highest median concentrations and were observed that approximately antibiotics encompass half of pharmaceuticals contamination in addition the ratio of permanent pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine and sulpiride are valuable to trace sources of contamination in urban rivers spongberg et al investigated the existence of 34 pharmaceuticals in 86 water samples collected from coastal sites and surface water in costa rica 193 the investigated areas involved sites that received both of untreated and treated wastewaters and rural runoff the five most determined substances were caffeine 29 triclosan 34 salicylic acid 41 sulfadimethoxine 43 and doxycycline 77 the pharmaceuticals detected from lower to higher concentrations were ketoprofen 10 000 ng l acetaminophen 13 000 ng l gemfibrozil 17 000 ng l ibuprofen 37 000 ng l and doxycycline 74 000 ng l β blockers are used for treatment of vasodilation visceral smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation 194 see section 2 4 in beijing ppcps have frequencies of detection of 50 100 where beijing is considered one of the most populated cities in china 195 the obtained results showed that the median concentrations of the analysed pharmaceutical residues were reached 4200 ng l moreover the conducted studies revealed that the concentrations of antiretroviral drugs e g tenofovir lamivudine stavudine abacavir nevirapine ritonavir etc in surface water of south african were reported higher concentrations than in other countries 196 persistent analgesic anti inflammatory agents are one of the most commonly existed drugs in sewage due to their higher use and consumption rate for specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds see section 2 an anticonvulsant or anti epileptic drugs such as carbamazepine is usually found at relatively high concentrations ng l μg l in surface waters table 4 4 1 usa as a case study on the occurrence and distribution of ppcps in surface water in the usa batt and coworkers 197 assessed the potential existence of active pharmaceutical ingredients in aquatic ecosystems fig 7 they proceeded a nationwide probability statistical survey and analysis to detect the distribution and occurrence for number of ingredients in the surface water of the usa and to represent a national predication of potential contamination of river surface water with active pharmaceutical ingredients apis the monitoring and survey study involved about 182 sampling locations and proposed rivers especially closest to urban areas fig 7 the study included 46 analytes contain various classes of active pharmaceutical ingredients such as anticonvulsants diuretics antidepressants and antibiotics about 37 compounds out of 46 were detected in minimum one sampling site sulfamethoxazole was the most frequently detected drug and was measured in about 141 of the 182 of surveyed surface water at concentrations up to 570 ng l about 10 of these substances were measured in about 20 or more in the sampling locations the most frequently detected compounds were sulfamethoxazole 576 4 ng l hydrochlorothiazide 619 ng l progesterone 440 8 ng l testosterone 361 4 ng l valsartan 319 4 ng l and carbamazepine 249 3 ng l respectively higher pollution with these pharmaceuticals could be produced from sewage treatment plants stps wastewater treatment plants wwtps animal manure or wastewater sludge containing traces of these compounds improper disposal also from higher consumption or prescription rate the results of their survey of apis on surface water were convenient with their previous studies in wastewater and when they compared with prescribed doses their study indicated that the risk of human exposure for these apis through drinking water would be very low 197 4 2 china as a case study on the occurrence and distribution of ppcps in surface water in china na liu et al studied 1934 exposure data of 50 selected compounds obtained from 26 secondary river areas around china huai river pearl river yellow river songliao river southeast coast hai river yangtze river fig 8 198 the regions included 26 river system covering the highest population density area according to the geographic hu huanyong line 199 in addition to 20 areas covers the eastern coastal area of china the most frequently detected 42 ppcps were investigated in the pearl river delta followed by investigation about 38 substances in yangtze river downstream 38 in taihu lake 36 in daqing river 34 in chaobai beiyun jiyun river and 33 substances in liao river the highest concentrations were observed in liaodong peninsula yangtze river downstream ziya river and huai river with values of 14 718 411 ng l 731 100 ng l 97 434 ng l 81 250 ng l respectively the watershed yangtze river id 14 18 was the most frequently reported where about 643 samples were studied and the concentrations of about 96 about 43 out of 45 of the investigated ppcps compounds were found above the detection limit the most observed ppcps residues in hai river id 5 9 were about 45 compounds positively investigated in 489 samples 46 substances were investigated pearl river id 21 26 where 44 compounds of them were positively measured in 352 samples it was reported that due to studies in some watersheds were quite limited therefore only 41and 52 samples were investigated in huai river id 21 22 and yellow river id 10 respectively 198 fig 9 shows the detected concentrations of each compound and the frequencies of detection are exhibited as the number of positively detected all data points except for phantolide cleaning product and household care ppcps were frequently detected in surface water of china 50 to 100 in the studied 50 target pharmaceutical compounds it was found that 23 of them were over 90 in samples fig 9 the most concerned and investigated antibiotic was sulfamethoxazole where it was positively observed at more than 95 of 120 locations from 7 watersheds the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole demonstrated the highest concentration of 984 ng l similar to the indian measurements 900 ng l 200 but less than the observed concentrations in usa 1500 ng l 201 australia 2000 ng l 202 and europe 11 920 ng l 203 erythromycin and sulfadiazine are considered the most ubiquitous antibiotics the obtained results revealed that erythromycin compound was positively observed in 97 of about 65 samples and the highest concentration 1418 ng l was observed in yangtze river 204 comparable to that was observed in europe 1700 ng l 203 comparing to europe in china the antibiotic sulfadiazine was highly detected 97 but with lower concentrations for steroid hormones the greatest frequently detected was for estriol e3 67 ng l in yangtze river 205 less than its concentration in european surface water where it was up to 480 ng l however in the 36 samples the frequency of detection was 61 higher than those detected in europe 20 203 considering estrone e1 was the most frequently investigated hormone where in the seven watersheds it was detected in 96 of 53 samples concentration of estrone e1 in china surface waters was 0 12 57 ng l where in european countries was up to 89 ng l 203 globally androgens testosterone and androstenedione were less reported in surface waters but in three chinese watersheds they were 100 frequently detected with concentrations between 2 and 28 and 0 2 2 5 ng l obviously anticonvulsant or anti epileptic substances as carbamazepine and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids as ibuprofen are the most common studied medicines where carbamazepine was detected in 93 of 42 samples from watershed sites demonstrated the highest concentration up to 1090 ng l 206 in comparing to those was reported in european countries it was slightly lower with concentrations about 1700 ng l 201 but higher than commonly concentrations found in different areas of the globe 198 207 ibuprofen exhibited the greatest concentration about 360 ng l in 32 out of 36 locations lower than that found in european countries with concentration about 31 323 ng l 203 as shown in fig 9 the distribution of quantities of ppcps was deviated to the right skewed direction positive skewness this skewness is produced owing to the broad range of concentrations in different selected samples according to the study conducted by liu and coworkers 198 fig 9 shows that the mean quantities of substances were nearly equal to 75th centiles where distribution of concentrations of residues were skewed to positive skewness to the right about 17 mean concentrations reported greater than the 75th centile by 2 fold for instance the detected mean concentrations of carbamazepine and dimethyl phthalate substances reported greater than the 75th centile values by 5 and 9 times and with frequencies of detection of 93 and 81 respectively in the surface waters of chinese rivers sulfamethoxazole was observed at more than 95 of 120 locations from 7 watersheds and demonstrated the highest concentration of 984 ng l fig 8 198 variations in results are usually related to many factors such as human attitude rate of consumption guidelines and legislation improper disposal and etc 3 52 208 seasonal variations in literatures it was reported that several mechanisms were proposed to explain seasonal variations on ppcps such as dilution effects water temperature seasonal discharges and irradiances 173 183 in low temperature in cold seasons ppcps are less biodegradable than in high temperatures or warm seasons in addition to decreasing levels of solar radiation in autumn season which may decrease the rate of photo degradations of pharmaceuticals decreasing the activity of microorganisms for degradation and transformation of ppcps in cold weather enhances their settling and adsorption to sediments which leading to concentration detection in some areas of research sun and coworkers 183 observed higher concentrations of cotinine in warm season than in cold season in both the yellow river and the huai river basins where in the aquatic environment cotinine is the majority metabolite of nicotine 211 5 occurrence of ppcps in wastewater and wastewater treatment plants wwtps ppcps have been described as pseudo persistent emerging contaminants as a result of their persistent releasing into aquatic systems through several pathways 243 up to now in most of countries there aren t capacities required for monitoring 276 and analysis of ppcps and there aren t appropriate sophisticated techniques for removal of ppcps from wastewater and wwtps so that they could exist in drinking water at trace quantities with unknown impacts on human health 173 previous efforts were done to investigate the presence of ppcps in the influents and effluents of wwtps 244 248 discharging of substances from wwtps does not only cause a direct ecosystem threat but also can be transformed to the ingredients of harmful compounds for example n nitrosodimethylamine a methadone form forms in drinking water treatment process as disinfectant byproduct 249 the variability in removal efficiencies of ppcps in wwtps are usually related to their physicochemical properties such as log kow pka chemical structure sorption biodegradability and other parameters of treatment processes e g ph temperature hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt 250 252 for instance many medicines erythromycin triclosan trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole with concentrations ranging from 0 0167 to 0 278 0 to 0 410 0 407 to 1 021 and 1 860 to 2 146 μg l respectively have been investigated in the influents of wwtps in southern california 253 other ppcps such as acetaminophen caffeine codeine gemfibrozil ibuprofen and naproxen were also investigated in the influent of wwtps of costa rica with mean concentrations of 14 6 μg l for acetaminophen and 69 9 μg l for caffeine 254 in fact wastewater indicators are considered as an important way for evaluation the impact of wastewater on both of surface and ground water quantitatively and qualitatively 214 for instance glassmeyer and coworkers 255 studied the spatial and temporal occurrence of 110 ppcps in 10 rivers of usa and reported that diethyltoluamide deet caffeine and carbamazepine were the mainly appropriate wastewater indicators of river water samples furthermore the ratio between conservative indicators and labile or unstable indicators could be used to clarify the contribution of treated wastewater released to surface water 256 258 yang and coworkers 54 investigated wastewater contaminated with 93 ppcps and 5 artificial sweeteners ass in wwtps and selected appropriate wastewater indicators in the region of pearl river in china they have selected fluconazole and sucralose as a conservative indicator and selected caffeine saccharin cyclamate propyl paraben ethyl paraben methyl paraben paracetamol and salicylic acid as labile indicators in two consecutive years 2015 and 2016 rodriguez mozaz and coworkers 56 conducted a comprehensive monitoring for a large group of antibiotic residues in the final effluents of wwtps of seven european countries germany norway finland ireland spain portugal and cyprus this was the first kind of study which carried out at an international level throughout monitored 53 drugs 17 of them were detected at least once in the effluents of the wwtps as ampicillin azithromycin cephalexin ciprofloxacin clarithromycin clindamycin enrofloxacin metronidazole nalidixic acid ofloxacin orbifloxacin oxolinic acid pipemidic acid sulfapyridine and sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and tetracycline the southern countries portugal and spain and ireland exhibited the superior average concentrations of antibiotics in the final effluents whereas cyprus and the northern countries germany norway and finland showed lower total concentrations according to their analysis azithromycin cephalexin and ciprofloxacin are suggested as indicators of antibiotic pollution as they could lead to a potential risk to the environment as shown in table 5 the mean concentration of acesulfame is 17 000 ng l and its maximum value of 24 000 ng l were detected in the influent wastewater in vietnam acesulfame is considered as an artificial low calorie sweetener that can be existed in beverages and different foods after consumption and undergoing metabolism in human it passes through the system without change or unaffected chemically is not metabolised then enter into aquatic environments acesulfame is a negatively charged compound and highly water soluble at different ph values therefore it is known as a potential marker that is used to indicate the entree of domestic s wastewater into aquatic systems 259 furthermore the highest concentrations of antibiotic such as sulfamethoxazole were detected in wastewater and wwtps e g méxico inf 2010 ng l and eff 935 ng l spain inf 1520 ng l usa eff 1000 ng l china inf 3930 8 ng l and south africa inf 9071 96 ng l eff 4357 52 ng l inf 11 644 18 ng l eff 6814 05 ng l according to review prepared by straub 65 declared that sulfamethoxazole in a few measured environmental quantifications reached 4000 ng l especially in discharged streams of wastewater treatment plant effluents wastewater and wwtps showed the highest concentration of antibiotics for both of developing and developed countries table 5 ciprofloxacin antibiotic was detected with higher concentrations in wastewater and wwtps of spain with values of inf 2250 ng l inf 53 054 ng l and eff 2194 ng l in czech inf 860 ng l turkey inf 937 ng l and632 ng l greece inf and eff 591 ng l and sweden inf 560 ng l table 5 the highest concentration of acetaminophen in wastewater and wwtps extremely increased in both of the developing and developed countries as follows usa eff 4500 ng l latvia inf 4200 ng l india inf 11 000 ng l inf 7500 ng l south africa inf 121 776 13 ng l inf 167 515 85 ng l and eff 1727 31 ng l eff 1659 73 ng l canada eff 461 000 ng l france inf 96 700 ng l and new zealand inf 117 867 ng l in wastewater and wwtps it was noticed that ibuprofen concentrations were extremely increased to the highest values in new zealand inf 11 165 ng l canada eff 132 000 ng l and eff 344 000 ng l spain inf 563 000 ng l and algiers inf 8612 9 ng l table 5 this is attributed to its higher water solubility low volatility the excretion of metabolized and non metabolized residues in the urine of animals and humans upon medical treatment discharges and extensive mobility in the aquatic streams on the other hand the concentrations of carbamazepine an anticonvulsants in wastewater and wwtps in sever conditions are extremely high in both of the developing and developed countries as follow the mean concentrations in germany were inf 1536 ng l and eff 1614 ng l the max concentrations in spain were inf 3030 ng l czech were inf 710 ng l and eff 730 ng l usa were inf 588

wwtps of the usa were inf 146 ng l and eff 414 ng l sweden inf 220 ng l and eff 340 ng l and germany inf 293 ng l and eff 303 ng l on the other hand sertraline drug revealed the highest concentration up to 5100 ng l in effluents of wwtps in canada table 5 venlafaxine antidepressants drugs maximum concentrations in wastewater and wwtps were in sweden inf 880 ng l and eff 1100 ng l czech inf 800 ng l and eff 1110 ng l and germany inf 765 ng l and eff 681 ng l while fluoxetine was inf 155 in spain and inf 67 ng l in new zealand table 5 by comparing the concentrations of lipid regulating drugs in wastewater and wwtps with those in drinking and surface waters the data showed extensive increases in concentrations of bezafibrate to two or three times where it reported inf 2840 ng l inf 3445 ng l eff 485 ng l eff 855 ng l in méxico and inf 1635 ng l eff 855 ng l in germany this is attributed to wastewater wwtps and stps act as the main sources of lipid regulating drugs which produced from discharges of wastes endocrine disrupting substances such as bisphenol a bpa in wastewater and wwtps their higher concentrations were reported in both influents of china 1527 1 ng l and italy 305 83 ng l and in the effluents of china were 623 6 ng l and italy were 206 81 ng l table 5 globally about 559 pharmaceutical residues have been detected in wwtps influents effluents wastewater matrices sewage and sludge by 47 fig 10 illustrates the potential distributions and numbers of substances detected in wastewater matrices in each country worldwide according to the review prepared by 47 there is a close and significance relationship between wwtps effluents and surface water where most of wwtps discharges into surface waters directly such as lakes and rivers according to national survey performed by the u s geological survey a variety of natural organic and synthetic compounds such as pharmaceuticals steroids surfactants flame retardants fragrances plasticizers and other chemicals have been detected in the vicinity of municipal wastewater discharges and livestock agricultural facilities and the maximum concentration of investigated substances were from 0 19 μg l to 0 30 μg l 183 worldwide effluents from the wwtps contaminate about 25 of lakes and rivers 260 5 1 the mediterranean basin as a case study on the occurrence and distribution and of ppcps in wastewater and wwtps the area of mediterranean basin contains lower upper middle and high income countries is leading to variation in demographic and populations industrialization and economic growth disposal and reuses of wastewater water and wastewater treatment processes 261 as a result there is a variation in water management and policies for each country differ than others as follow a high income developed countries such as france and italy treat about 70 of produced wastewater b upper middle income countries such as turkey croatia and algeria treat about 38 of wastewater and c lower middle income countries e g tunisia morocco and syria treat about 28 of wastewater 262 263 the mediterranean basin covering european countries classified in the top of 10 producers and exporters of medicines in europe in 2016 such as spain italy and france 4 5 and 10 respectively 264 based on official reports some of countries such as spain italy france slovenia and greece were registered a considerable amounts of drug consumption 265 a review provided by desbiolles and coworkers 243 discussed the contamination of aquatic environment by 43 pharmaceutical substances including their different classes such as β blockers antibiotics sex hormones anti depressants lipid regulators and anti inflammatory drugs occurring in natural surface waters and sewage running off into the mediterranean basin in addition to watersheds and the mediterranean sea they selected these substances based on some criteria all substances should be reported in an international context 266 and each compound should be fulfilled at least one of the following a mainly distributed in solutions i e log kow 3 e g acetaminophen norfloxacin metronidazole b at environmental level should have an ecotoxicological effect at tens μg l 41 and c in conventional wwtps their removal efficiencies are low 20 e g atenolol carbamazepine 251 occurrence study was carried out relying on database from publications in international journals between 2002 and 2018 the total ppcps concentrations values of this database were 6072 included 2964 for rivers 753 for sea water 904 for wwtps influents and 1451 for wwtps effluents effluents and influents data were obtained from municipal and domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps fig 11 fig 11 shows the map of geographical sites of wwtps sea and rivers samples referenced in the 67 papers for pharmaceutical quantities in the mediterranean basin their spatial distribution and occurrences were mainly in the european mediterranean countries accounting about 83 of the collected data as follows france 15 articles greece 11 articles spain 28 articles and italy 14 articles besides this map spotlights on the deficiency of published data in worldwide reports and scientific papers in other countries such as albania libya morocco and little data in other countries in southern mediterranean basin in the mediterranean countries the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and frequency of detection in influents and effluents of wwtps are shown in fig 12 fig 12 shows large number of points referring to several studies that have been carried out to investigate the occurrence of antibiotics and their ingredients in the mediterranean basin fig 11 indicates the frequency of detection fd of 5 antibiotic substances of 10 which were measured 90 of total selected cases at median concentrations ranged from 90 to 461 ng l in samples of wwtps antibiotic class was found in several regions and countries such as china europe and america as reported by 6 54 267 269 analgesics and anti inflammatories in the mediterranean basin are considered the most abundant substances in wastewater due to their high rate of consumption in these countries the results revealed that the median values ranged from 410 for ketoprofen propionic acid class to 10 000 ng l for aspirin acetylsalicylic acid and the frequency of detection was from 80 to 100 but for acetaminophen paracetamol and ibuprofen the frequency of detection was from 5 to 10 251 in influents and effluents of sewage waters it was found quite low levels of estrogens below 10 ng l in eff and about 50 ng l in inf with fd about 70 80 although hormones were a considerable spreading due to their endocrine disruptive influences they were less frequently studied in wwtps water because of their log kow ranging from 3 to 4 2 and have a tendency to be slightly in sludge 243 fig 13 shows the psychotropic drugs as highly studied carbamazepine anticonvulsant antiepileptic drug their quantities in mediterranean wwtps which are ranging from hundreds to 1000 ng l in inlets and outlets were confirmed by data published in usa and europe 108 270 lipid regulators which are considered as β blockers were detected in 70 to 85 of studied cases the most studied medicines in class c cardiovascular system were atenolol and gemfibrozil at their highest values from hundreds to 1000 ng l respectively although propranolol and metoprolol are excreted as their parent origin form at only 10 271 they were identified in sewage with concentrations about 50 and 200 ng l and for propranolol and metoprolol respectively urinary drugs such as metoprolol and its two metabolites o desmethylmetoprolol and α hydroxymetoprolol and their metabolization pathways were studied 272 demonstration the potential occurrence of pharmaceutical residues phrs indicates that the mediterranean sea becomes a vulnerable ecosystem due to its location as a basin for receiving huge amounts of pollutants 5 2 usa as a case study on the occurrence and distribution of ppcps in wwtps u s environmental protection agency epa announced that there are more than public 14 591 wwtps in the usa in the service of 226 4 million people reported in 2012 273 in the usa thousands of prescribed and non prescribed drugs such as illicit medicines are annually released into the aquatic environment in the form of 35 300 million gallons of wastewater about 500 million tons of animal manure sources and more than 8 million of dry biosolids 274 275 different classes of ppcps comprise antihypertensives psychoactives antibiotics analgesics and illicit drugs reported at ng l to μg l introduced wwtps in the usa fig 14 278 280 in 2011 about 262 5 million of drugs administrations were dispensed in the usa leading to 5 prescriptions for every 6 persons 281 the studies revealed that trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin are among the highest ordained antibiotics in the usa and are the most commonly detected compounds in wastewater systems 278 282 283 trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were loaded at 0 39 kg d and 0 71 kg d respectively into a wwtp to serve about 650 000 persons in las vegas nevada usa 284 furthermore it was found that a first generation of antiallergenic medicine diphenhydramine was detected at 530 ng l in influents of wastewater during elevated seasonal allergies seasonal allergic rhinitis in texas usa 282 recently in the usa a nationwide large scale study including 50 large wwtps covering 20 states that treat about 17 of total wastewater production found that the antipsychotics and antihypertensives were more frequently detected with higher concentrations than other prioritized pharmaceutical classes 274 globally psychoactives psychopharmaceutical or psychotropic drugs are among the most widely used drugs it was found that in the usa the total consumption of psychoactive drugs raised from 1998 to 2008 by 78 285 and reported at the highest selling classes with 14 billion among prescription medications in sales in 2009 286 an antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole is one of the most administrated drugs in the usa its mass loading to wwtps was found to be 6 46 mg d 1000 persons in new york 280 in 2013 sertraline quetiapine fluoxetine lorazepam bupropion and alprazolam were the top selling prescribed psychoactive drugs in the usa and the mass loading were found to be 1 66 78 9 mg d 1000 persons in a wwtp in new york 280 acetaminophen ibuprofen carbamazepine and the most prescribed antidepressants such as fluoxetine citalopram and sertraline for specific characteristics see section 2 were the most frequently detected antipsychotics in wastewater in the usa 280 282 283 287 among narcotic opioid analgesics despite the relatively high consumption of hydrocodone detected in the western midwest and the south of usa while oxycodone was measured in the northeast 288 according to chiaia and coworkers 289 they reported greatest quantities of oxycodone than hydrocodone in the selected samples across the usa in the usa from 2000 to 2010 the total production of oxycodone and hydrocodone was exceeded by 300 to 55 000 kg and 90 000 kg respectively 290 the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc reported that there were more than 165 315 million illicit drug users over the world 291 and in the usa in 2013 about 9 4 of the population age 12 years used illicit medicines 292 in 2011 the most famous illicit drugs such as cocaine and cannabis the usa produced about 94 tons of cocaine approximately 10 5 of the total global production 291 frequently the effluent discharges are mixed of unchanged parent substances metabolites or ingredients their conjugates and many other wwtp derived transformed products fig 15 274 278 280 283 293 historically discharges of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment was as early as 1977 where it was reported that about 28 69 kg of salicylic acid was daily released to the missouri river in north america in kansas city through the effluents of wastewater from a wwtp that is treating about 300 millions of liter per day mld wastewater for serving 600 000 people 260 294 subsequently trace levels ng l to μg l of different pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics antihypertensives analgesics psychoactives and their selected metabolites and ingredients were detected in 139 sewage impacted streams covering 32 states in the usa 51 logically once pharmaceutical substances released into the environment will be significantly transported for long distances in surface waters through different water sources where venlafaxine was detected with high concentration of 102 ng l till at 8 4 km downstream from effluent stream of a single source 287 in recent studies several compounds including atenolol gemfibrozil carbamazepine diphenhydramine cocaine and sulfamethoxazole were detected closely to the shore sites of muir beach to monterey bay 295 and san francisco bay california usa 296 antihypertensives psychoactives and antibiotics were the most detected substances among selected 63 substances at higher concentrations in effluents collected from 50 wwtps through the usa 274 a round 16 psychoactive compounds and their selected metabolites discharged from a wwtp in albany new york was detected at 1542 mg d 1000 inhabitants this quantity is equivalent to yearly discharges of 56 3 kg psychoactives into the river water 280 yearly discharges of methamphetamine and azithromycin from a wwtp into received water in nevada was about 0 05 0 11 kg and 1 4 kg respectively while the amount of methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma in receiving water in south carolina was 0 02 kg 297 nevertheless about 6 5 kg of illicit compounds comprise morphine methamphetamine mdma methadone cocaine and their ingredients and metabolites were released into the river water from a wastewater treatment plant in new york 279 also the discharges of pharmaceuticals through wastewater effluents vary with the seasons as well as that was described for influents in winter the concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in effluents can be greater than in summer season attributed to significant human consumption and low biodegradation of drugs in winter season 298 6 occurrence of ppcps in groundwater comparing to other freshwater resources the significant contamination of groundwater resources by nano and micro ppcps is a growing interest and poorly understood recently groundwater supplies the most trustworthy perennial source of clean freshwater on the land it sustains levels and flows in lakes and rivers necessary for the health of groundwater dependent ecosystems and in many regions of the globe becomes the main source of drinking water 2 on the basis of the reviewed articles it is found that concentrations of pharmaceuticals in groundwater are lower than in surface water peng and coworkers 322 reported that the 52 target studied pharmaceuticals sulfamethoxazole fluconazole erythromycin methyl paraben salicylic acid bisphenol and triclosan were the most observed at ng l levels in 70 selected groundwater samples obtained near to multiple landfill locations in guangzhou china lapworth and coworkers 35 studied the occurrence of five frequently pharmaceuticals in groundwater their work was carried out in 14 countries through europe asia north america and the middle east their results indicated that the average quantities of caffeine diclofenac ibuprofen carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were 9800 ng l n 14 121 ng l n 11 1500 ng l n 14 5000 ng l n 23 and 252 ng l n 15 respectively lin and coworkers 323 studied the occurrences of concern emerging contaminants and their presence correlation in groundwater with possible sources of pollution in taiwan they reported that the results exhibited most of the 50 selected substances in addition to perfluorinated compounds were at the ng l level except for acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole and 17α ethinylestradiol were at 1036 ng l 1820 ng l and 1822 ng l respectively from the results it was shown that the ppcps which reported high quantities in groundwater were convenient with the results obtained from studies conducted in other countries sulphonamides are consider as one of the most studied classes and were reported higher concentrations in most studies 324 326 anticonvulsants e g carbamazepine analgesics and anti inflammatories medicines such as diclofenac paracetamol salicylic acid and ibuprofen are the most common detected in groundwater because they are the widely consumed drugs studies reported that salicylic acid was found at concentration ranged from 43 7 to 2014 7 ng l with detection of 98 in guangzhou china 322 loos and coworkers 327 reported the predominantly used antiepileptic carbamazepine was detected in 42 of groundwater specimens obtained from 23 european countries from 164 locations with a highest concentration of 390 ng l the frequencies of detection of metabolites and lipid regulators in groundwater such as clofibric acid gemfibrozil and bezafibrate were lower than those of anti inflammatories and antibiotics 322 the chalk aquifers consider an essential source of drinking water for northern europe countries in addition to its sustainability for the ecosystem of surface water in this region lapworth et al 328 studied the presentence of ppcps and their transformation products in the chalk groundwater of france and england the results revealed the highest concentrations in england were for bisphenol a 100 μg l n butylbenzenesulfonamide bbsa and diethyl phthalate dep pesticides diphenylamine atrazine and its breakdown products desethyl atrazine dea anthracene and caffeine also in france the concentrations of detected substances were higher but lower than the detected substances in england where the highest results were for diethylhexylphthalate dehp and n butylbenzenesulfonamide bbsa and bisphenol a 1 4100 μg l demonstrating that 20 of 32 studied substances weren t revealed any results such as diethyltoluamide deet and anthracene in addition to ibuprofen and parabens novel study for the concentrations and seasonal variability of ppcps in 8 drinking water 17 surface water and 12 groundwater samples collected from lagos state southwest of nigeria the median concentrations of ppcps were drinking water 424 ng l groundwater 948 ng l surface water 4660 ng l the results revealed that amoxicillin antibiotic was the most prevalent detected compound owing to its potential effect on development of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains it was observed a seasonal variation in the quantities of selected compounds between collected samples in the summer the rain season and in the winter the dry season the authors attributed these variations to several characteristic factors such as dilution produced from extensive rainfall basic agriculture activities in addition to the usage of pharmaceuticals in the local community 14 fig 16 illustrates the pathways sources and fate of ppcps in the subsurface groundwater using source pathway receptor framework 35 sources of ppcps in the aquatic environment which may affect groundwater can be divided into point and diffuse sources of pollution major sources of ppcps in the environmental systems include examination of key origins paths and fate of ppcps in the underground that can cause to contamination of groundwater are showing in fig 16 spotlighting those sources which are suggested to have the highest effect on groundwater resources 6 1 france as a case study on ppcps emerging contaminants in groundwater the french ministry of ecology and the french national agency for water and aquatic environments have started a nationwide exploration survey on emerging contaminants such as ppcps this study included analysis of 411 emerging contaminants in the collected samples from 494 groundwater locations across france fig 17 329 the study included the parent molecules and their transformation products where 44 of the targeted compounds 180 substances were detected in at least one sampling site 55 substances were detected in 1 of samples and both of emerging and regulated compounds were detected unregulated substances such as acetaminophen bisphenol a carbamazepine dioxins furans perfluorinated compounds triazine and caffeine were found in 10 of the analysed samples the threshold of toxicological concern of 0 1 μg l was detected for some of triazine transformation products bisphenol a and tolyltriazole the obtained results could help in environmental regulators and water resource managers to develop accurate policies related to the presence and distribution of emerging and regulated pollutants in groundwater according to the types of compounds or categories of use they divided the compounds into 19 groups and 4 main categories e g pesticides agricultural industrial compounds and other emerging contaminants about 131 pharmaceutical compounds 17 steroids and hormones 37 antibiotics 5 biocides 6 non prescribed medicines and 66 other prescribed medicines 103 pesticides 29 fungicides 26 insecticides and 48 herbicides 143 industrial substances dioxins and furans 36 pcbs 25 dyes 10 plasticizers 11 flame retardants 13 perfluorinated compounds and 48 other industrial compounds and 34 other emerging pollutants 10 cosmetics 13 lifestyle products 4 disinfection by products 3 organotins and 4 toxins were explored in the groundwater collected samples 68 of the analysed samples exhibited positive results for a minimum one drug derivative and 60 pharmaceutical products where about 45 8 of the targeted pharmaceutical products were detected at least once in groundwater the existence of ppcps was highest in areas where the main sources of groundwater is usually urban industrial or urban agricultural with an average number of pharmaceutical products measured per sample of 2 16 and 2 24 respectively compared to 1 33 in natural environments and 1 63 in agricultural stations acetaminophen a non prescription analgesic was the most frequently detected 27 carbamazepine 14 6 metformin 7 8 tramadol 7 3 oxazepam 4 3 completed the series of the top 5 of most detected compounds the most 5 quantified compounds were oxazepam 5 6 metformin 8 3 tramadol 8 7 acetaminophen 15 4 carbamazepine 16 8 in the fall acetaminophen was found significantly greater in the spring than in the fall while their quantity was lesser for the other top 5 compounds sulfamethoxazole erythromycin and metronidazole were the most frequently quantified antibiotics in sampling sites the most frequently quantified pharmaceuticals were acetaminophen 29 carbamazepine 26 5 tramadol 11 metformin 10 3 and oxazepam 9 the results indicated the significant influence of the veterinary use of drugs especially antibiotic residues in livestock on groundwater underneath agricultural land for some of ppcps the obtained results were in agreement with those reported in the literatures sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and acetaminophen are usually reported as being among the most frequently detected compounds in groundwater 35 148 7 regulations guidelines and policies of ppcps in the environmental systems most of pharmaceutical compounds are synthesized to be metabolic or biologically active and persist in both of human and animal body even at low concentrations to accomplish their target effect 26 330 due to their direct and indirect potential risks international organizations authorities and governments have administrated sets of guidelines and strategies to regulate and control the problems of different ppcps in aquatic systems we have categorized the interventions taken by regulators as follow a regulations and directives proposed by the european union eu b strategies and recommendations by international organizations c legislations guidelines declared by state governments countries 7 1 regulations and directives proposed by the european union eu several policies and directives have been published by european union eu related to emerging pollutants e g ppcps and other contaminants that may cause a potential threat to humans and environment summarized as follow in 2000 the official journal of the european communities ojec has announced the first official regulations and guidelines to spotlight on compounds that can pose a significant risk to human health and the environment 24 additionally in 2000 the same year the european union adopted the water framework directive wfd which takes a pioneer approach to protect water matrices the wfd included the surface water watch list wl that comprises potential water pollutants which should be determined by the eu member states and determined if they cause a potential threat to the aquatic systems and if the environmental quality standards eqs should be declared for them 24 in 2008 the second regulations and directives announced the priority of 33 compounds and the suggested environmental quality standards eqs 331 in 2013 after five years the official journal of the european union ojeu released a new directive to recommend the detection and elimination of another selected 45 substances that can lead to side effects on humans and the environmental systems 332 directive 2013 39 ec enclosed the first watch list wl has detected and analysed 10 substances where the number of detected compounds can increase to 14 as a maximum 52 selection of substances depends on the accessible data that means whether these compounds can cause a potential threat to the aquatic systems and if the required data for these substances isn t sufficient to know if they can cause risks or side effects on the aquatic systems or not in 2015 the development of first wl under the environmental quality standards directive was published and proposed additional 7 substances 333 in the first wl three pharmaceutical substances comprised e2 ee2 and diclofenac after identifying the compounds involved in the first announced watch list the joint research center jrc of the eu advised that five compounds should be eliminated from the updated watch list involving diclofenac drug owing to the accessibility of sufficient data in 2018 the joint research center jrc policy report updated the watch list to comprise three new additional compounds therefore the list encompassed eight groups of substances which contain a list of compounds such as ciprofloxacin clarithromycin erythromycin azithromycin amoxicillin e1 e2 and ee2 the new european commission plan against antimicrobial resistance compounds included additional antibiotics in the new watch list 334 335 in 2020 the european commission has issued a new commission implementation decision 336 the new decision of eu strategic approach ceased the potential monitoring of e1 e2 ee2 neonicotinoid group and macrolide antibiotics e g azithromycin clarithromycin erythromycin this is attributed to that the persistent duration of these compounds has reached four years as reported by directive 2008 105 ec 52 7 2 strategies and recommendations by international organizations recently there are several international committees and organizations that have argued the issue of ppcps in the environment and stated the legislations and guidelines to regulate and control the existence and distribution of ppcps in environmental systems as example the european commission ec has obligated the assessment of environmental risk of human and veterinary drugs in order to support approval marketing authorization for all of new medicines moreover the european union strategic approach eusa completes the newest approved approach on endocrine disrupting compounds edcs along with other proposed initial actions such as evaluation of the urban waste water treatment recast of drinking water regulations and reuse of water 337 the european commission ec adopted six actions or plans to regulate and control the problems of ppcps occurrences in environmental systems in brief the first plan action advised controlling of pharmaceutical substances that could cause a significant risk on the environment this will reduce and solve the problem from its source the second action based on the idea of green pharmaceuticals where the ec encourages ppcps industries to enhance more environmentally friendly substances the third action the european commission proposed improvement the current models and technologies of environmental risk assessment through potential collaboration with different agencies such as member states e g the netherlands sweden and the european medicines agency ema the fourth action the european commission will take an appropriate action to reduce pharmaceuticals wastes to prevent or limit their risks on the environment through improvement the waste management system moreover the ec confirmed the importance of development and application of new technologies for wastewater treatment especially at certain sources e g livestock farming to minimize the releases of ppcps into environmental compartments the fifth action the eu should increase studies for quantification of pharmaceuticals in environmental systems finally the ec will take an appropriate action on behave of filling the knowledge gaps and missing information especially research on i the toxicity behavior and fate of pharmaceutical active substances in the environment ii the linking between the presence of antimicrobials in environmental systems and the fate and development of antimicrobial gens iii the significant chronic effects of ppcps in lowest quantities on the environment and human health and iv improvement of cost effective new methods for minimizing the existence of ppcps in the environment the world health organization who in 2012 has advised that the possibility of health risk of ppcps can be estimated by implementation the minimum therapeutic dose mtd 40 with taking in account the number of daily doses the mtd is usually equivalent to the lowest or advised prescribed therapeutic dose 26 the implementation of mtd can be valuable in the developing of conservative screening values and for risk assessment owing to absence loss of accessible information on the toxicological effects of medicinals in water 40 the toxicological effects of ppcps depend on the exposure s duration and the potential concentration of chemicals within the target organism the organization of economic co operation and development oecd in 2019 has applied legislations to limit and regulate the presence of ppcps in the environment 338 the oceb has established five economical guidelines and policies to govern the presence of ppcps in aquatic systems and to maintain the water quality 338 the strategic approach to international chemicals management saicm which is a global multi stakeholder and multi sectoral policy frameworks offers a directive to discuss and tackle the challenges related to the authorization and application of national policies to safely regulate chemicals around the world the saicm was launched in dubai on february 02 2006 339 is one of the newest additions in order to respond to the global objective of the 2002 world summit on sustainable development in johannesburg to produce and use chemicals in a way that minimizes their undesired harmful effects on human and ecosystem health 7 3 legislations guidelines reported by state governments countries number of countries of the member states e g the netherlands sweden the organization of economic co operation and development oecd 338 countries germany switzerland south korean the united kingdom united states and australia and others e g belgium france have applied legislations and control measures to organize the problems of ppcps and other organic compounds in the environment table 6 8 challenges and future perspectives the world s water security and natural environment have been severely impacted by the uncontrollable dumping of ppcps in the aquatic bodies deterioration of water quality and global warming this review presented an upgraded comprehensive summary on the occurrence and distribution of a large number of ppcps from different geographical regions north america europe asia africa and other regions worldwide using of ppcps are growing and expected to continous increase owing to the growing of world population this has prompted the globe to investigate new environmentally acceptable pathways for efficient monitoring and remediation of these emerging contaminants to meet the sustainable development goals additional efforts in the conversion recycling of wastewater to energy are required in the current environment the future lies in putting more emphasis on the most favored solutions for wastewater reclamation thence based on the author s knowledge and study the following aspects should be explored in future studies to defeat the confronted challenges promotion of innovative pathways for converting ppcps laden wastewater into value added resources for industrial purposes integrating data driven technologies such as machine learning ml and artificial neural networks with wastewater management for better process optimization higher recyclability rates and enhanced final product quality could be one of the potential future directions for data quantification the implementation of a standard framework with continual checks for wastewater remediation could be a viable option it is necessary to have a long term approach to minimizing waste at the source changing people s attitudes about wastewater dumping into aquatic bodies and making them aware of the benefits of energy production to address concerns such as environmental pollution global warming and climate change assessment the long term impact of ppcps on the human health and ecosystems awareness campaigns social media campaigns and non governmental organizations should encourage and provide information on efficient wastewater to energy conversion the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in the greater disposal of wastewater hence more focus should be given towards wastewater surveillance recycling of wastewater in accord with the concept of zero liquid discharge for realizing a circular economy during the covid 19 pandemic a massive consumption of some drugs as antivirals antibiotics antiparasitics antiprotozoals and glucocorticoids used in the treatment of this virus has increased the discharge of pharmaceutical residues in different aqueous matrices 357 conventional treatment systems fail to efficiently remove these contaminants from water matrices in this regard antiviral drugs show increases higher than 70 of their concentration in urban wastewater compared before 358 and during the pandemic 359 as example before the pandemic azithromycin antibiotic concentration in surface waters was 4 3 ng l and during the pandemic it increased up to 935 ng l other examples kuroda et al 359 reported that water treated through urban wwtp and the concentrations of these drugs and their metabolites were favipiravir 4231 ng l lopinavir 730 ng l ribavirin 7402 ng l and remdesivir 319 ng l during the current pandemic the average dose of favipiravir drug is 1600 mg day and the predicted environmental concentration is 64 ng l and its main metabolite t705m1 is 4248 ng l in domestic wastewater 359 additionally the average dose of lopinavir received by coronavirus patients is currently 800 mg day which generates an expected environmental concentration of 880 ng l of the parent compound and 2840 ng l of its metabolites in domestic wastewater 360 according to romano and coworkers 361 hydroxychloroquine is one of the highest growth rates of sales during 2020 in contrast to the same period in 2019 this is related to the high consumption during the highest peaks of the pandemic and the maximum consumption value was observed in countries such as portugal at the end of march 2021 the same approach was employed by kuroda and coworkers 359 where they estimated that the concentrations of hydroxychloroquine as anti covid 19 drug in surface water will reach to 78 3 ng l and in domestic wastewater will be 833 ng l

12542,pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps residues are known to occur widely in the aquatic environments of industrialized and developing countries considerable progress has been made regarding to study of their exposure and distribution in aquatic environment the spatial distribution and transformation of ppcps have been investigated in the aquatic systems of different countries covering the five un regions as a result the objectives of this review are focused on a the global occurrence of ppcps residues in aquatic systems particularly in drinking tap water surface water groundwater and wastewater treatment plants wwtps b widely prescribed pharmaceutical classes such as antibiotics antidepressants β blockers lipid regulators nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids etc due to their potential adverse influences on the aquatic ecosystems and human health c the spatial distribution of ppcps in water bodies based on recently published data d different regions in the world e g usa china and mediterranean basin as case studies of contaminated areas e the relation of occurrences with specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds f the legislation and regulations implemented by countries states governments were summarized and discussed and finally g future perspectives for research on ppcps in the aquatic environment which are explained regarded to the research gaps in current knowledge the findings of this review indicate that the concentrations of ppcps in the influents and effluents of wwtps of the selected regions are much higher than in other water matrices additionally there are significant variations in ppcps concentrations between different countries and regions due to certain reasons graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ppcps aquatic environment characteristics frequently detected compounds legislations and regulations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years many of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have been widely investigated due to their continuous release into aquatic systems and newly developed state of the art analytical techniques ppcps are recognized as emerging contaminants in water resources and considered one of the most hazardous active ingredients of medicinal products used in human and veterinary medicines the occurrence and distribution of ppcps in aquatic environment particularly in tap drinking water surface water groundwater and wastewater have intrigued the scientific community ppcps are natural or synthetic chemicals used in treating and preventing diseases in humans and animals in the form of prescription drugs ppcps are frequently detected in drinking water sewage treatment plants stps wastewater treatment plants wwtps and groundwater 1 2 due to their universal consumption improper manufacturer disposal low human metabolic capability and biologically active structures 3 7 after use the major sources of ppcps in the aquatic systems are mainly via sewage treatment plants stps wwtps effluents landfill leaching improper disposal and manufacturing processes 8 11 usually pharmaceuticals are not completely and accurately eliminated during sewage and wastewater treatment processes therefore they are detected in surface water at concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l the physicochemical properties of many pharmaceutical substances render them not easily to be eliminated by conventional processes as observed by their existence in tap drinking water 12 although most of ppcps are less persistent than legacy persistent organic pollutants many of them are not readily degraded due to the massive discharge rates recently there is growing scientific concern regarding to ppcps occurrence fate and potential effects on the aquatic environment and human health major concern is attributed to their existence in the environment such as endocrine disruptors development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and carcinogenic activity in addition to human risks of long term chronic exposure at trace levels 5 13 14 one of the most problems for the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment maybe lead to the development of new species or strains of microorganism e g bacteria algae fungi and viruses which resist the effects of antibiotics known as antibiotic resistant bacteria 15 currently about 4000 of pharmaceutical substances are accessible in the global markets with annual world consumption of approximately 100 000 tons y 3 in 2010 the growth of antibiotics used for treatment of livestock reached 63 151 tons and is predicted to rise by 67 in 2030 16 from 2000 to 2015 the using of antibiotics in 76 countries were raised by 65 in terms of defined daily doses ddd with about 21 35 billion ddd while the rate of consumption per day increased by 39 17 in china it was reported that the percentage of antibiotics use 41 60 are higher than recommended by the world health organization who 30 18 globally in 2015 antibiotic consumption reached 34 8 billion ddd with an unusual rise of 65 from 2000 that reported 21 1billion ddd 19 in 2020 global medicines use reached 4 5 trillion doses 20 where in this year approximately more than half of the world s population consumed 1 dose person day of drugs this higher consumption rate was reported by china india indonesia and brazil due to their high populations and increasing demand on animal proteins usage of medicines in middle eastern and african countries reached 500 billion doses in 2020 20 the european markets alone contain approximately more than 3000 pharmaceutical substances 21 approximatley 20 of the total world production of ppcps are produced from china appearanltly the majority of counties have a minimal or no specific programs to assess ppcps use in the environment and food products 22 a web of science a tool from clarivate analytics 2022 search performed on july 20 2022 using the keywords of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water resulted in 5077 articles fig 1 presents an analysis of the number of publications on this topic per year with the number of studies on the topic of concern being shown by region combined asia and europe represent more than 72 of the total articles published between 2014 and 2022 whereas china and spain are the most published countries in each continent respectively notably only 4 of published studies originated from africa where south africa is the most published country 37 80 fig 1 this analysis draws an increasing interest from researchers and organizations which implies that more comprehensive studies should be conducted the presence of ppcps and their metabolites in environmental compartments has become a global challenge that requires local and global multi sectors and multi stakeholder approaches to reduce prevent and manage their entry into the environment for example a recent policy aimed to address this issue known as the strategic approach to international chemicals management saicm 23 both the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the european union eu have listed and developed the priority pollutants by identifying a variety of chemicals existed in stormwater runoff and wastewaters that may cause a risk to receiving water matrices the eu water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec in the year 2000 identified the initial list of 33 priority substances to be applied as a control measure for the next two decades 24 in the year 2007 some of ppcps were recognized as future emerging priority substances such as carbamazepine diclofenac musks and iopamidol some other candidates are proposed to be included in this list such as bisphenol a triclosan ibuprofen clofibric acid and phthalates 12 25 owing to the large number and chemical natures of ppcps the environment agency ea of wales and england suggested a ranking system for these compounds based on their relative risk which aimed to identify compounds with a potential to cause a risk to the aquatic ecosystem this proposed ranking system depends on the combining of criteria and procedures such as risk assessment persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity occurrences result from different countries employed analytical methods and concentrations of ppcps from different therapeutic classes 26 in this regard the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north east atlantic ospar commission and dynamic selection and prioritisation mechanism for hazardous substances dynamec provided another list of priority compounds such as trimethoprim tramadol thioridazine tamoxifen sulfamethoxazole procyclidine paracetamol mebeverine lofepramine fluoxetine fenofibrate1 diclofenac clotrimazole and aminophylline according to ospar commission 2002 27 to fill the gap of knowledge this review is critically focused on the following areas a the global occurrence of ppcp residues in aquatic systems particularly in drinking tap water surface water groundwater and wwtps mainly in the period from 2012 to 2022 b widely prescribed pharmaceutical classes such as antibiotics antidepressants β blockers lipid regulators nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids etc due to their potential risk effects on human and wildlife c the spatial distribution of ppcps in water bodies based on recently published data d different regions in the world e g usa china and the mediterranean basin as case studies of contaminated areas e the relations of occurrences with specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds f reviewing the emphasized guidelines and legislations that are implemented by countries states governments to regulate the use and discharge ppcps and finally g future perspectives for research on ppcps in the aquatic systems 1 1 classification of emerging contaminants in this section emerging contaminants are classified into different groups number of groups were varied from reference to another as illustrated in table 1 emerging contaminants includes personal care products pharmaceuticals steroid hormones surfactants and industrial chemicals each group includes subclasses as reported in table 1 1 2 physicochemical properties of ppcps different ppcps possess wide variation in their physical and chemical properties therefore wide behaviour variation could be assumed hydrophobicity water solubility volatility etc which could contribute to ppcps fate occurrence and distribution into the aquatic environment 34 35 additionally dissociation constants pka octanol water partition coefficients log kow organic carbon based sorption coefficients log koc solid water distribution coefficients log kd also influence the fate and behaviour of ppcps by varying partition sorption adsorption biodegradation and photodegradation 34 36 a lot of ppcps have a basic and or acidic functional groups in their structures therefore neutral cationic anionic or zwitterion forms can be exist in different environmental ph conditions 3 37 these based on the values of kow and pka which are widely varied as shown in table 2 these functional groups may regulate the behaviour of ppcps in aquatic environment moreover henry s coefficient kh is also called the air water partition coefficient which is an important partition parameter for dissolved contaminants in the environment it usually acts on the volatilization as a function of the concentrations of contaminants in solutions and the contaminant s partial pressure previous studies suggested that the removal of some pharmaceutical residues phrs by volatilization could be neglected owing to low values of henry coefficient 38 39 table 1 1 3 potential distribution of ppcps in the aquatic environment in different regions of the world the spatial distribution of ppcps in the aquatic systems varies significantly depending on their consumption rates and their mobility properties many studies and surveys confirmed the widespread of ppcps in the aquatic environment municipal wastewater and effluents that have been classified as major sources of these compounds in water bodies fig 2 40 to date available studies have stated that concentrations of phrs in groundwater surface waters and treated water are below 100 ng l and their concentrations in treated water are less than 50 ng l 40 the first occurrence of medicines in aquatic environment in treated wastewater was reported in the usa in kansas city in 1976 where clofibric acid was found in the range of 800 2000 ng l 41 subsequently in 1981 the presence of 25 pharmaceutical substances were investigated in the river lee which consider the source of drinking water for north london with concentration approximately 1000 ng l assuming no degradation or metabolism processes occurred 12 42 from that time across the globe many studies have quantified the presence of ppcps and their ingredients in environmental compartments in this regard studies exhibited that the administration and discharge of ppcps in the aquatic environment vary between countries and between different areas in the same country meanwhile the presence and concentrations of ppcps in wwtps influents fluctuate between different regions according to consumption patterns the socioeconomic composition of the population that provides the sewage and wastewater treatment plants climatic conditions and water uses 43 44 in addition the distribution and quantities of ppcps in the effluents of wwtps depend on their physicochemical properties e g pka log kow volatility solubility etc properties characteristics of wastewater influents e g acidity alkalinity total dissolved solid tds dissolved oxygen do turbidity chemical oxygen demand cod etc adsorption sorption of ppcps to suspended solids and applied treatment processes 45 46 germany s ministry for the environment 47 have prepared a review for investigation of ppcps in the aquatic environment for 71 countries of all five un regions fig 3 they have found about 631 of pharmaceuticals were detected above analytical detection limits of the 713 tested substances in which at least the concentration of one substance was measured in the environment was presented in the literatures they found more than 100 of different compounds that have been detected in the aquatic environment tap drinking water surface water and groundwater in the usa and many of european countries fig 3 and more than 30 substances were detected in other eastern and western european countries asia the pacific and in gru lac latin america and caribbean states in addition they declared that 30 pharmaceutical substances were detected in most countries of eastern europe africa and the pacific in a global critical evaluation about 203 of ppcps were reported in 41 different countries 48 national japanese monitoring of 12 different medicines were detected in 37 rivers and their sum concentrations were 626 ng l 49 petrović and coworkers 50 applied a multiresidue method for the analysis of 81 pharmaceutical drugs from different therapeutic classes in different water matrices i e water surface underground and wastewater from serbia forty seven compounds of 81 drugs were found in four different types of analyzed water a nationwide usa first study investigated about 95 of ppcps and other organic compounds in 139 different streams from 30 states during 1999 2000 the detected organic wastewater compounds were represented a wide range of different resources including industrial anthropogenic agricultural origins and uses with 82 of the 95 compounds being detected 51 other previous reviews 3 4 12 52 54 explored many tools and environmental conditions about ppcps of occurrences data based on the available data that was previously published western european countries such as spain largest contribution germany france italy switzerland portugal and england have detected ppcps in their aquatic environment 48 asian countries were not far away from that issue whereas many studies carried out in china japan malaysia and south korea as well however in the rest of the world the conducted studies are limited or may be missing this indicates that the detection of ppcps in some developing regions such as africa are of significant interest 2 characteristics of frequently detected ppcps and their relationship with potential occurrence in aquatic systems 2 1 occurrence of antibiotics antibiotics are one of the most valuable drugs where they are considered a significant pharmaceuticals class that is usually used in human and veterinary medicines globally the consumption of antibiotics has been evaluated to be approximately 100 000 200 000 tons annually 55 throughout the world more than 250 substances are registered as antibiotic drugs for human health and animals use 56 over the past 10 years according to data analysis from literatures regional and national surveillance systems from 71 different countries reported that antibiotics usage are growing by 30 worldwide mainly owing to rising consumption in the low and middle income countries 57 after humans or animals intake antibiotics may be partially metabolized and then metabolites are excreted into the urine and feces in germany it was reported that all antibiotics had a metabolization rate about 30 58 this is leading to say that approximately 70 are excreted without change and discharged into sewage systems in a recent work pei et al reported that only about 15 of antibiotic drugs are metabolized and absorbed while 85 are unaltered and released into environmental systems 59 the top 10 list of generic antibiotic drugs are sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim ciprofloxacin amoxicillin clindamycin doxycycline amoxicillin and clavulanate cephalexin metronidazole levofloxacin and azithromycin 60 in the last couple of decades a lot of studies have been carried out to investigate the occurrence of antibiotics in wwtps most of studies have been concentrated on a limited number of antibiotics between 2 and 33 target compounds 56 studies about comparing between varied countries are relatively absent but in case of a single country such as united kingdom sweden greece portugal croatia and china the drugs were analysed while between 2 and 19 compounds within each country have been studied in a limited number of wwtps 56 58 61 64 in the following the occurrence of most common antibiotics are discussed sulfamethoxazole is an antibiotic commonly found in water matrices belong to the class of sulfonamides which is considered as the oldest antibiotic classes still in use for both human and animal health care sulfonamides or sulfa drugs bacteriostatic compounds inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as fungi protozoa and some bacteria 65 and depend on the synthesis of folate for nucleotides synthesis pyrimidine and purine 66 occurrence and distribution of sulfonamides e g sulfamethoxazole in surface water of european countries were investigated 4 65 in european freshwaters studies concentrations of sulfamethazine are in the range of sulfamethoxazole as it was reported by 67 moreover in the llobregat river spain concentrations of sulfamethoxazole were up to 6000 ng l 68 and up to 12 000 ng l in river receiving industrial wastewater in croatia 69 in aqueous acidic medium sulfamethoxazole is a highly photolabile drug resulted in many primary photoproducts photolysis of sulfamethoxazole leads to formation of an imido isomer which produced from the photoisomerization of isoxazole ring to 1 3 oxazole product the photodegradation products involve sulfanilic acid aniline and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole 70 trimethoprim is an antibiotic belonging to a class of chemotherapeutic agents it is used to treat bacterial infections as well as the treatment of intestinal skin urinary and respiratory tract infections and other diseases such as severe attacks of otitis enterocolitis and bronchitis in children 18 trimethoprim has a broad antimicrobial function and it is effective to most kinds of bacteria similar to sulfamethoxazole 71 approximately 80 of trimethoprim is excreted by users through urine and the feces 72 because it is poorly metabolized in animal digestive tracts and human bodies 73 furthermore some of ppcps are released in sinks or in toilets through hospital or domestic routes as undesired drugs due to expiration and others are coming from pharmaceutical industries which enter to water resources through sewage systems 74 trimethoprim is observed to be more persistent where its rate of degradation in the aquatic systems is relatively slow with half life about 30 days 75 ciprofloxacin is one of the second generation of fluoroquinolones drug class with a solubility of 30 g l and is the most widely used as bactericidal antibiotics worldwide 76 ciprofloxacin acts as a broad spectrum drug used to treat gram negative and gram positive bacteria 77 generally it is used to treat infections of respiratory tract bone and joint infections malignant otitis externa gastroenteritis chancroid cellulitis endocarditis anthrax urinary tract infections and prostatitis 78 2 2 occurrence of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids nsaids are the most commonly quantified medicine classes widely used to relieve pain analgesic fever reducing antipyretic and to reduce inflammation they are usually used to relieve symptoms of painful periods headaches colds and flu sprains and strains arthritis and others 79 the most frequently detected nsaids are acetaminophen diclofenac ketoprofen naproxen and ibuprofen as follows acetaminophen is called paracetamol n acetyl p aminophenol it is the most frequently detected compound in water matrices it is an effective and widely used drug for fever pains and headache 80 it was introduced into medical practice in the uk in 1956 and in the usa in 1955 81 acetaminophen becomes toxic and causes acute liver and kidney failure when it is overdosed 82 it enters into water matrices from medical waste pharmaceutical effluents and from veterinary use indeed increasing concentrations of acetaminophen in aquatic environment maybe related to their less or not degradable compounds under normal environmental conditions as it is not biodegradable it is easily to accumulate in the aquatic environment leading to an adverse effect on the human health and other living organisms 83 diclofenac is widely used of nsaids and highly consumed by hundreds of tons annually by human and veterinary medical care it is a weak electrolyte which is characterized by an acid dissociation constant of pka 4 0 where molecular and anionic forms can coexist in aqueous solutions 84 it is recognized as an effective cyclooxygenase inhibitor with analgesic antipyretic and anti inflammatory properties 85 approximately 65 of consumed diclofenac can be released through feces and urine due to its low digestibility extensive use and the generation of related metabolites 86 the low biodegradability of diclofenac usually causes a low removal rate through biological treatment process and a few quantities of diclofenac can be absorbed into sludge studies conducted by agüera et al 87 revealed that 8 chloro 9 hcarbazole 1yl acetic acid is main derivative of photoproduct of diclofenac drug different pharmaceuticals photolysis have broad ranges of half life t 1 2 for instance gemfibrozil exhibited a t1 2 of 15 h while ketoprofen showed a half life 4 min at the same conditions 88 ibuprofen is a propionic drug prescribed as anti inflammatory antipyretic and analgesic it is used for pain relief in some diseases including rheumatoid arthritis muscle aches toothache migraine and for lowering the fever 89 it is highly soluble in water 21 0 mg l at 25 c with a pka 4 90 around 30 kilotons of ibuprofen is synthesized annually due to its high consumption rate and globally extensive demand 90 high water solubility and low volatility of ibuprofen cause extensive mobility in the aquatic streams and reservoirs the discarded of drug from aquaculture and pharmaceutical industries the excretion of metabolized and non metabolized drug in the urine of animals and humans upon medical treatment are the main sources of ibuprofen contamination in environmental systems 89 it was noticed that about 15 of ibuprofen therapeutic dose is unchanged in the excretion whereas about 26 of it passes the body as metabolized derivatives hydroxyl ibuprofen and 43 as carboxy ibuprofen which are more toxic than the parent compound 91 the conducted studies revealed that oxidation of benzylic group introduced a hydroxyl group which occurs in photolytic degradation of ibuprofen as it was indicated by the mechanism suggested by 92 this is leading to the formation of 1 hydroxyibuprofen and 2 hydroxyibuprofen which are the main products of ibuprofen degradation 92 93 as a result ibuprofen is present in drinking water up to 1 3 μg l and in surface water up to 0 4 μg l 90 94 therefore become ecotoxic and significant dangerous for aquatic ecosystems and human health naproxen is a derivative of bicyclic propionic acid and is commonly known as nsaids it is working through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzyme which is entered in the synthesis of thromboxane prostacyclin and prostaglandins from arachidonic acid ara 95 96 among analgesic drugs and nsaids naproxen is widely used class with around 30 million user international daily and in the usa about more than 100 million prescriptions every year 96 around 3000 tons of naproxen drug were manufactured in the world in 2003 97 in 2016 naproxen was prescribed approximately 11 470 076 times in the usa 98 in the living organisms naproxen is metabolized into naproxen glucuronide and o desmethylnaproxen 99 also these metabolites are released in surface water and wastewater naproxen does not subject to complete mineralization in sewage treatment plants stps due to its relatively high degree of transformation consequently leading to releases into the environment from treatment plants 100 101 from more than 100 european monitored rivers naproxen was detected in 69 of more than 100 water samples at quantitation up to 2 027 μg l 102 investigation of european union water has revealed that the concentrations of naproxen in surface waters and wwtps exceed the recommended concentration stated by the european medicines agency ema by 10 to 500 fold 103 2 3 occurrence of anticonvulsants anticonvulsants are known as antiepileptic drugs which are used in treatment of neuropathic pain epilepsy and psychiatric disorders 104 and have a global consumption volume about 1014 tons year 105 anticonvulsants drugs are including carbamazepine diazepam gabapentin lorazepam phenytoin pregabalin etc from tables 3 4 5 and literatures it is noted that carbamazepine is the most frequently detected and widely distributed in the aquatic systems carbamazepine drug is highly metabolized in humans mainly excreted in the form of hydroxylate and conjugated metabolites and revealed minimum unchanged eliminated amounts 2 106 despite of its continuous discharge to aquatic environment the low removal rate from treatment processes of wastewater is less than 45 and sludge is less than 10 107 108 besides the resistance to photochemical and biological transformations in the environment 109 all of these factors contribute the existence and persistence of carbamazepine in the aquatic environment chiron et al reported that the products of carbamazepine photodegradation are more toxic than the parent compound where acridine is highly mutagenic and carcinogenic product of carbamazepine photodegradation 110 from table 2 gabapentin pka is 3 7 and 10 7 therefore it is freely dissolved in both of acidic and basic aqueous solutions and in water the data obtained from tables 3 4 and 5 indicated there are extremely increasing in the concentration of carbamazepine in sewage and wastewater of most of countries this is attributed to the chemical structure of carbamazepine which has an olefinic double bond on the central of heterocyclic ring is difficult to be photo or biodegradation and this enhance their concentration in aquatic environment 2 4 occurrence of β blockers β blockers are the most broadly used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases hypertension as well as patients recovering from heart attacks angina pectoris arrhythmia and migraine 111 112 their mechanism of work is based on blocking the action or effects of adrenaline on β receptors of the body which subsequently slow down impulses of the nerve to the heart and as a result they reduce its work load 52 the most commonly used β blockers are metoprolol atenolol sotalol and propranolol the biodegradation of organic compounds in aquatic media and is the dominant pathway for removal of ppcps in wwtps 113 however it was reported atenolol propranolol indomethacin acetaminophen ibuprofen carbamazepine ifenprodil and mefenamic acid resist biodegradation process and remain unchanged in the effluents of wwtp and aquatic environment 36 on the other hand it was reported that in activated sludge the biodegradation of valsartan atenolol oseltamivir bezafibrate and diazepam produces many of transformation ingredients 114 metoprolol is one of the most commonly used β blockers it is quite frequently detected in the aquatic environment in some of european countries β blockers annual consumption rate exceeded by 0 1 1 1 and 3 2 g per person in finland switzerland and uk respectively 115 these extremely high concentrations of metoprolol drugs in the advanced countries are attributed to a significant high consumption rate of β blockers drugs for treatment of heart diseases which spread in these countries on contrast its concentrations in surface water and drinking water were low degradation efficiency of β blockers such as propranolol atenolol and metoprolol has been explored in electro fenton ef process where most of these substances can be undergone degradation in 5 to 30 min and totally mineralized in several hours 116 high detected concentrations of atenolol in wwtps are attributed to its relatively high emission as unchanged drugs 50 by comparing with 0 5 and 15 for propranolol and metoprolol respectively 1 furthermore β blockers are considered pseudo persistent compounds that have been exhibited half life of 3 to 8 7 days in the aqueous medium 112 continuous releasing of these substances into aquatic environment will lead to a significant potential risks and threats to the aquatic ecosystems 2 5 occurrence of antidepressants psychiatric antidepressant medications are frequently prescribed to treat anxiety depression disorder chronic pain or insomnia its mechanism of work is based on increasing and regulating the levels of two different neurotransmitters in the brain neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and serotonin also called norepinephrine may affect pain signals sent by nerves 117 in canada in the year of 2007 more than 22 000 kg of antidepressant medicines were authorized to patients 118 between the periods 2005 and 2008 in the usa about 11 of persons aged between 18 and 44 years were gotten rid of antidepressant medications antidepressants class was listed the third of most commonly authorized drugs consumed by americans 1 antidepressants are usually released to drinking water surface water wastewater and wwtps in their metabolized or parent form during human excreta and improper discharges for instance fluoxetine an antidepressant medicine approximately 20 30 is metabolized in the human body to produce the norfluoxetine and fluoxetine glucuronide metabolites while the remaining is passed unaltered to sewage systems 119 the neuroactive compounds or antidepressant drugs from the class s serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor snari and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris have been detected in surface waters and wwtps venlafaxine is one of the most widely used antidepressants drug and acts as a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snari 120 venlafaxine is used to treat panic disorders major depressive disorder and anxiety 121 o desmethylvenlafaxine is the main venlafaxine human metabolite and also known as a snari 120 122 nevertheless after ingestion venlafaxine cannot be completely absorbed by human body and enters to aquatic environment 123 in this review the occurrence of frequently prescribed antidepressants venlafaxine fluoxetine and diazepam in drinking tap water surface water and the influents and effluents of wwtps in different countries have been reported 2 6 occurrence of endocrine disrupting estrogens synthetic and natural endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are significant environmental pollutants that usually interfere and affect the normal function of the endocrine system of humans and wildlife a broad range of substances including both of natural and synthetic chemicals has been shown to elicit endocrine disruption 124 steroid estrogens are derived from cholesterol belonging to a group of biologically active compounds and have a cyclopentan o perhydrophenanthrene in their common structure it is well known that estrogens are dominantly female hormones that keep the health of reproductive systems breast brain and skin 125 from medicinal point of view natural estrogens such as estriol e3 17β estradiol e2 and estrone e1 are secreted by the ovary testis the adrenal cortex and placenta in animals and humans while synthetic estrogens such as 17β ethinylestradiol ee2 are the main ingredients in hormone therapy and oral contraceptive pills 126 these steroid hormones which are belonging to edcs have a highly estrogenic influence activity approximately 10 000 100 000 times higher than that of other edcs such as bisphenols alkylphenols and organochlorine aromatic compounds 127 128 duncan and coworkers 129 reported that the concentrations of e2 in the range of 1 10 ng l show a potential risk effect on aquatic species where its detection of exposure found to be in a combination of e1 and e2 than its individual exposure hormone urinary and fecal excretions of all of humans and animals usually contain both of synthetic and natural estrogens which potentially end up in the environment through waste disposal or sewage discharge the physical and chemical properties revealed that the steroid estrogens dissolve poorly in water where synthetic estrogens have a solubility of about 4 8 mg l and natural compounds have a solubility of around 13 mg l 125 moreover steroid estrogens have very low vapor pressure ranging from 2 3 10 10 to 6 7 10 15 mmhga leading to their low volatility 130 furthermore the octanol water partition coefficient kow values of steroid estrogens varied between 2 81 and 4 15 indicates that they are hydrophobic compounds table 2 their physicochemical properties showed that steroid estrogens have low tendency for dissolving in aqueous media and prefer sorption on sediments and soils 131 the most frequently detected estrogens are estriol e3 β estradiol e2 estrone e1 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 and diethylstilbestrol des were quantified in surface water wastewater and wwtps tables 3 4 and 5 2 7 occurrence of endocrine disrupting phenols the most frequently detected phenolic endocrine disrupting compounds are bisphenol a bpa octylphenol op nonylphenol np diethylstilbestrol des and corresponding ethoxylates nowadays these substances have become omnipresent in the environment owing to their utilization in a wide range of products e g ppcps surfactants food and beverage packaging adhesives flame retardants building materials electronic components and paper coatings they can cause a potential pose risk to human health as decreasing reproductive fitness and increase cancer diseases in humans due to exposure to estrogenic compounds e g phenolic compounds especially through drinking water 132 bisphenol a bpa large uses in the manufacture of epoxy resin and polycarbonate plastics leads to be one of the most frequently detected compounds in tap drinking water surface water and wwtps 133 bisphenol a is recognized as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs which can impact the hormonal systems of humans and wildlife at relative low concentrations furthermore alkylphenols compounds are the main products of alkylphenol ethoxylates apeos degradation which is considered as one of the most important non ionic surfactants utilized as dispersants solubilizers and detergents 134 2 8 occurrence of lipid lowering drugs lipid lowering medicines are prescribed medicines that are given to patients suffering from excess cholesterol fat or triglycerides an ester derived from glycerol and three fatty acids to reduce the amount of lipids present in human blood 135 in general to regulate and control elevated levels of various forms of lipids in patients suffering from hyperlipidemia the main sources of lipid lowering drugs contaminants in wastewater are from discharges of wastes from pharmaceuticals manufacturing processes and human excretions where about 70 excreted in urine and 30 from faeces 136 this class of medicines is composed of a broad range of synthetic and natural organic substances which contain nicotinic acid omega 3 fatty acids bile acid sequestrates ezetimibe or cholesterol absorption inhibitor 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme a hmg coa reductase inhibitor or fibrates and statins 137 as it was reported in literatures this class are divided into two main groups i statins which include seven pharmaceutical substances simvastatin rosuvastatin lovastatin pravastatin pitavastatin fluvastatin and atorvastatin ii fibrates which include fenofibrate gemfibrozil ciprofibrate and bezafibrate 138 statin compounds include a carboxylic hydrophilic tail and a hydrophobic core therefore the relative interactions are favoured to take place between the sorbent organic matter and the hydrophobic groups of the molecule while the hydrophilic functional part of the compound oriented towards the aqueous solution 135 based on performed studies the gemfibrozil drug showed high persistent in aquatic medium with half lives ranging from 70 to 288 days 103 139 on the other hand the environmental residence time of clofibric acid reach up to 21 years and it was not biodegradable in the laboratory scale reactors 140 3 occurrence of ppcps in tap drinking water over the last three decades extensive researches conducted on chemical pollution concerning the conventional persistent organic pollutants pops nowadays scientists and new scientific projects are oriented towards compounds that are found in low concentrations but have direct harmful effects and could cause a potential threat to the aquatic systems with long time through bioaccumulation and metabolism the presence of ppcps in surface water could be a worrying problem when it is utilized for drinking water a current challenge is attributed to the presence of degradation by products of ppcps in water matrices in many cases these by products have not been detected and could be persistent and hazardous as their parent compounds 52 from table 3 it found that raw tap drinking water is not highly polluted by ppcps because of their concentrations in treated water were at trace amounts or below the detection limits as illustrated in table 3 the global concentrations of frequently detected ppcps such as antibiotics β blockers antiulcer agents antiepileptics antiasthma drugs antihistamines calcium channel blockers lipid regulating agent and hormones in tap drinking water across the world are reported the discussed data were collected from various published papers and reviews including different pharmaceutical classes that are usually focused on the maximum concentration values and all individual listed values for drinking water there is variability in the concentrations in different countries over the world for example high concentrations of ppcps were detected in tap drinking water in china which reported high levels of caffeine 607 85 ng l erythromycin 515 69 ng l and codeine 313 29 ng l by comparing the same compounds with respect to other countries the highest concentration of caffeine was found in poland 308 ng l and taiwan 263 2 ng l for specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds see section 2 table 3 shows that the maximum concentration of antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole was 113 ng l in usa drinking water and ibuprofen nsaids quantities in tap drinking water ranged from 9 23 ng l to 223 6 ng l for china and poland respectively in addition the concentrations of antidepressant drugs such as venlafaxine in drinking water of china was 0 1 ng l and fluoxetine was 19 2 ng l in usa drinking water table 3 endocrine disrupting substances as bisphenol a bpa in tap drinking water of poland 203 ng l spain 51 2 ng l and usa 44 3 ng l table 3 revealed the highest concentrations of bpa because of many of industries and goods contain plastics and epoxy resins in their various production on the other hand the highest concentration of lipid lowering drugs in tap drinking water of bezafibrate 120 ng l was reported in japan while the highest concentration of gemfibrozil 98 2 ng l was reported in the netherlands table 3 the highest concentration of carbamazepine as anticonvulsants or anti epileptic drug detected in tap drinking water was 176 06 ng l in hungary and 72 ng l in the usa the observed data indicated that the highest concentrations of ppcps in spain were valsartan 1300 ng l atenolol 900 ng l losartan 620 ng l metoprolol 380 ng l bisoprolol 250 ng l and primidone 200 ng l valsartan is an antihypertensive drug and a tetrazole derivative that contains carboxylic pka 3 9 and acid pka 4 73 groups that result in the compound being soluble within the neutral ph range 141 thus it can exist as a solution at normal physiological ph values by rising the ph value from 4 to 6 the solubility of valsartan will increase by a factor of 1000 times but it prefers the anionic form with decreasing lipophilicity 142 caffeine is a central nervous system cns stimulant belonging to the methylxanthine class it is the most widely consumed psychoactive stimulant and it was regarded as one of the most commonly detected drugs in aquatic environment 143 caffeine is highly persistent in water due to its extreme stability with a half life of 100 to 240 days 144 due to its high concentrations high detection frequency and relatively high stability and suitability as indicator of untreated wastewater it has been considered as an effective indicator of the emergence of pharmaceutical active compounds phacs 145 146 previous study reported that the presence of 90 ppcps were investigated in tap water treated water and reservoirs in france italy germany finland canada and the usa 147 among 90 of studied ppcps diclofenac bezafibrate ibuprofen clofibric acid triclosan and gemfibrozil were revealed at concentrations of 2 5 734 ng l vulliet et al reported that the salicylic acid was the most detected compound among 25 pharmaceuticals in drinking water samples while the others atenolol and carbamazepine were detected in more than 30 of polluted water supplies but at low quantities or 2 ng l 148 in valencia spain the results declared that parabens were investigated at relatively high concentrations in wtps and low quantities of pharmaceuticals 100 ng l were found in mineral and tap waters according to the study performed by carmona and coworkers 149 their study was performed on the tap water samples which showed that salicylic acid and naproxen were frequently detected while ibuprofen diclofenac and propylparaben showed the greatest concentrations 1 39 ng l in mineral water methylparaben was measured at 40 ng l salicylic acid is an important organic synthetic compound and is extensively utilized in medicines perfumes pesticides foods dyes and rubber due to its wide usage salicylic acid has become an emerging contaminant in the aquatic systems and has been frequently measured in surface waters 150 contamination of water with residuals of salicylic acid can cause significant harmful effects on human health e g blood circulation failure and central nervous system disorders 151 salicylic acid is not soluble in water at room temperature it needs to be transformed to salicylate to dissolve completely in water with its solubility depending on the ph of the medium notably it dissolves well in water at ph 3 152 from table 3 it is shown that european countries reported the highest values of salicylic acid in tap drinking water of france 102 ng l netherlands 98 0 and 58 7 ng l and poland 33 3 ng l this is attributed to high rate of medicinal consumption dyes industries food production in addition to the insolubility of salicylic acid in water liu and coworkers 153 carried out their study on the fate and elimination of six medicines in an industrial scale wtp in china and found that the effluent quantities of these substances ranged from 1 to 43 ng l and were from below the limit of detection to 6 ng l it was reported that very low levels of phacs were detected in finished drinking water in the usa 40 besides phacs were found in tap water in several european countries including the netherlands germany and italy 154 in germany an analgesic drug phenazone and an antipyretic medicine propyphenazone were detected in berlin drinking water at concentrations of 120 ng l and 400 ng l respectively 155 this high value was due to the use of groundwater as a source of drinking water which was contaminated with sewage system 156 in germany for both of human and veterinary use the annual consumption of drugs antibiotics is between 700 and 800 t indicating high loads of antibiotic residues that can enter the wastewater stream 13 157 in the period between october 2007 and march 2012 the u s geological survey usgs and the u s environmental protection agency usepa carried out a joint study to examine the sources and treated water from 25 drinking water treatment plants dwtps across the usa 158 the collected samples were analyzed 24 pharmaceutical substances in phase i and 118 compounds in phase ii it was reported that in phase i about 11 medicines were measured in all source water samples fewer quantifiable pharmaceuticals were detected with a maximum of five substances in any one sample and a median for all samples of two on the other hand in phase ii about 47 of different substances were quantified in all source water samples with a maximum of 41 compounds investigated in any one sample the median number of drugs for all 25 samples was 8 median concentrations in source water were lower than 113 ng l for 37 substances quantified in phase ii the most persistent pharmaceuticals through treatment processes were cotinine bupropion metoprolol and carbamazepine by comparing available data pharmaceuticals existed in tap drinking water is less than of surface water and wastewater especially in developing countries fig 4 in germany and spain more than 30 medicines have been identified and about 11 to 30 were investigated in france canada sweden china and usa these data confirmed the report of who 2012 which contains less data on medicines in drinking water 47 bexfield and coworkers 159 carried out the first large scale 1000 sites in 46 states for assessment the spatial distribution and presence of pharmaceuticals and hormones in groundwater used in drinking water throughout the usa fig 5 they analyzed samples from 1091 locations in principal aquifers representing 60 of the total volume used as a source of drinking water supply and found the data of 103 pharmaceuticals and 21 hormones across 15 principal aquifers including 844 sites which indicate the resources used for public supply at least one compound was detected at 5 9 and was measured at 11 3 in 247 sites indicating the resources of domestic supply over 9 principal aquifers about 34 compounds were detected three pharmaceutical substances carbamazepine an anticonvulsant mood stabilizer sulfamethoxazole an antibiotic meprobamate an antianxiety medication one plastics component bisphenol a and caffeine metabolite 1 7 dimethylxanthine where each was measured between 0 7 and 1 6 of all sites most of common detections in shallow wells included recent discharge ingredients the obtained results revealed the vulnerability of contaminated groundwater utilized for drinking water in the usa is generally limited they reported that all detections of hormones and pharmaceuticals that were prepared were 102 in addition to any of 2 or more uncommon compounds of 1091 sites its results included for pharmaceuticals and hormones three or four substances were determined at four sites two compounds were determined at 14 sites whereas a single pharmaceutical or hormone compound was determined at 60 locations fig 5 at least one pharmaceutical compound was detected at 5 1 of principal aquifer survey pas sites and 9 6 of major aquifer study mas sites where pharmaceutical substances were more frequently detected than hormones the concentrations of hormones ranged from 3 0 ng l to 570 ng l and cholesterol has been revealed the highest concentration while concentrations of pharmaceuticals ranged from 1 7 ng l to 677 ng l and caffeine has been revealed the highest the obtained data revealed that the highest concentrations for the five medicines and hormones that were quantified at more than 0 5 of sites were ranged from 120 ng l to 430 ng l for sulfamethoxazole and bisphenol a respectively belitz and coworkers 160 stated that the most detected compounds have relatively high solubility and low tendency to adsorb onto sediments or soils in conclusion information obtained from this work can be utilized to regulate and control the medicines and environmental settings for future research and monitoring environmental fate and evaluate of their potential threats to human health 4 occurrence and distribution of ppcps in surface water as it is shown in fig 6 and table 4 a wide range of ppcps is existed in surface waters from many sources mainly sewage treatment plants stps as it had been reported in uk italy africa and the us 189 whereas the effluents from stps are considered the dominant pathway for the presence of a huge number of ppcps in surface water accordingly this review has scanned recent published articles that reported different ppcps residues in surface waters and about 94 of ppcps were quantified the prevalence of ppcps is observed mainly in regions such as asia e g japan china korea india bangladesh and malaysia africa e g egypt morocco south africa nigeria and uganda europe e g greece serbia italy and spain north and south america e g usa canada brazil and mexico and australia in surface water the available data revealed that the highest concentrations of ppcps were observed in africa and south america in relative to other regions with an average concentration of 11 8093 μg l in 27 frequently detected compounds in nigeria and 8 0368 μg l of 22 compounds in brazil fig 6 it was observed that the highest quantities of ppcps were occurred in the surface water of the developing countries compared to the developed countries this may be related to the low efficient of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and chemical manufacturing plants residues furthermore the relatively high concentrations of ppcps in surface water are mainly referred to some factors such as their low digestion rate into human or animal guts high consumption rates and low solubility in this regard table 4 shows the highest detected ppcps in surface water with large variations in the scanned regions these variations could be attributed to some factors such as sampling modes climate conditions and their consumption rate in high income nations such as north america and europe the concentrations of investigated ppcps were lower compared to that with low income nations these maybe due to i behavior of nations to protect their environment ii application of guidelines and legislations iii healthcare where these countries provide high quality medical care for their nations thus decrease the consumption of drugs leading to reduction of ppcps contamination and iv restriction rules to prevent factories industries veterinary and agriculture uses of prohibited ppcps while nations such as nigeria and brazil based on the collected data above their pharmaceuticals consumption maybe high and therefore elevated levels of ppcps were observed in the environment additionally improper practices i e livestock wastewater effluent to cropland prolonged storage of manure composting ground drainage water from manured soils and sewage lines or effluent infiltration have forced the presence of pharmaceuticals e g veterinary antibiotics into livestock surrounding environments i e groundwater rivers and lakes intensively and persisted for long time 190 additionally ppcps residues in surface water maybe indicate the medication habits and human attitude furthermore pharmaceuticals mobility from one medium to another as clearly seen in table 4 for instance bisphenol a bpa was the most frequently detected compound in the surface water of china 1286 25 ng l morocco 302 ng l poland 277 9 ng l malaysia 203 ng l and uk 159 ng l this is attributed to its poor solubility in water and its widely utilized in the production of plastics to a direct contact with foods including plastic packaging jar caps inner coatings of cans and kitchenware 191 for specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds see section 2 the existence of caffeine in surface water acts as indicator of anthropogenic pollution caffeine was observed in high levels in greece 3508 ng l india 1104 8 ng l brazil 127 000 ng l spain 1092 ng l and nigeria 1080 ng l table 4 because of its high solubility and low octanol water partition coefficient caffeine is most likely to persist in the water column moreover caffeine is not only a component of medications but also an ingredient in drinks food and cosmetics in which explain its high exist in environment acetylsalicylic acid aspirin was also observed in high levels in korea 1 1726 μg l and brazil 20 960 μg l these substances are medications used to reduce pain fever or inflammation thus its consumption rate and usage may explain why it was observed in high levels amoxicillin is highly detected in surface water of some regions such as nigeria 272 150 ng l because of it is a widely used in number of bacterial infections for both human and animals which leading to increasing of its consumption rate table 4 table 4 illustrates the antibiotics concentrations in surface water the concentration of the reported antibiotics were found to be varied from region to another as reported in table 4 the maximum concentrations of antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole were detected in some african countries such as uganda 5600 ng l nigeria 3180 ng l ghana 2861 ng l and south africa 2017 ng l also sulfamethoxazole was detected by elevated concentrations in other regions such as china 715 3 ng l mexico 722 ng l and usa 576 4 ng l straub 65 reported that sulfamethoxazole was determined in the surface water of the most of european countries with quantifications lower than 286 ng l with a median of 52 ng l in comparsion the presences of ciprofloxacin in tap drinking water were very low concentrations but its frequently detection in surface water was high with moderate concentrations however ciprofloxacin was detected by high concentration in some countries especially african countries at 1168 ng l in ghana 14 331 ng l and 12 987 ng l in south africa while ciprofloxacin was detected in china and spain at concentrations of 1727 11 ng l and 540 ng l respectively the concentrations of carbamazepine were relatively increased in the surface water of developing countries such as nigeria 342 ng l and greece 406 ng l also higher concentrations were detected in the developed countries such as south korea 899 9 ng l usa 249 ng l and uk 200 ng l the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants compounds in surface water the concentration of frequently detected venlafaxine was 127 62 ng l in spain and fluoxetine was 24 8 ng l in usa table 4 in surface water bpa compounds exhibited higher concentrations in china 1286 25 ng l poland 277 9 ng l and malaysia 203 ng l these results confirmed the reason of higher production of plastic materials lipid lowering drugs it was found that the maximum concentrations of bezafibrate were increased to 233 ng l and 2100 ng l in south africa and mexico respectively table 4 while the maximum concentrations of gemfibrozil were 620 ng l 552 ng l and 368 ng l in surface water of greece nigeria and mexico respectively table 4 these varied concentration levels of different antibiotics may reflect the method of use consumption rate removal mechanism technique of treatment and applied policies that helped in their spreed into surface waters bodies additionally wang et al 192 estimated the occurrence of 36 pharmaceutical compounds in urban rivers water samples obtained from shenzhen beijing and changzhou whereas 28 compounds were frequently detected including indomethacin 50 9 ng l atenolol 52 9 ng l sulpiride 77 3 ng l and sulfadimethoxine 164 ng l which showed the highest median concentrations and were observed that approximately antibiotics encompass half of pharmaceuticals contamination in addition the ratio of permanent pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine and sulpiride are valuable to trace sources of contamination in urban rivers spongberg et al investigated the existence of 34 pharmaceuticals in 86 water samples collected from coastal sites and surface water in costa rica 193 the investigated areas involved sites that received both of untreated and treated wastewaters and rural runoff the five most determined substances were caffeine 29 triclosan 34 salicylic acid 41 sulfadimethoxine 43 and doxycycline 77 the pharmaceuticals detected from lower to higher concentrations were ketoprofen 10 000 ng l acetaminophen 13 000 ng l gemfibrozil 17 000 ng l ibuprofen 37 000 ng l and doxycycline 74 000 ng l β blockers are used for treatment of vasodilation visceral smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation 194 see section 2 4 in beijing ppcps have frequencies of detection of 50 100 where beijing is considered one of the most populated cities in china 195 the obtained results showed that the median concentrations of the analysed pharmaceutical residues were reached 4200 ng l moreover the conducted studies revealed that the concentrations of antiretroviral drugs e g tenofovir lamivudine stavudine abacavir nevirapine ritonavir etc in surface water of south african were reported higher concentrations than in other countries 196 persistent analgesic anti inflammatory agents are one of the most commonly existed drugs in sewage due to their higher use and consumption rate for specific characteristics of frequently detected compounds see section 2 an anticonvulsant or anti epileptic drugs such as carbamazepine is usually found at relatively high concentrations ng l μg l in surface waters table 4 4 1 usa as a case study on the occurrence and distribution of ppcps in surface water in the usa batt and coworkers 197 assessed the potential existence of active pharmaceutical ingredients in aquatic ecosystems fig 7 they proceeded a nationwide probability statistical survey and analysis to detect the distribution and occurrence for number of ingredients in the surface water of the usa and to represent a national predication of potential contamination of river surface water with active pharmaceutical ingredients apis the monitoring and survey study involved about 182 sampling locations and proposed rivers especially closest to urban areas fig 7 the study included 46 analytes contain various classes of active pharmaceutical ingredients such as anticonvulsants diuretics antidepressants and antibiotics about 37 compounds out of 46 were detected in minimum one sampling site sulfamethoxazole was the most frequently detected drug and was measured in about 141 of the 182 of surveyed surface water at concentrations up to 570 ng l about 10 of these substances were measured in about 20 or more in the sampling locations the most frequently detected compounds were sulfamethoxazole 576 4 ng l hydrochlorothiazide 619 ng l progesterone 440 8 ng l testosterone 361 4 ng l valsartan 319 4 ng l and carbamazepine 249 3 ng l respectively higher pollution with these pharmaceuticals could be produced from sewage treatment plants stps wastewater treatment plants wwtps animal manure or wastewater sludge containing traces of these compounds improper disposal also from higher consumption or prescription rate the results of their survey of apis on surface water were convenient with their previous studies in wastewater and when they compared with prescribed doses their study indicated that the risk of human exposure for these apis through drinking water would be very low 197 4 2 china as a case study on the occurrence and distribution of ppcps in surface water in china na liu et al studied 1934 exposure data of 50 selected compounds obtained from 26 secondary river areas around china huai river pearl river yellow river songliao river southeast coast hai river yangtze river fig 8 198 the regions included 26 river system covering the highest population density area according to the geographic hu huanyong line 199 in addition to 20 areas covers the eastern coastal area of china the most frequently detected 42 ppcps were investigated in the pearl river delta followed by investigation about 38 substances in yangtze river downstream 38 in taihu lake 36 in daqing river 34 in chaobai beiyun jiyun river and 33 substances in liao river the highest concentrations were observed in liaodong peninsula yangtze river downstream ziya river and huai river with values of 14 718 411 ng l 731 100 ng l 97 434 ng l 81 250 ng l respectively the watershed yangtze river id 14 18 was the most frequently reported where about 643 samples were studied and the concentrations of about 96 about 43 out of 45 of the investigated ppcps compounds were found above the detection limit the most observed ppcps residues in hai river id 5 9 were about 45 compounds positively investigated in 489 samples 46 substances were investigated pearl river id 21 26 where 44 compounds of them were positively measured in 352 samples it was reported that due to studies in some watersheds were quite limited therefore only 41and 52 samples were investigated in huai river id 21 22 and yellow river id 10 respectively 198 fig 9 shows the detected concentrations of each compound and the frequencies of detection are exhibited as the number of positively detected all data points except for phantolide cleaning product and household care ppcps were frequently detected in surface water of china 50 to 100 in the studied 50 target pharmaceutical compounds it was found that 23 of them were over 90 in samples fig 9 the most concerned and investigated antibiotic was sulfamethoxazole where it was positively observed at more than 95 of 120 locations from 7 watersheds the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole demonstrated the highest concentration of 984 ng l similar to the indian measurements 900 ng l 200 but less than the observed concentrations in usa 1500 ng l 201 australia 2000 ng l 202 and europe 11 920 ng l 203 erythromycin and sulfadiazine are considered the most ubiquitous antibiotics the obtained results revealed that erythromycin compound was positively observed in 97 of about 65 samples and the highest concentration 1418 ng l was observed in yangtze river 204 comparable to that was observed in europe 1700 ng l 203 comparing to europe in china the antibiotic sulfadiazine was highly detected 97 but with lower concentrations for steroid hormones the greatest frequently detected was for estriol e3 67 ng l in yangtze river 205 less than its concentration in european surface water where it was up to 480 ng l however in the 36 samples the frequency of detection was 61 higher than those detected in europe 20 203 considering estrone e1 was the most frequently investigated hormone where in the seven watersheds it was detected in 96 of 53 samples concentration of estrone e1 in china surface waters was 0 12 57 ng l where in european countries was up to 89 ng l 203 globally androgens testosterone and androstenedione were less reported in surface waters but in three chinese watersheds they were 100 frequently detected with concentrations between 2 and 28 and 0 2 2 5 ng l obviously anticonvulsant or anti epileptic substances as carbamazepine and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids as ibuprofen are the most common studied medicines where carbamazepine was detected in 93 of 42 samples from watershed sites demonstrated the highest concentration up to 1090 ng l 206 in comparing to those was reported in european countries it was slightly lower with concentrations about 1700 ng l 201 but higher than commonly concentrations found in different areas of the globe 198 207 ibuprofen exhibited the greatest concentration about 360 ng l in 32 out of 36 locations lower than that found in european countries with concentration about 31 323 ng l 203 as shown in fig 9 the distribution of quantities of ppcps was deviated to the right skewed direction positive skewness this skewness is produced owing to the broad range of concentrations in different selected samples according to the study conducted by liu and coworkers 198 fig 9 shows that the mean quantities of substances were nearly equal to 75th centiles where distribution of concentrations of residues were skewed to positive skewness to the right about 17 mean concentrations reported greater than the 75th centile by 2 fold for instance the detected mean concentrations of carbamazepine and dimethyl phthalate substances reported greater than the 75th centile values by 5 and 9 times and with frequencies of detection of 93 and 81 respectively in the surface waters of chinese rivers sulfamethoxazole was observed at more than 95 of 120 locations from 7 watersheds and demonstrated the highest concentration of 984 ng l fig 8 198 variations in results are usually related to many factors such as human attitude rate of consumption guidelines and legislation improper disposal and etc 3 52 208 seasonal variations in literatures it was reported that several mechanisms were proposed to explain seasonal variations on ppcps such as dilution effects water temperature seasonal discharges and irradiances 173 183 in low temperature in cold seasons ppcps are less biodegradable than in high temperatures or warm seasons in addition to decreasing levels of solar radiation in autumn season which may decrease the rate of photo degradations of pharmaceuticals decreasing the activity of microorganisms for degradation and transformation of ppcps in cold weather enhances their settling and adsorption to sediments which leading to concentration detection in some areas of research sun and coworkers 183 observed higher concentrations of cotinine in warm season than in cold season in both the yellow river and the huai river basins where in the aquatic environment cotinine is the majority metabolite of nicotine 211 5 occurrence of ppcps in wastewater and wastewater treatment plants wwtps ppcps have been described as pseudo persistent emerging contaminants as a result of their persistent releasing into aquatic systems through several pathways 243 up to now in most of countries there aren t capacities required for monitoring 276 and analysis of ppcps and there aren t appropriate sophisticated techniques for removal of ppcps from wastewater and wwtps so that they could exist in drinking water at trace quantities with unknown impacts on human health 173 previous efforts were done to investigate the presence of ppcps in the influents and effluents of wwtps 244 248 discharging of substances from wwtps does not only cause a direct ecosystem threat but also can be transformed to the ingredients of harmful compounds for example n nitrosodimethylamine a methadone form forms in drinking water treatment process as disinfectant byproduct 249 the variability in removal efficiencies of ppcps in wwtps are usually related to their physicochemical properties such as log kow pka chemical structure sorption biodegradability and other parameters of treatment processes e g ph temperature hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt 250 252 for instance many medicines erythromycin triclosan trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole with concentrations ranging from 0 0167 to 0 278 0 to 0 410 0 407 to 1 021 and 1 860 to 2 146 μg l respectively have been investigated in the influents of wwtps in southern california 253 other ppcps such as acetaminophen caffeine codeine gemfibrozil ibuprofen and naproxen were also investigated in the influent of wwtps of costa rica with mean concentrations of 14 6 μg l for acetaminophen and 69 9 μg l for caffeine 254 in fact wastewater indicators are considered as an important way for evaluation the impact of wastewater on both of surface and ground water quantitatively and qualitatively 214 for instance glassmeyer and coworkers 255 studied the spatial and temporal occurrence of 110 ppcps in 10 rivers of usa and reported that diethyltoluamide deet caffeine and carbamazepine were the mainly appropriate wastewater indicators of river water samples furthermore the ratio between conservative indicators and labile or unstable indicators could be used to clarify the contribution of treated wastewater released to surface water 256 258 yang and coworkers 54 investigated wastewater contaminated with 93 ppcps and 5 artificial sweeteners ass in wwtps and selected appropriate wastewater indicators in the region of pearl river in china they have selected fluconazole and sucralose as a conservative indicator and selected caffeine saccharin cyclamate propyl paraben ethyl paraben methyl paraben paracetamol and salicylic acid as labile indicators in two consecutive years 2015 and 2016 rodriguez mozaz and coworkers 56 conducted a comprehensive monitoring for a large group of antibiotic residues in the final effluents of wwtps of seven european countries germany norway finland ireland spain portugal and cyprus this was the first kind of study which carried out at an international level throughout monitored 53 drugs 17 of them were detected at least once in the effluents of the wwtps as ampicillin azithromycin cephalexin ciprofloxacin clarithromycin clindamycin enrofloxacin metronidazole nalidixic acid ofloxacin orbifloxacin oxolinic acid pipemidic acid sulfapyridine and sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and tetracycline the southern countries portugal and spain and ireland exhibited the superior average concentrations of antibiotics in the final effluents whereas cyprus and the northern countries germany norway and finland showed lower total concentrations according to their analysis azithromycin cephalexin and ciprofloxacin are suggested as indicators of antibiotic pollution as they could lead to a potential risk to the environment as shown in table 5 the mean concentration of acesulfame is 17 000 ng l and its maximum value of 24 000 ng l were detected in the influent wastewater in vietnam acesulfame is considered as an artificial low calorie sweetener that can be existed in beverages and different foods after consumption and undergoing metabolism in human it passes through the system without change or unaffected chemically is not metabolised then enter into aquatic environments acesulfame is a negatively charged compound and highly water soluble at different ph values therefore it is known as a potential marker that is used to indicate the entree of domestic s wastewater into aquatic systems 259 furthermore the highest concentrations of antibiotic such as sulfamethoxazole were detected in wastewater and wwtps e g méxico inf 2010 ng l and eff 935 ng l spain inf 1520 ng l usa eff 1000 ng l china inf 3930 8 ng l and south africa inf 9071 96 ng l eff 4357 52 ng l inf 11 644 18 ng l eff 6814 05 ng l according to review prepared by straub 65 declared that sulfamethoxazole in a few measured environmental quantifications reached 4000 ng l especially in discharged streams of wastewater treatment plant effluents wastewater and wwtps showed the highest concentration of antibiotics for both of developing and developed countries table 5 ciprofloxacin antibiotic was detected with higher concentrations in wastewater and wwtps of spain with values of inf 2250 ng l inf 53 054 ng l and eff 2194 ng l in czech inf 860 ng l turkey inf 937 ng l and632 ng l greece inf and eff 591 ng l and sweden inf 560 ng l table 5 the highest concentration of acetaminophen in wastewater and wwtps extremely increased in both of the developing and developed countries as follows usa eff 4500 ng l latvia inf 4200 ng l india inf 11 000 ng l inf 7500 ng l south africa inf 121 776 13 ng l inf 167 515 85 ng l and eff 1727 31 ng l eff 1659 73 ng l canada eff 461 000 ng l france inf 96 700 ng l and new zealand inf 117 867 ng l in wastewater and wwtps it was noticed that ibuprofen concentrations were extremely increased to the highest values in new zealand inf 11 165 ng l canada eff 132 000 ng l and eff 344 000 ng l spain inf 563 000 ng l and algiers inf 8612 9 ng l table 5 this is attributed to its higher water solubility low volatility the excretion of metabolized and non metabolized residues in the urine of animals and humans upon medical treatment discharges and extensive mobility in the aquatic streams on the other hand the concentrations of carbamazepine an anticonvulsants in wastewater and wwtps in sever conditions are extremely high in both of the developing and developed countries as follow the mean concentrations in germany were inf 1536 ng l and eff 1614 ng l the max concentrations in spain were inf 3030 ng l czech were inf 710 ng l and eff 730 ng l usa were inf 588 ng l and eff 631 ng l india were inf 1536 ng l and eff 1614 ng l south africa were eff 416 3 ng l and in kenya the mean concentrations were inf 350 ng l and eff 320 ng l β blockers metoprolol drug was detected in wastewater and its maximum concentrations were in new zealand inf 7443 ng l and eff 4305 ng l usa eff 1200 china inf 3665 4 sweden inf 1100 and eff 1800 ng l france inf 2760 ng l and eff

wwtps of the usa were inf 146 ng l and eff 414 ng l sweden inf 220 ng l and eff 340 ng l and germany inf 293 ng l and eff 303 ng l on the other hand sertraline drug revealed the highest concentration up to 5100 ng l in effluents of wwtps in canada table 5 venlafaxine antidepressants drugs maximum concentrations in wastewater and wwtps were in sweden inf 880 ng l and eff 1100 ng l czech inf 800 ng l and eff 1110 ng l and germany inf 765 ng l and eff 681 ng l while fluoxetine was inf 155 in spain and inf 67 ng l in new zealand table 5 by comparing the concentrations of lipid regulating drugs in wastewater and wwtps with those in drinking and surface waters the data showed extensive increases in concentrations of bezafibrate to two or three times where it reported inf 2840 ng l inf 3445 ng l eff 485 ng l eff 855 ng l in méxico and inf 1635 ng l eff 855 ng l in germany this is attributed to wastewater wwtps and stps act as the main sources of lipid regulating drugs which produced from discharges of wastes endocrine disrupting substances such as bisphenol a bpa in wastewater and wwtps their higher concentrations were reported in both influents of china 1527 1 ng l and italy 305 83 ng l and in the effluents of china were 623 6 ng l and italy were 206 81 ng l table 5 globally about 559 pharmaceutical residues have been detected in wwtps influents effluents wastewater matrices sewage and sludge by 47 fig 10 illustrates the potential distributions and numbers of substances detected in wastewater matrices in each country worldwide according to the review prepared by 47 there is a close and significance relationship between wwtps effluents and surface water where most of wwtps discharges into surface waters directly such as lakes and rivers according to national survey performed by the u s geological survey a variety of natural organic and synthetic compounds such as pharmaceuticals steroids surfactants flame retardants fragrances plasticizers and other chemicals have been detected in the vicinity of municipal wastewater discharges and livestock agricultural facilities and the maximum concentration of investigated substances were from 0 19 μg l to 0 30 μg l 183 worldwide effluents from the wwtps contaminate about 25 of lakes and rivers 260 5 1 the mediterranean basin as a case study on the occurrence and distribution and of ppcps in wastewater and wwtps the area of mediterranean basin contains lower upper middle and high income countries is leading to variation in demographic and populations industrialization and economic growth disposal and reuses of wastewater water and wastewater treatment processes 261 as a result there is a variation in water management and policies for each country differ than others as follow a high income developed countries such as france and italy treat about 70 of produced wastewater b upper middle income countries such as turkey croatia and algeria treat about 38 of wastewater and c lower middle income countries e g tunisia morocco and syria treat about 28 of wastewater 262 263 the mediterranean basin covering european countries classified in the top of 10 producers and exporters of medicines in europe in 2016 such as spain italy and france 4 5 and 10 respectively 264 based on official reports some of countries such as spain italy france slovenia and greece were registered a considerable amounts of drug consumption 265 a review provided by desbiolles and coworkers 243 discussed the contamination of aquatic environment by 43 pharmaceutical substances including their different classes such as β blockers antibiotics sex hormones anti depressants lipid regulators and anti inflammatory drugs occurring in natural surface waters and sewage running off into the mediterranean basin in addition to watersheds and the mediterranean sea they selected these substances based on some criteria all substances should be reported in an international context 266 and each compound should be fulfilled at least one of the following a mainly distributed in solutions i e log kow 3 e g acetaminophen norfloxacin metronidazole b at environmental level should have an ecotoxicological effect at tens μg l 41 and c in conventional wwtps their removal efficiencies are low 20 e g atenolol carbamazepine 251 occurrence study was carried out relying on database from publications in international journals between 2002 and 2018 the total ppcps concentrations values of this database were 6072 included 2964 for rivers 753 for sea water 904 for wwtps influents and 1451 for wwtps effluents effluents and influents data were obtained from municipal and domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps fig 11 fig 11 shows the map of geographical sites of wwtps sea and rivers samples referenced in the 67 papers for pharmaceutical quantities in the mediterranean basin their spatial distribution and occurrences were mainly in the european mediterranean countries accounting about 83 of the collected data as follows france 15 articles greece 11 articles spain 28 articles and italy 14 articles besides this map spotlights on the deficiency of published data in worldwide reports and scientific papers in other countries such as albania libya morocco and little data in other countries in southern mediterranean basin in the mediterranean countries the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and frequency of detection in influents and effluents of wwtps are shown in fig 12 fig 12 shows large number of points referring to several studies that have been carried out to investigate the occurrence of antibiotics and their ingredients in the mediterranean basin fig 11 indicates the frequency of detection fd of 5 antibiotic substances of 10 which were measured 90 of total selected cases at median concentrations ranged from 90 to 461 ng l in samples of wwtps antibiotic class was found in several regions and countries such as china europe and america as reported by 6 54 267 269 analgesics and anti inflammatories in the mediterranean basin are considered the most abundant substances in wastewater due to their high rate of consumption in these countries the results revealed that the median values ranged from 410 for ketoprofen propionic acid class to 10 000 ng l for aspirin acetylsalicylic acid and the frequency of detection was from 80 to 100 but for acetaminophen paracetamol and ibuprofen the frequency of detection was from 5 to 10 251 in influents and effluents of sewage waters it was found quite low levels of estrogens below 10 ng l in eff and about 50 ng l in inf with fd about 70 80 although hormones were a considerable spreading due to their endocrine disruptive influences they were less frequently studied in wwtps water because of their log kow ranging from 3 to 4 2 and have a tendency to be slightly in sludge 243 fig 13 shows the psychotropic drugs as highly studied carbamazepine anticonvulsant antiepileptic drug their quantities in mediterranean wwtps which are ranging from hundreds to 1000 ng l in inlets and outlets were confirmed by data published in usa and europe 108 270 lipid regulators which are considered as β blockers were detected in 70 to 85 of studied cases the most studied medicines in class c cardiovascular system were atenolol and gemfibrozil at their highest values from hundreds to 1000 ng l respectively although propranolol and metoprolol are excreted as their parent origin form at only 10 271 they were identified in sewage with concentrations about 50 and 200 ng l and for propranolol and metoprolol respectively urinary drugs such as metoprolol and its two metabolites o desmethylmetoprolol and α hydroxymetoprolol and their metabolization pathways were studied 272 demonstration the potential occurrence of pharmaceutical residues phrs indicates that the mediterranean sea becomes a vulnerable ecosystem due to its location as a basin for receiving huge amounts of pollutants 5 2 usa as a case study on the occurrence and distribution of ppcps in wwtps u s environmental protection agency epa announced that there are more than public 14 591 wwtps in the usa in the service of 226 4 million people reported in 2012 273 in the usa thousands of prescribed and non prescribed drugs such as illicit medicines are annually released into the aquatic environment in the form of 35 300 million gallons of wastewater about 500 million tons of animal manure sources and more than 8 million of dry biosolids 274 275 different classes of ppcps comprise antihypertensives psychoactives antibiotics analgesics and illicit drugs reported at ng l to μg l introduced wwtps in the usa fig 14 278 280 in 2011 about 262 5 million of drugs administrations were dispensed in the usa leading to 5 prescriptions for every 6 persons 281 the studies revealed that trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin are among the highest ordained antibiotics in the usa and are the most commonly detected compounds in wastewater systems 278 282 283 trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were loaded at 0 39 kg d and 0 71 kg d respectively into a wwtp to serve about 650 000 persons in las vegas nevada usa 284 furthermore it was found that a first generation of antiallergenic medicine diphenhydramine was detected at 530 ng l in influents of wastewater during elevated seasonal allergies seasonal allergic rhinitis in texas usa 282 recently in the usa a nationwide large scale study including 50 large wwtps covering 20 states that treat about 17 of total wastewater production found that the antipsychotics and antihypertensives were more frequently detected with higher concentrations than other prioritized pharmaceutical classes 274 globally psychoactives psychopharmaceutical or psychotropic drugs are among the most widely used drugs it was found that in the usa the total consumption of psychoactive drugs raised from 1998 to 2008 by 78 285 and reported at the highest selling classes with 14 billion among prescription medications in sales in 2009 286 an antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole is one of the most administrated drugs in the usa its mass loading to wwtps was found to be 6 46 mg d 1000 persons in new york 280 in 2013 sertraline quetiapine fluoxetine lorazepam bupropion and alprazolam were the top selling prescribed psychoactive drugs in the usa and the mass loading were found to be 1 66 78 9 mg d 1000 persons in a wwtp in new york 280 acetaminophen ibuprofen carbamazepine and the most prescribed antidepressants such as fluoxetine citalopram and sertraline for specific characteristics see section 2 were the most frequently detected antipsychotics in wastewater in the usa 280 282 283 287 among narcotic opioid analgesics despite the relatively high consumption of hydrocodone detected in the western midwest and the south of usa while oxycodone was measured in the northeast 288 according to chiaia and coworkers 289 they reported greatest quantities of oxycodone than hydrocodone in the selected samples across the usa in the usa from 2000 to 2010 the total production of oxycodone and hydrocodone was exceeded by 300 to 55 000 kg and 90 000 kg respectively 290 the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc reported that there were more than 165 315 million illicit drug users over the world 291 and in the usa in 2013 about 9 4 of the population age 12 years used illicit medicines 292 in 2011 the most famous illicit drugs such as cocaine and cannabis the usa produced about 94 tons of cocaine approximately 10 5 of the total global production 291 frequently the effluent discharges are mixed of unchanged parent substances metabolites or ingredients their conjugates and many other wwtp derived transformed products fig 15 274 278 280 283 293 historically discharges of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment was as early as 1977 where it was reported that about 28 69 kg of salicylic acid was daily released to the missouri river in north america in kansas city through the effluents of wastewater from a wwtp that is treating about 300 millions of liter per day mld wastewater for serving 600 000 people 260 294 subsequently trace levels ng l to μg l of different pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics antihypertensives analgesics psychoactives and their selected metabolites and ingredients were detected in 139 sewage impacted streams covering 32 states in the usa 51 logically once pharmaceutical substances released into the environment will be significantly transported for long distances in surface waters through different water sources where venlafaxine was detected with high concentration of 102 ng l till at 8 4 km downstream from effluent stream of a single source 287 in recent studies several compounds including atenolol gemfibrozil carbamazepine diphenhydramine cocaine and sulfamethoxazole were detected closely to the shore sites of muir beach to monterey bay 295 and san francisco bay california usa 296 antihypertensives psychoactives and antibiotics were the most detected substances among selected 63 substances at higher concentrations in effluents collected from 50 wwtps through the usa 274 a round 16 psychoactive compounds and their selected metabolites discharged from a wwtp in albany new york was detected at 1542 mg d 1000 inhabitants this quantity is equivalent to yearly discharges of 56 3 kg psychoactives into the river water 280 yearly discharges of methamphetamine and azithromycin from a wwtp into received water in nevada was about 0 05 0 11 kg and 1 4 kg respectively while the amount of methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma in receiving water in south carolina was 0 02 kg 297 nevertheless about 6 5 kg of illicit compounds comprise morphine methamphetamine mdma methadone cocaine and their ingredients and metabolites were released into the river water from a wastewater treatment plant in new york 279 also the discharges of pharmaceuticals through wastewater effluents vary with the seasons as well as that was described for influents in winter the concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in effluents can be greater than in summer season attributed to significant human consumption and low biodegradation of drugs in winter season 298 6 occurrence of ppcps in groundwater comparing to other freshwater resources the significant contamination of groundwater resources by nano and micro ppcps is a growing interest and poorly understood recently groundwater supplies the most trustworthy perennial source of clean freshwater on the land it sustains levels and flows in lakes and rivers necessary for the health of groundwater dependent ecosystems and in many regions of the globe becomes the main source of drinking water 2 on the basis of the reviewed articles it is found that concentrations of pharmaceuticals in groundwater are lower than in surface water peng and coworkers 322 reported that the 52 target studied pharmaceuticals sulfamethoxazole fluconazole erythromycin methyl paraben salicylic acid bisphenol and triclosan were the most observed at ng l levels in 70 selected groundwater samples obtained near to multiple landfill locations in guangzhou china lapworth and coworkers 35 studied the occurrence of five frequently pharmaceuticals in groundwater their work was carried out in 14 countries through europe asia north america and the middle east their results indicated that the average quantities of caffeine diclofenac ibuprofen carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were 9800 ng l n 14 121 ng l n 11 1500 ng l n 14 5000 ng l n 23 and 252 ng l n 15 respectively lin and coworkers 323 studied the occurrences of concern emerging contaminants and their presence correlation in groundwater with possible sources of pollution in taiwan they reported that the results exhibited most of the 50 selected substances in addition to perfluorinated compounds were at the ng l level except for acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole and 17α ethinylestradiol were at 1036 ng l 1820 ng l and 1822 ng l respectively from the results it was shown that the ppcps which reported high quantities in groundwater were convenient with the results obtained from studies conducted in other countries sulphonamides are consider as one of the most studied classes and were reported higher concentrations in most studies 324 326 anticonvulsants e g carbamazepine analgesics and anti inflammatories medicines such as diclofenac paracetamol salicylic acid and ibuprofen are the most common detected in groundwater because they are the widely consumed drugs studies reported that salicylic acid was found at concentration ranged from 43 7 to 2014 7 ng l with detection of 98 in guangzhou china 322 loos and coworkers 327 reported the predominantly used antiepileptic carbamazepine was detected in 42 of groundwater specimens obtained from 23 european countries from 164 locations with a highest concentration of 390 ng l the frequencies of detection of metabolites and lipid regulators in groundwater such as clofibric acid gemfibrozil and bezafibrate were lower than those of anti inflammatories and antibiotics 322 the chalk aquifers consider an essential source of drinking water for northern europe countries in addition to its sustainability for the ecosystem of surface water in this region lapworth et al 328 studied the presentence of ppcps and their transformation products in the chalk groundwater of france and england the results revealed the highest concentrations in england were for bisphenol a 100 μg l n butylbenzenesulfonamide bbsa and diethyl phthalate dep pesticides diphenylamine atrazine and its breakdown products desethyl atrazine dea anthracene and caffeine also in france the concentrations of detected substances were higher but lower than the detected substances in england where the highest results were for diethylhexylphthalate dehp and n butylbenzenesulfonamide bbsa and bisphenol a 1 4100 μg l demonstrating that 20 of 32 studied substances weren t revealed any results such as diethyltoluamide deet and anthracene in addition to ibuprofen and parabens novel study for the concentrations and seasonal variability of ppcps in 8 drinking water 17 surface water and 12 groundwater samples collected from lagos state southwest of nigeria the median concentrations of ppcps were drinking water 424 ng l groundwater 948 ng l surface water 4660 ng l the results revealed that amoxicillin antibiotic was the most prevalent detected compound owing to its potential effect on development of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains it was observed a seasonal variation in the quantities of selected compounds between collected samples in the summer the rain season and in the winter the dry season the authors attributed these variations to several characteristic factors such as dilution produced from extensive rainfall basic agriculture activities in addition to the usage of pharmaceuticals in the local community 14 fig 16 illustrates the pathways sources and fate of ppcps in the subsurface groundwater using source pathway receptor framework 35 sources of ppcps in the aquatic environment which may affect groundwater can be divided into point and diffuse sources of pollution major sources of ppcps in the environmental systems include examination of key origins paths and fate of ppcps in the underground that can cause to contamination of groundwater are showing in fig 16 spotlighting those sources which are suggested to have the highest effect on groundwater resources 6 1 france as a case study on ppcps emerging contaminants in groundwater the french ministry of ecology and the french national agency for water and aquatic environments have started a nationwide exploration survey on emerging contaminants such as ppcps this study included analysis of 411 emerging contaminants in the collected samples from 494 groundwater locations across france fig 17 329 the study included the parent molecules and their transformation products where 44 of the targeted compounds 180 substances were detected in at least one sampling site 55 substances were detected in 1 of samples and both of emerging and regulated compounds were detected unregulated substances such as acetaminophen bisphenol a carbamazepine dioxins furans perfluorinated compounds triazine and caffeine were found in 10 of the analysed samples the threshold of toxicological concern of 0 1 μg l was detected for some of triazine transformation products bisphenol a and tolyltriazole the obtained results could help in environmental regulators and water resource managers to develop accurate policies related to the presence and distribution of emerging and regulated pollutants in groundwater according to the types of compounds or categories of use they divided the compounds into 19 groups and 4 main categories e g pesticides agricultural industrial compounds and other emerging contaminants about 131 pharmaceutical compounds 17 steroids and hormones 37 antibiotics 5 biocides 6 non prescribed medicines and 66 other prescribed medicines 103 pesticides 29 fungicides 26 insecticides and 48 herbicides 143 industrial substances dioxins and furans 36 pcbs 25 dyes 10 plasticizers 11 flame retardants 13 perfluorinated compounds and 48 other industrial compounds and 34 other emerging pollutants 10 cosmetics 13 lifestyle products 4 disinfection by products 3 organotins and 4 toxins were explored in the groundwater collected samples 68 of the analysed samples exhibited positive results for a minimum one drug derivative and 60 pharmaceutical products where about 45 8 of the targeted pharmaceutical products were detected at least once in groundwater the existence of ppcps was highest in areas where the main sources of groundwater is usually urban industrial or urban agricultural with an average number of pharmaceutical products measured per sample of 2 16 and 2 24 respectively compared to 1 33 in natural environments and 1 63 in agricultural stations acetaminophen a non prescription analgesic was the most frequently detected 27 carbamazepine 14 6 metformin 7 8 tramadol 7 3 oxazepam 4 3 completed the series of the top 5 of most detected compounds the most 5 quantified compounds were oxazepam 5 6 metformin 8 3 tramadol 8 7 acetaminophen 15 4 carbamazepine 16 8 in the fall acetaminophen was found significantly greater in the spring than in the fall while their quantity was lesser for the other top 5 compounds sulfamethoxazole erythromycin and metronidazole were the most frequently quantified antibiotics in sampling sites the most frequently quantified pharmaceuticals were acetaminophen 29 carbamazepine 26 5 tramadol 11 metformin 10 3 and oxazepam 9 the results indicated the significant influence of the veterinary use of drugs especially antibiotic residues in livestock on groundwater underneath agricultural land for some of ppcps the obtained results were in agreement with those reported in the literatures sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and acetaminophen are usually reported as being among the most frequently detected compounds in groundwater 35 148 7 regulations guidelines and policies of ppcps in the environmental systems most of pharmaceutical compounds are synthesized to be metabolic or biologically active and persist in both of human and animal body even at low concentrations to accomplish their target effect 26 330 due to their direct and indirect potential risks international organizations authorities and governments have administrated sets of guidelines and strategies to regulate and control the problems of different ppcps in aquatic systems we have categorized the interventions taken by regulators as follow a regulations and directives proposed by the european union eu b strategies and recommendations by international organizations c legislations guidelines declared by state governments countries 7 1 regulations and directives proposed by the european union eu several policies and directives have been published by european union eu related to emerging pollutants e g ppcps and other contaminants that may cause a potential threat to humans and environment summarized as follow in 2000 the official journal of the european communities ojec has announced the first official regulations and guidelines to spotlight on compounds that can pose a significant risk to human health and the environment 24 additionally in 2000 the same year the european union adopted the water framework directive wfd which takes a pioneer approach to protect water matrices the wfd included the surface water watch list wl that comprises potential water pollutants which should be determined by the eu member states and determined if they cause a potential threat to the aquatic systems and if the environmental quality standards eqs should be declared for them 24 in 2008 the second regulations and directives announced the priority of 33 compounds and the suggested environmental quality standards eqs 331 in 2013 after five years the official journal of the european union ojeu released a new directive to recommend the detection and elimination of another selected 45 substances that can lead to side effects on humans and the environmental systems 332 directive 2013 39 ec enclosed the first watch list wl has detected and analysed 10 substances where the number of detected compounds can increase to 14 as a maximum 52 selection of substances depends on the accessible data that means whether these compounds can cause a potential threat to the aquatic systems and if the required data for these substances isn t sufficient to know if they can cause risks or side effects on the aquatic systems or not in 2015 the development of first wl under the environmental quality standards directive was published and proposed additional 7 substances 333 in the first wl three pharmaceutical substances comprised e2 ee2 and diclofenac after identifying the compounds involved in the first announced watch list the joint research center jrc of the eu advised that five compounds should be eliminated from the updated watch list involving diclofenac drug owing to the accessibility of sufficient data in 2018 the joint research center jrc policy report updated the watch list to comprise three new additional compounds therefore the list encompassed eight groups of substances which contain a list of compounds such as ciprofloxacin clarithromycin erythromycin azithromycin amoxicillin e1 e2 and ee2 the new european commission plan against antimicrobial resistance compounds included additional antibiotics in the new watch list 334 335 in 2020 the european commission has issued a new commission implementation decision 336 the new decision of eu strategic approach ceased the potential monitoring of e1 e2 ee2 neonicotinoid group and macrolide antibiotics e g azithromycin clarithromycin erythromycin this is attributed to that the persistent duration of these compounds has reached four years as reported by directive 2008 105 ec 52 7 2 strategies and recommendations by international organizations recently there are several international committees and organizations that have argued the issue of ppcps in the environment and stated the legislations and guidelines to regulate and control the existence and distribution of ppcps in environmental systems as example the european commission ec has obligated the assessment of environmental risk of human and veterinary drugs in order to support approval marketing authorization for all of new medicines moreover the european union strategic approach eusa completes the newest approved approach on endocrine disrupting compounds edcs along with other proposed initial actions such as evaluation of the urban waste water treatment recast of drinking water regulations and reuse of water 337 the european commission ec adopted six actions or plans to regulate and control the problems of ppcps occurrences in environmental systems in brief the first plan action advised controlling of pharmaceutical substances that could cause a significant risk on the environment this will reduce and solve the problem from its source the second action based on the idea of green pharmaceuticals where the ec encourages ppcps industries to enhance more environmentally friendly substances the third action the european commission proposed improvement the current models and technologies of environmental risk assessment through potential collaboration with different agencies such as member states e g the netherlands sweden and the european medicines agency ema the fourth action the european commission will take an appropriate action to reduce pharmaceuticals wastes to prevent or limit their risks on the environment through improvement the waste management system moreover the ec confirmed the importance of development and application of new technologies for wastewater treatment especially at certain sources e g livestock farming to minimize the releases of ppcps into environmental compartments the fifth action the eu should increase studies for quantification of pharmaceuticals in environmental systems finally the ec will take an appropriate action on behave of filling the knowledge gaps and missing information especially research on i the toxicity behavior and fate of pharmaceutical active substances in the environment ii the linking between the presence of antimicrobials in environmental systems and the fate and development of antimicrobial gens iii the significant chronic effects of ppcps in lowest quantities on the environment and human health and iv improvement of cost effective new methods for minimizing the existence of ppcps in the environment the world health organization who in 2012 has advised that the possibility of health risk of ppcps can be estimated by implementation the minimum therapeutic dose mtd 40 with taking in account the number of daily doses the mtd is usually equivalent to the lowest or advised prescribed therapeutic dose 26 the implementation of mtd can be valuable in the developing of conservative screening values and for risk assessment owing to absence loss of accessible information on the toxicological effects of medicinals in water 40 the toxicological effects of ppcps depend on the exposure s duration and the potential concentration of chemicals within the target organism the organization of economic co operation and development oecd in 2019 has applied legislations to limit and regulate the presence of ppcps in the environment 338 the oceb has established five economical guidelines and policies to govern the presence of ppcps in aquatic systems and to maintain the water quality 338 the strategic approach to international chemicals management saicm which is a global multi stakeholder and multi sectoral policy frameworks offers a directive to discuss and tackle the challenges related to the authorization and application of national policies to safely regulate chemicals around the world the saicm was launched in dubai on february 02 2006 339 is one of the newest additions in order to respond to the global objective of the 2002 world summit on sustainable development in johannesburg to produce and use chemicals in a way that minimizes their undesired harmful effects on human and ecosystem health 7 3 legislations guidelines reported by state governments countries number of countries of the member states e g the netherlands sweden the organization of economic co operation and development oecd 338 countries germany switzerland south korean the united kingdom united states and australia and others e g belgium france have applied legislations and control measures to organize the problems of ppcps and other organic compounds in the environment table 6 8 challenges and future perspectives the world s water security and natural environment have been severely impacted by the uncontrollable dumping of ppcps in the aquatic bodies deterioration of water quality and global warming this review presented an upgraded comprehensive summary on the occurrence and distribution of a large number of ppcps from different geographical regions north america europe asia africa and other regions worldwide using of ppcps are growing and expected to continous increase owing to the growing of world population this has prompted the globe to investigate new environmentally acceptable pathways for efficient monitoring and remediation of these emerging contaminants to meet the sustainable development goals additional efforts in the conversion recycling of wastewater to energy are required in the current environment the future lies in putting more emphasis on the most favored solutions for wastewater reclamation thence based on the author s knowledge and study the following aspects should be explored in future studies to defeat the confronted challenges promotion of innovative pathways for converting ppcps laden wastewater into value added resources for industrial purposes integrating data driven technologies such as machine learning ml and artificial neural networks with wastewater management for better process optimization higher recyclability rates and enhanced final product quality could be one of the potential future directions for data quantification the implementation of a standard framework with continual checks for wastewater remediation could be a viable option it is necessary to have a long term approach to minimizing waste at the source changing people s attitudes about wastewater dumping into aquatic bodies and making them aware of the benefits of energy production to address concerns such as environmental pollution global warming and climate change assessment the long term impact of ppcps on the human health and ecosystems awareness campaigns social media campaigns and non governmental organizations should encourage and provide information on efficient wastewater to energy conversion the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in the greater disposal of wastewater hence more focus should be given towards wastewater surveillance recycling of wastewater in accord with the concept of zero liquid discharge for realizing a circular economy during the covid 19 pandemic a massive consumption of some drugs as antivirals antibiotics antiparasitics antiprotozoals and glucocorticoids used in the treatment of this virus has increased the discharge of pharmaceutical residues in different aqueous matrices 357 conventional treatment systems fail to efficiently remove these contaminants from water matrices in this regard antiviral drugs show increases higher than 70 of their concentration in urban wastewater compared before 358 and during the pandemic 359 as example before the pandemic azithromycin antibiotic concentration in surface waters was 4 3 ng l and during the pandemic it increased up to 935 ng l other examples kuroda et al 359 reported that water treated through urban wwtp and the concentrations of these drugs and their metabolites were favipiravir 4231 ng l lopinavir 730 ng l ribavirin 7402 ng l and remdesivir 319 ng l during the current pandemic the average dose of favipiravir drug is 1600 mg day and the predicted environmental concentration is 64 ng l and its main metabolite t705m1 is 4248 ng l in domestic wastewater 359 additionally the average dose of lopinavir received by coronavirus patients is currently 800 mg day which generates an expected environmental concentration of 880 ng l of the parent compound and 2840 ng l of its metabolites in domestic wastewater 360 according to romano and coworkers 361 hydroxychloroquine is one of the highest growth rates of sales during 2020 in contrast to the same period in 2019 this is related to the high consumption during the highest peaks of the pandemic and the maximum consumption value was observed in countries such as portugal at the end of march 2021 the same approach was employed by kuroda and coworkers 359 where they estimated that the concentrations of hydroxychloroquine as anti covid 19 drug in surface water will reach to 78 3 ng l and in domestic wastewater will be 833 ng l

12543,organic contaminated groundwater poses a growing threat to environmental sustainability and human health as a passive plume control technology permeable reactive barriers prbs have become a popular method for groundwater pollutants degradation due to their cost effective and sustainable merits however active materials adopted in conventional prbs have the shortcomings of easy deactivation and speedy consumption as an alternative slow release materials can be used as prbs fillers to treat contaminated groundwater because of their long chemical release time in this study novel slow release persulfate pellets were prepared and tested for their release capabilities and effectiveness in the remediation of groundwater organic pollution results show that each pellet s release efficiency and average release rate within 14 days were 87 36 and 46 80 mg persulfate d respectively when the mass ratio of sodium persulfate to paraffin was 3 1 dissolution and diffusion via pores are the main mechanisms of the persulfate delivery from slow release pellets in water moreover solution ph ionic species and addition of quartz sand into release pellets play dissimilar effects on the release kinetics results from column experiments indicate that the pellets could expand the ps influence range in the barrier and continuously remediate btexs contaminated groundwater initial concentration of each compound 50 mg l and reach 64 2 85 1 removal efficiency the results of electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy show that both so4 and oh contribute to the removal of btexs this study demonstrates the potential feasibility of slow release persulfate materials for groundwater pollution treatments by prbs which inspires for future field applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords persulfate pellets groundwater contamination permeable reactive barriers prbs slow release in situ oxidation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most crucial drinking water sources in the world 1 however the accelerated development of human industry has led to increasing groundwater pollution the btexs found in groundwater have attracted considerable attention due to their toxicity and carcinogenicity which pose great threats to human health 2 btexs mainly include benzene toluene ethylbenzene and paraxylene which are common pollutants in the petrochemical industry leakage of oil in exploration and improper sewage discharging in contaminated sites lead to the above compounds inevitably entering the groundwater 3 5 consequently various groundwater remediation technologies for btexs pollution have emerged these technologies are mainly divided into ex situ methods and in situ methods according to superfund remedy report 16th edition in 1257 contaminated sites the selection trends of ex situ remediation have decreased in general but that of in situ remediation has increased from 2015 to 2017 the proportion selecting the ex situ approaches decreased from 21 to 19 while that of the in situ methods increased from 50 to 53 which fully reflects the considerable acceptance and dependence of in situ remediation technologies for contaminated groundwater in situ remediation technologies mainly include bioremediation chemical treatment monitored natural attenuation and permeable reactive barriers prbs 6 8 among them prbs have received a great deal of attention and application because of their remarkable economic and ecological benefits 9 10 in prbs active materials are added downstream of pollution plume where contaminated groundwater reacts with them to reduce concentrations or transform into less hazardous substances by physical adsorption chemical oxidation and biodegradation 11 13 prbs have sound treatment effects on various target pollutants such as btexs tphs and heavy metals applicable for the phreatic aquifer 14 15 selecting advisable reaction media is the key to prbs technology at present zero valent iron zvi activated carbon and mineral materials are the most commonly used 16 18 however in the long term operation of prbs zvi is easy to passivate and inactivate and it is also accessible to cause prbs blockage due to small particle size carbonaceous and mineral materials will significantly reduce the removal efficiency after adsorption saturation in addition when the media capacity of prbs is limited many materials are demanded to achieve an excellent removal effect for high concentration pollutants which leads to an increase in economical cost and accelerates the consumption rate of media and shortens the longevity of prbs accordingly it is necessary to explore new reaction media or supply media the slow release material is to take specific approaches to slow down the release of specific active substances sass within a certain period of time so that the concentration of sass can remain effective for a long time 19 generally the slow release material consists of inert matrices and sass and no chemical reaction occurs between them when the material contacts with groundwater the sass are gradually released to oxidize organic pollutants in situ the slow release material has a prolonged action time and can continuously provide effective concentration which is expected to promote the long term effectiveness of media in prbs currently a few studies explored the combination of slow release materials and prbs to remove organic pollutants such as tce mtbe and btexs and the sass involved are mainly permanganate and persulfate 20 22 the residue mno2 generated by permanganate may affect mass transfer and cause prbs blockage 23 but persulfate has no such risk and has a higher oxidation reduction potential and can degrade btexs in this study a slow release oxidant was synthesized using persulfate ps and paraffin batch experiments were conducted to assess its release performance and the impact of several physicochemical parameters including solution ph ionic species and addition of sand on persulfate release the surface morphology before and after release was observed by sem to analyze the ps release process furthermore column experiments were directed to simulate the prbs system to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of slow release persulfate for the removal of btexs 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium persulfate na2s2o8 ar 99 paraffin wax and quartz sand were purchased from aladdin chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china benzene toluene ethylbenzene and paraxylene btexs ar 99 5 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china hydrochloric acid hcl ar 37 and sodium hydroxide naoh ar 97 were employed to adjust the solution ph and they were purchased from beijing chemical works beijing china potassium iodide ki ar 99 0 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 ar 99 8 were used for persulfate concentration determination ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o ar 99 0 was used to activate persulfate and they were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo c6h11no 97 was served as a spin trapping reagent and it was purchased from anpu experimental technology co ltd shanghai china all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water from a pure ultrapure water integrated system milli q integral 3 2 2 preparation of slow release persulfate the slow release persulfate was fabricated via a physical approach first an electric skillet with a constant temperature water bath was heated to 70 c subsequently paraffin wax was placed into a 100 ml glass beaker in the tub after the paraffin was melted entirely sodium persulfate was added to the beaker quickly and the two were blended by a glass rod next the mixture in the molten state was poured into spherical molds diameter 1 cm then let them cool for 5 min and removed the prepared products were termed s ps pellets since the mass ratios of ps to paraffin were 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 3 1 3 2 and 4 1 respectively the corresponding products were denoted as p1 p7 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted to assess the release kinetics of ps from s ps pellets briefly each s ps pellet was immersed in a conical flask containing 200 ml milli q water and the flasks were kept at room temperature by a seal a certain amount of solution samples were collected according to a predetermined time interval for ps concentration determination additionally the ps release was evaluated under different conditions including solution ph and ionic species as well as the addition of quartz sand this study used the cumulative persulfate concentration over time to characterize the ps release in s ps pellets based on the volume of the solution and the ps concentration in the solution the cumulative release mass mg average release rate mg d and release efficiency of persulfate for each s ps pellet could be calculated 2 4 column study column experiments were directed to simulate the prbs system on the one hand the release properties of s ps pellets in a homogeneous porous medium system can be explored on the other hand the effectiveness of using these materials on contaminated groundwater would be evaluated the layout of the column experiments is exhibited in fig 1 each column had a length of 150 mm with an inside diameter of 20 mm and an outside diameter of 30 mm it has good sealing and one side connects with a peristaltic pump for delivering solution the whole column is made of glass and all pipes conveying the solution are made of ptfe a single column was used to evaluate the effects of different flow rates 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 ml min on persulfate release three continuous flow columns were used to simulate the remediation of btexs contaminated groundwater by prbs 2 5 analytical methods the ps concentration was determined by the uv spectrophotometer u 3900 at 352 nm 24 the btexs concentrations were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography ultimate 3000 the hplc was equipped with a uv detector and a 150 mm 4 6 mm 3 μm chromatographic column acetonitrile and dipotassium phosphate were employed as the mobile phase the flow rate was 1 ml min and the injection volume was 10 μl the uv wavelength and temperature were 210 nm and 30 c respectively the standard curves are detailed in figs s1 and s2 the s ps pellets surface morphology changes before and after release were observed by field emission scanning electron microscope fei quanta 650 feg operated at voltage 20 kv and beam spot 3 0 free radicals in degradation were identified by electron spinresonance spectroscopy esr emplus 6 i p l the specific parameters were sweep width of 100 g a resonance frequency of 9 057 ghz microwave power of 18 2 mw 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of s ps pellets the prepared s ps pellets were white in appearance and 1 cm in diameter and associated properties are provided in table s1 p1 p2 and p3 pellets have smooth surfaces due to the high content of paraffin in contrast p4 p7 pellets have rough surfaces and a sense of grain when the ps to paraffin mass ration exceeds 4 1 the adhesion between particles is not tight and the product is loose for all s ps pellets the specific gravity is heavier than that of water note ps and paraffin densities are 2 4 and 0 9 g cm3 respectively assuming that ps in each pellet is completely released the porosity of the pellets is 40 06 26 44 20 03 53 69 60 09 48 08 and 64 10 respectively therefore when the ps in a pellet is exhausted the pellet can be seen as a sphere framework composed of paraffin only the density of the pellet becomes lighter than water and will float in the aqueous phase fig s3 this feature will make it convenient to salvage the pellets from underground in actual engineering each s ps pellet was put into ki solution and the color of the solution was observed to turn yellow due to i2 generated eq 1 25 the color presented darker and expanded around over time indicating that ps was released from the pellets and diffused a certain distance according to the color radius and depth the slow release effect of s ps pellets could be qualitatively learned by examining table s2 one can find that the impact of different mass ratios among s ps pellets was possibly different when the proportion of ps was higher the solution showed deeper color and broader diffusion radius which indirectly reflected the faster release rate 1 s 2 o 8 2 2 i 2 so 4 2 i 2 3 2 s ps pellets release characteristics and process since the mass ratio of ps to paraffin plays a critical role in the structural stability and physical properties of the pellets it is necessary to investigate the release characteristics of different pellets fig 2 a shows that the release longevity of s ps pellets was considerably different for p1 p2 and p3 the ps concentrations increased slowly and reached the plateau on the 2 4th day for p4 p7 the ps concentrations rose relatively fast reaching the platform on the 5 7th day the main reason for this phenomenon is that the mass transfer resistances of s ps pellets in the slow release process were disparate hydrophobic paraffin hinder water penetration into the pore space of pellet matrix thus increasing the ps dissolution and release resistance 26 27 the porosity was higher for s ps pellets with more ps content so they suffered lower mass transfer resistance the ps release from s ps pellets conformed to the second order kinetic equation and the fitting curve is shown in fig 2 b the release quantity q and time t fitted to the second order kinetic relationship 2 1 q 1 q 1 1 kt 3 k q 1 t 1 2 q1 is the maximum ps release quantity of unit mass s ps pellets mg g t1 2 is the time to reach half of the maximum ps release quantity d k is the mass transfer coefficient reflecting the resistance in the ps release process mg d g the kinetic equation fitting parameters are shown in table 1 when q1 is larger the ability of s ps pellets to release persulfate is more remarkable when t1 2 is lower the stable release time of s ps pellets is faster when k is higher the mass transfer resistance is minor and ps release is easier from table 1 the q1 value of p7 was the largest up to 742 382 mg g thus its ability to release ps was the strongest among s ps pellets besides the k value of each pellet was ranked as p5 p1 p7 p6 p4 p2 p3 so the mass transfer resistance of p5 was the smallest this rule is consistent with the trend in fig 2 from table s3 the release efficiency of p1 p4 was 70 so they were considered not an ideal pellet in contrast that of p5 p7 was higher than 80 besides p5 showed an appropriate porosity therefore pellets with a mass ratio of 3 1 p5 were selected as the materials for subsequent research to explore the slow release pathway of s ps pellets the surface and profile morphology of the p5 pellets before and after release was analyzed by sem as presented in fig 3 fig 3 a suggests that the surface and profile were relatively smooth with a few cracks before release fig 3 b indicates that a large area of pores and cracks appeared after release which might result from surface sodium persulfate dissolution it is speculated that the release behaviors of s ps pellets in water mainly include the following processes 1 na2s2o8 distributed on the surface of s ps pellets dissolves and causes pore networks after contact with water 2 convection through pores occurs between water and inner na2s2o8 driven by concentration difference and osmotic pressure in other words water flows in and na2s2o8 dissolves out 3 the internal na2s2o8 diffuses to the surface dissolves uniformly in water and releases completely fig 4 shows the slow release process of s ps pellets the whole release process can be summarized as na2s2o8 transported from the initial position of s ps pellets to its outer surface and finally dispersed in the surrounding environment 3 3 effects of factors on s ps pellets release performance parameters such as solution ph ionic species and addition of quartz sand may considerably affect ps release kinetics hence release experiments were also conducted at both acidic and alkaline conditions as well as at 7 ph condition as a control fig 5 a shows that the ps release concentration in different solution ph is 3 01 3 28 g l indicating no noticeable difference table s4 summarizes the ps release kinetics in different conditions from table s4 the ps release efficiency under alkaline conditions 82 7 81 83 and 80 16 was slightly lower than that under neutral 87 36 and acidic conditions 86 04 and 86 51 this may be due to the activation of sodium persulfate by alkali resulting in a small amount of s2o8 2 consumption in general ph had no significant effect on the slow release performance of s ps pellets which was consistent with the previous research results 28 therefore it is considered that s ps pellets are desirable for remediation in various ph ranges there are specific contents of ionic species including mg2 ca2 so4 2 cl no3 and hco3 in natural water 29 thus another factor evaluated in this study is the presence of ionic species in the solution each ionic specie concentration was set at 10 mm for all experiments and no ion was added as a control it can be observed from fig 5 b that the ps concentration in cl solution was the lowest only 2 3 g l indicating that the presence of cl in solution has a negative impact on ps release results for one s ps pellet in cl solution the release efficiency and average release rate were 61 42 and 32 91 mg d respectively markedly lower than those of the control table s4 this observation can be explained by the fact that the redox reaction between cl and s2o8 2 induced a low determination value of persulfate eqs 4 and 5 30 except for cl other ionic species have negligible influence on ps release 4 s 2 o 8 2 cl h 2 o 2 so 4 2 clo 2 h 5 s 2 o 8 2 2 cl 2 so 4 2 cl 2 quartz sand is a hard wear resistant and stable mineral that is commonly used as the raw material to prepare slow release agents another key point discussed in this study was the effect of quartz sand on the release process of s ps pellets s ps pellets were prepared according to the method described in section 2 2 the mass ratio of ps to paraffin was 3 1 and the addition of quartz sand was set at 10 and 20 of the total mass of original pellets coarse sand 0 5 1 0 mm medium sand 0 25 0 5 mm and fine sand 0 125 0 25 mm are used in this experiment fig 5 c illustrates that the ps release concentration can be regulated by doping an appropriate amount of quartz sand into s ps pellets for pellets with sand the initial ps release concentration increased obviously at 0 25d the lowest ps concentration of the pellets doped with quartz sand was 1 78 g l which was significantly higher than that of the control 1 44 g l moreover within the same level of addition as the particle size of quartz sand increases the release efficiency and average release rate also uplift table s4 one reason can contribute to the acceleration of the ps release process the doping of quartz sand changed spatial distribution inside s ps pellets specifically the increment of quartz sand contents makes the pellets have higher porosity and more diffusion channels as a result the mass transfer resistance decreases continuously and more ps diffuses from pellets to the aqueous phase similarly published studies 31 32 have shown that the ps concentration increased with growing sand content in the slow release materials this indicates that when the slow release materials are applied to repair the contaminated site in situ the release rate of sodium persulfate can be controlled by adjusting the dose of quartz sand with different particle sizes 3 4 column study column experiments were performed under different flow rates to study the influence of groundwater velocity on persulfate release the column was filled with 10 g s ps pellets and 70 g quartz sand with grain sizes of 0 5 1 mm and its porosity and pore volume were 35 9 and 16 91 cm3 respectively the flow rates 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 ml min selected satisfies the characteristics of groundwater movement laminar flow and steady flow and the values are on par with the previously reported studies 33 34 the persulfate release results under different flow rates are shown in fig 6 a with the increase in flow rate the ps release concentrations rose slightly at the flow rates of 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 ml min the release efficiency of s ps pellets was 88 54 92 75 and 95 28 respectively table s5 compared with the results in batch experiments the ps concentrations and release efficiency in column experiments are higher about 1 05 1 13 times dynamics can affect the release rate and erosion of slow release drugs 35 persulfate in s ps pellets is diffused and dissolved in water mainly through pores based on concentration differences the column experiments exist fluid movements and the continuous unidirectional impact of water may lead to the native fracture evolving into larger secondary pores so that the ps inside it can be released faster and easier hydraulic conductivity indicates the difficulty of fluid passing through porous media and influences the solute transport in the barrier 36 therefore column experiments were also conducted to study the effect of hydraulic conductivity on persulfate release by changing the sand filled size 0 125 1 mm the hydraulic conductivity was measured by the constant head permeability test the specific values of fine medium and coarse sand were 5 20 and 40 m d respectively which were recorded as k1 k2 and k3 the release results under different k values are shown in fig 6 b in the early release stage the ps concentration under k3 was ahead of k1 and k2 but in the later period the difference was almost reduced to 0 this is because the hydraulic conductivity of k3 is higher than that of k1 and k2 and the solution flows more quickly resulting in earlier contact between s ps pellets and the solution in the later stage the solution in the k1 and k2 columns also fully penetrated into the s ps pellets so the cumulative release concentration under the three conditions was consistent in addition due to the strong solubility of the released ps aquifer blockage and permeability reduction will not occur when the s ps pellets have satisfying release properties they should also maintain the oxidation of sodium persulfate to degrade organic pollutants effectively in this study btexs have been selected as target pollutants because of their extensive distribution and severe environmental hazards in order to ensure the accuracy of s ps pellets for degradation the adsorption experiments for btexs were performed with paraffin pellets before column experiments paraffin pellets were prepared according to the method in 2 2 and the difference was that no sodium persulfate was added degradation results indicate that the adsorption for btexs by paraffin can be neglected fig s4 in the second part of the column study three continuous columns were used to simulate the prbs system to evaluate the effectiveness of slow release persulfate in btexs contaminated groundwater remediation ferrous iron with a concentration of 100 mg l was added in the influent to strengthen the persulfate oxidation fig 7 presents the variation trend of btexs over time in three columns the first column was a homogeneous aquifer crowded with quartz sand simulating the upstream of prb since no oxidant was added the concentration of btexs in first column did not decrease significantly the second column was persulfate release zone in which the btexs concentrations declined significantly from day 1 3 the removal efficiency of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and paraxylene was approximately 64 2 85 1 from day 4 7 the elimination efficiency of btexs decreased to 54 5 76 5 because persulfate was consumed the third column was downstream of the persulfate oxidation zone although no s ps pellets were filled about 38 8 63 4 compounds were still removed this demonstrated that the ps released by s ps pellets could also play a role in the downgradient area in other words the influence radius and reaction time are extended an important function that conventional fillers in prbs do not have this study demonstrated that s ps pellets ps paraffin 3 1 diameter 1 cm could effectively treat btexs c0 50 mg l within 7 days analogously kambhu et al developed a ps slow release candle ps paraffin 2 25 1 diameter 0 71 cm length 2 38 cm for the degradation of btexs c0 7 8 39 78 mg l 37 the results presented that ps candles could effectively decompose btexs within 7 days and the degradation efficiency was approximately 55 90 ma et al synthesized a ps controlled release bead ps paraffin 6 1 diameter 1 cm for the treatment of btexs c0 7 8 mg l the results showed that the removal efficiency within 10 days was 63 69 28 these studies provide a reference for the development and application of slow release ps in degrading organic contaminated groundwater prbs are generally considered green and sustainable remediation technology 38 if slow release ps can be used as the media of prbs the overall reactivity and durability of the prbs should be enhanced however the morphology of slow release ps such as candle pellet droplet and gel may affect its function besides hydrological conditions such as groundwater flow rates hydraulic conductivity and contaminant concentrations may affect oxidation efficiency furthermore it is better to establish mathematical equations to clarify the retardation factors and transport characteristics of pollutants in prbs therefore it is crucial to consider chemical and site factors when designing field applications in the future so that the developed prbs can effectively solve the problem of groundwater pollution 3 5 btexs oxidation mechanism and degradation pathway esr spectroscopy was used to determine free radical species produced in btexs oxidation as shown in fig 8 the characteristic signals of dmpo so4 with peak strength of 1 1 1 1 1 1 and dmpo oh with peak strength of 1 2 2 1 adducts were observed indicating that both so4 and oh were generated during the oxidation process to enhance the removal of btexs due to overlapping peaks signals of dmpo so4 are not obvious the production of so4 and oh in the system could attribute to the reactions eqs 6 and 7 39 40 6 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 s o 4 2 s o 4 7 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 oh the degradation pathway of btexs has been studied in detail in previous research 41 43 when the activated ps reacts with benzene so4 extracts an electron from benzene benzene then turns into a cationic radical quickly converts into phenol and aldehyde and is further oxidized to small molecule compounds the degradation intermediate products of toluene are benzaldehyde benzyl alcohol o cresol and bibenzyl 41 the specific degradation pathways can be inferred as two fig s5 on the one hand so4 extracts hydrogen atoms from toluene on the other hand so4 is directly added to the aromatic ring of toluene the intermediates of the above two pathways are further degraded into small molecules by oxidation reactions and finally mineralized into co2 h2o and inorganic ions the degradation pathways of ethylbenzene and p xylene are similar to those of toluene 4 conclusions in this study the persulfate pellet a novel slow release oxidant was developed and evaluated for its applicability in prb for groundwater remediation firstly the ps release characteristics of s ps pellets were methodically studied via batch experiments when the mass ratio of ps to paraffin was 3 1 the pellets had good formability and ideal release effect and the release process conformed to the second order kinetics additionally persulfate dissolution and diffusion through pores and cracks were crucial processes for the ps release from pellets moreover the impact of solution ph on the ps release kinetics can be ignored the presence of cl in the solution would consume s2o8 2 resulting in a lower determination of ps concentration the other ions in the solution do not affect the release process and results furthermore adding an appropriate amount of quartz sand when synthesizing pellets can change their spatial distribution expand porosity and reduce mass transfer resistance thereby increasing the ps release concentration release efficiency and release rate different flow rate and hydraulic conductivity conditions were established in a single column and the effects of these two factors on ps release were investigated under the influence of hydrodynamic the ps release concentration and release efficiency from s ps pellets were higher than those in batch experiments furthermore btexs removal by released ps was evaluated in three continuous flow columns with ps activated s ps pellets could effectively oxidize high concentration btexs during the 7 days operational period therefore the developed pellets have the potential to become a sustainable and cost effective alternative to remediate groundwater organic pollution credit authorship contribution statement bing wang supervision conceptualization funding acquisition

12543,organic contaminated groundwater poses a growing threat to environmental sustainability and human health as a passive plume control technology permeable reactive barriers prbs have become a popular method for groundwater pollutants degradation due to their cost effective and sustainable merits however active materials adopted in conventional prbs have the shortcomings of easy deactivation and speedy consumption as an alternative slow release materials can be used as prbs fillers to treat contaminated groundwater because of their long chemical release time in this study novel slow release persulfate pellets were prepared and tested for their release capabilities and effectiveness in the remediation of groundwater organic pollution results show that each pellet s release efficiency and average release rate within 14 days were 87 36 and 46 80 mg persulfate d respectively when the mass ratio of sodium persulfate to paraffin was 3 1 dissolution and diffusion via pores are the main mechanisms of the persulfate delivery from slow release pellets in water moreover solution ph ionic species and addition of quartz sand into release pellets play dissimilar effects on the release kinetics results from column experiments indicate that the pellets could expand the ps influence range in the barrier and continuously remediate btexs contaminated groundwater initial concentration of each compound 50 mg l and reach 64 2 85 1 removal efficiency the results of electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy show that both so4 and oh contribute to the removal of btexs this study demonstrates the potential feasibility of slow release persulfate materials for groundwater pollution treatments by prbs which inspires for future field applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords persulfate pellets groundwater contamination permeable reactive barriers prbs slow release in situ oxidation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most crucial drinking water sources in the world 1 however the accelerated development of human industry has led to increasing groundwater pollution the btexs found in groundwater have attracted considerable attention due to their toxicity and carcinogenicity which pose great threats to human health 2 btexs mainly include benzene toluene ethylbenzene and paraxylene which are common pollutants in the petrochemical industry leakage of oil in exploration and improper sewage discharging in contaminated sites lead to the above compounds inevitably entering the groundwater 3 5 consequently various groundwater remediation technologies for btexs pollution have emerged these technologies are mainly divided into ex situ methods and in situ methods according to superfund remedy report 16th edition in 1257 contaminated sites the selection trends of ex situ remediation have decreased in general but that of in situ remediation has increased from 2015 to 2017 the proportion selecting the ex situ approaches decreased from 21 to 19 while that of the in situ methods increased from 50 to 53 which fully reflects the considerable acceptance and dependence of in situ remediation technologies for contaminated groundwater in situ remediation technologies mainly include bioremediation chemical treatment monitored natural attenuation and permeable reactive barriers prbs 6 8 among them prbs have received a great deal of attention and application because of their remarkable economic and ecological benefits 9 10 in prbs active materials are added downstream of pollution plume where contaminated groundwater reacts with them to reduce concentrations or transform into less hazardous substances by physical adsorption chemical oxidation and biodegradation 11 13 prbs have sound treatment effects on various target pollutants such as btexs tphs and heavy metals applicable for the phreatic aquifer 14 15 selecting advisable reaction media is the key to prbs technology at present zero valent iron zvi activated carbon and mineral materials are the most commonly used 16 18 however in the long term operation of prbs zvi is easy to passivate and inactivate and it is also accessible to cause prbs blockage due to small particle size carbonaceous and mineral materials will significantly reduce the removal efficiency after adsorption saturation in addition when the media capacity of prbs is limited many materials are demanded to achieve an excellent removal effect for high concentration pollutants which leads to an increase in economical cost and accelerates the consumption rate of media and shortens the longevity of prbs accordingly it is necessary to explore new reaction media or supply media the slow release material is to take specific approaches to slow down the release of specific active substances sass within a certain period of time so that the concentration of sass can remain effective for a long time 19 generally the slow release material consists of inert matrices and sass and no chemical reaction occurs between them when the material contacts with groundwater the sass are gradually released to oxidize organic pollutants in situ the slow release material has a prolonged action time and can continuously provide effective concentration which is expected to promote the long term effectiveness of media in prbs currently a few studies explored the combination of slow release materials and prbs to remove organic pollutants such as tce mtbe and btexs and the sass involved are mainly permanganate and persulfate 20 22 the residue mno2 generated by permanganate may affect mass transfer and cause prbs blockage 23 but persulfate has no such risk and has a higher oxidation reduction potential and can degrade btexs in this study a slow release oxidant was synthesized using persulfate ps and paraffin batch experiments were conducted to assess its release performance and the impact of several physicochemical parameters including solution ph ionic species and addition of sand on persulfate release the surface morphology before and after release was observed by sem to analyze the ps release process furthermore column experiments were directed to simulate the prbs system to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of slow release persulfate for the removal of btexs 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium persulfate na2s2o8 ar 99 paraffin wax and quartz sand were purchased from aladdin chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china benzene toluene ethylbenzene and paraxylene btexs ar 99 5 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china hydrochloric acid hcl ar 37 and sodium hydroxide naoh ar 97 were employed to adjust the solution ph and they were purchased from beijing chemical works beijing china potassium iodide ki ar 99 0 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 ar 99 8 were used for persulfate concentration determination ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o ar 99 0 was used to activate persulfate and they were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo c6h11no 97 was served as a spin trapping reagent and it was purchased from anpu experimental technology co ltd shanghai china all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water from a pure ultrapure water integrated system milli q integral 3 2 2 preparation of slow release persulfate the slow release persulfate was fabricated via a physical approach first an electric skillet with a constant temperature water bath was heated to 70 c subsequently paraffin wax was placed into a 100 ml glass beaker in the tub after the paraffin was melted entirely sodium persulfate was added to the beaker quickly and the two were blended by a glass rod next the mixture in the molten state was poured into spherical molds diameter 1 cm then let them cool for 5 min and removed the prepared products were termed s ps pellets since the mass ratios of ps to paraffin were 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 3 1 3 2 and 4 1 respectively the corresponding products were denoted as p1 p7 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted to assess the release kinetics of ps from s ps pellets briefly each s ps pellet was immersed in a conical flask containing 200 ml milli q water and the flasks were kept at room temperature by a seal a certain amount of solution samples were collected according to a predetermined time interval for ps concentration determination additionally the ps release was evaluated under different conditions including solution ph and ionic species as well as the addition of quartz sand this study used the cumulative persulfate concentration over time to characterize the ps release in s ps pellets based on the volume of the solution and the ps concentration in the solution the cumulative release mass mg average release rate mg d and release efficiency of persulfate for each s ps pellet could be calculated 2 4 column study column experiments were directed to simulate the prbs system on the one hand the release properties of s ps pellets in a homogeneous porous medium system can be explored on the other hand the effectiveness of using these materials on contaminated groundwater would be evaluated the layout of the column experiments is exhibited in fig 1 each column had a length of 150 mm with an inside diameter of 20 mm and an outside diameter of 30 mm it has good sealing and one side connects with a peristaltic pump for delivering solution the whole column is made of glass and all pipes conveying the solution are made of ptfe a single column was used to evaluate the effects of different flow rates 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 ml min on persulfate release three continuous flow columns were used to simulate the remediation of btexs contaminated groundwater by prbs 2 5 analytical methods the ps concentration was determined by the uv spectrophotometer u 3900 at 352 nm 24 the btexs concentrations were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography ultimate 3000 the hplc was equipped with a uv detector and a 150 mm 4 6 mm 3 μm chromatographic column acetonitrile and dipotassium phosphate were employed as the mobile phase the flow rate was 1 ml min and the injection volume was 10 μl the uv wavelength and temperature were 210 nm and 30 c respectively the standard curves are detailed in figs s1 and s2 the s ps pellets surface morphology changes before and after release were observed by field emission scanning electron microscope fei quanta 650 feg operated at voltage 20 kv and beam spot 3 0 free radicals in degradation were identified by electron spinresonance spectroscopy esr emplus 6 i p l the specific parameters were sweep width of 100 g a resonance frequency of 9 057 ghz microwave power of 18 2 mw 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of s ps pellets the prepared s ps pellets were white in appearance and 1 cm in diameter and associated properties are provided in table s1 p1 p2 and p3 pellets have smooth surfaces due to the high content of paraffin in contrast p4 p7 pellets have rough surfaces and a sense of grain when the ps to paraffin mass ration exceeds 4 1 the adhesion between particles is not tight and the product is loose for all s ps pellets the specific gravity is heavier than that of water note ps and paraffin densities are 2 4 and 0 9 g cm3 respectively assuming that ps in each pellet is completely released the porosity of the pellets is 40 06 26 44 20 03 53 69 60 09 48 08 and 64 10 respectively therefore when the ps in a pellet is exhausted the pellet can be seen as a sphere framework composed of paraffin only the density of the pellet becomes lighter than water and will float in the aqueous phase fig s3 this feature will make it convenient to salvage the pellets from underground in actual engineering each s ps pellet was put into ki solution and the color of the solution was observed to turn yellow due to i2 generated eq 1 25 the color presented darker and expanded around over time indicating that ps was released from the pellets and diffused a certain distance according to the color radius and depth the slow release effect of s ps pellets could be qualitatively learned by examining table s2 one can find that the impact of different mass ratios among s ps pellets was possibly different when the proportion of ps was higher the solution showed deeper color and broader diffusion radius which indirectly reflected the faster release rate 1 s 2 o 8 2 2 i 2 so 4 2 i 2 3 2 s ps pellets release characteristics and process since the mass ratio of ps to paraffin plays a critical role in the structural stability and physical properties of the pellets it is necessary to investigate the release characteristics of different pellets fig 2 a shows that the release longevity of s ps pellets was considerably different for p1 p2 and p3 the ps concentrations increased slowly and reached the plateau on the 2 4th day for p4 p7 the ps concentrations rose relatively fast reaching the platform on the 5 7th day the main reason for this phenomenon is that the mass transfer resistances of s ps pellets in the slow release process were disparate hydrophobic paraffin hinder water penetration into the pore space of pellet matrix thus increasing the ps dissolution and release resistance 26 27 the porosity was higher for s ps pellets with more ps content so they suffered lower mass transfer resistance the ps release from s ps pellets conformed to the second order kinetic equation and the fitting curve is shown in fig 2 b the release quantity q and time t fitted to the second order kinetic relationship 2 1 q 1 q 1 1 kt 3 k q 1 t 1 2 q1 is the maximum ps release quantity of unit mass s ps pellets mg g t1 2 is the time to reach half of the maximum ps release quantity d k is the mass transfer coefficient reflecting the resistance in the ps release process mg d g the kinetic equation fitting parameters are shown in table 1 when q1 is larger the ability of s ps pellets to release persulfate is more remarkable when t1 2 is lower the stable release time of s ps pellets is faster when k is higher the mass transfer resistance is minor and ps release is easier from table 1 the q1 value of p7 was the largest up to 742 382 mg g thus its ability to release ps was the strongest among s ps pellets besides the k value of each pellet was ranked as p5 p1 p7 p6 p4 p2 p3 so the mass transfer resistance of p5 was the smallest this rule is consistent with the trend in fig 2 from table s3 the release efficiency of p1 p4 was 70 so they were considered not an ideal pellet in contrast that of p5 p7 was higher than 80 besides p5 showed an appropriate porosity therefore pellets with a mass ratio of 3 1 p5 were selected as the materials for subsequent research to explore the slow release pathway of s ps pellets the surface and profile morphology of the p5 pellets before and after release was analyzed by sem as presented in fig 3 fig 3 a suggests that the surface and profile were relatively smooth with a few cracks before release fig 3 b indicates that a large area of pores and cracks appeared after release which might result from surface sodium persulfate dissolution it is speculated that the release behaviors of s ps pellets in water mainly include the following processes 1 na2s2o8 distributed on the surface of s ps pellets dissolves and causes pore networks after contact with water 2 convection through pores occurs between water and inner na2s2o8 driven by concentration difference and osmotic pressure in other words water flows in and na2s2o8 dissolves out 3 the internal na2s2o8 diffuses to the surface dissolves uniformly in water and releases completely fig 4 shows the slow release process of s ps pellets the whole release process can be summarized as na2s2o8 transported from the initial position of s ps pellets to its outer surface and finally dispersed in the surrounding environment 3 3 effects of factors on s ps pellets release performance parameters such as solution ph ionic species and addition of quartz sand may considerably affect ps release kinetics hence release experiments were also conducted at both acidic and alkaline conditions as well as at 7 ph condition as a control fig 5 a shows that the ps release concentration in different solution ph is 3 01 3 28 g l indicating no noticeable difference table s4 summarizes the ps release kinetics in different conditions from table s4 the ps release efficiency under alkaline conditions 82 7 81 83 and 80 16 was slightly lower than that under neutral 87 36 and acidic conditions 86 04 and 86 51 this may be due to the activation of sodium persulfate by alkali resulting in a small amount of s2o8 2 consumption in general ph had no significant effect on the slow release performance of s ps pellets which was consistent with the previous research results 28 therefore it is considered that s ps pellets are desirable for remediation in various ph ranges there are specific contents of ionic species including mg2 ca2 so4 2 cl no3 and hco3 in natural water 29 thus another factor evaluated in this study is the presence of ionic species in the solution each ionic specie concentration was set at 10 mm for all experiments and no ion was added as a control it can be observed from fig 5 b that the ps concentration in cl solution was the lowest only 2 3 g l indicating that the presence of cl in solution has a negative impact on ps release results for one s ps pellet in cl solution the release efficiency and average release rate were 61 42 and 32 91 mg d respectively markedly lower than those of the control table s4 this observation can be explained by the fact that the redox reaction between cl and s2o8 2 induced a low determination value of persulfate eqs 4 and 5 30 except for cl other ionic species have negligible influence on ps release 4 s 2 o 8 2 cl h 2 o 2 so 4 2 clo 2 h 5 s 2 o 8 2 2 cl 2 so 4 2 cl 2 quartz sand is a hard wear resistant and stable mineral that is commonly used as the raw material to prepare slow release agents another key point discussed in this study was the effect of quartz sand on the release process of s ps pellets s ps pellets were prepared according to the method described in section 2 2 the mass ratio of ps to paraffin was 3 1 and the addition of quartz sand was set at 10 and 20 of the total mass of original pellets coarse sand 0 5 1 0 mm medium sand 0 25 0 5 mm and fine sand 0 125 0 25 mm are used in this experiment fig 5 c illustrates that the ps release concentration can be regulated by doping an appropriate amount of quartz sand into s ps pellets for pellets with sand the initial ps release concentration increased obviously at 0 25d the lowest ps concentration of the pellets doped with quartz sand was 1 78 g l which was significantly higher than that of the control 1 44 g l moreover within the same level of addition as the particle size of quartz sand increases the release efficiency and average release rate also uplift table s4 one reason can contribute to the acceleration of the ps release process the doping of quartz sand changed spatial distribution inside s ps pellets specifically the increment of quartz sand contents makes the pellets have higher porosity and more diffusion channels as a result the mass transfer resistance decreases continuously and more ps diffuses from pellets to the aqueous phase similarly published studies 31 32 have shown that the ps concentration increased with growing sand content in the slow release materials this indicates that when the slow release materials are applied to repair the contaminated site in situ the release rate of sodium persulfate can be controlled by adjusting the dose of quartz sand with different particle sizes 3 4 column study column experiments were performed under different flow rates to study the influence of groundwater velocity on persulfate release the column was filled with 10 g s ps pellets and 70 g quartz sand with grain sizes of 0 5 1 mm and its porosity and pore volume were 35 9 and 16 91 cm3 respectively the flow rates 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 ml min selected satisfies the characteristics of groundwater movement laminar flow and steady flow and the values are on par with the previously reported studies 33 34 the persulfate release results under different flow rates are shown in fig 6 a with the increase in flow rate the ps release concentrations rose slightly at the flow rates of 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 ml min the release efficiency of s ps pellets was 88 54 92 75 and 95 28 respectively table s5 compared with the results in batch experiments the ps concentrations and release efficiency in column experiments are higher about 1 05 1 13 times dynamics can affect the release rate and erosion of slow release drugs 35 persulfate in s ps pellets is diffused and dissolved in water mainly through pores based on concentration differences the column experiments exist fluid movements and the continuous unidirectional impact of water may lead to the native fracture evolving into larger secondary pores so that the ps inside it can be released faster and easier hydraulic conductivity indicates the difficulty of fluid passing through porous media and influences the solute transport in the barrier 36 therefore column experiments were also conducted to study the effect of hydraulic conductivity on persulfate release by changing the sand filled size 0 125 1 mm the hydraulic conductivity was measured by the constant head permeability test the specific values of fine medium and coarse sand were 5 20 and 40 m d respectively which were recorded as k1 k2 and k3 the release results under different k values are shown in fig 6 b in the early release stage the ps concentration under k3 was ahead of k1 and k2 but in the later period the difference was almost reduced to 0 this is because the hydraulic conductivity of k3 is higher than that of k1 and k2 and the solution flows more quickly resulting in earlier contact between s ps pellets and the solution in the later stage the solution in the k1 and k2 columns also fully penetrated into the s ps pellets so the cumulative release concentration under the three conditions was consistent in addition due to the strong solubility of the released ps aquifer blockage and permeability reduction will not occur when the s ps pellets have satisfying release properties they should also maintain the oxidation of sodium persulfate to degrade organic pollutants effectively in this study btexs have been selected as target pollutants because of their extensive distribution and severe environmental hazards in order to ensure the accuracy of s ps pellets for degradation the adsorption experiments for btexs were performed with paraffin pellets before column experiments paraffin pellets were prepared according to the method in 2 2 and the difference was that no sodium persulfate was added degradation results indicate that the adsorption for btexs by paraffin can be neglected fig s4 in the second part of the column study three continuous columns were used to simulate the prbs system to evaluate the effectiveness of slow release persulfate in btexs contaminated groundwater remediation ferrous iron with a concentration of 100 mg l was added in the influent to strengthen the persulfate oxidation fig 7 presents the variation trend of btexs over time in three columns the first column was a homogeneous aquifer crowded with quartz sand simulating the upstream of prb since no oxidant was added the concentration of btexs in first column did not decrease significantly the second column was persulfate release zone in which the btexs concentrations declined significantly from day 1 3 the removal efficiency of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and paraxylene was approximately 64 2 85 1 from day 4 7 the elimination efficiency of btexs decreased to 54 5 76 5 because persulfate was consumed the third column was downstream of the persulfate oxidation zone although no s ps pellets were filled about 38 8 63 4 compounds were still removed this demonstrated that the ps released by s ps pellets could also play a role in the downgradient area in other words the influence radius and reaction time are extended an important function that conventional fillers in prbs do not have this study demonstrated that s ps pellets ps paraffin 3 1 diameter 1 cm could effectively treat btexs c0 50 mg l within 7 days analogously kambhu et al developed a ps slow release candle ps paraffin 2 25 1 diameter 0 71 cm length 2 38 cm for the degradation of btexs c0 7 8 39 78 mg l 37 the results presented that ps candles could effectively decompose btexs within 7 days and the degradation efficiency was approximately 55 90 ma et al synthesized a ps controlled release bead ps paraffin 6 1 diameter 1 cm for the treatment of btexs c0 7 8 mg l the results showed that the removal efficiency within 10 days was 63 69 28 these studies provide a reference for the development and application of slow release ps in degrading organic contaminated groundwater prbs are generally considered green and sustainable remediation technology 38 if slow release ps can be used as the media of prbs the overall reactivity and durability of the prbs should be enhanced however the morphology of slow release ps such as candle pellet droplet and gel may affect its function besides hydrological conditions such as groundwater flow rates hydraulic conductivity and contaminant concentrations may affect oxidation efficiency furthermore it is better to establish mathematical equations to clarify the retardation factors and transport characteristics of pollutants in prbs therefore it is crucial to consider chemical and site factors when designing field applications in the future so that the developed prbs can effectively solve the problem of groundwater pollution 3 5 btexs oxidation mechanism and degradation pathway esr spectroscopy was used to determine free radical species produced in btexs oxidation as shown in fig 8 the characteristic signals of dmpo so4 with peak strength of 1 1 1 1 1 1 and dmpo oh with peak strength of 1 2 2 1 adducts were observed indicating that both so4 and oh were generated during the oxidation process to enhance the removal of btexs due to overlapping peaks signals of dmpo so4 are not obvious the production of so4 and oh in the system could attribute to the reactions eqs 6 and 7 39 40 6 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 s o 4 2 s o 4 7 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 oh the degradation pathway of btexs has been studied in detail in previous research 41 43 when the activated ps reacts with benzene so4 extracts an electron from benzene benzene then turns into a cationic radical quickly converts into phenol and aldehyde and is further oxidized to small molecule compounds the degradation intermediate products of toluene are benzaldehyde benzyl alcohol o cresol and bibenzyl 41 the specific degradation pathways can be inferred as two fig s5 on the one hand so4 extracts hydrogen atoms from toluene on the other hand so4 is directly added to the aromatic ring of toluene the intermediates of the above two pathways are further degraded into small molecules by oxidation reactions and finally mineralized into co2 h2o and inorganic ions the degradation pathways of ethylbenzene and p xylene are similar to those of toluene 4 conclusions in this study the persulfate pellet a novel slow release oxidant was developed and evaluated for its applicability in prb for groundwater remediation firstly the ps release characteristics of s ps pellets were methodically studied via batch experiments when the mass ratio of ps to paraffin was 3 1 the pellets had good formability and ideal release effect and the release process conformed to the second order kinetics additionally persulfate dissolution and diffusion through pores and cracks were crucial processes for the ps release from pellets moreover the impact of solution ph on the ps release kinetics can be ignored the presence of cl in the solution would consume s2o8 2 resulting in a lower determination of ps concentration the other ions in the solution do not affect the release process and results furthermore adding an appropriate amount of quartz sand when synthesizing pellets can change their spatial distribution expand porosity and reduce mass transfer resistance thereby increasing the ps release concentration release efficiency and release rate different flow rate and hydraulic conductivity conditions were established in a single column and the effects of these two factors on ps release were investigated under the influence of hydrodynamic the ps release concentration and release efficiency from s ps pellets were higher than those in batch experiments furthermore btexs removal by released ps was evaluated in three continuous flow columns with ps activated s ps pellets could effectively oxidize high concentration btexs during the 7 days operational period therefore the developed pellets have the potential to become a sustainable and cost effective alternative to remediate groundwater organic pollution credit authorship contribution statement bing wang supervision conceptualization funding acquisition

12544,shale gas fracturing flowback fluid fff is characterized as the hazardous wastewater with high viscosity large displacement and complex components which is difficult to deal with flocculation has been proven to be the most extensively applied treatment process considering its effortless operation low energy consumption and comparatively high efficiency however efficient removal of ultrafine colloidal particles 10 μm from fff still remains a big challenge since their extremely stable properties herein microbubbles mbs were introduced into the flocculation reaction to enhance the flocculation performance when the median particle diameter d50 of mbs reached 0 97 μm which matched the size of selected colloidal particles the turbidity removal rate was as high as 91 93 at 0 70 g l flocculant dosage which was superior to traditional stir flocculation without mbs 66 67 under this condition the mean floc size reached the maximum value of 64 77 μm at 30 s after adding the flocculant meanwhile the floc fractal dimension was significantly improved and the flocs held more resilient which was beneficial for solid liquid separation the mbs worked by the trapping and bridging functions consequently microbubble intensified flocculation provided an advantageous way for the effective removal of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff by controlling the bubble size appropriately graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbubbles flocculation ultrafine colloidal particles microbubble size flocs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction shale gas chiefly containing methane is a clean low carbon and efficient unconventional oil and gas resource 1 however the exploitation of shale gas remains a challenge due to its unreachable and concealed accumulation features 2 more recently the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies 3 provides a favorable condition that makes it possible to intensively extract shale gas in this technology micro proppants such as barite and quartz sand are added to strut the fractures which ensure the stable release of shale gas 4 meanwhile multitudinous additives absorb on the surface of these micro proppants forming stable colloidal particles which force shale gas fracturing flowback fluid to bear the inescapable blame for hard to disposal 5 up to now many techniques have been developed to treat fff 6 mainly including flocculation sedimentation electrochemical chemical oxidation biotreatment and combined treatment methods 7 10 among them flocculation has been generally adopted as a pretreatment tool due to its economic and efficiency 11 12 however it cannot meet the need for the treatment of fff containing ultrafine particles 10 μm 4 13 which are thorny to collect and sediment because of their imperceptible size and immense hydration energy 14 until now a series of technologies have thrived to enhance flocculation performance 15 16 including flocculant modification 17 pre adding ultrasonics 18 and coagulants 19 20 optimizing flocculation reaction equipment to amplify the hydraulic conditions 21 etc gasperi et al 22 manifested that the micro sand could enhance flocculation reaction due to its huge surface area the addition of micro sand promoted the flocs growing compactly and the removal rate of micro pollutants improved from 20 to 50 he et al 23 observed that the coagulant dosage displayed an obvious decrease trend 50 when anionic polymer and fine sand were incorporated into the ballast flocculation compared with the traditional flocculation technique fine sand acted as a ballast agent which affected the development of floc size and characteristics therefore flocculation reaction could be promoted by adding adequate tiny mediums the commonly used mediums include fine sand diatomite etc 20 however the solid mediums inevitably trigger the puzzles of increasing sludge production and the difficulty of water reuse in the following stages fortunately microbubbles gain the upper hand in slower rising speed a longer lifetime in aqueous solutions larger specific surface area and higher interface potential which promote the adhesion of suspended particles 24 liu et al 25 summarized that the mbs produced by the anode were beneficial to the collection of particles and flocs in the process of electrocoagulation and the ratio of surface floaters occupied 70 in sludge recovery li et al 26 supported that micro nanobubbles produced by hydrodynamic cavitation could improve the flotation recovery rate of fine particles from 54 2 to 78 1 moreover bubble size directly affects the collision probability between bubbles and particles 27 the high flotation recovery of ultrafine colloidal particles can be achieved when the microbubble size matches the size of mineral particles because of the enhanced collision and adhesion efficiency 28 a large number of mbs with proper size and uniform distribution increase the contact area between bubbles and flocs which makes them enter the internal voids of flocs more easily and forms ideal aerated flocs these flocs present strong shear resistance enriched bubble wrapping stable floc structure and low water content of scum which are easier to realize solid liquid separation 25 hence mbs serve as approving mediums to assemble the destabilized ultrafine colloidal particles it is expected to intensify the floc strength by controlling the size of mbs and achieve the satisfactory removal of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff consequently the objectives of this paper are to i explore the microbubble intensified flocculation mechanism by evaluating the removal performance of ultrafine colloidal particles from fff ii disclose the effect of microbubble size on flocculation efficiency by in situ characterizing the floc features variations 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the drag reducer polyacrylamide anionic

preparation of simulated fff the preparation procedures of simulated fff were determined based on the raw water quality data provided by sinopec sichuan shale gas exploration and development co ltd sichuan china detailed water quality characteristics of fff were shown in table s1 supplementary information in the first place quantitative salts 811 mg l of mgcl2 6h2o 71 mg l of na2so4 10 755 mg l of nacl 173 mg l of nahco3 and 6156 mg l of cacl2 were injected into deionized water to compose the mineralized water then polyacrylamide was mixed with the mineralized water at a mass ratio of 0 10 subsequently the nh4 2s2o8 was introduced into a container at a mass ratio of 0 05 and 1 0 g l of sio2 was added at the same time finally the mixture was ultrasonically homogenized for 10 min and placed into a water bath at 80 c for 2 h the simulated fff was prepared and consumed immediately 2 3 flocculation test all flocculation processes were carried out on a six part coagulation stirrer zr4 6 this unit was equipped with six individual beakers and stirring paddles the beaker test procedure was shown in fig 1 for the test group with adding of mbs fig 1a the test procedure consisted of four main steps firstly 1 0 l simulated fff was accurately measured in the beaker and stirred rapidly at 200 rpm for 30 s the key step of adding mbs was acted on for 10 min then a determined mass of flocculant pfs was added into the breaker and stirred rapidly at 200 rpm for another 30 s to realize a thorough mixing next the mixture was stirred gently at 50 rpm for 10 min to promote the formation of large flocs finally the flocs were separated from the water after settling for 30 min in the control group without adding mbs as shown in fig 1b the flocculation test was carried out in three steps notably mbs of various sizes were produced by introducing the simulated fff into the bubble generator xzcp k 0 75 xiazhichun environmental protection technology co ltd during this process the sizes of mbs were monitored by the zetasizer nano analyzer zetaplus brookhaven germany and ultra depth 3d microscope keyence company japan the flocculation performance was evaluated in terms of the turbidity removal rate which was measured by the tl2310 bench top turbidimeter hach company usa 2 4 floc growth analysis focused beam reflectance measurement fbrm technology combined with particle video microscope pvm technology were used for online observation of the floc formation process the chord value of particles usually regarded as particle size particle number distribution characteristics and pattern information can be reflected in real time 29 during this process the floc size distribution was divided into five categories including 1 5 μm 5 10 μm 10 50 μm 50 100 μm and 100 1000 μm respectively fractal dimension d f was computed to describe the irregularity and complexity of flocs it should be noted that the denser the floc structure the larger the d f value and vice versa 30 to obtain this data a high speed camera was utilized to characterize the morphological characteristics of flocs during the whole process and imagine pro plus 7 0 ipp was conducted for image processing and calculation 31 first the camera was installed in a suitable position then the parameters were adjusted by setting the frame speed to 500 fps and the shutter speed to 500 μs respectively finally the focal length and aperture were adjusted to make the distinct image of floc particles on the screen flocs fractal dimension d f can be calculated based on eqs 1 and 2 1 a α p d f 2 ln a d f ln p ln α where a represents the orthogonal projection area and p expresses the projection perimeter of floc particles α stands for a proportional constant 32 2 5 rheological test the floc strength holds an indispensable indicator of flocculation performance which directly reflects the ability of flocs to resist mechanical damage 33 anton paar mcr302 rotational rheometer was manipulated to carry out the floc shear resistance test with a tailor made cup and geometry module the shear frequency was set in the range of 0 1 1000 s 1 and the test temperature was continuously kept at 25 0 1 c to obtain the rheological result 0 7 g l dosages of pfs was chosen and proceeded with the jar test mentioned above the flocs were initially separated from the solution after settling then the oscillation measurement frequency scanning mode was adopted to obtain the storage modulus and loss modulus at an angular frequency from 0 1 to 1000 rad s and a constant strain of 0 3 each measurement was repeated three times with a relative standard deviation 0 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbubbles intensified flocculation efficiency evaluation herein a microbubble generator was applied to control the bubble size by adjusting the dissolved air pressure 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 mpa the effect of dissolved air pressure on the bubble size is shown in fig 2 when the pressure increases from 0 2 to 0 5 mpa the d50 of mbs decreases gradually the reason is that the strong flowing fluid turbulent is generated under high dissolved air pressure which can cut bubbles into smaller ones 34 however the d50 increases up to 3 91 μm as the dissolved air pressure continues to increase to 0 6 mpa this might be the fact that when the dissolved air pressure reaches too high the concentration of released mbs exists exceedingly plentiful which provides them an opportunity to collide and merge more vigorously with each other resulting in a sharp increase of d50 at 0 6 mpa 35 meanwhile the micrographs of the mbs produced at different dissolved air pressures are captured by an ultra depth 3d microscope the results are shown in fig s1 a e it is noted that the bubble size is in good accordance with the above results the turbidity removal rates with different mbs sizes are investigated which provide insight into the effect of microbubble size on flocculation performance the turbidity removal rate measurements are carried out at different pfs dosages as presented in fig 3 a in the case of 0 7 g l pfs dosage the turbidity removal rate of the simulated fff achieves up to 91 93 when mbs d50 is 0 97 μm while this value is merely 66 67 when no mbs are added the results indicate that mbs play a role in improving flocculation efficiency to achieve such a high turbidity removal rate 1 0 g l pfs dosage is required in traditional flocculation process this phenomenon can be explained by the zeta potential of the simulated fff at different mbs sizes it is noteworthy that the relevant indicators for the solution are provided in table s2 as displayed in fig 3 b the presence of mbs availably decreases the absolute value of zeta potential of the particles which means that less pfs dosage is needed to neutralize the negative charges to realize the destabilization of ultrafine colloidal particles 36 the absolute value of zeta potential reaches the minimum when d50 is 0 97 μm which means that the least pfs dosage is needed to destabilize the ultrafine colloidal particles by electro neutralization moreover under the condition of the same bubble size too much pfs addition is not conducive to flocculation the reason is that excessive positive charge restabilized the colloidal particles in the solution under the same pfs dosage the microbubble size has a significant impact on the turbidity removal rate of the simulated fff in the case of 0 7 g l pfs dosage the turbidity removal rate increases with an increase in d50 of mbs from 0 57 μm to 0 97 μm as the microbubble size continues to increase the turbidity removal rate decreases slowly the reasons are explained as follows when the d50 of mbs is 0 57 μm some micro flocs still exist in the solution because of the poor buoyancy of mbs which is insufficient to carry the flocs 37 after this the breaking possibility of mbs increases when the d50 increases continuously 38 so the turbulence destroys the flocs already formed resulting in the increase of turbidity at the same time in the case of d50 is 0 97 μm the bubble size matches the selected size of particles and the flocculation efficiency achieves a good effect at this time because of improved collision probability 28 3 2 floc morphology characteristics 3 2 1 fbrm pvm measurement intuitively the influence of microbubble size on flocculation efficiency is primarily reflected by the change in floc size fbrm was applied to in situ monitor the floc sizes change during the flocculation process 29 during this period the agitation rate was fixed at 200 rpm and 0 70 g l pfs was added to the beaker at 100 s throughout the flocculation process colloidal particles adhere and aggregate to form larger flocs which are characterized by an increase in mean floc size up to a maximum afterward the flocs are broken and re arranged under sustained fluid shear and eventually the distribution of flocs gradually reaches dynamic equilibrium 39 the changes of the mean floc size throughout the process are shown in fig 4 in the control group without mbs the average floc size reaches the maximum value of 57 52 μm and it consumes 100 s to form after the addition of the flocculant moreover flocs are disrupted due to their extremely loose structure and the mean floc size eventually decreases to 25 55 μm in comparison flocs growing processes take less time in groups where mbs are involved the addition of mbs increases the number of particles and collision probability in the solution which shortens the reaction time 40 specifically the shortest growth time 30 s and the largest mean floc size 64 77 μm are detected when the d50 of mbs is 0 97 μm afterwards a slight fluctuation is monitored when subjected to fluid shear the mean flocs size under this condition remains about 45 02 μm at the end of the test 580 s which means that the strength of the flocs kept tough when d50 of mbs is 0 57 μm the poor bridging and collision ability make it consume more time to form flocs in particular the mbs dramatically break up in d50 is 3 91 μm which causes a violent disturbance of the suspension and triggers a special agitation 41 these turbulences are detrimental to the stable growth of the flocs which incurs the undulatory tendency of mean floc size in the end to further clarify the reasons for the appealed variation in the mean floc size the details on floc size distribution at 580 s are displayed in fig 5 the floc diameters of the colloidal particles in the densification process are classified into different intervals including small size flocs of 1 10 μm medium size flocs of 10 100 μm as well as large size flocs of 100 1000 μm as displayed in fig 5 for the control group without mbs the percentage of small size flocs remains as high as 66 76 indicating the poor removal rate of ultrafine colloidal particles with the increase of mbs sizes the proportion of small size flocs in each group first decreases and then increases while the proportions of medium size and large size flocs appear the opposite trend the more medium sized and large sized flocs the easier it is to realize solid liquid separation to be specific when d50 of mbs is 0 97 μm the proportion of medium sized flocs and large sized flocs is up to 62 15 in total which is beneficial to solid liquid separation when d50 is below 0 97 μm the chance of collision is poor and few ultrafine particles are captured which results in a low flocculation efficiency conversely when d50 exceeds 3 91 μm the suspension time is transient failing to collect particles or even destroy formed flocs which also causes a setback in flocculation efficiency the proportion of larger size flocs is more negative than that in no microbubble group due to the turbulence therefore appropriate bubble size is required to realize the microbubble enhanced flocculation the representative pictures taken in situ by pvm when mbs d50 was kept at 0 97 μm are shown in fig 6 a d mbs just involved in simulated fff without the addition of flocculant are recorded in fig 6 a the outstanding specific surface area allows mbs to collect some ultrafine colloidal particles suspended in solution and gradually expand their sizes 42 however the ability of mbs alone to get rid of them is limited since these particles are recognized as extremely stable the destabilized particles assemble fleetly when pfs is added and even smartly gain their footholds on the surface of bubbles then mbs are encapsulated within the flocs to reinforce them or adhere around the flocs as a result aerated flocs can be seen in fig 6 b mbs can be wrapped inside flocs in fig 6 c and many particles and flocs attached to the surface of the bubbles can be seen in fig 6 d 3 2 2 floc fractal dimension besides floc size floc shape and filling degree are also indispensable indexes that affect flocculation performance fractal dimension is employed to describe floc fractal structure which quantitatively describes the irregularity and space filling of the particle coalescence in real time generally a large fractal dimension means that the flocs are compact and can be separated from the solution by sedimentation 30 fig 7 depicts the morphological characteristics of flocs under different flocculation conditions which are captured by a high speed camera system the fractal dimension is measured by using the ipp software in the absence of mbs the flocs have a loose and porous irregular shape with a minimum d f of 1 53 the introduction of mbs significantly accelerates the aggregation of flocs as indicated by the larger fractal dimension the fractal dimension of flocs tends to increase first and then decrease as the d50 of mbs increases when the d50 is 0 97 μm the floc fractal dimension reaches a maximum value of 1 89 and flocs are characterized as the most regular perimeter and the best filling degree the smaller mbs had a slight influence on the flocculation process as they are challenging to be caught which is why d f is small and the floc is not well developed in d50 was 0 57 μm in contrast the larger the bubbles the more violently they merge and break up which creates a torrential disturbance in simulated fff therefore the proportion of long chain flocs boosts as the bubble size increases while that in the near sphere state gradually decreases the long chain flocs with a lower d f are easier to be broken 43 3 3 rheological behaviour of floc in the actual fff treatment process the liquid will be further pumped to the settlement system after the flocculation steps completed which requires these flocs possessed excellent shear resistance the rheological properties of flocs provide an intuitive indication of particle particle interaction and aggregation degree in the flocs 44 in traditional flocculation the forces inside flocs mainly include the forces between floc particles and the forces between colloidal particles and flocculants such as van der waals force electrostatic attraction etc besides this the forces inside the aerated flocs also include the interaction between bubbles and particles flocs flocculants such as hydrophobic gravity bridging capillary force and separation pressure 45 figs 8 and 9 summarize the non newtonian fluid behaviour of the flocs the dense phase was pre sheared at 10 s 1 for 5 min before the steady state test to minimize the effect of prolonged suspension retention on the rheological behaviour the steady state test was carried out after standing for 1 0 min also dense phases in all groups were obtained at 0 70 g l pfs dosage the viscosity of flocs treated with conventional flocculation no mbs and microbubble intensified flocculation with various microbubble sizes as a function of shear rate is depicted in fig 8 a the viscosity of the flocs decreases with increasing shear rate so the flocs showcase the shear thinning behaviour and increased flow property they signify the plastic fluid properties of flocs plastic fluid embodies the solid like properties at low shear rates which mainly act as an elastic force and the liquid like properties at high shear rates which mainly act as a viscous force the reduction of viscosity represents an impaired intensity of the flocs 46 the low initial viscosity of 3 55 pa s is detected for the flocs at the lowest shear rate applied in the group of no mbs however the initial viscosity of the flocs increases as a whole with the participation of mbs and reaches a maximum 73 25 pa s at mbs d50 was 0 97 μm the low initial viscosity of the flocs produced during conventional flocculation indicates that these flocs have a loose structure and exhibit a predominance of liquid like behaviour at the same time the initial viscosities of the flocs tend to increase and then decrease with the increase of mbs d50 it appears the greatest value at 0 97 μm which engenders the densest and strongest flocs when d50 is 0 57 μm these mbs fail to fill the cavities of the flocs resulting in the weakened forces however when the mbs d50 increase further the merging and breaking up of the probability of larger bubbles in suspension severely increases a micro disturbance flow is ubiquitous that attacks the already formed flocs to fragments the disappearance of bubbles reduces the forces inside the flocs although the flocs reorganize after breaking beyond a certain point the floc debris would be irretrievable in addition the increased shear rate is destructive to the flocs the viscosity of the flocs decreases linearly as the shear rate increases probably due to the disruption of the interaction forces within the flocs 47 the variation of the flocs viscosity in fig 8 is in accordance with the bingham plastic model eq 3 3 τ τ 0 kγ where τ0 and k represent the bingham yield stress pa and bingham plastic viscosity pa s respectively some of the bingham parameters are shown in fig 8 b there is a significant difference in the shear stress of the floc at different d50 of mbs 46 the results indicate that the density of the floc increase with the involvement of mbs promoting the formation of the densest flocs at d50 is 0 97 μm to evaluate the floc strength the elastic properties including the energy storage modulus g the elastic modulus and the loss modulus g the viscous modulus were measured by oscillation frequency sweep experiments g and g correspond to the storage and dissipation of energy during the deformation process of flocs respectively 48 as shown in fig 9 the tendencies of storage modulus and loss modulus are consistent across all conditions which suggests that flocs behaved in similar viscoelastic behaviour they are both higher in the group with mbs than in the group without mbs which reflects the higher strength of the flocs produced by microbubble intensified flocculation at low angular frequencies the elastic modulus g of the flocs all exceed the viscous modulus g and remain constant in the earlier stage of fig 9 at the critical angular frequency ωc the storage modulus slips down a precipice after which the loss modulus begins to climb this is because flocs exhibit a solid like behaviour dominated by elastic forces at low frequencies on the contrary they represent a liquid like behaviour dominated by viscous forces at high frequencies furthermore the sharp drop of g at angular frequencies above ωc implies that the floc structure has been damaged the subsequent further increase at higher frequencies might be ascribed to structural reorganization 48 49 without the mbs the ωc is as small as 39 80 rad s indicating that the flocs are extremely loose at the same time the ωc tends to increase and then decrease as the d50 of mbs increases the ωc reaches the peak at d50 is 0 97 μm 100 rad s disclosing that the floc strength and shear resistance are superior to that in other groups moreover the higher ωc proves that the generated flocs had a desirable gel like structural strength 49 the mbs promote to form a denser floc during the treatment process they take the place of water and are tightly encapsulated within the flocs which led to less water content and perform an extraordinarily recalcitrant resistance to disruption of its structure the high g value represents the most amount of mechanical energy stored in the flocs which also reflects the stronger particle particle flocculant particle and particle bubble flocculant floc interactions under these conditions this is also in agreement with the results mentioned earlier furthermore fig 9b shows that the liquid like behaviour is the same for all systems at high angular frequencies which means that the energy needed to be expended to destroy the microbubbles loaded flocs especially at d50 is 0 97 μm 50 4 discussion the above studies demonstrated that the mbs significantly enhanced the flocculation efficiency of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff and the appropriate microbubble size was required in a conventional flocculation process pfs destabilized the negatively charged colloidal particles and these particles aggregated into flocs in most cases the floc structure was irregular and amorphous moreover these flocs were loose and porous with a high internal water content which was fragile and difficult to reconstitute to improve the flocs strength mbs were introduced to intensify the flocculation performance of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff first and foremost mbs be nucleated on the surface of the particles primarily increasing the apparent sizes of colloid particles at the same time these mbs occupied certain sites on the particle surface which result in a decrease in zeta potential these two aspects made it possible to collect colloid particles quickly with a relatively small amount of flocculant and achieve an excellent flocculation effect 42 51 in addition the mbs continuously collided and adhered to the surface of particles and even tightly wrapped inside the aggregates which assembled flocs with low water content and exceptional viscoelasticity in the end the aerated flocs had a high compactness and showed outstanding shear resistance which was attributed to the collection and bridging functions of mbs however it was noteworthy that the appropriate size of mbs would produce the most encouraging flocculation effect when the d50 of mbs matched with the selected particles the flocculation effect and floc properties were optimized accompanied by minimal pfs dosage and reaction time because of the improved collision probability 28 when the d50 of mbs was 0 97 μm relatively large amounts of flocculants were still required the flocs grew slower and the buoyancy of floc was weak in the flocculation process 37 in addition when the d50 of mbs was 0 97 μm the probability of collision between bubbles and particles was reduced meanwhile the probability of bubbles merging and breaking dramatically increased resulting in their disappearance in a twinkling so the presence of micro disturbances caused damage to the formed flocs 38 41 this phenomenon was testified by the fact that the mean floc size fluctuated considerably in the later stages of flocculation in this case flocs are exposed to a fragile long chain structure and decreased strength therefore the size control of mbs played an indispensable role in the process of microbubble intensified flocculation 5 conclusions in this work the microbubble intensified flocculation mechanism of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff was elucidated from the perspective of microbubble size adaptation when the d50 of mbs reached 0 97 μm matching the size of the selected colloidal particle the flocculation efficiency was outstanding the reduction of zeta potential indicated that the addition of mbs availably cut down the 30 dosage of pfs by monitoring the mean floc size in the flocculation process it was pointed out that the flocculation reaction time was greatly reduced from 100 s to 30 s under this condition the mean floc size reached 64 77 μm at the maximum and remained at about 45 02 μm after sustained shearing combined with the pvm photos it can be seen that the mbs collected ultrafine particles and flocs on the surface and then encapsulated them inside the flocs through collision and adhesion effect the fractal dimension and rheological properties demonstrated that the microbubbles loaded flocs were denser and more resistant to shear therefore the right size of mbs will make the floc denser and stronger by trapping and bridging to achieve the purpose of enhanced flocculation to sum up microbubble intensified flocculation acts as a considerable way to treat ultrafine colloidal particles in shale gas fff under the premise of reasonable size control

12544,shale gas fracturing flowback fluid fff is characterized as the hazardous wastewater with high viscosity large displacement and complex components which is difficult to deal with flocculation has been proven to be the most extensively applied treatment process considering its effortless operation low energy consumption and comparatively high efficiency however efficient removal of ultrafine colloidal particles 10 μm from fff still remains a big challenge since their extremely stable properties herein microbubbles mbs were introduced into the flocculation reaction to enhance the flocculation performance when the median particle diameter d50 of mbs reached 0 97 μm which matched the size of selected colloidal particles the turbidity removal rate was as high as 91 93 at 0 70 g l flocculant dosage which was superior to traditional stir flocculation without mbs 66 67 under this condition the mean floc size reached the maximum value of 64 77 μm at 30 s after adding the flocculant meanwhile the floc fractal dimension was significantly improved and the flocs held more resilient which was beneficial for solid liquid separation the mbs worked by the trapping and bridging functions consequently microbubble intensified flocculation provided an advantageous way for the effective removal of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff by controlling the bubble size appropriately graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbubbles flocculation ultrafine colloidal particles microbubble size flocs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction shale gas chiefly containing methane is a clean low carbon and efficient unconventional oil and gas resource 1 however the exploitation of shale gas remains a challenge due to its unreachable and concealed accumulation features 2 more recently the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies 3 provides a favorable condition that makes it possible to intensively extract shale gas in this technology micro proppants such as barite and quartz sand are added to strut the fractures which ensure the stable release of shale gas 4 meanwhile multitudinous additives absorb on the surface of these micro proppants forming stable colloidal particles which force shale gas fracturing flowback fluid to bear the inescapable blame for hard to disposal 5 up to now many techniques have been developed to treat fff 6 mainly including flocculation sedimentation electrochemical chemical oxidation biotreatment and combined treatment methods 7 10 among them flocculation has been generally adopted as a pretreatment tool due to its economic and efficiency 11 12 however it cannot meet the need for the treatment of fff containing ultrafine particles 10 μm 4 13 which are thorny to collect and sediment because of their imperceptible size and immense hydration energy 14 until now a series of technologies have thrived to enhance flocculation performance 15 16 including flocculant modification 17 pre adding ultrasonics 18 and coagulants 19 20 optimizing flocculation reaction equipment to amplify the hydraulic conditions 21 etc gasperi et al 22 manifested that the micro sand could enhance flocculation reaction due to its huge surface area the addition of micro sand promoted the flocs growing compactly and the removal rate of micro pollutants improved from 20 to 50 he et al 23 observed that the coagulant dosage displayed an obvious decrease trend 50 when anionic polymer and fine sand were incorporated into the ballast flocculation compared with the traditional flocculation technique fine sand acted as a ballast agent which affected the development of floc size and characteristics therefore flocculation reaction could be promoted by adding adequate tiny mediums the commonly used mediums include fine sand diatomite etc 20 however the solid mediums inevitably trigger the puzzles of increasing sludge production and the difficulty of water reuse in the following stages fortunately microbubbles gain the upper hand in slower rising speed a longer lifetime in aqueous solutions larger specific surface area and higher interface potential which promote the adhesion of suspended particles 24 liu et al 25 summarized that the mbs produced by the anode were beneficial to the collection of particles and flocs in the process of electrocoagulation and the ratio of surface floaters occupied 70 in sludge recovery li et al 26 supported that micro nanobubbles produced by hydrodynamic cavitation could improve the flotation recovery rate of fine particles from 54 2 to 78 1 moreover bubble size directly affects the collision probability between bubbles and particles 27 the high flotation recovery of ultrafine colloidal particles can be achieved when the microbubble size matches the size of mineral particles because of the enhanced collision and adhesion efficiency 28 a large number of mbs with proper size and uniform distribution increase the contact area between bubbles and flocs which makes them enter the internal voids of flocs more easily and forms ideal aerated flocs these flocs present strong shear resistance enriched bubble wrapping stable floc structure and low water content of scum which are easier to realize solid liquid separation 25 hence mbs serve as approving mediums to assemble the destabilized ultrafine colloidal particles it is expected to intensify the floc strength by controlling the size of mbs and achieve the satisfactory removal of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff consequently the objectives of this paper are to i explore the microbubble intensified flocculation mechanism by evaluating the removal performance of ultrafine colloidal particles from fff ii disclose the effect of microbubble size on flocculation efficiency by in situ characterizing the floc features variations 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the drag reducer polyacrylamide anionic

subsequently the nh4 2s2o8 was introduced into a container at a mass ratio of 0 05 and 1 0 g l of sio2 was added at the same time finally the mixture was ultrasonically homogenized for 10 min and placed into a water bath at 80 c for 2 h the simulated fff was prepared and consumed immediately 2 3 flocculation test all flocculation processes were carried out on a six part coagulation stirrer zr4 6 this unit was equipped with six individual beakers and stirring paddles the beaker test procedure was shown in fig 1 for the test group with adding of mbs fig 1a the test procedure consisted of four main steps firstly 1 0 l simulated fff was accurately measured in the beaker and stirred rapidly at 200 rpm for 30 s the key step of adding mbs was acted on for 10 min then a determined mass of flocculant pfs was added into the breaker and stirred rapidly at 200 rpm for another 30 s to realize a thorough mixing next the mixture was stirred gently at 50 rpm for 10 min to promote the formation of large flocs finally the flocs were separated from the water after settling for 30 min in the control group without adding mbs as shown in fig 1b the flocculation test was carried out in three steps notably mbs of various sizes were produced by introducing the simulated fff into the bubble generator xzcp k 0 75 xiazhichun environmental protection technology co ltd during this process the sizes of mbs were monitored by the zetasizer nano analyzer zetaplus brookhaven germany and ultra depth 3d microscope keyence company japan the flocculation performance was evaluated in terms of the turbidity removal rate which was measured by the tl2310 bench top turbidimeter hach company usa 2 4 floc growth analysis focused beam reflectance measurement fbrm technology combined with particle video microscope pvm technology were used for online observation of the floc formation process the chord value of particles usually regarded as particle size particle number distribution characteristics and pattern information can be reflected in real time 29 during this process the floc size distribution was divided into five categories including 1 5 μm 5 10 μm 10 50 μm 50 100 μm and 100 1000 μm respectively fractal dimension d f was computed to describe the irregularity and complexity of flocs it should be noted that the denser the floc structure the larger the d f value and vice versa 30 to obtain this data a high speed camera was utilized to characterize the morphological characteristics of flocs during the whole process and imagine pro plus 7 0 ipp was conducted for image processing and calculation 31 first the camera was installed in a suitable position then the parameters were adjusted by setting the frame speed to 500 fps and the shutter speed to 500 μs respectively finally the focal length and aperture were adjusted to make the distinct image of floc particles on the screen flocs fractal dimension d f can be calculated based on eqs 1 and 2 1 a α p d f 2 ln a d f ln p ln α where a represents the orthogonal projection area and p expresses the projection perimeter of floc particles α stands for a proportional constant 32 2 5 rheological test the floc strength holds an indispensable indicator of flocculation performance which directly reflects the ability of flocs to resist mechanical damage 33 anton paar mcr302 rotational rheometer was manipulated to carry out the

rheological result 0 7 g l dosages of pfs was chosen and proceeded with the jar test mentioned above the flocs were initially separated from the solution after settling then the oscillation measurement frequency scanning mode was adopted to obtain the storage modulus and loss modulus at an angular frequency from 0 1 to 1000 rad s and a constant strain of 0 3 each measurement was repeated three times with a relative standard deviation 0 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbubbles intensified flocculation efficiency evaluation herein a microbubble generator was applied to control the bubble size by adjusting the dissolved air pressure 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 mpa the effect of dissolved air pressure on the bubble size is shown in fig 2 when the pressure increases from 0 2 to 0 5 mpa the d50 of mbs decreases gradually the reason is that the strong flowing fluid turbulent is generated under high dissolved air pressure which can cut bubbles into smaller ones 34 however the d50 increases up to 3 91 μm as the dissolved air pressure continues to increase to 0 6 mpa this might be the fact that when the dissolved air pressure reaches too high the concentration of released mbs exists exceedingly plentiful which provides them an opportunity to collide and merge more vigorously with each other resulting in a sharp increase of d50 at 0 6 mpa 35 meanwhile the micrographs of the mbs produced at different dissolved air pressures are captured by an ultra depth 3d microscope the results are shown in fig s1 a e it is noted that the bubble size is in good accordance with the above results the turbidity removal rates with different mbs sizes are investigated which provide insight into the effect of microbubble size on flocculation performance the turbidity removal rate measurements are carried out at different pfs dosages as presented in fig 3 a in the case of 0 7 g l pfs dosage the turbidity removal rate of the simulated fff achieves up to 91 93 when mbs d50 is 0 97 μm while this value is merely 66 67 when no mbs are added the results indicate that mbs play a role in improving flocculation efficiency to achieve such a high turbidity removal rate 1 0 g l pfs dosage is required in traditional flocculation process this phenomenon can be explained by the zeta potential of the simulated fff at different mbs sizes it is noteworthy that the relevant indicators for the solution are provided in table s2 as displayed in fig 3 b the presence of mbs availably decreases the absolute value of zeta potential of the particles which means that less pfs dosage is needed to neutralize the negative charges to realize the destabilization of ultrafine colloidal particles 36 the absolute value of zeta potential reaches the minimum when d50 is 0 97 μm which means that the least pfs dosage is needed to destabilize the ultrafine colloidal particles by electro neutralization moreover under the condition of the same bubble size too much pfs addition is not conducive to flocculation the reason is that excessive positive charge restabilized the colloidal particles in the solution under the same pfs dosage the microbubble size has a significant impact on the turbidity removal rate of the simulated fff in the case of 0 7 g l pfs dosage the turbidity removal rate increases with an increase in d50 of mbs from 0 57 μm to 0 97 μm as the microbubble size continues to increase the turbidity removal rate decreases slowly the reasons are explained as follows when the d50 of mbs is 0 57 μm some micro flocs still exist in the solution because of the poor buoyancy of mbs which is insufficient to carry the flocs 37 after this the breaking possibility of mbs increases when the d50 increases continuously 38 so the turbulence destroys the flocs already formed resulting in the increase of turbidity at the same time in the case of d50 is 0 97 μm the bubble size matches the selected size of particles and the flocculation efficiency achieves a good effect at this time because of improved collision probability 28 3 2 floc morphology characteristics 3 2 1 fbrm pvm measurement intuitively the influence of microbubble size on flocculation efficiency is primarily reflected by the change in floc size fbrm was applied to in situ monitor the floc sizes change during the flocculation process 29 during this period the agitation rate was fixed at 200 rpm and 0 70 g l pfs was added to the beaker at 100 s throughout the flocculation process colloidal particles adhere and aggregate to form larger flocs which are characterized by an increase in mean floc size up to a maximum afterward the flocs are broken and re arranged under sustained fluid shear and eventually the distribution of flocs gradually reaches dynamic equilibrium 39 the changes of the mean floc size throughout the process are shown in fig 4 in the control group without mbs the average floc size reaches the maximum value of 57 52 μm and it consumes 100 s to form after the addition of the flocculant moreover flocs are disrupted due to their extremely loose structure and the mean floc size eventually decreases to 25 55 μm in comparison flocs growing processes take less time in groups where mbs are involved the addition of mbs increases the number of particles and collision probability in the solution which shortens the reaction time 40 specifically the shortest growth time 30 s and the largest mean floc size 64 77 μm are detected when the d50 of mbs is 0 97 μm afterwards a slight fluctuation is monitored when subjected to fluid shear the mean flocs size under this condition remains about 45 02 μm at the end of the test 580 s which means that the strength of the flocs kept tough when d50 of mbs is 0 57 μm the poor bridging and collision ability make it consume more time to form flocs in particular the mbs dramatically break up in d50 is 3 91 μm which causes a violent disturbance of the suspension and triggers a special agitation 41 these turbulences are detrimental to the stable growth of the flocs which incurs the undulatory tendency of mean floc size in the end to further clarify the reasons for the appealed variation in the mean floc size the details on floc size distribution at 580 s are displayed in fig 5 the floc diameters of the colloidal particles in the densification process are classified into different intervals including small size flocs of 1 10 μm medium size flocs of 10 100 μm as well as large size flocs of 100 1000 μm as displayed in fig 5 for the control group without mbs the percentage of small size flocs remains as high as 66 76 indicating the poor removal rate of ultrafine colloidal particles with the increase of mbs sizes the proportion of small size flocs in each group first decreases and then increases while the proportions of medium size and large size flocs appear the opposite trend the more medium sized and large sized flocs the easier it is to realize solid liquid separation to be specific when d50 of mbs is 0 97 μm the proportion of medium sized flocs and large sized flocs is up to 62 15 in total which is beneficial to solid liquid separation when d50 is below 0 97 μm the chance of collision is poor and few ultrafine particles are captured which results in a low flocculation efficiency conversely when d50 exceeds 3 91 μm the suspension time is transient failing to collect particles or even destroy formed flocs which also causes a setback in flocculation efficiency the proportion of larger size flocs is more negative than that in no microbubble group due to the turbulence therefore appropriate bubble size is required to realize the microbubble enhanced flocculation the representative pictures taken in situ by pvm when mbs d50 was kept at 0 97 μm are shown in fig 6 a d mbs just involved in simulated fff without the addition of flocculant are recorded in fig 6 a the outstanding specific surface area allows mbs to collect some ultrafine colloidal particles suspended in solution and gradually expand their sizes 42 however the ability of mbs alone to get rid of them is limited since these particles are recognized as extremely stable the destabilized particles assemble fleetly when pfs is added and even smartly gain their footholds on the surface of bubbles then mbs are encapsulated within the flocs to reinforce them or adhere around the flocs as a result aerated flocs can be seen in fig 6 b mbs can be wrapped inside flocs in fig 6 c and many particles and flocs attached to the surface of the bubbles can be seen in fig 6 d 3 2 2 floc fractal dimension besides floc size floc shape and filling degree are also indispensable indexes that affect flocculation performance fractal dimension is employed to describe floc fractal structure which quantitatively describes the irregularity and space filling of the particle coalescence in real time generally a large fractal dimension means that the flocs are compact and can be separated from the solution by sedimentation 30 fig 7 depicts the morphological characteristics of flocs under different flocculation conditions which are captured by a high speed camera system the fractal dimension is measured by using the ipp software in the absence of mbs the flocs have a loose and porous irregular shape with a minimum d f of 1 53 the introduction of mbs significantly accelerates the aggregation of flocs as indicated by the larger fractal dimension the fractal dimension of flocs tends to increase first and then decrease as the d50 of mbs increases when the d50 is 0 97 μm the floc fractal dimension reaches a maximum value of 1 89 and flocs are characterized as the most regular perimeter and the best filling degree the smaller mbs had a slight influence on the flocculation process as they are challenging to be caught which is why d f is small and the floc is not well developed in d50 was 0 57 μm in contrast the larger the bubbles the more violently they merge and break up which creates a torrential disturbance in simulated fff therefore the proportion of long chain flocs boosts as the bubble size increases while that in the near sphere state gradually decreases the long chain flocs with a lower d f are easier to be broken 43 3 3 rheological behaviour of floc in the actual fff treatment process the liquid will be further pumped to the settlement system after the flocculation steps completed which requires these flocs possessed excellent shear resistance the rheological properties of flocs provide an intuitive indication of particle particle interaction and aggregation degree in the flocs 44 in traditional flocculation the forces inside flocs mainly include the forces between floc particles and the forces between colloidal particles and flocculants such as van der waals force electrostatic attraction etc besides this the forces inside the aerated flocs also include the interaction between bubbles and particles flocs flocculants such as hydrophobic gravity bridging capillary force and separation pressure 45 figs 8 and 9 summarize the non newtonian fluid behaviour of the flocs the dense phase was pre sheared at 10 s 1 for 5 min before the steady state test to minimize the effect of prolonged suspension retention on the rheological behaviour the steady state test was carried out after standing for 1 0 min also dense phases in all groups were obtained at 0 70 g l pfs dosage the viscosity of flocs treated with conventional flocculation no mbs and microbubble intensified flocculation with various microbubble sizes as a function of shear rate is depicted in fig 8 a the viscosity of the flocs decreases with increasing shear rate so the flocs showcase the shear thinning behaviour and increased flow property they signify the plastic fluid properties of flocs plastic fluid embodies the solid like properties at low shear rates which mainly act as an elastic force and the liquid like properties at high shear rates which mainly act as a viscous force the reduction of viscosity represents an impaired intensity of the flocs 46 the low initial viscosity of 3 55 pa s is detected for the flocs at the lowest shear rate applied in the group of no mbs however the initial viscosity of the flocs increases as a whole with the participation of mbs and reaches a maximum 73 25 pa s at mbs d50 was 0 97 μm the low initial viscosity of the flocs produced during conventional flocculation indicates that these flocs have a loose structure and exhibit a predominance of liquid like behaviour at the same time the initial viscosities of the flocs tend to increase and then decrease with the increase of mbs d50 it appears the greatest value at 0 97 μm which engenders the densest and strongest flocs when d50 is 0 57 μm these mbs fail to fill the cavities of the flocs resulting in the weakened forces however when the mbs d50 increase further the merging and breaking up of the probability of larger bubbles in suspension severely increases a micro disturbance flow is ubiquitous that attacks the already formed flocs to fragments the disappearance of bubbles reduces the forces inside the flocs although the flocs reorganize after breaking beyond a certain point the floc debris would be irretrievable in addition the increased shear rate is destructive to the flocs the viscosity of the flocs decreases linearly as the shear rate increases probably due to the disruption of the interaction forces within the flocs 47 the variation of the flocs viscosity in fig 8 is in accordance with the bingham plastic model eq 3 3 τ τ 0 kγ where τ0 and k represent the bingham yield stress pa and bingham plastic viscosity pa s respectively some of the bingham parameters are shown in fig 8 b there is a significant difference in the shear stress of the floc at different d50 of mbs 46 the results indicate that the density of the floc increase with the involvement of mbs promoting the formation of the densest flocs at d50 is 0 97 μm to evaluate the floc strength the elastic properties including the energy storage modulus g the elastic modulus and the loss modulus g the viscous modulus were measured by oscillation frequency sweep experiments g and g correspond to the storage and dissipation of energy during the deformation process of flocs respectively 48 as shown in fig 9 the tendencies of storage modulus and loss modulus are consistent across all conditions which suggests that flocs behaved in similar viscoelastic behaviour they are both higher in the group with mbs than in the group without mbs which reflects the higher strength of the flocs produced by microbubble intensified flocculation at low angular frequencies the elastic modulus g of the flocs all exceed the viscous modulus g and remain constant in the earlier stage of fig 9 at the critical angular frequency ωc the storage modulus slips down a precipice after which the loss modulus begins to climb this is because flocs exhibit a solid like behaviour dominated by elastic forces at low frequencies on the contrary they represent a liquid like behaviour dominated by viscous forces at high frequencies furthermore the sharp drop of g at angular frequencies above ωc implies that the floc structure has been damaged the subsequent further increase at higher frequencies might be ascribed to structural reorganization 48 49 without the mbs the ωc is as small as 39 80 rad s indicating that the flocs are extremely loose at the same time the ωc tends to increase and then decrease as the d50 of mbs increases the ωc reaches the peak at d50 is 0 97 μm 100 rad s disclosing that the floc strength and shear resistance are superior to that in other groups moreover the higher ωc proves that the generated flocs had a desirable gel like structural strength 49 the mbs promote to form a denser floc during the treatment process they take the place of water and are tightly encapsulated within the flocs which led to less water content and perform an extraordinarily recalcitrant resistance to disruption of its structure the high g value represents the most amount of mechanical energy stored in the flocs which also reflects the stronger particle particle flocculant particle and particle bubble flocculant floc interactions under these conditions this is also in agreement with the results mentioned earlier furthermore fig 9b shows that the liquid like behaviour is the same for all systems at high angular frequencies which means that the energy needed to be expended to destroy the microbubbles loaded flocs especially at d50 is 0 97 μm 50 4 discussion the above studies demonstrated that the mbs significantly enhanced the flocculation efficiency of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff and the appropriate microbubble size was required in a conventional flocculation process pfs destabilized the negatively charged colloidal particles and these particles aggregated into flocs in most cases the floc structure was irregular and amorphous moreover these flocs were loose and porous with a high internal water content which was fragile and difficult to reconstitute to improve the flocs strength mbs were introduced to intensify the flocculation performance of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff first and foremost mbs be nucleated on the surface of the particles primarily increasing the apparent sizes of colloid particles at the same time these mbs occupied certain sites on the particle surface which result in a decrease in zeta potential these two aspects made it possible to collect colloid particles quickly with a relatively small amount of flocculant and achieve an excellent flocculation effect 42 51 in addition the mbs continuously collided and adhered to the surface of particles and even tightly wrapped inside the aggregates which assembled flocs with low water content and exceptional viscoelasticity in the end the aerated flocs had a high compactness and showed outstanding shear resistance which was attributed to the collection and bridging functions of mbs however it was noteworthy that the appropriate size of mbs would produce the most encouraging flocculation effect when the d50 of mbs matched with the selected particles the flocculation effect and floc properties were optimized accompanied by minimal pfs dosage and reaction time because of the improved collision probability 28 when the d50 of mbs was 0 97 μm relatively large amounts of flocculants were still required the flocs grew slower and the buoyancy of floc was weak in the flocculation process 37 in addition when the d50 of mbs was 0 97 μm the probability of collision between bubbles and particles was reduced meanwhile the probability of bubbles merging and breaking dramatically increased resulting in their disappearance in a twinkling so the presence of micro disturbances caused damage to the formed flocs 38 41 this phenomenon was testified by the fact that the mean floc size fluctuated considerably in the later stages of flocculation in this case flocs are exposed to a fragile long chain structure and decreased strength therefore the size control of mbs played an indispensable role in the process of microbubble intensified flocculation 5 conclusions in this work the microbubble intensified flocculation mechanism of ultrafine colloidal particles in fff was elucidated from the perspective of microbubble size adaptation when the d50 of mbs reached 0 97 μm matching the size of the selected colloidal particle the flocculation efficiency was outstanding the reduction of zeta potential indicated that the addition of mbs availably cut down the 30 dosage of pfs by monitoring the mean floc size in the flocculation process it was pointed out that the flocculation reaction time was greatly reduced from 100 s to 30 s under this condition the mean floc size reached 64 77 μm at the maximum and remained at about 45 02 μm after sustained shearing combined with the pvm photos it can be seen that the mbs collected ultrafine particles and flocs on the surface and then encapsulated them inside the flocs through collision and adhesion effect the fractal dimension and rheological properties demonstrated that the microbubbles loaded flocs were denser and more resistant to shear therefore the right size of mbs will make the floc denser and stronger by trapping and bridging to achieve the purpose of enhanced flocculation to sum up microbubble intensified flocculation acts as a considerable way to treat ultrafine colloidal particles in shale gas fff under the premise of reasonable size control
