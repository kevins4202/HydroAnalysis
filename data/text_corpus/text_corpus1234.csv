6170,with climate change and the intensification of human activities landscape patterns have undergone important changes these changes can have multiple impact on hydrology nutrient transport between soil and vegetation and ecological function and health in vegetative ecosystems dynamic changes in landscape patterns may affect the ecological water requirements ewrs of vegetation based on meteorological data soil data and 6 years of land use data from 1990 to 2015 the ewrs were obtained through the penman monteith formula eight suitable landscape indices patch density pd connectivity index cohesion largest patch index lpi aggregation index ai shannon diversity index shdi contagion index contag separation index split and landscape shape index lsi were used to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of landscape patterns furthermore the influences of landscape pattern changes on the ewrs of the middle main reaches of the yellow river china were investigated from 1990 to 2015 the total number of patches in the landscape pattern of the watershed increased and the patch shape became more complex the ewrs decreased from 392 7 mm to 276 5 mm and the annual volume of the ewrs in the study area decreased from 124 8 108 m3 to 89 6 108 m3 the ewrs had a positive correlation with the lpi indicating that the changes in the largest patch had a great impact on the ewrs the ewrs also had a negative correlation with the split showing that the more fragmented the landscape patches the smaller the ewrs with an increase in shdi the ewrs showed a downward trend furthermore the ewrs showed a downward trend with decreasing contag and cohesion these results provide useful information for ecological restoration and provide an important reference for ecological environmental protection and the optimal allocation of water resources in arid semiarid regions around the world in the future the ewrs can be regulated and the utilization rate of water resources can be improved by combining the current ecological environmental protection policies of the yellow river basin and managing future trends in landscape patterns keywords land use cover the middle main reaches of the yellow river landscape pattern landscape indices ecological water requirements ewrs 1 introduction with the rapid development of water resources and the intensification of activities centered on human demands aquatic ecosystems have been changed to different degrees cui et al 2009 fang et al 2018 this has resulted in damage to the ecological environment and has created a series of environmental problems such as ecological degradation these problems will eventually endanger the safety and sustainable development of human society liu and xia 2004 li et al 2015 liu and cui 2011 wu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 at the same time vegetative ecosystems play an important role in maintaining regional ecosystem stability and ecological protections especially in vulnerable ecological regions amici et al 2015 li et al 2016 looking at the concept of ecological water requirements ewrs the ewrs of the vegetative ecosystems aim to maintain ecosystem function and health in the ecological water cycle deb et al 2019a 2019b as they play an important role in maintaining ecosystem function ewrs have gradually attracted attention in hydrological research song et al 2007 sun et al 2007 cui et al 2009 yang et al 2009 feng et al 2012 kendy et al 2017 pitt and kendy 2017 ramírez hernández et al 2017 wurbs and hoffpauir 2017 in recent years many methods for calculating ewrs have been proposed such as area method the phreatic evaporation method the vegetation evapotranspiration method the water balance method and the vegetation biomass method aa et al 2019 chen et al 2010 deng et al 2015 yu et al 2015 the calculation of ewrs allows not only the quantification of the demand for water resources in regional ecosystems but also analysis of the degree to which human activities use up ewrs the determination of regional ewrs is conducive to the rational development and utilization of water and soil resources under the premise of protecting the environment in order to realize the simultaneous development of economic development and ecological protection rapid land use change has occurred in many arid and semiarid regions in the yellow river basin yrb over the past few decades such as the increase in grassland and forestland area and the decrease in unused land fu and chen 2000 ding 2003 wang et al 2010a b the change in landscape patterns which was extracted from land use data is one of the most crucial and direct driving factors of the changes in ecosystem functions fu and chen 2000 wang et al 2011 deng et al 2014 wang et al 2014 amici et al 2015 liang and yang 2016 li et al 2017b liang et al 2017 landscape pattern change alters the productivity of the ecosystem modifies the physical parameters of the earth s surface and affects nutritional transport between soil and vegetation by changing biochemical cycles and influences the elements and structure of ecosystems since landscape attributes show different patterns at different spatial extents the landscape structure affects the richness of plant species i e plant species diversity ouyang et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 ouyang et al 2010 deng et al 2014 amici et al 2015 liang and yang 2016 gao et al 2017 li et al 2017a the dynamic changes in landscape pattern change the process of biological water consumption and thus could affect the ewrs of ecosystems gao et al 2017 since the 1950s the demand for soil and water conservation measures has continuously increased due to the importance placed on environmental protection and sustainable development li et al 2016 cao et al 2018 many studies focusing on the impact of human activities and climate change on the ecological and water systems of the yrb have been performed xu and zhang 2002 fu et al 2004 liu and xia 2004 yang et al 2004 shiau et al 2007 yang et al 2008 cong et al 2009 yang et al 2009 wang et al 2010a feng et al 2012 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 and have found that the annual variation in natural annual runoff and the ecological systems of middle reaches of the yellow river has a significant period furthermore a large number of ecological protection measures in the middle reaches of the yellow river have achieved certain goals for instance due to soil and water conservation measures large areas of developed land such as urban land and cropland and unused land were converted into natural land such as forest grassland and wetland thus the pressures on the ewrs of the ecosystem are increasing gao et al 2011 li et al 2015 glenn et al 2017 in view of the scarcity of water resources and the degradation of the ecological functions of the middle main reaches of the yellow river an arid semiarid region in china and from a perspective of landscape pattern change it is necessary and important to analyze the influence of landscape pattern changes on ewrs therefor the influence of landscape pattern changes on the spatial distribution of ewrs was analyzed in arid semiarid regions with the middle main reaches of the yellow river used as an example in the research the objectives of this research are 1 to obtain the ewrs of different land uses during 1990 2015 2 to extract the landscape spatial pattern indices based on the ecosystem land use data and 3 to analyze the influence of landscape pattern change on the spatial distribution of the ewrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data

sanmenxia water resource division and the sanmenxia huayuankou water resource division zhang 2003 the division of water resources is beneficial to the management and application of water resources in river basins the middle main reaches of the yellow river produce approximately 21 of the river run off yield for the whole yrb but approximately 45 of the sediment is generated from this region the average annual temperature is approximately 9 78 14 33 c the average annual precipitation in the middle reaches of the yellow river is approximately 493 65 mm with the temporal distribution of annual precipitation being significant and concentrated in june and september the annual evaporation is in the range of 700 1300 mm the study area is located in the arid semiarid zone in china fig 1 which has special geographical locations and climatic conditions this area is a key area for soil and water conservation ecological environment projects especially the loess plateau area and the grain for green project ggp with intensive human activities the landscape pattern changed and the ewrs of vegetation in the region changed at the same time furthermore landscape pattern changes have an impact on the eco hydrology process of the whole region of the middle main reaches of the yellow river the study of the relationship between ewrs and landscape patterns in this area has important significance for other arid semiarid regions 2 1 2 data sources the data used in this study include dem data land use data and meteorological data remote sensing images from 1990 to 2005 were obtained

using the penman monteith formula and the characteristics of the spatial temporal evolution of ewrs were analyzed using fragstats software and arcgis software as platforms luque et al 2012 based on the 6 phases of land use data and 8 suitable landscape indices patch density pd connectivity index cohesion largest patch index lpi aggregation index ai shannon diversity index shdi contagion index contag separation index split and landscape shape index lsi the spatial and temporal characteristics of landscape patterns were explored furthermore the influence of landscape pattern on the spatial distribution of the ewrs in the middle main reaches of the yellow river was investigated the flowchart is shown in fig 2 2 2 1 calculation of the ewrs the ewrs of the river basin aim to maintain ecosystem function and ecosystem health in the process of the river basin water cycle the ewrs refer primarily to the ewrs of vegetation and the ewrs of the yellow river main stem have not been

support the growth of vegetation in this ecosystem while the kc values of grassland cropland and forestland are 0 4 0 35 and 0 5 respectively 2 2 2 calculation of the landscape pattern indices in this research the change characteristics of landscape pattern in the region are studied from two levels one is the class metrics level which reflects the change characteristics of each landscape type and the other is the landscape metrics level which reflects the overall change characteristics of the landscape jiang et al 2015 sakieh et al 2015 shen et al 2015 yuan et al 2015 the landscape pattern index at the class metrics level can analyze changes in the patch pattern of each landscape in different ways which can help us to more fully understand the change rules of landscape patterns for this purpose patch density pd connectivity index cohesion largest patch index lpi and aggregation index ai were selected at the class metrics level to understand the direction and intensity of human activities in the whole study region the shannon diversity index shdi contagion index contag connectivity index cohesion separation index split largest patch index lpi and landscape shape index lsi were selected for the landscape metrics level the landscape spatial pattern indices were extracted using fragstats 4 2 luque et al 2012 fragstats 4 2 can read esri arcgrids or rasters as the input

and ai is the area of landscape type i 2 the connectivity index cohesion reflects the aggregation degree of various landscape types in the landscape and their spatial distribution characteristics it is one of the important indicators for describing changes in landscape patterns generally the dominant landscape types in the overall landscape have good connectivity 4 cohesion 1 i 1 n j 1 m p ij i 1

j 1 a ij a where lpi is the largest patch index a is the total area of the study area and aij is the area of patch j of patch type i 4 the aggregation index ai reflects the spatial distribution of various landscape types the aggregation index is lowest if there is no common edge between any pixels of one landscape type and the aggregation index is highest when the common edge of all pixels in a certain landscape type reaches the maximum value 6 ai g ij max g ij 100 where ai is the aggregation index and gij is the number of adjacent pixels of patch j in landscape type i 5 the shannon diversity index shdi is an important index in landscape pattern analysis this index utilizes the knowledge that the degree of land use in the study area is directly proportional to the degree of fragmentation a higher shannon diversity index indicates a higher use degree of land use 7 shdi i 1 m a k a i ln a k a i where shdi is the shannon diversity index ak is the area of landscape type k ai is the area of landscape type i a is the total area of the study area and m is the number of landscape types 6 the contagion index contag refers to the spatial information about the landscape type a region with a high contagion index has a dominant type of landscape and good connectivity in contrast a low contagion index shows that the landscape includes a variety of landscape types and that the landscape tends to be fragmented 8 contag 1 i 1 m k 1 n p i g ik k 1 n g ik ln p i g ik k 1 n g ik 2 ln m 100 where contag is the contagion index n is the number of landscape patches of the same landscape type pi is the proportion of landscape type i in the total landscape area and gik is the number of pixels that are adjacent to landscape patch k in landscape type i 7 the separation index

the landscape shape index lsi represents the complexity of all patch boundaries 10 lsi 0 25 e a where lsi is the landscape shape index a is the total area of the study area and e is the length of all the patches in the study region 3 results and discussion based on the combination of remote sensing and gis technology and measured data the spatial distribution of ewrs and the landscape pattern index in the six different time periods 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were studied while the temporal and spatial relationships between the change in ewrs and the evolution of landscape pattern were analyzed 3 1 spatial distribution of the ewrs and landscape pattern indices 3 1 1 spatial distribution of the ewrs the spatial distribution map of the ewrs was obtained by the above methods in this map the ewr quota for each land use type is between 100 and 510 mm while the annual average water demand quotas for grassland forestland cropland and unused land are 391 mm 474 mm 343 mm and 180 mm respectively the spatial distribution of the ewrs for vegetation in the study area was simulated based on gis technology combined with several years of meteorological data fig 3 from 1990 to 2015 the ewrs decreased from 392 7 mm to 276 5 mm and the annual volume of ewrs in the study area decreased from 124 8 108 m3 to 89 6 108 m3 this decreasing trend was consistent with the actual evapotranspiration fig 4 the minimum ewrs in the study area decreased from 273 2 mm to 186 9 mm the maximum ewrs in 1995 was 594 7 mm which was higher than the maximum ewrs in 1990 table 1 this increase was related to the conversion of farmland to forest and grassland due to water and soil conservation engineering projects in the study area and was consistent with the decrease in landscape diversity shdi and an increase in the connectivity of landscape patches cohesion due to the spatial changes of vegetation cover the minimum ewrs for plant growth were less than 300 mm in the hekou longmen section and less than 394 mm in the sanmenxia huayuankou main stream section the ewrs in the main stream between longmen and sanmenxia were higher than 400 mm the ewrs in the sanmenxia huayuankou main stream section were the highest in the study area the minimum ewrs was 503 mm and the maximum ewrs were between 500 and 595 mm the ewrs in the northwest region of the study area were higher than those in the region between longmen and huayuankou in the yrb water and soil conservation engineering construction and rapid urban expansion resulted in the development of a diversiform landscape in the northwest part of the study area but most of the region between longmen and huayuankou contained cropland 3 1 2 spatial distribution of the landscape pattern indices from 1990 to 2015 due to the yellow river water and soil conservation engineering construction and the rapid urban expansion in the study area cropland and some unused land were replaced by urban land forestland and grassland the cropland was more affected by the landscape change than the unused land in order to maintain the quantity of the cropland a number of bottomland areas were converted into cropland in the riparian zone along with this trend the proportion of water and unused land in the study area decreased by 0 05 and 0 69 respectively while the proportion of cropland decreased by 1 12 the residential area increased from 304 200 ha to 481 500 ha which represented an increase of 1 05 the area of forestland increased from 3 306 500 ha to 3 431 200 ha which represented an increase of 0 74 the proportion of grassland increased by 0 07 fig 5 based on fragstats 4 2 and the land use classification data for each land use type the landscape pattern indices were calculated under three land use scenarios pd refers to the density of land use types and reflects the fragmentation degree of the distribution of every land use type a higher value of pd means more patches per unit area a higher value of the fragmentation index and higher heterogeneity based on the statistical results for pd for the various landscape types fig 6 the landscape type with the highest patch density was grassland followed by cropland and forestland during 1990 2015 the patch density changed significantly from 1990 to 1995 the pd of cropland and grassland decreased significantly the changes in the pd of the various landscape types were not obvious during 2000 2010 but the pd increased in 2015 patch density increases show that the extent of landscape fragmentation intensified landscape types tend not to follow simple rules i e changes in the landscape structure are volatile after 1995 the pd of grassland increased but the area of grassland decreased and the connectivity decreased gradually from 99 09 in 1990 to 98 83 in 2015 this indicated that the splitting of grassland patches in the later years led to an increase in patch density it can be seen that in the past 25 years under the influence of human activities the landscape pattern of the study area has changed greatly and the degree of landscape fragmentation has gradually increased but the change has slowed down in the last 10 years further analysis of the patch spatial pattern change process based on the ai table 2 shows that water and construction land experienced large changes the ai of water decreased from 39 49 in 1990 to 32 43 in 2015 indicating that the degree of water separation increased as many new channels were built to meet irrigation needs this resulted in greater water separation the ai of construction land increased by 8 62 mainly due to the increasing population and rapid economic development in shaanxi shanxi and henan province which led to increased demand for housing and arable land resulting in the emergence of new construction land and cropland in the previous multistage transfer matrix the main sources of forestland and construction land were grassland cropland and unused land the area of grassland and cropland is large so the ai of grassland and cropland decreased slightly based on the lpi table 2 the results showed that the lpi of cropland decreased showing a continuous trend in space the number of patches increased slowly and hardly increased in the next 15 years from 2000 to 2015 fig 6 the shrinkage of waters and unused land the soil and water conservation ecological environment construction especially in the loess plateau area and the grain for green project ggp resulted in the gradual division of space in conclusion most landscape types in the study region i e the middle main reaches of the yellow river were separated in space and the values of ai and lpi decreased at the landscape metrics level from 1990 to 2015 the shdi increased while the contag and cohesion continuously decreased table 3 the maximum value of shdi was 1 34 in 2015 which indicated that the landscape in this year was composed of various types the minimum value of shdi was 1 27 in 1995 which indicated that the landscape was dominated by a certain type from 1990 to 1995 the number of patches shown obviously decreased but it has increased continuously in the last 20 years from 1995 to 2015 the first 5 years of the study period were the most changeable years for the landscape pattern which can be reflected in three key indices of spatial change lpi lsi and split table 3 from 2010 to 2015 the change range is the largest because of the soil and water conservation projects especially in the loess plateau area and the grain for green project ggp the connection values of the same patches increased and the forestland and grassland became the predominant patches from 2000 to 2015 the larger patches were divided into many smaller patches and the shape changes were complex and diverse so the value of split increased the development of large scale intensive forest production and maintenance in later years has greatly improved cultivation irrigation and other issues this has created small patches of land resulting in increasing landscape diversity and heterogeneity which is conducive to maintaining the stability and improving the quality of forestland and grassland areas and reducing some of the negative impacts caused by landscape pattern changes the highest shdi was 1 67 in the hekou longmen water resource division indicating more landscape types in this region the shdi was low in the sanmenxia huayuankou water resource division ranging from 0 3 to 1 27 indicating less diversity in the landscape types in this region the maximum value of cohesion was 99 18 downstream of the study area in 1995 figs 7 9 which indicated greater landscape connectivity better element cycling improved energy flow and efficient information transmission between landscape patches in this region this article uses the pd in landscape ecology to show the density of land use types which reflects the fragmentation degree of every land use type distribution an increase in patch density and a decrease in mean patch size of landscape patches at the landscape level also indicated increased fragmentation of the whole landscape 3 1 3 the correlation between landscape pattern indices and ewrs fig 10 shows the relationship between the landscape pattern indices and the ewrs at the landscape metrics level over the past 25 years the correlation between the watershed landscape metrics level indices and the ewrs was obvious there was a significant positive correlation between ewrs and contag the positive correlations between ewrs and cohesion and between ewrs and lpi were not significant with coefficients of 0 733 and 0 663 respectively conversely the ewrs were significantly negatively correlated with shdi and lsi and the correlation coefficient with split was only 0 700 which indicated no significant negative correlation the correlations between the ewrs and landscape indices indicate that the ewrs are related to the transformation direction of landscape types under the influence of human activities and that the degree of aggregation of various landscape types in the landscape can affect the ewrs of the vegetation to determine the relationship between ewrs and landscape patterns the response characteristics of landscape patterns to ewrs were analyzed based on the grid data of the landscape pattern index and the spatial distribution map of ewrs arcgis 10 3 software was used to randomly select 6000 points excluding water and construction land before the spatial analysis tool was used to extract the data finally we conducted a statistical analysis and created a scatter diagram fig 11 with the most points aggregated in the interval of ewrs ranging from 200 mm to 400 mm the value of the landscape index is closely related to the human activities around it the shdi is high and the contag is low due to the intensity of human activities the ewrs showed a downward trend with increasing shdi and cohesion while they showed an upward trend with an increase in the landscape contag statistical software was used to analyze the correlation between landscape patterns and the ewrs table 4 there was a significant correlation between the ewrs and shdi cohesion and contag p less than 0 01 the ewrs had a significant negative correlation with shdi which indicated that an increase in landscape diversity would lead to a decrease in ewrs the ewrs had a significantly positive correlation with cohesion and contag which indicated that the ewrs would increase with better landscape connectivity and contagion the correlation coefficient with contag was higher than that with shdi and cohesion which showed a more significant correlation in addition landscape diversity had a significant negative correlation with landscape connectivity and landscape contagion considering landscape metrics fragmentation which can be reflected by patch density became the most important variable in shaping plot scale diversity this fragmentation was strongly related to ecosystem quality i e forest quality and was inversely related to the number of forest plant species huston 1999 amici et al 2015 landscape connectivity had a significant negative correlation with landscape contagion and high landscape contagion indicated that the landscape was dominated by a certain type of landscape patch which led to the high connectivity of each patch 3 2 discussion consistent with previous studies e g amici et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 the outcome of the simulation method used in this article was the annual ewr which is calculated based on natural geography land use vegetation distribution regional climate conditions vegetation transpiration and other characteristics however considering the fully functioning ecosystem the amount of unexplained variance is still very high which is likely due to the direct effects of environmental parameters i e altitude topography climate soil chemistry amici et al 2015 the vegetation ecosystem plays an important role in maintaining regional ecosystem stability and ecological protection especially in vulnerable ecological regions for all three groups of landscape variables the shape of the patches and the configuration of patch edges have a recurrent spatial pattern demonstrating the effect of landscape heterogeneity in explaining species richness and landscape fragmentation rocchini et al 2014 the split and the cohesion showed decreasing and nonvarying trends respectively in the past 25 years the total number of patches in the landscape pattern of the watershed has increased and their shapes have become more complex the results of this study show that there is a significant response and feedback relationship between the ewrs and the regional landscape pattern the correlations between the landscape indices at the landscape metric level and the ewrs were obvious but the degrees of correlation were different among them the ewrs had a positive correlation with the lpi indicating that changes to the largest patch had a great impact on the ewrs the change trend of lpi reflects that the patches have been gradually subdivided and large patches become smaller patches the change trend lead to the reduction of ewrs the ewrs also had a negative correlation with the split showing that the more fragmented the landscape patches the smaller the ewrs furthermore the ewrs had a very significant negative correlation with shdi and a very significant positive correlation with the cohesion and contag vegetation with high ewrs requires high growth factors such as topography and geology with the increase of water consumption the area of vegetation such as grassland increased and the cohesion and contag around it increased which lead to the decline shdi the correlation coefficient with contag was higher than that with shdi and cohesion which showed a more significant correlation based on rs and gis technology combined with multiple years of meteorological data the spatial distribution of ewrs for vegetation in the study area was simulated the spatial distribution characteristics of ewrs and the correlation with the landscape pattern index were analyzed the results of the study are helpful for management decision making as they allow managers to understand the characteristics of and topics related to the ewrs of vegetation on the regional level the responses of ewrs to landscape patterns that were determined in this study are helpful for the management and regulation of water resources 4 conclusions from 1990 to 2015 the ewrs decreased from 392 7 mm to 276 5 mm and the annual volume of ewrs in the study area decreased by 28 2 from 124 8 108 m3 to 89 6 108 m3 this decreasing trend was consistent with the actual evapotranspiration and also related to the monitoring capacity of vegetation evaporation in the study area in the past 25 years the total number of patches in the landscape pattern of the watershed has increased and the patch shape has become more complex the heterogeneity of the landscape has been strengthened and the degree of connectivity has been reduced overall with higher diversity the correlations between the landscape indices at the landscape metric level and the ewrs were clear but the degrees of correlation were different the ewrs had a positive correlation with the lpi indicating that changes in the largest patch had a great impact on the ewrs the ewrs also had a negative correlation with the split showing that the more fragmented the landscape patches the smaller the ewrs furthermore from the spatial distribution perspective there is a significant negative correlation between the ewrs and shdi there is a significant positive correlation between the ewrs and contag and cohesion the correlation coefficient between the ewrs and contag was higher than that with shdi or cohesion thus contag showed a more significant correlation with ewrs in terms of future applications understanding the effects of the surrounding landscape patterns on the ewrs could help to promote effective environmental policies and landscape management practices the spatial composition and configuration of landscape elements can be increased to reduce the ewrs of regional vegetation the ewrs can be regulated and the utilization rate of water resources can be improved by combining the current ecological environmental protection policies of the river basin and restricting future trends of landscape patterns to improve the accuracy of the calculations field experiments should be performed to measure

6170,with climate change and the intensification of human activities landscape patterns have undergone important changes these changes can have multiple impact on hydrology nutrient transport between soil and vegetation and ecological function and health in vegetative ecosystems dynamic changes in landscape patterns may affect the ecological water requirements ewrs of vegetation based on meteorological data soil data and 6 years of land use data from 1990 to 2015 the ewrs were obtained through the penman monteith formula eight suitable landscape indices patch density pd connectivity index cohesion largest patch index lpi aggregation index ai shannon diversity index shdi contagion index contag separation index split and landscape shape index lsi were used to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of landscape patterns furthermore the influences of landscape pattern changes on the ewrs of the middle main reaches of the yellow river china were investigated from 1990 to 2015 the total number of patches in the landscape pattern of the watershed increased and the patch shape became more complex the ewrs decreased from 392 7 mm to 276 5 mm and the annual volume of the ewrs in the study area decreased from 124 8 108 m3 to 89 6 108 m3 the ewrs had a positive correlation with the lpi indicating that the changes in the largest patch had a great impact on the ewrs the ewrs also had a negative correlation with the split showing that the more fragmented the landscape patches the smaller the ewrs with an increase in shdi the ewrs showed a downward trend furthermore the ewrs showed a downward trend with decreasing contag and cohesion these results provide useful information for ecological restoration and provide an important reference for ecological environmental protection and the optimal allocation of water resources in arid semiarid regions around the world in the future the ewrs can be regulated and the utilization rate of water resources can be improved by combining the current ecological environmental protection policies of the yellow river basin and managing future trends in landscape patterns keywords land use cover the middle main reaches of the yellow river landscape pattern landscape indices ecological water requirements ewrs 1 introduction with the rapid development of water resources and the intensification of activities centered on human demands aquatic ecosystems have been changed to different degrees cui et al 2009 fang et al 2018 this has resulted in damage to the ecological environment and has created a series of environmental problems such as ecological degradation these problems will eventually endanger the safety and sustainable development of human society liu and xia 2004 li et al 2015 liu and cui 2011 wu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 at the same time vegetative ecosystems play an important role in maintaining regional ecosystem stability and ecological protections especially in vulnerable ecological regions amici et al 2015 li et al 2016 looking at the concept of ecological water requirements ewrs the ewrs of the vegetative ecosystems aim to maintain ecosystem function and health in the ecological water cycle deb et al 2019a 2019b as they play an important role in maintaining ecosystem function ewrs have gradually attracted attention in hydrological research song et al 2007 sun et al 2007 cui et al 2009 yang et al 2009 feng et al 2012 kendy et al 2017 pitt and kendy 2017 ramírez hernández et al 2017 wurbs and hoffpauir 2017 in recent years many methods for calculating ewrs have been proposed such as area method the phreatic evaporation method the vegetation evapotranspiration method the water balance method and the vegetation biomass method aa et al 2019 chen et al 2010 deng et al 2015 yu et al 2015 the calculation of ewrs allows not only the quantification of the demand for water resources in regional ecosystems but also analysis of the degree to which human activities use up ewrs the determination of regional ewrs is conducive to the rational development and utilization of water and soil resources under the premise of protecting the environment in order to realize the simultaneous development of economic development and ecological protection rapid land use change has occurred in many arid and semiarid regions in the yellow river basin yrb over the past few decades such as the increase in grassland and forestland area and the decrease in unused land fu and chen 2000 ding 2003 wang et al 2010a b the change in landscape patterns which was extracted from land use data is one of the most crucial and direct driving factors of the changes in ecosystem functions fu and chen 2000 wang et al 2011 deng et al 2014 wang et al 2014 amici et al 2015 liang and yang 2016 li et al 2017b liang et al 2017 landscape pattern change alters the productivity of the ecosystem modifies the physical parameters of the earth s surface and affects nutritional transport between soil and vegetation by changing biochemical cycles and influences the elements and structure of ecosystems since landscape attributes show different patterns at different spatial extents the landscape structure affects the richness of plant species i e plant species diversity ouyang et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 ouyang et al 2010 deng et al 2014 amici et al 2015 liang and yang 2016 gao et al 2017 li et al 2017a the dynamic changes in landscape pattern change the process of biological water consumption and thus could affect the ewrs of ecosystems gao et al 2017 since the 1950s the demand for soil and water conservation measures has continuously increased due to the importance placed on environmental protection and sustainable development li et al 2016 cao et al 2018 many studies focusing on the impact of human activities and climate change on the ecological and water systems of the yrb have been performed xu and zhang 2002 fu et al 2004 liu and xia 2004 yang et al

and the ecological systems of middle reaches of the yellow river has a significant period furthermore a large number of ecological protection measures in the middle reaches of the yellow river have achieved certain goals for instance due to soil and water conservation measures large areas of developed land such as urban land and cropland and unused land were converted into natural land such as forest grassland and wetland thus the pressures on the ewrs of the ecosystem are increasing gao et al 2011 li et al 2015 glenn et al 2017 in view of the scarcity of water resources and the degradation of the ecological functions of the middle main reaches of the yellow river an arid semiarid region in china and from a perspective of landscape pattern change it is necessary and important to analyze the influence of landscape pattern changes on ewrs therefor the influence of landscape pattern changes on the spatial distribution of ewrs was analyzed in arid semiarid regions with the middle main

sanmenxia water resource division and the sanmenxia huayuankou water resource division zhang 2003 the division of water resources is beneficial to the management and application of water resources in river basins the middle main reaches of the yellow river produce approximately 21 of the river run off yield for the whole yrb but approximately 45 of the sediment is generated from this region the average annual temperature is approximately 9 78 14 33 c the average annual precipitation in the middle reaches of the yellow river is approximately 493 65 mm with the temporal distribution of annual precipitation being significant and concentrated in june and september the annual evaporation is in the range of 700 1300 mm the study area is located in the arid semiarid zone in china fig 1 which has special geographical locations and climatic conditions this area is a key area for soil and water conservation ecological environment projects especially the loess plateau area and the grain for green project ggp with intensive human activities the landscape pattern changed and the ewrs of vegetation in the region changed at the same time furthermore landscape pattern changes have an impact on the eco hydrology process of the whole region of the middle main reaches of the yellow river the study of the relationship between ewrs and landscape patterns in this area has important significance for other arid semiarid regions 2 1 2 data sources the data used in this study include dem data land use data and meteorological data remote sensing images from 1990 to 2005 were obtained

research the change characteristics of landscape pattern in the region are studied from two levels one is the class metrics level which reflects the change characteristics of each landscape type and the other is the landscape metrics level which reflects the overall change characteristics of the landscape jiang et al 2015 sakieh et al 2015 shen et al 2015 yuan et al 2015 the landscape pattern index at the class metrics level can analyze changes in the patch pattern of each landscape in different ways which can help us to more fully understand the change rules of landscape patterns for this purpose patch density pd connectivity index cohesion largest patch index lpi and aggregation index ai were selected at the class metrics level to understand the direction and intensity of human activities in the whole study region the shannon diversity index shdi contagion index contag connectivity index cohesion separation index split largest patch index lpi and landscape shape index lsi

and ai is the area of landscape type i 2 the connectivity index cohesion reflects the aggregation degree of various landscape types in the landscape and their spatial distribution characteristics it is one of the important indicators for describing changes in landscape patterns generally the dominant landscape types in the overall landscape have good connectivity 4 cohesion 1 i 1 n j 1 m p ij i 1

certain landscape type reaches the maximum value 6 ai g ij max g ij 100 where ai is the aggregation index and gij is the number of adjacent pixels of patch j in landscape type i 5 the shannon diversity index shdi is an important index in landscape pattern analysis this index utilizes the knowledge that the degree of land use in the study area is directly proportional to the degree of fragmentation a higher shannon diversity index indicates a higher use degree of land use 7 shdi i 1 m a k a i ln a k a i where shdi is the shannon diversity index ak is the area of landscape type k ai is the area of landscape type i a is the total area of the study area and m is the number of landscape types 6 the contagion index contag refers to the spatial information about the landscape type a region with a high contagion index has a dominant type of landscape and good connectivity in contrast a low contagion index shows that the landscape includes a variety of landscape types and that the landscape tends to be fragmented 8 contag 1 i 1 m k 1 n p i g ik k 1 n g ik ln p i g ik k 1 n g ik 2 ln m 100 where contag is the contagion index n is the number of landscape patches of the same

the patches in the study region 3 results and discussion based on the combination of remote sensing and gis technology and measured data the spatial distribution of ewrs and the landscape pattern index in the six different time periods 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were studied while the temporal and spatial relationships between the change in ewrs and the evolution of landscape pattern were analyzed 3 1 spatial distribution of the ewrs and landscape pattern indices 3 1 1 spatial distribution of the ewrs the spatial distribution map of the ewrs was obtained by the above methods in this map the ewr quota for each land use type is between 100 and 510 mm while the annual average water demand quotas for grassland forestland cropland and unused land are 391 mm 474 mm 343 mm and 180 mm respectively the spatial distribution of the ewrs for vegetation in the study area was simulated based on gis technology combined with several years of meteorological data fig 3 from 1990 to 2015 the ewrs decreased from 392 7 mm to 276 5 mm and the annual volume of ewrs in the study area decreased from 124 8 108 m3 to 89 6 108 m3 this decreasing trend was consistent with the actual evapotranspiration fig 4 the minimum ewrs in the study area decreased from 273 2 mm to 186 9 mm the maximum ewrs in 1995 was 594 7 mm which was higher than the maximum ewrs in 1990 table 1 this increase was related to the conversion of farmland to forest and grassland due to water and soil conservation engineering projects in the study area and was consistent with the decrease in landscape diversity shdi and an increase in the connectivity of landscape patches cohesion due to the spatial changes of vegetation cover the minimum ewrs for plant growth were less than 300 mm in the hekou longmen section and less than 394 mm in the sanmenxia huayuankou main stream section the ewrs in the main stream between longmen and sanmenxia were higher than 400 mm the ewrs in the sanmenxia huayuankou main stream section were the highest in the study area the minimum ewrs was 503 mm and the maximum ewrs were between 500 and 595 mm the ewrs in the northwest region of the study area were higher than those in the region between longmen and huayuankou in the yrb water and soil conservation engineering construction and rapid urban expansion resulted in the development of a diversiform landscape in the northwest part of the study area but most of the region between longmen and huayuankou contained cropland 3 1 2 spatial distribution of the landscape pattern indices from 1990 to 2015 due to the yellow river water and soil conservation engineering construction and the rapid urban expansion in the study area cropland and some unused land were replaced by urban land forestland and grassland the cropland was more affected by the landscape change than the unused land in order to maintain the quantity of the cropland a number of bottomland areas were converted into cropland in the riparian zone along with this trend the proportion of water and unused land in the study area decreased by 0 05 and 0 69 respectively while the proportion of cropland decreased by 1 12 the residential area increased from 304 200 ha to 481 500 ha which represented an increase of 1 05 the area of forestland increased from 3 306 500 ha to 3 431 200 ha which represented an increase of 0 74 the proportion of grassland increased by 0 07 fig 5 based on fragstats 4 2 and the land use classification data for each land use type the landscape pattern indices were calculated under three land use scenarios pd refers to the density of land use types and reflects the fragmentation degree of the distribution of every land use type a higher value of pd means more patches per unit area a higher value of the fragmentation index and higher heterogeneity based on the statistical results for pd for the various landscape types fig 6 the landscape type with the highest patch density was grassland followed by cropland and forestland during 1990 2015 the patch density changed significantly from 1990 to 1995 the pd of cropland and grassland decreased significantly the changes in the pd of the various landscape types were not obvious during 2000 2010 but the pd increased in 2015 patch density increases show that the extent of landscape fragmentation intensified landscape types tend not to follow simple rules i e changes in the landscape structure are volatile after 1995 the pd of grassland increased but the area of grassland decreased and the connectivity decreased gradually from 99 09 in 1990 to 98 83 in 2015 this indicated that the splitting of grassland patches in the later years led to an increase in patch density it can be seen that in the past 25 years under the influence of human activities the landscape pattern of the study area has changed greatly and the degree of landscape fragmentation has gradually increased but the change has slowed down in the last 10 years further analysis of the patch spatial pattern change process based on the ai table 2 shows that water and construction land experienced large changes the ai of water decreased from 39 49 in 1990 to 32 43 in 2015 indicating that the degree of water separation increased as many new channels were built to meet irrigation needs this resulted in greater water separation the ai of construction land increased by 8 62 mainly due to the increasing population and rapid economic development in shaanxi shanxi and henan province which led to increased demand for housing and arable land resulting in the emergence of new construction land and cropland in the previous multistage transfer matrix the main sources of forestland and construction land were grassland cropland and unused land the area of grassland and cropland is large so the ai of grassland and cropland decreased slightly based on the lpi table 2 the results showed that the lpi of cropland decreased showing a continuous trend in space the number of patches increased slowly and hardly increased in the next 15 years from 2000 to 2015 fig 6 the shrinkage of waters and unused land the soil and water conservation ecological environment construction especially in the loess plateau area and the grain for green project ggp resulted in the gradual division of space in conclusion most landscape types in the study region i e the middle main reaches of the yellow river were separated in space and the values of ai and lpi decreased at the landscape metrics level from 1990 to 2015 the shdi increased while the contag and cohesion continuously decreased table 3 the maximum value of shdi was 1 34 in 2015 which indicated that the landscape in this year was composed of various types the minimum value of shdi was 1 27 in 1995 which indicated that the landscape was dominated by a certain type from 1990 to 1995 the number of patches shown obviously decreased but it has increased continuously in the last 20 years from 1995 to 2015 the first 5 years of the study period were the most changeable years for the landscape pattern which can be reflected in three key indices of spatial change lpi lsi and split table 3 from 2010 to 2015 the change range is the largest because of the soil and water conservation projects especially in the loess plateau area and the grain for green project ggp the connection values of the same patches increased and the forestland and grassland became the predominant patches from 2000 to 2015 the larger patches were divided into many smaller patches and the shape changes were complex and diverse so the value of split increased the development of large scale intensive forest production and maintenance in later years has greatly improved cultivation irrigation and other issues this has created small patches of land resulting in increasing landscape diversity and heterogeneity which is conducive to maintaining the stability and improving the quality of forestland and grassland areas and reducing some of the negative impacts caused by landscape pattern changes the highest shdi was 1 67 in the hekou longmen water resource division indicating more landscape types in this region the shdi was low in the sanmenxia huayuankou water resource division ranging from 0 3 to 1 27 indicating less diversity in the landscape types in this region the maximum value of cohesion was 99 18 downstream of the study area in 1995 figs 7 9 which indicated greater landscape connectivity better element cycling improved energy flow and efficient information transmission between landscape patches in this region this article uses the pd in landscape ecology to show the density of land use types which reflects the fragmentation degree of every land use type distribution an increase in patch density and a decrease in mean patch size of landscape patches at the landscape level also indicated increased fragmentation of the whole landscape 3 1 3 the correlation between landscape pattern indices and ewrs fig 10 shows the relationship between the landscape pattern indices and the ewrs at the landscape metrics level over the past 25 years the correlation between the watershed landscape metrics level indices and the ewrs was obvious there was a significant positive correlation between ewrs and contag the positive correlations between ewrs and cohesion and between ewrs and lpi were not significant with coefficients of 0 733 and 0 663 respectively conversely the ewrs were significantly negatively correlated with shdi and lsi and the correlation coefficient with split was only 0 700 which indicated no significant negative correlation the correlations between the ewrs and landscape indices indicate that the ewrs are related to the transformation direction of landscape types under the influence of human activities and that the degree of aggregation of various landscape types in the landscape can affect the ewrs of the vegetation to determine the relationship between ewrs and landscape patterns the response characteristics of landscape patterns to ewrs were analyzed based on the grid data of the landscape pattern index and the spatial distribution map of ewrs arcgis 10 3 software was used to randomly select 6000 points excluding water and construction land before the spatial analysis tool was used to extract the data finally we conducted a statistical analysis and created a scatter diagram fig 11 with the most points aggregated in the interval of ewrs ranging from 200 mm to 400 mm the value of the landscape index is closely related to the human activities around it the shdi is high and the contag is low due to the intensity of human activities the ewrs showed a downward trend with increasing shdi and cohesion while they showed an upward trend with an increase in the landscape contag statistical software was used to analyze the correlation between landscape patterns and the ewrs table 4 there was a significant correlation between the ewrs and shdi cohesion and contag p less than 0 01 the ewrs had a significant negative correlation with shdi which indicated that an increase in landscape diversity would lead to a decrease in ewrs the ewrs had a significantly positive correlation with cohesion and contag which indicated that the ewrs would increase with better landscape connectivity and contagion the correlation coefficient with contag was higher than that with shdi and cohesion which showed a more significant correlation in addition landscape diversity had a significant negative correlation with landscape connectivity and landscape contagion considering landscape metrics fragmentation which can be reflected by patch density became the most important variable in shaping plot scale diversity this fragmentation was strongly related to ecosystem quality i e forest quality and was inversely related to the number of forest plant species huston 1999 amici et al 2015 landscape connectivity had a significant negative correlation with landscape contagion and high landscape contagion indicated that the landscape was dominated by a certain type of landscape patch which led to the high connectivity of each patch 3 2 discussion consistent with previous studies e g amici et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 the outcome of the simulation method used in this article was the annual ewr which is calculated based on natural geography land use vegetation distribution regional climate conditions vegetation transpiration and other characteristics however considering the fully functioning ecosystem the amount of unexplained variance is still very high which is likely due to the direct effects of environmental parameters i e altitude topography climate soil chemistry amici et al 2015 the vegetation ecosystem plays an important role in maintaining regional ecosystem stability and ecological protection especially in vulnerable ecological regions for all three groups of landscape variables the shape of the patches and the configuration of patch edges have a recurrent spatial pattern demonstrating the effect of landscape heterogeneity in explaining species richness and landscape fragmentation rocchini et al 2014 the split and the cohesion showed decreasing and nonvarying trends respectively in the past 25 years the total number of patches in the landscape pattern of the watershed has increased and their shapes have become more complex the results of this study show that there is a significant response and feedback relationship between the ewrs and the regional landscape pattern the correlations between the landscape indices at the landscape metric level and the ewrs were obvious but the degrees of correlation were different among them the ewrs had a positive correlation with the lpi indicating that changes to the largest patch had a great impact on the ewrs the change trend of lpi reflects that the patches have been gradually subdivided and large patches become smaller patches the change trend lead to the reduction of ewrs the ewrs also had a negative correlation with the split showing that the more fragmented the landscape patches the smaller the ewrs furthermore the ewrs had a very significant negative correlation with shdi and a very significant positive correlation with the cohesion and contag vegetation with high ewrs requires high growth factors such as topography and geology with the increase of water consumption the area of vegetation such as grassland increased and the cohesion and contag around it increased which lead to the decline shdi the correlation coefficient with contag was higher than that with shdi and cohesion which showed a more significant correlation based on rs and gis technology combined with multiple years of meteorological data the spatial distribution of ewrs for vegetation in the study area was simulated the spatial distribution characteristics of ewrs and the correlation with the landscape pattern index were analyzed the results of the study are helpful for management decision making as they allow managers to understand the characteristics of and topics related to the ewrs of vegetation on the regional level the responses of ewrs to landscape patterns that were determined in this study are helpful for the management and regulation of water resources 4 conclusions from 1990 to 2015 the ewrs decreased from 392 7 mm to 276 5 mm and the annual volume of ewrs in the study area decreased by 28 2 from 124 8 108 m3 to 89 6 108 m3 this decreasing trend was consistent with the actual evapotranspiration and also related to the monitoring capacity of vegetation evaporation in the study area in the past 25 years the total number of patches in the landscape pattern of the watershed has increased and the patch shape has become more complex the heterogeneity of the landscape has been strengthened and the degree of connectivity has been reduced overall with higher diversity the correlations between the landscape indices at the landscape metric level and the ewrs were clear but the degrees of correlation were different the ewrs had a positive correlation with the lpi indicating that changes in the largest patch had a great impact on the ewrs the ewrs also had a negative correlation with the split showing that the more fragmented the landscape patches the smaller the ewrs furthermore from the spatial distribution perspective there is a significant negative correlation between the ewrs and shdi there is a significant positive correlation between the ewrs and contag and cohesion the correlation coefficient between the ewrs and contag was higher than that with shdi or cohesion thus contag showed a more significant correlation with ewrs in terms of future applications understanding the effects of the surrounding landscape patterns on the ewrs could help to promote effective environmental policies and landscape management practices the spatial composition and configuration of landscape elements can be increased to reduce the ewrs of regional vegetation the ewrs can be regulated and the utilization rate of water resources can be improved by combining the current ecological environmental protection policies of the river basin and restricting future trends of landscape patterns to improve the accuracy of the calculations field experiments should be performed to measure

6171,uncertainty in a hydrodynamic model originates from input data model structure and parameters in order to provide the robust model predictions the bayesian model averaging bma approach could be used as a multi model combining method to account for the compound effects from various uncertainty sources however bma cannot provide a clear picture of the impact from individual uncertainty sources hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma is a recently developed approach to study the relative impact of different uncertainty sources which explicitly considers various sources of uncertainty in the hierarchical structure bma tree for analysing uncertainty propagation in this study hbma is tested over the black river watershed in missouri and arkansas based on water stage predictions from 243 lisflood fp model configurations that integrate five sources of uncertainty including channel shape channel width channel roughness topography and flow forcing to compare the model perturbation approach is also applied in this study to investigate the influence of individual uncertainty sources on model prediction overall the results indicate that hbma provides an alternative way for flood modellers to deal with modelling uncertainty in data sparse region when multiple choices of uncertainty sources are considered findings from black river watershed point out that without considering the model weight model perturbation approach channel width and topographical data resolution have the largest impact on the hydrodynamic model predictions followed by flow forcing which has a relatively greater influence than channel cross sectional shape and model parameter however when model weights are taken into account hbma model input topography and flow forcing and model parameter have a larger impact on prediction variance than model structure channel width and cross sectional shape moreover as results move up the hierarchy along the bma tree the accuracy of deterministic mean prediction also increases in general whereas the 95 confidence interval associated with the deterministic mean prediction might become larger keywords hierarchical bayesian model averaging uncertainty

2017 wing et al 2018 appropriate flood risk management decisions are underpinned by reliable prediction of water stage and inundation extent by using a hydrodynamic model alfieri et al 2014 bates et al 2010 bermúdez et al 2017 dimitriadis et al 2016 hunter et al 2008 merwade et al 2008 neal et al 2012b pappenberger et al 2005 however regardless of whether a one dimensional 1d or a two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic model is selected for simulation a lot of uncertainty will always exist this uncertainty to a certain extent affects the quality of model predictions aronica et al 1998 duong and gourbesville 2016 liu et al 2014 merwade et al 2008 yin and tsai 2018 according to the concept of equifinality different model structures parameters and input boundary conditions may make the predictions achieve a similar level of fit to the observations to interpret this in another way one specific model implementation that works well for one flood event might not perform well for another since it may have reached equifinality as the best model implementation for the first flood event therefore the prediction based on a single model approach is subjected to significant bias if the model is not properly implemented alternatively a multi model combining approach is a more robust way to extract information from a group of existing model implementations to provide reliable predictions among the current existing multi model combining approaches such as simple model average weighted model average and multi model super ensemble ajami et al 2006 chowdhury and sharma 2009 liu et al 2018 najafi and moradkhani 2015 wood et al 2016 bayesian model averaging bma is one of the most common and widely used approaches to generate a reliable deterministic model prediction and its prediction distribution from a model ensemble based on model performances in the past madadgar and moradkhani 2014 morales et al 2006 notaro et al 2014 raftery et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 yan and moradkhani 2014 in the previous study liu and merwade 2018 the authors applied the bma approach to the black river water stage predictions by integrating four sources of uncertainty including channel width channel cross sectional shape channel roughness and flow forcing the bma method weights each model implementation based on its predictability over the past flood event and assigning the same weight in the forecasting mode the results indicate that the bma prediction outperforms most of the model members and ensemble mean when equal weight is considered for each model implementation although the bma method aggregates all plausible models to obtain one optimal prediction it only evaluates the combinatory effects from all uncertainty sources the role of an individual uncertainty source is still not altogether understood yen 2012 the uncertainty source that could significantly change the prediction outcome or prediction variance should be identified therefore following the previous research this study aims to separate and evaluate the relative importance of model structure model parameter and model input forcing on the final prediction and prediction variance in flood inundation modelling hamill 2001 provides a perturbation approach to study the impact of individual factors on model predictions in the perturbation approach one individual factor is added or modified each time to evaluate the change in the model prediction each model implementation is treated equally in the perturbation approach however in a multi model combining method such as bma models are weighted and poor predictions from some model implementations in the ensemble are eliminated therefore the impact of each uncertainty source when weights are considered is different from that found using a model perturbation approach and instead of model prediction model prediction variance is evaluated chitsazan and tsai 2015 the hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma approach considers both situations by separating and locating each uncertainty source on one level of a bma tree structure chitsazan and tsai 2014 chitsazan and tsai 2015 tsai and elshall 2013 on one hand the original predictions from all the different model implementations are the root of the bma tree which are located at a hidden level base 1 level discussed later and no weight has been counted a model perturbation method can be applied to evaluate the impact of each uncertainty source on a model prediction based on these original predictions on the other hand as levels move up along the hierarchical structure hbma also provides an insight into the impact of different uncertainty sources on prediction variance and how they propagate over the bma tree when weights are counted as flood forecasts from additional sources become available which then drive multiple hydrodynamic models to create an ensemble of flood inundation extents it becomes necessary to not only understand the overall uncertainty but the relative role of each uncertainty source in the final prediction such an understanding will help modellers to allocate resources in collecting data for better parameterization of the models accordingly the objectives of this study are to 1 prioritize the impact of different uncertainty sources on a hydrodynamic model prediction and its variance using model perturbation and the hbma approach 2 investigate how the model performance changes at different hierarchical levels in the bma tree and 3 quantify the uncertainty associated with the mean predictions at each hierarchical level and its propagation along the bma tree to the best of the authors acknowledge nothing in the existing literature applies hbma to the field of flood modelling as the multi model combining approach becomes increasingly popular findings from this study are expected to provide useful information to flood modellers and decision makers in understanding and reducing flood prediction uncertainty 2 study area and data the black river watershed located across the border of arkansas and missouri in the u s has a drainage area about 20 000 km2 this region has humid subtropical climate with hot and wet summers and slightly cool and dry winters extreme weather events such as thunderstorms and tornadoes frequently affect arkansas and missouri as a tornado alley passes through these two states as a result the black river watershed has experienced numerous flood events in the past additionally the black river watershed has four major rivers including black river current river eleven point river and spring river from the east to west and all these rivers drain south to the watershed outlet in arkansas these four major rivers encompasses distinct topographical and geomorphic settings as well as varying reach lengths and sinuosity therefore the black river watershed is selected to be the study area for this study the daily streamflow input to the hydraulic model and stage data for validation are obtained from the usgs gauging stations fig 1 and table 1 the topography and land use dataset are obtained in the form of national elevation dataset ned 90 m digital elevation model dem http ned usgs gov and national land cover dataset 2011 land use data nlcd http www mrlc gov nlcd2011 php respectively although the prediction accuracy improves by using a higher resolution dem 90 m resolution is used in this study to strike a balance between predication accuracy and computational demand for a large number of simulations needed for the uncertainty analysis additionally many large scale models use 90 m or coarser dem for flood modelling neal et al 2012a schumann et al 2013 a 30 m resolution dem is obtained and resampled to create 60 m and 120 m dems for the study area the channel width samples are obtained by digitizing bank lines and a series of cross sections along major rivers in the study area based on google maps the distance between banks at each cross sections was computed to produce the widths sample for each major river respectively the bankfull depth data are obtained from national oceanic and atmospheric administration s advanced hydrologic prediction service https water weather gov ahps by assuming that the minor flood stage provided by noaa corresponds approximately to the bankfull depth the bankfull depth between two stations along a river is computed through linear interpolation 3 methodology 3 1 hydraulic modelling considering the amount of effort in the model set up computational demand and results from past studies lisflood fp is selected to conduct hydraulic simulations in this study the latest subgrid version of lisflood fp is easy to implement for large scale flood simulations and it typically yields accurate predictions bates and de roo 2000 neal et al 2012a lisflood fp subgrid model is designed based on a two dimensional base model bates 2010 to include a subgrid scale representation of channelized flows the model predicts water depths and streamflow in each grid cell at each time step to capture the dynamic propagation of flood waves along the channel and over the floodplains by solving continuity and momentum equations aronica et al 2002 bates et al 2010 horritt and bates 2001 horritt and bates 2002 neal et al 2011 the input data for the lisflood fp model includes the dem flow forcing time series stream centreline and channel geometry information including average river width bankfull depth slope surface roughness and channel cross sectional shape merwade et al 2018 the floodplain roughness values used in this study are obtained by relating each land use category in the nlcd land use dataset to manning s n value kalyanapu et al 2010 a six month daily time step simulation from 01 2011 to 06 2011 is used for this research this period is selected based on a major historical flood event peak around 4 26 2011 in the study area and the availability of input data this simulation period includes the entire peak flow period and low flow periods before and after the event a total number of 243 lisflood fp model configurations described in the next section are created and simulated using high performance computing hpc resources at purdue university lisflood fp model needs proper warm up period to adjust its state to fit the entire stream network and model parameters after trial runs the first two months of each simulation are found to be sufficient for warm up period and the predictions in the warm up period are excluded to avoid unrealistic predictions in the bma analysis 3 2 uncertainty sources and model implementations uncertainty in an lisflood fp model comes from a variety of sources including model structure model parameter input forcing and boundary conditions among others demeritt et al 2007 merwade et al 2008 merz et al 2004 merz and thieken 2009 todini 2004 five common uncertainty sources including the cross sectional shape of the channel channel width channel roughness dem resolution and streamflow forcing are considered in this study although there are other uncertainty sources such as the configuration of hydraulic structures including bridges and culverts they are excluded due to the lack of detailed data at the stream network scale the uncertainty in streamflow estimates at the usgs gaging stations can be as high as 10 for stable natural channels harmel et al 2006 slade 2004 thus three streamflow estimates including 0 9q q and 1 1q are used similarly uncertainty in channel width is incorporated by picking 5 average and 95 from a distribution of channel widths for each of the major rivers respectively table 2 fig 2 the 5 and 95 quantile widths represent a general range of channel widths excluding the extreme values e g width 95 or width 5 the uncertainty in channel roughness manning s n value is selected from 0 01 to 0 05 this range is used based on previous studies to reflect the roughness conditions of most natural channels characterized from a clean straight channel to winding grassy and gravelled channel liu et al 2019 three different dem resolutions including 60 m 90 m and 120 m are used for topography data and these resolutions are selected to match the computational demand for the large number of simulations in the black river watershed the typical simulation time for 60 m 90 m and 120 m dem are approximately 43 h 1 8 day 28 h 1 2 day and 18 h 0 76 day respectively finally the uncertainty in cross sectional shape is incorporated by assuming three shapes namely triangular parabola and rectangle considering the aforementioned five uncertainty sources and three values for each source table 3 243 3 3 3 3 3 lisflood fp model configurations are created by using different combinations of these uncertainty sources table a1 to distinguish the model parameter uncertainty since change of model parameters are not considered as a new model the 243 lisflood fp model configurations are further reconstructed to 81 base models for the base level of the bma tree by only considering the change in model structure and model input each of these 81 base models has three within model configurations located at a hidden base 1 level by considering the uncertainty in channel roughness parameter chitsazan and tsai 2015 3 3 hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma 3 3 1 bayesian model averaging bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical approach to combine estimations from individual models and produce reliable prediction madadgar and moradkhani 2014 raftery et al 2005 bma approach has been widely applied in various fields in the literatures for example ajami et al 2007 used bma to confront different types of model uncertainty in surface water hydrology neuman 2003 used bma and maximum likelihood bayesian model averaging mlbma to subsurface flow and transport zhang et al 2016 used bma to reconstruct regional mean climate and yeung et al 2005 used bma to develop an improved multi class gene selection and classification tool using the bma the mean and variance of predicted water stage using the 243 model implementations can be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 1 e d m 1 m k k e d m k p r m k d v a r d m k k v a r d m k p r m k d 2 k e d m k e d m 1 m k 2 p r m k d in eq 1 e d m 1 m k is the mean of the predicted water stage d from the kth model implementations e d m k is the prediction from the kth model p r m k d is the posterior model probability of model mk and d is the observed water stage data in eq 2 v a r d m k is the variance of a predicted water stage using model mk the first term on the right side of eq 2 is the within model variance of the predicted water stage that averages model prediction variances the second term on the right side of eq 2 is the between model variance that accounts for the spreading of a mean predicted water stage by different models for non gaussian data a power transformation is needed to map the variables from their original space to the gaussian space this is because the functions of expectation maximization eqs 5 7 discussed later can only be used for variables whose conditional probability distribution function pdf is well described with a normal distribution the observed and simulated water stage data are normalized using the box cox power transformation box and cox 1964 osborne 2010 this method is used to transform the skewed data into normal distribution using eq 3 when the power λ is zero the natural logarithm is applied to the data different powers are tested and the best power that yields the closest normal distribution of transformed water stage data is found and applied the transformed water stage data is used to find the bma weights for each model member in order to estimate the model weight wk and standard deviation σ k in eq 5 on the basis of a training data set the log likelihood function eq 4 is maximized 3 f λ f λ 1 λ λ 0 ln f λ 0 4 l θ s t l o g k 1 k w k g k d s t m k s t where λ is the power that is used to transform the data to a normal distribution and the summation in eq 4 is over locations s and time t in the training data eq 4 is difficult to solve analytically or numerically vrugt and robinson 2007 zhu et al 2016 and thus an expectation maximization em algorithm is used to find out the maximum likelihood the em algorithm is iterative and alternates between two steps the e or expectation step and the m or maximization step by using a latent variable z in the e step z is estimated given the current estimates of the model weight wk and standard deviation σ k eq 5 5 z k s t j w k j 1 g d s t m k s t σ k j 1 i 1 k w i j 1 g d s t m i s t σ i j 1 where the superscript j refers to the jth iteration of the em algorithm and g d st m kst σ k j 1 is a normal density with mean mkst and standard deviation σ k j 1 in the mth step weight wk and standard deviation σ k are calculated with the current estimate of zkst eqs 6 and 7 6 w k j 1 n s t z k s t j 7 σ k 2 j s t z k s t j d s t m s t 2 s t z k s t j where n is the number of observations including distinct values of locations and time the e step and m step are iterated to convergence when the changes of weight variance latent variable z and log likelihood are smaller than a specified small tolerance 10 6 in this study the log likelihood is guaranteed to increase at each em iteration therefore finally it converges to a local maximum wu 1983 although bma is a robust method to integrate a series of model outputs for uncertainty analysis it cannot provide detailed information about the relative importance of each uncertainty source additionally the contribution of an individual source of uncertainty to the total prediction variance is not clear therefore the hierarchical bma method is applied to address these issues 3 3 2 hierarchical bayesian model averaging hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma uses a bma tree structure and the schematic of the bma tree structure developed by the five uncertainty sources in this study is shown in fig 3 each level in the bma tree represents one uncertainty source and contains competing model predictions from this source in a discrete form the 81 models at the base level are called the base models which are derived by averaging predictions from the hidden level all models above the base level are bma models that are developed by averaging the models one level below them in this study the letters ct cp cr are used to represent the triangular parabolic and rectangular channel shapes respectively the letters w5 wave w95 are applied to describe a 5 low channel width average channel width and a 95 channel width the letters f 10 f0 f10 are employed to distinguish 0 9 to 1 1 of the usgs flow observation similarly the letters t1 t2 t3 are named to represent 60 m 90 m and 120 m dem data respectively based on this description ct w5 f 10 t1 represents a model implementing triangular channel shape 5 low channel width 0 9 usgs flow and 60 m resolution dem in the tree structure a parent model is the model at a vertex of a level with respect to their child models exactly one level below for instance ct w5 f 10 is a parent model at the third level and its child models are ct w5 f 10 t1 ct w5 f 10 t2 ct w5 f 10 t3 respectively the uncertainty sources are listed in the order described in fig 3 for this study however this order is not critical as it can be changed without affecting the final ranking with respect to their contribution to the total prediction variances chitsazan and tsai 2015 bma is performed to average the child models to obtain their parent models at the current level the mean and variance of a predicted water stage for a bma model at level n are shown in eqs 8 and 9 8 e d m n k e d m k n 1 p r m k n 1 d m n v a r d m n k v a r d m k n 1 p r m k n 1 d m n 9 k e d m k n 1 e d m n 2 p r m k n 1 d m n where mn are the bma models at level n m k n 1 are the child models at level n 1 under their parent models and p r m k n 1 d m n is the conditional model probability of a model under their parent models mn the first term at the right hand side of eq 9 is the within model variance of a predicted water stage using model mn which is the mean prediction variance using the child models of mn the second term represents the between model variance of a predicted water stage that accounts for the spreading of mean predicted water stages by different m k n 1 models using eqs 8 and 9 the hbma provides insights into model averaging for analysts in order to evaluate all possible averaged predicted water stages and variances at different levels 3 3 3 conditional model probability and posterior model probability in probability theory conditional model probability is a measure of the chance of an event occurring given that another event has occurred in this context it is the probability conditional model weight of a child level model implementation under its parent level where some of the uncertainty sources have been determined levels equal and above the parent level to estimate the conditional model probability or conditional model weight p r m k n 1 d m n in the child level the posterior model probability at level n 1 needs to be calculated using eq 10 10 p r m n d k p r m k n 1 d 11 p r m k n 1 d m n p r m k n 1 d p r m n d eq 10 is a recursive equation the posterior model probability of models at level n can be obtained by summing the posterior model probabilities recursively from the base level to level n 1 using eq 10 then the conditional posterior model probability at level n 1 under a model at level n is computed using eq 11 3 3 4 prediction mean and variance of hierarchical model the mean predicted water stage at a given hierarchical level can be obtained by calculating the weighted mean predicted water stage of the models using eq 8 from a child model to its parent model therefore the mean predicted water stage at top level can be calculated recursively from base level level 4 to level 1 based on this description a four level bma tree can be described using eq 12 similarly the variance of a predicted water stage at a parent level can be estimated using the mean water stage predictions of its child levels and corresponding conditional model weights the variance of top level can be obtained by using eq 13 recursively from the base level to level 1 12 e d d e m 1 e m 2 e m 3 e m 4 e d d m 4 v a r d d e m 1 e m 2 e m 3 e m 4 v a r d d m 4 e m 1 e m 2 e m 3 var m 4 e d d m 4 13 e m 1 e m 2 var m 3 e d d m 3 e m 1 var m 2 e d d m 2 var m 1 e d d m 1 where e d d is the weighted mean water level emn is the expectation operator to average a quantity given by model mn v a r d d m 4 is the variance of a predicted water stage varmn is the variance operator to average a quantity given by models mn eq 13 includes five terms on its right side the first term shows the contribution of the within model variance of the base models to the total prediction variance in this study the within model variance of the base models stems from uncertainty in channel roughness the remaining four terms represent the between model variance specifically the second third fourth and fifth terms in eq 13 are the contributions of variances of the channel cross sectional shape channel width flow accuracy and topographical data resolution respectively 3 4 the impact of uncertainty sources on water stage prediction and prediction variance to evaluate the impact of each type of uncertainty source on the simulated water stage model perturbation approach is applied to the 243 predictions at the base 1 level of the bma tree first the 243 predictions are assigned into 81 groups and each group has three predictions which share the same implementations except for the one that is being evaluated for instance when channel cross section shape is being evaluated each group has three members that have the same channel width channel roughness flow magnitude and topography values but the channel cross section shapes are different next the difference between any two predictions are found and averaged for each group finally the averaged values from each group are averaged again among all 81 groups this process is expressed using eq 14 14 s 1 81 i 1 81 1 3 e d p e a k p 1 e d p e a k p 2 e d p e a k p 2 e d p e a k p 3 e d p e a k p 1 e d p e a k p 3 i where s is the value to evaluate the impact of one source on the predicted water stage e d p e a k p 1 is the one prediction in one group on the peak day and i is the group number the impact of each uncertainty source found here is based on the predictions from 243 model implementations however this rank excludes the weights of models when employing the bma approach for the prediction ensemble each model implementation gets its own weight therefore the rank of uncertainty sources may change accordingly in this case the relative influence of each uncertainty source can be reflected by the model prediction variance chitsazan and tsai 2015 eq 13 is used and the second to fifth terms represent the influence of channel cross sectional shape channel width flow forcing accuracy and topographical data resolution on model prediction variance respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 bma tree construction three bma trees including the bma tree of model weight conditional model weight the bma tree of mean water stage prediction and the bma tree of prediction variance at usgs 07069500 for peak flow are shown in figs 4 6 respectively fig 4 shows the bma tree of model weights in parentheses and conditional model weights on flood peak day april 26 2011 for the validation usgs station 07069500 the model weights reflect the comparative importance of all the competitive modelling predictions in one level whereas the conditional model weights represent the relative importance of different predictions under the same parent model for explanation purposes results at level 2 are shown as an example all the conditional model weights with parenthesis in level 2 add up to 1 and average width value obtains the highest weight 0 9373 it indicates that model implementing average width is better than implementing 5 or 95 width information regardless the choice of all other uncertainty sources when channel cross sectional shape is determined as rectangular all the model weights without parenthesis at level two right side branch add up to 1 implementing average width weight is 0 6848 behaves better than 5 low width weight is 0 3152 whereas the model weight of implementing 95 width is too small thus could be neglected represented as dot in fig 4 the base level in fig 4 corresponds to different topography resolutions fig 4 indicates that dem data with a 60 m resolution provides the best prediction comparatively a 90 m dem yields slightly poorer but acceptable results however when the topography resolution reduces to 120 m the prediction accuracy is seriously affected therefore in general a higher resolution topography dataset provides a better prediction but the prediction accuracy does not improve monotonically with resolution the third level corresponds to different flow forcing magnitudes since no major hydraulic structure is located in the study area the flow data are assumed to be natural in this study additionally other possible influences from agriculture or industry are neglected in the analysis it demonstrates that the original usgs flow record and a slightly higher flow magnitude 10 more than original usgs record usually provide better results on the contrary the model implemented with low flow forcing provides poorer results the second level is developed by averaging water stage predictions from their child bma models that use different flow values this shows that the average width value is most suitable for this validation station similarly at first level parabolic cross sectional shape proves to be the best fit for the model prediction at validation station usgs 07069500 this shows that the combination of average channel width and parabolic channel cross sectional shape are the closest channel geometry to the reality fig 5 shows the bma tree of mean water stage predictions during the flow peak 4 26 2011 the water level prediction in a parent level is calculated based on the predictions of its child level and their corresponding model weights from fig 4 this figure demonstrates the mean water stage predictions over the accumulation of sources of uncertainty along the bma tree at the base level the mean water stage predictions for peak flow range between 6 41 m and 8 41 m among different model implementations as the level goes up in the hierarchical structure the difference between the largest and smallest prediction becomes smaller this shows that integrating predictions on more levels using the bma approach will reduce the prediction difference among model implementations fig 6 shows the bma tree of prediction variance on flood peak day at usgs 07069500 a parent level prediction variance is calculated based on the child level water level predictions fig 4 and corresponding model weights fig 5 using eq 9 at the base level the prediction variances result from the hidden level base 1 level that reflects the change of model prediction caused by model parameters as levels go up the prediction variances at different branches seem to increase in general and it demonstrates the cumulative effect of variances from all lower levels when compared with fig 4 it indicates that better performing models higher weights do not necessarily have the lowest prediction variances 4 2 relative impact of individual uncertainty source fig 7 shows the relative impact of different uncertainty sources on the mean model prediction on peak flow 4 26 2011 this is achieved through the model perturbation approach when bma weights are not taken into consideration fig 7 shows that topography and channel width play more significant roles than flow forcing which has a relatively larger impact than the model parameter and cross sectional shape past studies saksena and merwade 2015 sanders 2007 have shown that the model prediction accuracy is sensitive to dem data resolution in most cases this study shows that specifying accurate channel width is also very important and it may have an even larger impact on model predictions than topographical data fig 7a and c especially in some cases due to the computational burden there is an upper limit for the resolution of topographical data that could be used in the flood inundation mapping finding and setting proper channel width for the model could significantly improve the credibility of the model output additionally as cross sectional areas are also affected by width implementing a smaller channel width reduces the amount of water transported through the cross section since only 10 uncertainty is considered in the flow data its relatively less impact compared with other factors is understandable moreover channel roughness value represented by letter p in figs 7 and 8 is selected from its common range 0 01 0 05 for the lisflood fp model and the model is not always very sensitive to it liu et al 2019 fig 8 shows the relative influence of different uncertainty sources on prediction variance when bma weights are taken into account in this case the relative impact is reflected by the model prediction variance chitsazan and tsai 2015 and this is different from the model perturbation method which has an underlying assumption that each model is treated equally results show that model inputs topography and flow forcing and model parameters have a larger influence on model prediction variance compared to the model structure channel cross sectional shape and channel width the impact of channel width on prediction variance is not as significant as its impact on model prediction as shown in fig 7 this is due to the fact that in most cases models of one unique width value obtain a much higher weight and the model prediction does not vary significantly after implementing this best width value on the contrary the impact of roughness parameter and flow are amplified since high weights are obtained by different values of these two sources and the variance of a predicted water stage caused by these two sources is large 4 3 model mean prediction accuracy in the hierarchical structure in order to evaluate model mean prediction at each level of the bma tree two branches including a high weight model branch and a relatively low weight model branch are evaluated predictions of the high weight model the low weight model and ensemble of other models weights are above 0 0001 are shown in fig 9 for four validation stations in general the high weight model branch tends to estimate both flow peaks and low flow accurately however the low weight model either misses to capture the peaks fig 9c and d or fails to represent low flow series accurately fig 9a and b to see a clear trend the mean model predictions are compared with observed water stage data for each level at usgs 07069500 as shown in figs 10 and 11 results show that r2 values generally increase from the base level up to the higher level the base level prediction of high weight model branch has a relatively better r2 however as level moves up eventually the hierarchical level merges both braches and reach the same final r2 additionally root mean square errors rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse between model simulations and observed water stages are also calculated at different levels the results presented in table 4 show a general trend that the model mean prediction is closer to the observation as levels go up for different validation stations this can be found with a decreasing rmse and increasing nse at higher level however the improvement is either insignificant or sometimes even negative for the high weight branch validation station a and b the improvement of rmse and nse is remarkable for the worst performing branch whereas it is not very significant for the best branch this is because bma prediction may not always outperform the best model similarly the change of r2 rmse and nse at all four validation stations presented in fig 12 and table 4 show a similar trend since models with better performance are trusted more than others in the bma process as the model integrating more uncertainty sources moving up in the hierarchy the mean prediction gets better 4 4 uncertainty associated with mean prediction at each level although the deterministic mean water stage predictions at each level of the bma tree are determined there exists uncertainty associated with them to evaluate this uncertainty 95 confidence intervals associated with the deterministic predictions at each level are calculated figs 13 and 14 display the 95 confidence intervals for mean water stage prediction at different levels for the high and low weight branches of usgs 07069500 the band widths awb represents average band width are calculated and it indicates that the uncertainty associated with mean prediction increases as the level goes up in the hierarchical structure the reliability values are estimated to represent the percentage of observations that fall within the 95 confidence interval although the model mean prediction performs better as the level moves up in the bma tree in general the uncertainty associated with the mean predictions becomes larger to make the the observed water level more likely to fall within the band although the reliability values of high weight branch do not continue improving after reaching a certain level 0 8934 reliability could be significantly improved for low weight branch fig 14 demonstrates that mean prediction of the low weight model deviates from the observation data at base level and the 95 confidence interval is very narrow which could not cover the observed water stage reliability is 0 however when the level moves up in the bma tree the band width could mask most of the observed water stage this demonstrates that the deterministic prediction at the hierarchical level and its uncertainty bounds are more trustworthy for decision makers 5 conclusion flood risk management and mitigation requires reliable predictions of a water stage and flood inundation extent a multi model combining approach such as bma provides robust flood predictions compared with a single model approach or ensemble mean liu and merwade 2018 besides robust prediction some knowledge related to the uncertainty sources and their contribution in the final prediction must also be available the bma approach evaluates the combinatory effects of uncertainty from multiple sources to provide a reliable deterministic prediction as well as the prediction distribution the hierarchical bayesian model averaging approach hbma used in this study extends the application of bma by explicitly considering different sources of uncertainty in the hierarchical structure bma tree for analysing model uncertainty and uncertainty propagation each uncertainty source is located at one level of the hierarchical structure and the three bma trees corresponding to model weight mean prediction and prediction variance are created respectively the bma procedure is conducted upwards from base level to the top level for each branch in the bma tree of mean prediction to compare model perturbation approach is also applied this method could provide information of influences of different uncertainty sources when a single model implantation is used or equal weights are assigned to the model ensemble the relative impact of different uncertainty sources on model prediction using model perturbation fig 7 and prediction variance under bma frame fig 8 are prioritized and compared respectively a high weight and a relative low weight branch in the bma tree are evaluated at each level to find out how model performances are changed and propagated along the hierarchical structure moreover the uncertainty associated with mean predictions at each level is also investigated 5 1 boarder implications of applying hbma to flood modelling field compared with bayesian model averaging bma approach which strengthens the concept of combination to study the uncertainty in a modelling system hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma on the contrary fortify the idea of separation to investigate the role of individual uncertainty sources in the modelling process systemically understanding the uncertainty of modelling results is particularly crucial for modellers and decision makers when a series of choices exist with respect to model structure model input and model parameters the regular way such as model perturbation approach shows the importance of individual uncertainty sources however when the flood modelling extends to a macro view simulation performed over larger domain or a micro view simulation executed over lower order rivers sparse geospatial information and complex terrain bring a series of unclear information uncertainty which hinders the prediction accuracy under such circumstances only understanding the importance and rank of an uncertainty source through model perturbation might not be enough in the absence of ground truth therefore it is feasible to get better model prediction if an approach can be applied only given a boarder range of values for unclear information hbma from this study proves that it could fit into this role to show the relative contribution of individual uncertainty sources on prediction variances findings from this study provides flood modellers an alternative way to face and deal with uncertainty or unclear information when implementing a model in data sparse region for instance channel width and cross sectional shape data are usually not available for most of the lower order rivers in the world as channel width and shape vary in space and time obtaining accurate information for these variables for flood modelling is cumbersome and costly ranges that capture the variability in shape and width can be used and the infeasible choices will be eliminated in the bma process 5 2 specific findings based on the black river watershed in this study four major rivers in black river watershed are investigated and model predictions from various implementations are compared with the observed water stage data at validation stations downstream particular conclusions could be drawn for this watershed in general for a single model implementation or model implementations that have the same weights in the ensemble channel width and topographical data resolution have the largest impact on the hydrodynamic model predictions these two sources are followed by flow forcing which has a relatively greater influence than channel cross sectional shape and model parameter this result is derived from a model perturbation approach when model weights are not taken into consideration however when dealing with the ensemble forecasting systems and multi model combing approach such as the bma model weights need to be considered in this situation the relative influence of different uncertainty sources could be reflected by model prediction variance results from this study indicate that model inputs topography and input forcing and model parameters roughness have a larger impact on prediction variance than model structure channel shape and width the bma trees of model weights conditional model weights evaluate the comparative predictions in one level in general a higher resolution topography data provides better prediction however the improvement may not be significant after the resolution improves to a certain level for the validation station usgs 07069500 implementing the average width value and parabolic cross sectional shape produces a much better prediction compared with other types of model setups this might be because these two features are best fitted for the real condition for the site although the model weights and conditional model weights could change when uncertainty sources are assigned differently e g the more detailed range of widths values are applied the best model implementation highest model weights for a particular stream will not change a relatively closer uncertainty implementation can still be found through the bma process the bma tree of mean water stage predictions provides an understanding of mean prediction variability over the accumulation of sources of uncertainty along the bma tree as the level goes up from base level towards the hierarchical level the difference between the largest and smallest predictions becomes smaller the bma tree of prediction variance demonstrates that those better performed models highest weights do not necessarily have the lowest prediction variances as the level moves up in the bma tree the accuracy of mean prediction also increases in general the r2 rmse and nse values of both high weight branch and low weight branch for a given validation station show improvement at a higher level the improvement is more significant for the worst branch whereas it may not be very remarkable for the best branch in many cases and eventually they will merge together in the hierarchical level this is because the bma approach weights and averages all the models to provide a relatively reliable prediction which may not always be better than the best model prediction the uncertainty associated with the mean predictions of a high weight model and a low weight model are investigated at each level the band widths of 95 confidence interval display an increasing trend as the level goes higher this indicates that although the mean prediction of the top level is more reliable than lower levels the uncertainty associated with it could be larger therefore an observed water stage is more likely to fall within this range 5 3 limitations for this study and future direction the evaluation of relative influence of different uncertainty sources is under pre defined ranges in spite of the ranges being set based on previous studies and available computational resources the way of assigning channel width information to include lower order rivers could help find better predictions although the same box cox transformation coefficient is applied to all the model predictions to adjust the skewness the transformed pdf remains bounded in a few modelling scenarios channel widths are more or less wider than the cell size which will have some influence on the simulation outcome the grid size could be upscaled to minimize the impact however this is excluded from this study since dem resolution is one uncertainty source considered regardless of the limitations findings from black river watershed provide useful information for flood modellers model perturbation result turns out that when implementing a single model or no model weights are considered in flood prediction process modellers should spare no efforts for getting better a quality dem and channel width data this will significantly improve the prediction outcome for modellers that use the bma method or other multi model combining approaches to derive a deterministic prediction from prediction ensemble they should pay more attention to the data quality for model input and parameters instead of model structure because the best fitted model can be obtained during the bma process in the future more watersheds located at different geographical locations can be investigated

6171,uncertainty in a hydrodynamic model originates from input data model structure and parameters in order to provide the robust model predictions the bayesian model averaging bma approach could be used as a multi model combining method to account for the compound effects from various uncertainty sources however bma cannot provide a clear picture of the impact from individual uncertainty sources hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma is a recently developed approach to study the relative impact of different uncertainty sources which explicitly considers various sources of uncertainty in the hierarchical structure bma tree for analysing uncertainty propagation in this study hbma is tested over the black river watershed in missouri and arkansas based on water stage predictions from 243 lisflood fp model configurations that integrate five sources of uncertainty including channel shape channel width channel roughness topography and flow forcing to compare the model perturbation approach is also applied in this study to investigate the influence of individual uncertainty sources on model prediction overall the results indicate that hbma provides an alternative way for flood modellers to deal with modelling uncertainty in data sparse region when multiple choices of uncertainty sources are considered findings from black river watershed point out that without considering the model weight model perturbation approach channel width and topographical data resolution have the largest impact on the hydrodynamic model predictions followed by flow forcing which has a relatively greater influence than channel cross sectional shape and model parameter however when model weights are taken into account hbma model input topography and flow forcing and model parameter have a larger impact on prediction variance than model structure channel width and cross sectional shape moreover as results move up the hierarchy along the bma tree the accuracy of deterministic mean prediction also increases in general whereas the 95 confidence interval associated with the deterministic mean prediction might become larger keywords hierarchical bayesian model averaging uncertainty lisflood fp flood prediction water stage 1 introduction floods are the most frequently occurring natural disasters that cause large amounts of property loss and damage around the world deniz et al 2017 wing et al 2018 appropriate flood risk management decisions are underpinned by reliable prediction of water stage and inundation extent by using a hydrodynamic model alfieri et al 2014 bates et al 2010 bermúdez et al 2017 dimitriadis et al 2016 hunter et al 2008 merwade et al 2008 neal et al 2012b pappenberger et al 2005 however regardless of whether a one dimensional 1d or a two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic model is selected for simulation a lot of uncertainty will always exist this uncertainty to a certain extent affects the quality of model predictions aronica et al 1998 duong and gourbesville 2016 liu et al 2014 merwade et al 2008 yin and tsai 2018 according to the concept of equifinality different model structures parameters and input boundary conditions may make the predictions achieve a similar level of fit to the observations to interpret this in another way one specific model implementation that works well for one flood event might not perform well for another since it may have reached equifinality as the best model implementation for the first flood event therefore the prediction based on a single model approach is subjected to significant bias if the model is not properly implemented alternatively a multi model combining approach is a more robust way to extract information from a group of existing model implementations to provide reliable predictions among the current existing multi model combining approaches such as simple model average weighted model average and multi model super ensemble ajami et al 2006 chowdhury and sharma 2009 liu et al 2018 najafi and moradkhani 2015 wood et al 2016 bayesian model averaging bma is one of the most common and widely used approaches to generate a reliable deterministic model prediction and its prediction distribution from a model ensemble based on model performances in the past madadgar and moradkhani 2014 morales et al 2006 notaro et al 2014 raftery et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 yan and moradkhani 2014 in the previous study liu and merwade 2018 the authors applied the bma approach to the black river water stage predictions by integrating four sources of uncertainty including channel width channel cross sectional shape channel roughness and flow forcing the bma method weights each model implementation based on its predictability over the past flood event and assigning the same weight in the forecasting mode the results indicate that the bma prediction outperforms most of the model members and ensemble mean when equal weight is considered for each model implementation although the bma method aggregates all plausible models to obtain one optimal prediction it only evaluates the combinatory effects from all uncertainty sources the role of an individual uncertainty source is still not altogether understood yen 2012 the uncertainty source that could significantly change the prediction outcome or prediction variance should be identified therefore following the previous research this study aims to separate and evaluate the relative importance of model structure model parameter and model input forcing on the final prediction and prediction variance in flood inundation modelling hamill 2001 provides a perturbation approach to study the impact of individual factors on model predictions in the perturbation approach one individual factor is added or modified each time to evaluate the change in the model prediction each model implementation is treated equally in the perturbation approach however in a multi model combining method such as bma models are weighted and poor predictions from some model implementations in the ensemble are eliminated therefore the impact of each uncertainty source when weights are considered is different from that found using a model perturbation approach and instead of model prediction model prediction variance is evaluated chitsazan and tsai 2015 the hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma approach considers both situations by separating and locating each uncertainty source on one level of a bma tree structure chitsazan and tsai 2014 chitsazan and tsai 2015 tsai and elshall 2013 on one hand the original predictions from all the different model implementations are the root of the bma tree which are located at a hidden level base 1 level discussed later and no weight has been counted a model perturbation method can be applied to evaluate the impact of each uncertainty source on a model prediction based on these original predictions on the other hand as levels move up along the hierarchical structure hbma also provides an insight into the impact of different uncertainty sources on prediction variance and how they propagate over the bma tree when weights are counted as flood forecasts from additional sources become available which then drive multiple hydrodynamic models to create an ensemble of flood inundation extents it becomes necessary to not only understand the overall uncertainty but the relative role of each uncertainty source in the final prediction such an understanding will help modellers to allocate resources in collecting data for better parameterization of the models accordingly the objectives of this study are to 1 prioritize the impact of different uncertainty sources on a hydrodynamic model prediction and its variance using model perturbation and the hbma approach 2 investigate how the model performance changes at different hierarchical levels in the bma tree and 3 quantify the uncertainty associated with the mean predictions at each hierarchical level and its propagation along the bma tree to the best of the authors acknowledge nothing in the existing literature applies hbma to the field of flood modelling as the multi model combining approach becomes increasingly popular findings from this study are expected to provide useful information to flood modellers and decision makers in understanding and reducing flood prediction uncertainty 2 study area and data the black river watershed located across the border of arkansas and missouri in the u s has a drainage area about 20 000 km2 this region has humid subtropical climate with hot and wet summers and slightly cool and dry winters extreme weather events such as thunderstorms and tornadoes frequently affect arkansas and missouri as a tornado alley passes through these two states as a result the black river watershed has experienced numerous flood events in the past additionally the black river watershed has four major rivers including black river current river eleven point river and spring river from the east to west and all these rivers drain south to the watershed outlet in arkansas these four major rivers encompasses distinct topographical and geomorphic settings as well as varying reach lengths and sinuosity therefore the black river watershed is selected to be the study area for this study the daily streamflow input to the hydraulic model and stage data for validation are obtained from the usgs gauging stations fig 1 and table 1 the topography and land use dataset are obtained in the form of national elevation dataset ned 90 m digital elevation model dem http ned usgs gov and national land cover dataset 2011 land use data nlcd http www mrlc gov nlcd2011 php respectively although the prediction accuracy improves by using a higher resolution dem 90 m resolution is used in this study to strike a balance between predication accuracy and computational demand for a large number of simulations needed for the uncertainty analysis additionally many large scale models use 90 m or coarser dem for flood modelling neal et al 2012a schumann et al 2013 a 30 m resolution dem is obtained and resampled to create 60 m and 120 m dems for the study area the channel width samples are obtained by digitizing bank lines and a series of cross sections along major rivers in the study area based on google maps the distance between banks at each cross sections was computed to produce the widths sample for each major river respectively the bankfull depth data are obtained from national oceanic and atmospheric administration s advanced hydrologic prediction service https water weather gov ahps by assuming that the minor flood stage provided by noaa corresponds approximately to the bankfull depth the bankfull depth between two stations along a river is computed through linear interpolation 3 methodology 3 1 hydraulic modelling considering the amount of effort in the model set up computational demand and results from past studies lisflood fp is selected to conduct hydraulic simulations in this study the latest subgrid version of lisflood fp is easy to implement for large scale flood simulations and it typically yields accurate predictions bates and de roo 2000 neal et al 2012a lisflood fp subgrid model is designed based on a two dimensional base model bates 2010 to include a subgrid scale representation of channelized flows the model predicts water depths and streamflow in each grid cell at each time step to capture the dynamic propagation of flood waves along the channel and over the floodplains by solving continuity and momentum equations aronica et al 2002 bates et al 2010 horritt and bates 2001 horritt and bates 2002 neal et al 2011 the input data for the lisflood fp model includes the dem flow forcing time series stream centreline and channel geometry information including average river width bankfull depth slope surface roughness and channel cross sectional shape merwade et al 2018 the floodplain roughness values used in this study are obtained by relating each land use category in the nlcd land use dataset to manning s n value kalyanapu et al 2010 a six month daily time step simulation from 01 2011 to 06 2011 is used for this research this period is selected based on a major historical flood event peak around 4 26 2011 in the study area and the availability of input data this simulation period includes the entire peak flow period and low flow periods before and after the event a total number of 243 lisflood fp model configurations described in the next section are created and simulated using high performance computing hpc resources at purdue university lisflood fp model needs proper warm up period to adjust its state to fit the entire stream network and model parameters after trial runs the first two months of each simulation are found to be sufficient for warm up period and the predictions in the warm up period are excluded to avoid unrealistic predictions in the bma analysis 3 2 uncertainty sources and model implementations uncertainty in an lisflood fp model comes from a variety of sources including model structure model parameter input forcing and boundary conditions among others demeritt et al 2007 merwade et al 2008 merz et al 2004 merz and thieken 2009 todini 2004 five common uncertainty sources including the cross sectional shape of the channel channel width channel roughness dem resolution and streamflow forcing are considered in this study although there are other uncertainty sources such as the configuration of hydraulic structures including bridges and culverts they are excluded due to the lack of detailed data at the stream network scale the uncertainty in streamflow estimates at the usgs gaging stations can be as high as 10 for stable natural channels harmel et al 2006 slade 2004 thus three streamflow estimates including 0 9q q and 1 1q are used similarly uncertainty in channel width is incorporated by picking 5 average and 95 from a distribution of channel widths for each of the major rivers respectively table 2 fig 2 the 5 and 95 quantile widths represent a general range of channel widths excluding the extreme values e g width 95 or width 5 the uncertainty in channel roughness manning s n value is selected from 0 01 to 0 05 this range is used based on previous studies to reflect the roughness conditions of most natural channels characterized from a clean straight channel to winding grassy and gravelled channel liu et al 2019 three different dem resolutions including 60 m 90 m and 120 m are used for topography data and these resolutions are selected to match the computational demand for the large number of simulations in the black river watershed the typical simulation time for 60 m 90 m and 120 m dem are approximately 43 h 1 8 day 28 h 1 2 day and 18 h 0 76 day respectively finally the uncertainty in cross sectional shape is incorporated by assuming three shapes namely triangular parabola and rectangle considering the aforementioned five uncertainty sources and three values for each source table 3 243 3 3 3 3 3 lisflood fp model configurations are created by using different combinations of these uncertainty sources table a1 to distinguish the model parameter uncertainty since change of model parameters are not considered as a new model the 243 lisflood fp model configurations are further reconstructed to 81 base models for the base level of the bma tree by only considering the change in model structure and model input each of these 81 base models has three within model configurations located at a hidden base 1 level by considering the uncertainty in channel roughness parameter chitsazan and tsai 2015 3 3 hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma 3 3 1 bayesian model averaging bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical approach to combine estimations from individual models and produce reliable prediction madadgar and moradkhani 2014 raftery et al 2005 bma approach has been widely applied in various fields in the literatures for example ajami et al 2007 used bma to confront different types of model uncertainty in surface water hydrology neuman 2003 used bma and maximum likelihood bayesian model averaging mlbma to subsurface flow and transport zhang et al 2016 used bma to reconstruct regional mean climate and yeung et al 2005 used bma to develop an improved multi class gene selection and classification tool using the bma the mean and variance of predicted water stage using the 243 model implementations can be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 1 e d m 1 m k k e d m k p r m k d v a r d m k k v a r d m k p r m k d 2 k e d m k e d m 1 m k 2 p r m k d in eq 1 e d m 1 m k is the mean of the predicted water stage d from the kth model implementations e d m k is the prediction from the kth model p r m k d is the posterior model probability of model mk and d is the observed water stage data in eq 2 v a r d m k is the variance of a predicted water stage using model mk the first term on the right side of eq 2 is the within model variance of the predicted water stage that averages model prediction variances the second term on the right side of eq 2 is the between model variance that accounts for the spreading of a mean predicted water stage by different models for non gaussian data a power transformation is needed to map the variables from their original space to the gaussian space this is because the functions of expectation maximization eqs 5 7 discussed later can only be used for variables whose conditional probability distribution function pdf is well described with a normal distribution the observed and simulated water stage data are normalized using the box cox power transformation box and cox 1964 osborne 2010 this method is used to transform the skewed data into normal distribution using eq 3 when the power λ is zero the natural logarithm is applied to the data different powers are tested and the best power that yields the closest normal distribution of transformed water stage data is found and applied the transformed water stage data is used to find the bma weights for each model member in order to estimate the model weight wk and standard deviation σ k in eq 5 on the basis of a training data set the log likelihood function eq 4 is maximized 3 f λ f λ 1 λ λ 0 ln f λ 0 4 l θ s t l o g k 1 k w k g k d s t m k s t where λ is the power that is used to transform the data to a normal distribution and the summation in eq 4 is over locations s and time t in the training data eq 4 is difficult to solve analytically or numerically vrugt and robinson 2007 zhu et al 2016 and thus an expectation maximization em algorithm is used to find out the maximum likelihood the em algorithm is iterative and alternates between two steps the e or expectation step and the m or maximization step by using a latent variable z in the e step z is estimated given the current estimates of the model weight wk and standard deviation σ k eq 5 5 z k s t j w k j 1 g d s t m k s t σ k j 1 i 1 k w i j 1 g d s t m i s t σ i j 1 where the superscript j refers to the jth iteration of the em algorithm and g d st m kst σ k j 1 is a normal density with mean mkst and standard deviation σ k j 1 in the mth step weight wk and standard deviation σ k are calculated with the current estimate of zkst eqs 6 and 7 6 w k j 1 n s t z k s t j 7 σ k 2 j s t z k s t j d s t m s t 2 s t z k s t j where n is the number of observations including distinct values of locations and time the e step and m step are iterated to convergence when the changes of weight variance latent variable z and log likelihood are smaller than a specified small tolerance 10 6 in this study the log likelihood is guaranteed to increase at each em iteration therefore finally it converges to a local maximum wu 1983 although bma is a robust method to integrate a series of model outputs for uncertainty analysis it cannot provide detailed information about the relative importance of each uncertainty source additionally the contribution of an individual source of uncertainty to the total prediction variance is not clear therefore the hierarchical bma method is applied to address these issues 3 3 2 hierarchical bayesian model averaging hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma uses a bma tree structure and the schematic of the bma tree structure developed by the five uncertainty sources in this study is shown in fig 3 each level in the bma tree represents one uncertainty source and contains competing model predictions from this source in a discrete form the 81 models at the base level are called the base models which are derived by averaging predictions from the hidden level all models above the base level are bma models that are developed by averaging the models one level below them in this study the letters ct cp cr are used to represent the triangular parabolic and rectangular channel shapes respectively the letters w5 wave w95 are applied to describe a 5 low channel width average channel width and a 95 channel width the letters f 10 f0 f10 are employed to distinguish 0 9 to 1 1 of the usgs flow observation similarly the letters t1 t2 t3 are named to represent 60 m 90 m and 120 m dem data respectively based on this description ct w5 f 10 t1 represents a model implementing triangular channel shape 5 low channel width 0 9 usgs flow and 60 m resolution dem in the tree structure a parent model is the model at a vertex of a level with respect to their child models exactly one level below for instance ct w5 f 10 is a parent model at the third level and its child models are ct w5 f 10 t1 ct w5 f 10 t2 ct w5 f 10 t3 respectively the uncertainty sources are listed in the order described in fig 3 for this study however this order is not critical as it can be changed without affecting the final ranking with respect to their contribution to the total prediction variances chitsazan and tsai 2015 bma is performed to average the child models to obtain their parent models at the current level the mean and variance of a predicted water stage for a bma model at level n are shown in eqs 8 and 9 8 e d m n k e d m k n 1 p r m k n 1 d m n v a r d m n k v a r d m k n 1 p r m k n 1 d m n 9 k e d m k n 1 e d m n 2 p r m k n 1 d m n where mn are the bma models at level n m k n 1 are the child models at level n 1 under their parent models and p r m k n 1 d m n is the conditional model probability of a model under their parent models mn the first term at the right hand side of eq 9 is the within model variance of a predicted water stage using model mn which is the mean prediction variance using the child models of mn the second term represents the between model variance of a predicted water stage that accounts for the spreading of mean predicted water stages by different m k n 1 models using eqs 8 and 9 the hbma provides insights into model averaging for analysts in order to evaluate all possible averaged predicted water stages and variances at different levels 3 3 3 conditional model probability and posterior model probability in probability theory conditional model probability is a measure of the chance of an event occurring given that another event has occurred in this context it is the probability conditional model weight of a child level model implementation under its parent level where some of the uncertainty sources have been determined levels equal and above the parent level to estimate the conditional model probability or conditional model weight p r m k n 1 d m n in the child level the posterior model probability at level n 1 needs to be calculated using eq 10 10 p r m n d k p r m k n 1 d 11 p r m k n 1 d m n p r m k n 1 d p r m n d eq 10 is a recursive equation the posterior model probability of models at level n can be obtained by summing the posterior model probabilities recursively from the base level to level n 1 using eq 10 then the conditional posterior model probability at level n 1 under a model at level n is computed using eq 11 3 3 4 prediction mean and variance of hierarchical model the mean predicted water stage at a given hierarchical level can be obtained by calculating the weighted mean predicted water stage of the models using eq 8 from a child model to its parent model therefore the mean predicted water stage at top level can be calculated recursively from base level level 4 to level 1 based on this description a four level bma tree can be described using eq 12 similarly the variance of a predicted water stage at a parent level can be estimated using the mean water stage predictions of its child levels and corresponding conditional model weights the variance of top level can be obtained by using eq 13 recursively from the base level to level 1 12 e d d e m 1 e m 2 e m 3 e m 4 e d d m 4 v a r d d e m 1 e m 2 e m 3 e m 4 v a r d d m 4 e m 1 e m 2 e m 3 var m 4 e d d m 4 13 e m 1 e m 2 var m 3 e d d m 3 e m 1 var m 2 e d d m 2 var m 1 e d d m 1 where e d d is the weighted mean water level emn is the expectation operator to average a quantity given by model mn v a r d d m 4 is the variance of a predicted water stage varmn is the variance operator to average a quantity given by models mn eq 13 includes five terms on its right side the first term shows the contribution of the within model variance of the base models to the total prediction variance in this study the within model variance of the base models stems from uncertainty in channel roughness the remaining four terms represent the between model variance specifically the second third fourth and fifth terms in eq 13 are the contributions of variances of the channel cross sectional shape channel width flow accuracy and topographical data resolution respectively 3 4 the impact of uncertainty sources on water stage prediction and prediction variance to evaluate the impact of each type of uncertainty source on the simulated water stage model perturbation approach is applied to the 243 predictions at the base 1 level of the bma tree first the 243 predictions are assigned into 81 groups and each group has three predictions which share the same implementations except for the one that is being evaluated for instance when channel cross section shape is being evaluated each group has three members that have the same channel width channel roughness flow magnitude and topography values but the channel cross section shapes are different next the difference between any two predictions are found and averaged for each group finally the averaged values from each group are averaged again among all 81 groups this process is expressed using eq 14 14 s 1 81 i 1 81 1 3 e d p e a k p 1 e d p e a k p 2 e d p e a k p 2 e d p e a k p 3 e d p e a k p 1 e d p e a k p 3 i where s is the value to evaluate the impact of one source on the predicted water stage e d p e a k p 1 is the one prediction in one group on the peak day and i is the group number the impact of each uncertainty source found here is based on the predictions from 243 model implementations however this rank excludes the weights of models when employing the bma approach for the prediction ensemble each model implementation gets its own weight therefore the rank of uncertainty sources may change accordingly in this case the relative influence of each uncertainty source can be reflected by the model prediction variance chitsazan and tsai 2015 eq 13 is used and the second to fifth terms represent the influence of channel cross sectional shape channel width flow forcing accuracy and topographical data resolution on model prediction variance respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 bma tree construction three bma trees including the bma tree of model weight conditional model weight the bma tree of mean water stage prediction and the bma tree of prediction variance at usgs 07069500 for peak flow are shown in figs 4 6 respectively fig 4 shows the bma tree of model weights in parentheses and conditional model weights on flood peak day april 26 2011 for the validation usgs station 07069500 the model weights reflect the comparative importance of all the competitive modelling predictions in one level whereas the conditional model weights represent the relative importance of different predictions under the same parent model for explanation purposes results at level 2 are shown as an example all the conditional model weights with parenthesis in level 2 add up to 1 and average width value obtains the highest weight 0 9373 it indicates that model implementing average width is better than implementing 5 or 95 width information regardless the choice of all other uncertainty sources when channel cross sectional shape is determined as rectangular all the model weights without parenthesis at level two right side branch add up to 1 implementing average width weight is 0 6848 behaves better than 5 low width weight is 0 3152 whereas the model weight of implementing 95 width is too small thus could be neglected represented as dot in fig 4 the base level in fig 4 corresponds to different topography resolutions fig 4 indicates that dem data with a 60 m resolution provides the best prediction comparatively a 90 m dem yields slightly poorer but acceptable results however when the topography resolution reduces to 120 m the prediction accuracy is seriously affected therefore in general a higher resolution topography dataset provides a better prediction but the prediction accuracy does not improve monotonically with resolution the third level corresponds to different flow forcing magnitudes since no major hydraulic structure is located in the study area the flow data are assumed to be natural in this study additionally other possible influences from agriculture or industry are neglected in the analysis it demonstrates that the original usgs flow record and a slightly higher flow magnitude 10 more than original usgs record usually provide better results on the contrary the model implemented with low flow forcing provides poorer results the second level is developed by averaging water stage predictions from their child bma models that use different flow values this shows that the average width value is most suitable for this validation station similarly at first level parabolic cross sectional shape proves to be the best fit for the model prediction at validation station usgs 07069500 this shows that the combination of average channel width and parabolic channel cross sectional shape are the closest channel geometry to the reality fig 5 shows the bma tree of mean water stage predictions during the flow peak 4 26 2011 the water level prediction in a parent level is calculated based on the predictions of its child level and their corresponding model weights from fig 4 this figure demonstrates the mean water stage predictions over the accumulation of sources of uncertainty along the bma tree at the base level the mean water stage predictions for peak flow range between 6 41 m and 8 41 m among different model implementations as the level goes up in the hierarchical structure the difference between the largest and smallest prediction becomes smaller this shows that integrating predictions on more levels using the bma approach will reduce the prediction difference among model implementations fig 6 shows the bma tree of prediction variance on flood peak day at usgs 07069500 a parent level prediction variance is calculated based on the child level water level predictions fig 4 and corresponding model weights fig 5 using eq 9 at the base level the prediction variances result from the hidden level base 1 level that reflects the change of model prediction caused by model parameters as levels go up the prediction variances at different branches seem to increase in general and it demonstrates the cumulative effect of variances from all lower levels when compared with fig 4 it indicates that better performing models higher weights do not necessarily have the lowest prediction variances 4 2 relative impact of individual uncertainty source fig 7 shows the relative impact of different uncertainty sources on the mean model prediction on peak flow 4 26 2011 this is achieved through the model perturbation approach when bma weights are not taken into consideration fig 7 shows that topography and channel width play more significant roles than flow forcing which has a relatively larger impact than the model parameter and cross sectional shape past studies saksena and merwade 2015 sanders 2007 have shown that the model prediction accuracy is sensitive to dem data resolution in most cases this study shows that specifying accurate channel width is also very important and it may have an even larger impact on model predictions than topographical data fig 7a and c especially in some cases due to the computational burden there is an upper limit for the resolution of topographical data that could be used in the flood inundation mapping finding and setting proper channel width for the model could significantly improve the credibility of the model output additionally as cross sectional areas are also affected by width implementing a smaller channel width reduces the amount of water transported through the cross section since only 10 uncertainty is considered in the flow data its relatively less impact compared with other factors is understandable moreover channel roughness value represented by letter p in figs 7 and 8 is selected from its common range 0 01 0 05 for the lisflood fp model and the model is not always very sensitive to it liu et al 2019 fig 8 shows the relative influence of different uncertainty sources on prediction variance when bma weights are taken into account in this case the relative impact is reflected by the model prediction variance chitsazan and tsai 2015 and this is different from the model perturbation method which has an underlying assumption that each model is treated equally results show that model inputs topography and flow forcing and model parameters have a larger influence on model prediction variance compared to the model structure channel cross sectional shape and channel width the impact of channel width on prediction variance is not as significant as its impact on model prediction as shown in fig 7 this is due to the fact that in most cases models of one unique width value obtain a much higher weight and the model prediction does not vary significantly after implementing this best width value on the contrary the impact of roughness parameter and flow are amplified since high weights are obtained by different values of these two sources and the variance of a predicted water stage caused by these two sources is large 4 3 model mean prediction accuracy in the hierarchical structure in order to evaluate model mean prediction at each level of the bma tree two branches including a high weight model branch and a relatively low weight model branch are evaluated predictions of the high weight model the low weight model and ensemble of other models weights are above 0 0001 are shown in fig 9 for four validation stations in general the high weight model branch tends to estimate both flow peaks and low flow accurately however the low weight model either misses to capture the peaks fig 9c and d or fails to represent low flow series accurately fig 9a and b to see a clear trend the mean model predictions are compared with observed water stage data for each level at usgs 07069500 as shown in figs 10 and 11 results show that r2 values generally increase from the base level up to the higher level the base level prediction of high weight model branch has a relatively better r2 however as level moves up eventually the hierarchical level merges both braches and reach the same final r2 additionally root mean square errors rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse between model simulations and observed water stages are also calculated at different levels the results presented in table 4 show a general trend that the model mean prediction is closer to the observation as levels go up for different validation stations this can be found with a decreasing rmse and increasing nse at higher level however the improvement is either insignificant or sometimes even negative for the high weight branch validation station a and b the improvement of rmse and nse is remarkable for the worst performing branch whereas it is not very significant for the best branch this is because bma prediction may not always outperform the best model similarly the change of r2 rmse and nse at all four validation stations presented in fig 12 and table 4 show a similar trend since models with better performance are trusted more than others in the bma process as the model integrating more uncertainty sources moving up in the hierarchy the mean prediction gets better 4 4 uncertainty associated with mean prediction at each level although the deterministic mean water stage predictions at each level of the bma tree are determined there exists uncertainty associated with them to evaluate this uncertainty 95 confidence intervals associated with the deterministic predictions at each level are calculated figs 13 and 14 display the 95 confidence intervals for mean water stage prediction at different levels for the high and low weight branches of usgs 07069500 the band widths awb represents average band width are calculated and it indicates that the uncertainty associated with mean prediction increases as the level goes up in the hierarchical structure the reliability values are estimated to represent the percentage of observations that fall within the 95 confidence interval although the model mean prediction performs better as the level moves up in the bma tree in general the uncertainty associated with the mean predictions becomes larger to make the the observed water level more likely to fall within the band although the reliability values of high weight branch do not continue improving after reaching a certain level 0 8934 reliability could be significantly improved for low weight branch fig 14 demonstrates that mean prediction of the low weight model deviates from the observation data at base level and the 95 confidence interval is very narrow which could not cover the observed water stage reliability is 0 however when the level moves up in the bma tree the band width could mask most of the observed water stage this demonstrates that the deterministic prediction at the hierarchical level and its uncertainty bounds are more trustworthy for decision makers 5 conclusion flood risk management and mitigation requires reliable predictions of a water stage and flood inundation extent a multi model combining approach such as bma provides robust flood predictions compared with a single model approach or ensemble mean liu and merwade 2018 besides robust prediction some knowledge related to the uncertainty sources and their contribution in the final prediction must also be available the bma approach evaluates the combinatory effects of uncertainty from multiple sources to provide a reliable deterministic prediction as well as the prediction distribution the hierarchical bayesian model averaging approach hbma used in this study extends the application of bma by explicitly considering different sources of uncertainty in the hierarchical structure bma tree for analysing model uncertainty and uncertainty propagation each uncertainty source is located at one level of the hierarchical structure and the three bma trees corresponding to model weight mean prediction and prediction variance are created respectively the bma procedure is conducted upwards from base level to the top level for each branch in the bma tree of mean prediction to compare model perturbation approach is also applied this method could provide information of influences of different uncertainty sources when a single model implantation is used or equal weights are assigned to the model ensemble the relative impact of different uncertainty sources on model prediction using model perturbation fig 7 and prediction variance under bma frame fig 8 are prioritized and compared respectively a high weight and a relative low weight branch in the bma tree are evaluated at each level to find out how model performances are changed and propagated along the hierarchical structure moreover the uncertainty associated with mean predictions at each level is also investigated 5 1 boarder implications of applying hbma to flood modelling field compared with bayesian model averaging bma approach which strengthens the concept of combination to study the uncertainty in a modelling system hierarchical bayesian model averaging hbma on the contrary fortify the idea of separation to investigate the role of individual uncertainty sources in the modelling process systemically understanding the uncertainty of modelling results is particularly crucial for modellers and decision makers when a series of choices exist with respect to model structure model input and model parameters the regular way such as model perturbation approach shows the importance of individual uncertainty sources however when the flood modelling extends to a macro view simulation performed over larger domain or a micro view simulation executed over lower order rivers sparse geospatial information and complex terrain bring a series of unclear information uncertainty which hinders the prediction accuracy under such circumstances only understanding the importance and rank of an uncertainty source through model perturbation might not be enough in the absence of ground truth therefore it is feasible to get better model prediction if an approach can be applied only given a boarder range of values for unclear information hbma from this study proves that it could fit into this role to show the relative contribution of individual uncertainty sources on prediction variances findings from this study provides flood modellers an alternative way to face and deal with uncertainty or unclear information when implementing a model in data sparse region for instance channel width and cross sectional shape data are usually not available for most of the lower order rivers in the world as channel width and shape vary in space and time obtaining accurate information for these variables for flood modelling is cumbersome and costly ranges that capture the variability in shape and width can be used and the infeasible choices will be eliminated in the bma process 5 2 specific findings based on the black river watershed in this study four major rivers in black river watershed are investigated and model predictions from various implementations are compared with the observed water stage data at validation stations downstream particular conclusions could be drawn for this watershed in general for a single model implementation or model implementations that have the same weights in the ensemble channel width and topographical data resolution have the largest impact on the hydrodynamic model predictions these two sources are followed by flow forcing which has a relatively greater influence than channel cross sectional shape and model parameter this result is derived from a model perturbation approach when model weights are not taken into consideration however when dealing with the ensemble forecasting systems and multi model combing approach such as the bma model weights need to be considered in this situation the relative influence of different uncertainty sources could be reflected by model prediction variance results from this study indicate that model inputs topography and input forcing and model parameters roughness have a larger impact on prediction variance than model structure channel shape and width the bma trees of model weights conditional model weights evaluate the comparative predictions in one level in general a higher resolution topography data provides better prediction however the improvement may not be significant after the resolution improves to a certain level for the validation station usgs 07069500 implementing the average width value and parabolic cross sectional shape produces a much better prediction compared with other types of model setups this might be because these two features are best fitted for the real condition for the site although the model weights and conditional model weights could change when uncertainty sources are assigned differently e g the more detailed range of widths values are applied the best model implementation highest model weights for a particular stream will not change a relatively closer uncertainty implementation can still be found through the bma process the bma tree of mean water stage predictions provides an understanding of mean prediction variability over the accumulation of sources of uncertainty along the bma tree as the level goes up from base level towards the hierarchical level the difference between the largest and smallest predictions becomes smaller the bma tree of prediction variance demonstrates that those better performed models highest weights do not necessarily have the lowest prediction variances as the level moves up in the bma tree the accuracy of mean prediction also increases in general the r2 rmse and nse values of both high weight branch and low weight branch for a given validation station show improvement at a higher level the improvement is more significant for the worst branch whereas it may not be very remarkable for the best branch in many cases and eventually they will merge together in the hierarchical level this is because the bma approach weights and averages all the models to provide a relatively reliable prediction which may not always be better than the best model prediction the uncertainty associated with the mean predictions of a high weight model and a low weight model are investigated at each level the band widths of 95 confidence interval display an increasing trend as the level goes higher this indicates that although the mean prediction of the top level is more reliable than lower levels the uncertainty associated with it could be larger therefore an observed water stage is more likely to fall within this range 5 3 limitations for this study and future direction the evaluation of relative influence of different uncertainty sources is under pre defined ranges in spite of the ranges being set based on previous studies and available computational resources the way of assigning channel width information to include lower order rivers could help find better predictions although the same box cox transformation coefficient is applied to all the model predictions to adjust the skewness the transformed pdf remains bounded in a few modelling scenarios channel widths are more or less wider than the cell size which will have some influence on the simulation outcome the grid size could be upscaled to minimize the impact however this is excluded from this study since dem resolution is one uncertainty source considered regardless of the limitations findings from black river watershed provide useful information for flood modellers model perturbation result turns out that when implementing a single model or no model weights are considered in flood prediction process modellers should spare no efforts for getting better a quality dem and channel width data this will significantly improve the prediction outcome for modellers that use the bma method or other multi model combining approaches to derive a deterministic prediction from prediction ensemble they should pay more attention to the data quality for model input and parameters instead of model structure because the best fitted model can be obtained during the bma process in the future more watersheds located at different geographical locations can be investigated

al 2011 senay et al 2013 xia et al 2015b however ec systems suffer from the energy imbalance problem which may cause errors in et measurements wilson et al 2002 xu et al 2017 the spatial scale mismatch between ec observations and model estimates point vs grid cell is another problem in et evaluation liu et al 2016 moreover ec sites are sparsely distributed over spaces that are hard to assess et products over a regional scale the water balance method derived et wbet is used for long term et evaluation over basin scale long et al 2014 senay et al 2011 velpuri et al 2013 xia et al

balance method within a river basin as 1 wbet i p i r i t w s c i where wbet represents water balance method derived et p r and twsc are precipitation runoff and total water storage change respectively i denotes the specific epoch the wbet has been used as the reference to validate modeled et at multi year scale senay et al 2011 velpuri et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 twsc should be considered when the data time span is under 10 years especially for monthly et evaluation the regional twsc data can be calculated via numerical differentiation using the centered operator as 2 twsc i twsa i 1 t w s a i 1 2 δ i where twsa is the total water storage anomaly which can be derived from grace data the twsc can be neglected when the data time span is larger than 10 years thus eq 1 can be reduced to wbet i p i r i 3 2 uncertainty quantification method the tch method tavella and premoli 1994 was employed to estimate uncertainties of 12 types of et products without any prior knowledge the theory of the tch is similar to the triple collocation tc approach stoffelen 1998 but the tc method can only be used to calculate uncertainties of three uncorrelated variables while the tch can deal with data with correlations if properly constrained tavella and premoli 1994 the details of the tch method is described as follows the time series of the evaluated products are expressed as x i i 1 2 n the subscript i denotes i th et product and n is a total number of products x i is comprised by true value x t and the error term ε i 3 x i x t ε i i 1 2 3 n to obtain the error term ε i we must know the true value first x t that is difficult to get in reality tch algorithm solved this problem by the following means first the differences between n 1 products and one reference product x r chosen arbitrarily of x i are defined as 4 y i m x i x r ε i ε r i 1 2 n 1 where y is an m n 1 matrix and m is the time samples the covariance matrix of y can be represented by s cov y the unknown n n covariance matrix of the individual noise q is related to s as 5 s j r j t where j is n 1 n matrix that can be represent as 6 j n 1 n 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 however eq 5 cannot be solved as the number of an unknown element is larger than a number of equations the remaining elements require a reasonable way to obtain the unique value galindo and palacio 1999 proposed the constrained minimization problem using the kuhn tucker theorem whose objective function is given below 7 f q 1 n q nn 1 k 2 i j n q ij 2 and its constraint function is as follows 8 h q 1 n q nn q s k 0 where q in q nn are the elements of q and k det s n 1 torcaso et al 1998 set initial conditions for the iteration as 9 q in 0 0 i n q nn 0 1 2 s s 1 1 s 1 1 1 t finally q is obtained by minimizing the objective function combined with eq 6 the square root of the q diagonal values q ii i 1 2 n were considered to be the uncertainty of evaluated et the ratio of the uncertainty to the time series mean value is the relative uncertainty 4 results 4 1 et validation with flux tower observations the accuracies of all et products compared to flux tower observations are shown in fig 2 since gfet dataset were generated by upscaling fluxnet et observations gfet were not compared with flux tower observations in this section over three vegetation types the root mean square difference rmsd are 18 52 mm month 24 52 mm month 26 25 mm month and 29 01 mm month for rsms nldas 2 and nldas 3 et products respectively all et products are closed to observations in the dbf with the rmsd of 21 62 mm month whereas there are larger differences over enf and cropland the noah28 vic412 and ssebop have smaller rmsd than other products over dbf and cropland for lsms noah28 has lowest rmsd 22 33 mm month while clsm25 and noahmp36 have largest rmsd of 32 51 mm month and 32 02 mm month over three vegetation types respectively vic412 reduced rmsd of 5 62 mm month compared to vic403 over three vegetation types one should be very cautious to take this validation messages as very limited site measurements are used as energy imbalance is corrected for more sites with long term observations a re validation is needed in future six year averaged 2001 2006 seasonal cycles of 12 et products over three vegetation types i e dbf enf and cropland are shown in fig 3 the et flux tower observations are also drawn as a reference generally the retrieved et from all models is comparable in seasonal evolution and in magnitude the ssebop catches et seasonal variations well over three vegetation types the gleam describes the seasonal trend well over dbf and cropland the mod16 et is much lower than observations over cropland nldas 2 noah28 and sac capture the et seasonal variations better than vic403 and mosaic in spite of sac s failure to capture the et variations in growing season over the dbf vic403 and mosaic fail to capture the seasonal trend for june and july over enf and cropland for nldas 3 the peak et value of noahmp36 is one month ahead of the observations in the growing season june and july over enf and cropland vic412 from nldas 3 performs slightly better than vic403 from nldas 2 4 2 et validation with water balance method the wbet was used as the reference to quantify the accuracy of each et products at the basin scale since the twsc is usually neglected for more than 10 years the time span of this study is 12 2000 2011 and 30 years 1982 2011 respectively over a long period more than 10 years the wbet was calculated using precipitation and runoff in each basin fig 4 depicts the comparisons of all et products with wbet over 12 basins in conus as indicated the results of the 12 year left study are consistent with the results from the 30 year right study with small differences and all evaluated et products agree well with the wbet datasets for the 12 year comparisons noah28 et has the smallest highest rmsd correlation coefficient r of 27 32 mm year 0 99 while clsm25 et gives the largest lowest rmsd r of 140 79 mm year 0 83 the mean rmsd r are 50 48 mm year 0 98 70 76 mm year 0 93 70 85 mm year 0 96 and 88 99 mm year 0 91 for gfet rsms nldas 2 and nldas 3 et products respectively for rsm et products gleam is closest to the wbet with the rmsd r of 67 29 mm year 0 94 whereas mod16 is relatively farthest to the wbet with the rmsd r of 93 80 mm year 0 89 for nldas 2 et datasets noah28 performs slightly better than other models with rmsd r of 27 32 mm year 0 99 for nldas 3 et datasets vic412 performs best with the lowest rmsd r of 42 78 mm year 0 99 4 3 uncertainty quantification of et products over basin scale the tch method was employed to quantify uncertainties of monthly et products over basin scale table 3 shows the uncertainties of monthly et products in 12 basins over conus overall the uncertainties in et products range from 2 mm month to 20 mm month with tch method the et uncertainties are lowest in nldas 3 and gfet 4 7 mm month moderate in nldas 2 7 8 mm month and highest in rsms 10 15 mm month except gleam the noah36 et product has the lowest uncertainty 4 02 mm month while ssebop et product has the highest uncertainty 13 24 mm month the uncertainty of et from gfet 4 37 mm month and gleam 6 44 mm month are comparable with those from nldas 3 the noah36 gfet vic412 noahmp36 and gleam are the five best products with the lowest et uncertainty et uncertainties in wet basins are relatively larger than those in dry basins due to larger et magnitude over wet areas as shown in table 3 noah36 noahmp36 reduced 47 19 et uncertainty compared to noah28 vic412 reduced 19 et uncertainty compared to vic403 clsm25 reduced 19 et uncertainty compared to mosaic the relative uncertainty is the ratio of uncertainty to mean et value which can describe the model skill neglecting the et magnitude to further evaluate the seasonal variations of et uncertainty the relative uncertainties in 12 et products are shown in fig 5 generally most models perform better in relatively warm months from march to october than cold months from november to february the most likely reason for this is fair sublimation over the snow for lsms particularly ssebop et has larger relative uncertainties in the cold months overall 12 basins as ssebop et is calculated from land surface temperature lst the effect of snow on satellite retrieved lst leads to large lst errors which further results in large et errors mod16 shows poor performance in spring march april and may and summer june july and august at the two driest basins i e cb and cn at the cn basin some et products gleam vic403 vic412 clsm25 and noahmp36 have slightly higher relative uncertainties in summer gleam shows poor performance in the coldest months november december and january at the north basins i e nw mb nc ma oh and ne which is most likely due to fair sublimation and frozen soil process simulations noah28 demonstrated the higher relative uncertainties over north basins i e nw mb nc ma and ne in winter and simultaneously have slightly higher relative uncertainties in the spring and the first month of summer in ne nw and ma due to this a large aerodynamic coefficient constraint is used to limit sublimation over snow for stable boundary case as large sublimation was found for noah model in polar region slater et al 2007 and western mountainous region livneh et al 2010 however there are many stable boundary cases even when snow does not exist this constraint results in too small et in cold season and large runoff simulations xia et al 2015b noahmp36 have large relative uncertainties in winter at north basins i e nw mb nc ma oh and ne due to fair sublimation simulation in the north regions of conus or during cold time periods lsms have different simulation skills for snow sublimation process as snowpack simulation remains a challenge for land surface model development community and model grid become heterogeneous when snow begins to melt as the model output is average weighted by snow cover and snow free fraction at coarse spatial resolution in the early spring late autumn periods as the vegetation grows fast deciduous gradually there is large uncertainty in greenness vegetation fraction and lai simulated from naohmp36 as land surface becomes heterologous 4 4 et interannual variability and the impact of drought on et interannual variability of et and its anomaly has been widely used to monitor climate extremes such as drought long et al 2017 henn et al 2018 on the other hand drought monitoring ability of et is another kind of method to evaluate et products this section will show how et products respond to meteorological drought over 12 basins and texas the meteorological drought is described by negative precipitation anomaly soorensson and ruscica 2018 fig 6 show et and p anomaly over 12 basins from 2000 to 2011 the basins are listed from dry to wet according to the climate index p pet as shown in fig 6 the et anomaly trend agrees well with p anomaly the et anomaly increases with the increase in p anomaly and vice versa et has a sharp increase in wet years 2005 due to positive precipitation anomaly over relative dry basins e g cb cn and wg while the annual et varies smoothly over relative wet basins e g ne lm and oh since water and energy are the two main factors influencing et variations et is mainly controlled by precipitation under water limited conditions while energy factors in well watered area mainly control it the negative et anomaly does not correspond to negative p anomaly drought well over annual scale that s because the precipitation deficit means meteorological drought while et decrease is more indicative of agricultural drought decrease in surface and root zone soil moisture van loon 2015 however years of persistent meteorological drought e g cn basin during 2006 2009 and exceptional drought e g wg basin in 2011 will lead to negative et anomaly texas experienced the most extreme one year drought on record in 2011 with precipitation at 40 of long term mean long et al 2013 have detected the texas exceptional drought by using total water storage from grace satellite data and soil moisture from land surface models the seasonal relative anomaly of et and p fig 7 are also used in this study to check whether it can seize texas exceptional drought in 2011 as indicated in fig 7 most of the et products can detect the texas exceptional drought in 2011 due to large deficit of precipitation et and p anomaly corresponds well with each other during 2000 2011 over seasonal scale especially the positive et and p anomaly in autumn of each year moreover fig 7 indicates a negative et anomaly in spring and summer and positive et anomaly in autumn of 2000 2010 while et and p anomaly last for whole year in 2011 which lead to the texas exceptional drought 4 5 spatial distribution of et relative uncertainties over conus fig 8 shows relative uncertainties of et products grid by grid over conus the rfc basin mask land cover classification map and digital elevation are also shown in fig 8 generally all et products especially mod16 and ssebop have lower relative uncertainties in the east than in west of conus which may be caused by complex terrain in west mountain areas fig 8d moreover models tend to generate larger et uncertainties over bare land areas in southwest conus due to low et magnitude larger et uncertainties over the north area are also found in some models e g noah28 vic403 and vic412 caused by errors in the model simulating outputs for snow melting fields the gfet and noah36 perform well over whole conus with low et uncertainty for rsm et products gleam outperforms the other two remote sensing et products mod16 and ssebop with lower uncertainties over whole conus mod16 and ssebop underperform in high elevation area of the west meanwhile mod16 also have lower skill score in the cropland areas as the p m algorithm is developed for short canopies khan et al 2018 mu et al 2007 for nldas 2 et products the mosaic noah28 and sac have lower et uncertainties than those from vic403 noah28 has high uncertainty over northeast regions ma and ne basin which is similar to results in table 3 for nldas 3 et products the clsm25 and noah36 outperform vic412 and noahmp36 clsm25 reduced the et uncertainty compared to mosaic especially in mid conus noah36 and noahmp36 are both used in the nldas 3 however et uncertainty is higher in noahmp36 than that of noah36 the et products from nldas 3 has slightly lower uncertainties than those from nldas 2 it is because nldas 3 advanced nldas 2 by using upgraded vic noah model and replaced mosaic with clsm25 which includes a groundwater module xia et al 2017 for example noah36 vic412 improves simulation skill in the cold regions of the northeast southeast of conus compared with the noah28 vic403 fig 9 shows spatial distribution of lowest et uncertainties in nldas 2 nldas 3 and all 12 et products grid by grid from 2000 to 2011 as indicated in fig 9a for nldas 2 noah28 occupied the largest percentage of girds 56 59 over conus while mosaic has the smallest percentage of grids 6 12 the grid percentage of vic403 and sac are 20 49 and 16 80 respectively noah28 performs best over middle and south areas vic403 has the lowest uncertainty over northeast areas and sac performs well over middle and north areas of conus fig 9b indicated that for nldas 3 noah36 performs best with 46 22 of grids over conus while vic412 clsm25 and noahmp36 occupy 17 56 23 58 and 12 64 of grids respectively as shown in fig 9 noah36 performs best over northeast and west areas clsm25 is located in middle and north areas vic412 chiefly situates in the central plains and noahmp36 performs best over west mountain areas of conus fig 9c shows 4 et products with the lowest uncertainties in 12 et products in fig 9c noah28 performs best over 37 21 of grids over conus while noah36 gfet and gleam occupy 27 85 25 02 and 9 91 of grids respectively noah28 performs well over middle and west areas vic412 gives lowest et uncertainties in northeast and middle areas and gfet provides high accuracy over northern areas of conus 5 discussions this study evaluated 12 et products over conus with ec observations wbet and tch method the differences between 12 et products and reference dataset were caused by errors in et products and uncertainties in reference data and the evaluation method these issues are discussed in detail in this section 5 1 errors in et products models were developed to simulate reality which is a simplification of the real world consequently distinct model structures lead to various uncertainties in the simulation the 12 evaluated et products from models were constructed with distinct schemes such as machine learning method surface energy balance method and sophisticated models among others the machine learning model i e gfet and most sophisticated models i e gleam nldas 2 and nldas 3 outperformed 2 energy balance models i e mod16 and ssebop for et estimation gfet makes full use of fluxnet observations around the world to produce more reliable global et products lsms in nldas 2 and nldas 3 are sophisticated models that have higher et simulation skill than relatively simple rsms gleam model have independent soil module which is combined with the data assimilation system to obtain high quality soil moisture that can produce more stable and accurate et furthermore water energy and vegetation factor are essential for accurate estimation of regional et the lack of enough information about these factors will affect the accuracy of et simulation table 4 summarizes the main inputs of all et models in this study as indicated in table 4 mod16 and ssebop et products lack direct water availability inputs e g precipitation and soil moisture lsms do not have irrigation information over cropland gleam and sac model lack vegetation related information since mod16 did not include soil moisture or precipitation as model inputs they used vapor pressure deficit vpd as water stress input mu et al 2011 however vpd would be overestimated when the soil water content is high which results in the underestimated soil evaporation and canopy transpiration hu et al 2015 et models can capture soil wetness variances with vegetation index lst or soil moisture in most rsms multiple source of data e g lai and lst are used to reduce the uncertainty increases in et could be reflected corresponding to relatively higher vegetation index lower lst and higher soil moisture for irrigated areas than non irrigated areas long et al 2014 however lsms lack the irrigation information and lead to underestimating et over cropland for example lsms in nldas 2 and nldas 3 underperformed ssebop over cropland fig 2 gleam lacks inputs of vegetation growth information that may result in lower accuracy compared with gfet and other rsms at point scale the sac model lacks vegetation factor to derive et inter annual variation and fails to capture the et inter annual variation well the model input dataset errors and scale mismatch between inputs and outputs affect the accuracy of et products the input dataset including meteorological and land surface variables that can be divided into water energy vegetation and other factors table 4 the slightly higher relative uncertainties of nldas models in high altitude areas of the western conus could be attributed to its precipitation input which presents large negative biases pan et al 2003 xia et al 2015b errors in lst satellite data is one of the main reasons why ssebop and mod16 underperformed in the mountain regions fig 8 lst has low accuracy in the mountains caused by cloud sky senay et al 2013 moreover the mountains affect the shortwave radiation observations which leads to higher uncertainties in mod16 et over mountain areas hofste 2014 furthermore coarse spatial resolution 1 1 25 meteorological inputs in mod16 et products deteriorate the effects of elevation the accuracy of lai dataset is affected by the leaf shadowing mehrez et al 1992 especially for tall and dense forests besides shaded leaves are not light saturated which would result in diffuse sunlight conditions and then lead to having a higher fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar in the shaded leaves areas he et al 2013 jenkins et al 2007 errors in lai may lead to lsms failing to capture the season cycle well over enf model calibration has a significant impact on the accuracy of et simulation take nldas 2 as an example noah28 has been calibrated with arm cart et and streamflow observations wei et al 2013 sac and vic403 model were calibrated with the annual streamflow observation troy et al 2008 however mosaic has not been calibrated with any of these dataset mitchell et al 2004 this model calibration is consistent with the evaluation result in this study wherein noah28 have the best performance and it is followed by vic403 sac and mosaic fig 8 the gfet model was trained by fluxnet observations which show the good performance at any spatial temporal scale 5 2 uncertainties in reference dataset and evaluation method the ec observed et has been usually used as reference data to evaluate modeled et however the limitations for et validation can t be ignored including 1 spatial scale mismatch the spatial representativeness of et measurements from ec systems is about 100 m liu et al 2011 2018 while the size of computational pixels is mostly larger than 10 km in most regional applications hence there is a mismatch between the model estimates and ground observations which increase the uncertainties for model validation 2 energy imbalance ec measurements suffer from energy imbalance problem that can be represented as the available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux larger than ec measured sensible and latent heat fluxes wilson et al 2002 nevertheless the monthly et observation used in this study were sourced from supplementary data of jung et al 2010 which has been corrected for closure 3 limited observation sites the ec sites are sparsely distributed and cover limited land surfaces around the world hundreds of sites which cannot cover the full continent or globe thus it is hard to evaluate et products with ec observations overall conditions the wbet has been used as reference to validate et products at basin scale over multi year scale the twsc are ignored in the validation process the wbet is different from ncdc precipitation and usgs total runoff which is largely depended upon precipitation and runoff quality as indicated by many previous studies pan et al 2003 mo et al 2012 gauge based precipitation exhibits large errors in central and western conus this is because 1 there are few gauge stations when compared to eastern conus and western coastline 2 most stations are located in the valley in western mountainous regions and 3 there is a rapid decrease of stations after the year 2002 mo et al 2012 although usgs monthly runoff is a promising dataset it has some questionable aspects and limitations oubeidillah et al 2014 for instance there are very few usgs streamflow gauge stations in the central conus so that these runoff data have large errors in addition since the exact weighting factors for each streamflow station are not provided by usgs it would be difficult to examine and further quantify the influence of highly regulated stations e g reservoir or diversion on quality and accuracy of monthly total runoff therefore precipitation and runoff errors will affect the quality of wbet data particularly in central us and western mountainous regions furthermore there are only 12 samples in 12 basins for each et product the insufficient sample numbers would bring some uncertainties to the validation results moreover the omission of twsc may lead to uncertainties in et derivation as the twsc may change over the multi year scale i e 10 years because twsc may change when there is sustained climate change and or human impacts on the hydrological system as reported twscs have been decreased significantly due to glacier and snow melting in headwaters of rivers chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 climate change in lots of high altitude and latitude regions rodell et al 2018 and groundwater withdrawal for agricultural depletion deng and chen 2017 long et al 2016 pan et al 2016 rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2012 etc the twsc from grace can be used in wbetgrace at monthly scale fig 10 shows the monthly et validation results using wbetgrace as a reference at the basin scale from fig 10 the correlation coefficient are much lower compared to results in fig 4 that is because wbetgrace has higher uncertainty compared to et from rsms i e mod16 and avhrr based et and nldas 2 lsms long et al 2014 relatively large footprint of grace data 1 5 2 0 105 km2 masks a great deal of finer scale variability in effects of et and groundwater abstractions on the groundwater storage and fluxes which may cause high uncertainty in wbetgrace downscaling grace tws data with a forward modeling approach might be helpful for this sort of effort in future studies long et al 2016 with reference to the wbetgrace the performance of all models is very similar with each other except for mod16 and ssebop the results is consistent with the uncertainty quantification results from tch method at the monthly scale table 3 and fig 8 mod16 underperformed over the five drier and high elevation basins i e cb cn ab wg and mb and ssebop has low accuracy over most basins i e wg ab se lm cn and nw noah28 has a slightly larger difference with the reference data at the north basins due to largely constrain aerodynamic conductance value for stable boundary case xia et al 2015b sac shows slightly lower skill score at the north basins i e ne ma nw nc and oh and vic403 displays slightly poor performance at the four basins in eastern conus i e ma oh lm and se due to use of under optimal soil and hydrological parameters troy et al 2008 xia et al 2016b 6 conclusion this study evaluated 12 et products i e gfet ssebop mod16 gleam mosaic noah28 sac vic403 clsm25 noah36 noahmp36 and vic412 over the conterminous united states conus the ameriflux observations and water balance method derived et wbet were used to validate these products at point and basin scale the three corned hat tch method was employed to quantify uncertainties of these et products over basin scale and in each grid over the whole conus the et interannual variability and the impacts of drought on et were analyzed over the basin scale and texas moreover the performance of an advanced version of nldas nldas 3 is compared with currently operational version nldas 2 the results indicate that all models are able to capture the general features of et at seasonal cycle compared to ameriflux observations the most rsms are slightly closer to the observations and outperform most nldas models except noah28 and vic412 for seasonal variations all evaluated et products are close to the wbet r larger than 0 83 over basin scale in which noah28 and vic412 have smallest largest rmsd r of 27 32 mm year 0 99 and 42 78 mm year 0 99 respectively over basin scale the uncertainties from tch method indicate that nldas 3 monthly et has much lower uncertainties 4 7 mm month than nldas 2 et 7 8 mm month and two modis et mod16 and ssebop 10 15 mm month the gfet 4 37 mm month and gleam 6 44 mm month have comparable uncertainties with nldas 3 et products over 12 basins moreover relative uncertainties of most et products are relatively lower in summer and spring than those in fall and winter spatial distribution of uncertainty over conus shows that relative uncertainties are lower over eastern conus and higher over western conus which may be caused by terrain effect in western mountain areas overall this study further demonstrates that gfet and gleam are promising datasets to evaluate lsms among nldas 2 and nldas 3 et products noah28 and vic403 are closest to wbet by ignoring twsc over multi year scale fig 4 however all models perform very similarly with each other except for mod16 and ssebop compared to wbetgrace considering twsc from grace at monthly scale fig 10 compared to nldas 2 the next generation of nldas nldas 3 advanced noah28 and vic403 to noah36 noahmp36 andvic412 replaced the mosaic model with clsm25 and excluded sac model as shown in table 3 noah36 noahmp36 reduced 47 19 et uncertainty compared to noah28 vic412 reduced 19 et uncertainty compared to vic403 clsm25 reduced 19 et uncertainty compared to mosaic the evaluations for et simulations suggest that nldas 3 has smaller uncertainty when compared with nldas 2 which is in good agreement with the findings from kumar et al 2017 where they found that 4 models are more similar in nldas 3 than nldas 2 this result provides support to speed up operational transition and implementation of experimental nldas 3 in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

remotely sensed observations ssebop mod16 and gleam and 8 products from land surface models in nldas 2 mosaic noah28 sac and vic403 and nldas 3 clsm25 noah36 noahmp36 and vic412 the ameriflux

vic412 has smallest root mean square difference rmsd of 27 32 mm year 42 78 mm year the uncertainties calculated from tch method indicate that nldas 3 monthly et products have lower uncertainties 4 7

for vic412 compared to vic403 it is reduced 19 for clsm25 compared to mosaic the gfet 4 37 mm month and gleam 6 44 mm month have comparable low uncertainties with nldas 3 et products this study

niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 upgrading vic403 to vic412 vic version 4 1 2 through updating model physics and model tuning parameters gao et al 2009 there are some uncertainties in these regional et products from model structure deficiencies input dataset e g surface meteorological forcing soil and vegetation related parameters errors model parameter errors and scale expansion problem jia et al 2012 xia et al 2015a therefore there is a pressing need for comprehensive evaluation of existing et products to expand their applications for model development global climate change research and water resource management the et ground measurements from eddy covariance ec instruments have been used as reference dataset to validate et products at point scale jung et al 2010 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011 senay et al 2013 xia et al 2015b however ec systems suffer from the energy imbalance problem which may cause errors in et measurements wilson et al 2002 xu et al 2017 the spatial scale mismatch between ec observations and model estimates point vs grid cell is another problem in et evaluation liu et al 2016 moreover ec sites are sparsely distributed over spaces that are hard to assess et products over a regional scale the water balance method derived et wbet is used for long term et evaluation over basin scale long et al 2014 senay et al 2011 velpuri et al 2013 xia et al 2016b zhang et al 2010 wbet was generally based on the assumption that the total water storage change twsc can be negligible over multi year scale senay et al 2011 velpuri et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 twsc is essential to estimate inter annual variability or trend of et at regional scales and twsc caused by reservoir is a key parameter impact trend of regional et calculated from water balance

derive monthly et via water balance equation rodell et al 2004 however the et inferred from grace presents large uncertainty compared with et products from rsms and lsms over basin scale long et al 2014 statistical methods i e triple collocation tc and three cornered hat tch have been used to quantify datasets uncertainty without prior knowledge scipal et al 2008 tavella and premoli 1994 the tc

et al 2000 the digital elevation model data was sourced from national aeronautics and space administration nasa 3 methodology 3 1 water budget balance method the total et can be calculated with water balance method within a river basin as 1 wbet i p i r i t w s c i where wbet represents water balance method derived et p r and twsc are precipitation runoff and total water storage change respectively i denotes the specific epoch the wbet has been used as the reference to validate modeled et at multi year scale senay et al 2011 velpuri et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 twsc should be considered when the data time span is under 10 years especially for monthly et evaluation the regional twsc data can be calculated via numerical differentiation using the centered operator as 2 twsc i twsa i 1 t w s a i 1 2 δ i where twsa is the total water storage anomaly which can be derived from grace data the twsc can be neglected when the data time span is larger than 10 years thus eq 1 can be reduced to wbet i p i r i 3 2 uncertainty quantification method the tch method tavella and premoli 1994 was employed to estimate uncertainties of 12 types of et products without any prior knowledge the theory of the tch is similar to the triple collocation tc approach stoffelen 1998 but the tc method can only be used to calculate uncertainties of three uncorrelated variables while the tch can deal with data with correlations if properly constrained tavella and premoli 1994 the details of the tch method is described as follows the time series of the evaluated products are expressed as x i i 1 2 n the subscript i denotes i th et product and n is a total number of products x i is comprised by true value x t and the error term ε i 3 x i x t ε i i 1 2 3 n to obtain the error term ε i we must know the true value first x t that is difficult to get in reality tch algorithm solved this problem by the following means first the differences between n 1 products and one reference product x r chosen arbitrarily of x i are defined as 4 y i m x i x r ε i ε r i 1 2 n 1 where y is an m n 1 matrix and m is the time samples the covariance matrix of y can be represented by s cov y the unknown n n covariance matrix of the individual noise q is related to s as 5 s j r j t where j is n 1 n matrix that can be represent as 6 j n 1 n 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 however eq 5 cannot be solved as the number of an unknown element is larger than a number of equations the remaining elements require a reasonable way to obtain the unique value galindo and palacio 1999 proposed the constrained minimization problem using the kuhn tucker theorem whose objective function is given below 7 f q 1 n q nn 1 k 2 i j n q ij 2 and its constraint function is as follows 8 h q 1 n q nn q s k 0 where q in q nn are the elements of q and k det s n 1 torcaso et al 1998 set initial conditions for the iteration as 9 q in 0 0 i n q nn 0 1 2 s s 1 1 s 1 1 1 t finally q is obtained by minimizing the objective function combined with eq 6 the square root of the q diagonal values q ii i 1 2 n were considered to be the uncertainty of evaluated et the ratio of the uncertainty to the time series mean value is the relative uncertainty 4 results 4 1 et validation with flux tower observations the accuracies of all et products compared to flux tower observations are shown in fig 2 since gfet dataset were generated by upscaling fluxnet et observations gfet were not compared with flux tower observations in this section over three vegetation types the root mean square difference rmsd are 18 52 mm month 24 52 mm month 26 25 mm month and 29 01 mm month for rsms nldas 2 and nldas 3 et products respectively all et products are closed to observations in the dbf with the rmsd of 21 62 mm month whereas there are larger differences over enf and cropland the noah28 vic412 and ssebop have smaller rmsd than other products over dbf and cropland for lsms noah28 has lowest rmsd 22 33 mm month while clsm25 and noahmp36 have largest rmsd of 32 51 mm month and 32 02 mm month over three vegetation types respectively vic412 reduced rmsd of 5 62 mm month compared to vic403 over three vegetation types one should be very cautious to take this validation messages as very limited site measurements are used as energy imbalance is corrected for more sites with long term observations a re validation is needed in future six year averaged 2001 2006 seasonal cycles of 12 et products over three vegetation types i e dbf enf and cropland are shown in fig 3 the et flux tower observations are also drawn as a reference generally the retrieved et from all models is comparable in seasonal evolution and in magnitude the ssebop catches et seasonal variations well over three vegetation types the gleam describes the seasonal trend well over dbf and cropland the mod16 et is much lower than observations over cropland nldas 2 noah28 and sac capture the et seasonal variations better than vic403 and mosaic in spite of sac s failure to capture the et variations in growing season over the dbf vic403 and mosaic fail to capture the seasonal trend for june and july over enf and cropland for nldas 3 the peak et value of noahmp36 is one month ahead of the observations in the growing season june and july over enf and cropland vic412 from nldas 3 performs slightly better than vic403 from nldas 2 4 2 et validation with water balance method the wbet was used as the reference to quantify the accuracy of each et products at the basin scale since the twsc is usually neglected for more than 10 years the time span of this study is 12 2000 2011 and 30 years 1982 2011 respectively over a long period more than 10 years the wbet was calculated using precipitation and runoff in each basin fig 4 depicts the comparisons of all et products with wbet over 12 basins in conus as indicated the results of the 12 year left study are consistent with the results from the 30 year right study with small differences and all evaluated et products agree well with the wbet datasets for the 12 year comparisons noah28 et has the smallest highest rmsd correlation coefficient r of 27 32 mm year 0 99 while clsm25 et gives the largest lowest rmsd r of 140 79 mm year 0 83 the mean rmsd r are 50 48 mm year 0 98 70 76 mm year 0 93 70 85 mm year 0 96 and 88 99 mm year 0 91 for gfet rsms nldas 2 and nldas 3 et products respectively for rsm et products gleam is closest to the wbet with the rmsd r of 67 29 mm year 0 94 whereas mod16 is relatively farthest to the wbet with the rmsd r of 93 80 mm year 0 89 for nldas 2 et datasets noah28 performs slightly better than other models with rmsd r of 27 32 mm year 0 99 for nldas 3 et datasets vic412 performs best with the lowest rmsd r of 42 78 mm year 0 99 4 3 uncertainty quantification of et products over basin scale the tch method was employed to quantify uncertainties of monthly et products over basin scale table 3 shows the uncertainties of monthly et products in 12 basins over conus overall the uncertainties in et products range from 2 mm month to 20 mm month with tch method the et uncertainties are lowest in nldas 3 and gfet 4 7 mm month moderate in nldas 2 7 8 mm month and highest in rsms 10 15 mm month except gleam the noah36 et product has the lowest uncertainty 4 02 mm month while ssebop et product has the highest uncertainty 13 24 mm month the uncertainty of et from gfet 4 37 mm month and gleam 6 44 mm month are comparable with those from nldas 3 the noah36 gfet vic412 noahmp36 and gleam are the five best products with the lowest et uncertainty et uncertainties in wet basins are relatively larger than those in dry basins due to larger et magnitude over wet areas as shown in table 3 noah36 noahmp36 reduced 47 19 et uncertainty compared to noah28 vic412 reduced 19 et uncertainty compared to vic403 clsm25 reduced 19 et uncertainty compared to mosaic the relative uncertainty is the ratio of uncertainty to mean et value which can describe the model skill neglecting the et magnitude to further evaluate the seasonal variations of et uncertainty the relative uncertainties in 12 et products are shown in fig 5 generally most models perform better in relatively warm months from march to october than cold months from november to february the most likely reason for this is fair sublimation over the snow for lsms particularly ssebop et has larger relative uncertainties in the cold months overall 12 basins as ssebop et is calculated from land surface temperature lst the effect of snow on satellite retrieved lst leads to large lst errors which further results in large et errors mod16 shows poor performance in spring march april and may and summer june july and august at the two driest basins i e cb and cn at the cn basin some et products gleam vic403 vic412 clsm25 and noahmp36 have slightly higher relative uncertainties in summer gleam shows poor performance in the coldest months november december and january at the north basins i e nw mb nc ma oh and ne which is most likely due to fair sublimation and frozen soil process simulations noah28 demonstrated the higher relative uncertainties over north basins i e nw mb nc ma and ne in winter and simultaneously have slightly higher relative uncertainties in the spring and the first month of summer in ne nw and ma due to this a large aerodynamic coefficient constraint is used to limit sublimation over snow for stable boundary case as large sublimation was found for noah model in polar region slater et al 2007 and western mountainous region livneh et al 2010 however there are many stable boundary cases even when snow does not exist this constraint results in too small et in cold season and large runoff simulations xia et al 2015b noahmp36 have large relative uncertainties in winter at north basins i e nw mb nc ma oh and ne due to fair sublimation simulation in the north regions of conus or during cold time periods lsms have different simulation skills for snow sublimation process as snowpack simulation remains a challenge for land surface model development community and model grid become heterogeneous when snow begins to melt as the model output is average weighted by snow cover and snow free fraction at coarse spatial resolution in the early spring late autumn periods as the vegetation grows fast deciduous gradually there is large uncertainty in greenness vegetation fraction and lai simulated from naohmp36 as land surface becomes heterologous 4 4 et interannual variability and the impact of drought on et interannual variability of et and its anomaly has been widely used to monitor climate extremes such as drought long et al 2017 henn et al 2018 on the other hand drought monitoring ability of et is another kind of method to evaluate et products this section will show how et products respond to meteorological drought over 12 basins and texas the meteorological drought is described by negative precipitation anomaly soorensson and ruscica 2018 fig 6 show et and p anomaly over 12 basins from 2000 to 2011 the basins are listed from dry to wet according to the climate index p pet as shown in fig 6 the et anomaly trend agrees well with p anomaly the et anomaly increases with the increase in p anomaly and vice versa et has a sharp increase in wet years 2005 due to positive precipitation anomaly over relative dry basins e g cb cn and wg while the annual et varies smoothly over relative wet basins e g ne lm and oh since water and energy are the two main factors influencing et variations et is mainly controlled by precipitation under water limited conditions while energy factors in well watered area mainly control it the negative et anomaly does not correspond to negative p anomaly drought well over annual scale that s because the precipitation deficit means meteorological drought while et decrease is more indicative of agricultural drought decrease in surface and root zone soil moisture van loon 2015 however years of persistent meteorological drought e g cn basin during 2006 2009 and exceptional drought e g wg basin in 2011 will lead to negative et anomaly texas experienced the most extreme one year drought on record in 2011 with precipitation at 40 of long term mean long et al 2013 have detected the texas exceptional drought by using total water storage from grace satellite data and soil moisture from land surface models the seasonal relative anomaly of et and p fig 7 are also used in this study to check whether it can seize texas exceptional drought in 2011 as indicated in fig 7 most of the et products can detect the texas exceptional drought in 2011 due to large deficit of precipitation et and p anomaly corresponds well with each other during 2000 2011 over seasonal scale especially the positive et and p anomaly in autumn of each year moreover fig 7 indicates a negative et anomaly in spring and summer and positive et anomaly in autumn of 2000 2010 while et and p anomaly last for whole year in 2011 which lead to the texas exceptional drought 4 5 spatial distribution of et relative uncertainties over conus fig 8 shows relative uncertainties of et products grid by grid over conus the rfc basin mask land cover classification map and digital elevation are also shown in fig 8 generally all et products especially mod16 and ssebop have lower relative uncertainties in the east than in west of conus which may be caused by complex terrain in west mountain areas fig 8d moreover models tend to generate larger et uncertainties over bare land areas in southwest conus due to low et magnitude larger et uncertainties over the north area are also found in some models e g noah28 vic403 and vic412 caused by errors in the model simulating outputs for snow melting fields the gfet and noah36 perform well over whole conus with low et uncertainty for rsm et products gleam outperforms the other two remote sensing et products mod16 and ssebop with lower uncertainties over whole conus mod16 and ssebop underperform in high elevation area of the west meanwhile mod16 also have lower skill score in the cropland areas as the p m algorithm is developed for short canopies khan et al 2018 mu et al 2007 for nldas 2 et products the mosaic noah28 and sac have lower et uncertainties than those from vic403 noah28 has high uncertainty over northeast regions ma and ne basin which is similar to results in table 3 for nldas 3 et products the clsm25 and noah36 outperform vic412 and noahmp36 clsm25 reduced the et uncertainty compared to mosaic especially in mid conus noah36 and noahmp36 are both used in the nldas 3 however et uncertainty is higher in noahmp36 than that of noah36 the et products from nldas 3 has slightly lower uncertainties than those from nldas 2 it is because nldas 3 advanced nldas 2 by using upgraded vic noah model and replaced mosaic with clsm25 which includes a groundwater module xia et al 2017 for example noah36 vic412 improves simulation skill in the cold regions of the northeast southeast of conus compared with the noah28 vic403 fig 9 shows spatial distribution of lowest et uncertainties in nldas 2 nldas 3 and all 12 et products grid by grid from 2000 to 2011 as indicated in fig 9a for nldas 2 noah28 occupied the largest percentage of girds 56 59 over conus while mosaic has the smallest percentage of grids 6 12 the grid percentage of vic403 and sac are 20 49 and 16 80 respectively noah28 performs best over middle and south areas vic403 has the lowest uncertainty over northeast areas and sac performs well over middle and north areas of conus fig 9b indicated that for nldas 3 noah36 performs best with 46 22 of grids over conus while vic412 clsm25 and noahmp36 occupy 17 56 23 58 and 12 64 of grids respectively as shown in fig 9 noah36 performs best over northeast and west areas clsm25 is located in middle and north areas vic412 chiefly situates in the central plains and noahmp36 performs best over west mountain areas of conus fig 9c shows 4 et products with the lowest uncertainties in 12 et products in fig 9c noah28 performs best over 37 21 of grids over conus while noah36 gfet and gleam occupy 27 85 25 02 and 9 91 of grids respectively noah28 performs well over middle and west areas vic412 gives lowest et uncertainties in northeast and middle areas and gfet provides high accuracy over northern areas of conus 5 discussions this study evaluated 12 et products over conus with ec observations wbet and tch method the differences between 12 et products and reference dataset were caused by errors in et products and uncertainties in reference data and the evaluation method these issues are discussed in detail in this section 5 1 errors in et products models were developed to simulate reality which is a simplification of the real world consequently distinct model structures lead to various uncertainties in the simulation the 12 evaluated et products from models were constructed with distinct schemes such as machine learning method surface energy balance method and sophisticated models among others the machine learning model i e gfet and most sophisticated models i e gleam nldas 2 and nldas 3 outperformed 2 energy balance models i e mod16 and ssebop for et estimation gfet makes full use of fluxnet observations around the world to produce more reliable global et products lsms in nldas 2 and nldas 3 are sophisticated models that have higher et simulation skill than relatively simple rsms gleam model have independent soil module which is combined with the data assimilation system to obtain high quality soil moisture that can produce more stable and accurate et furthermore water energy and vegetation factor are essential for accurate estimation of regional et the lack of enough information about these factors will affect the accuracy of et simulation table 4 summarizes the main inputs of all et models in this study as indicated in table 4 mod16 and ssebop et products lack direct water availability inputs e g precipitation and soil moisture lsms do not have irrigation information over cropland gleam and sac model lack vegetation related information since mod16 did not include soil moisture or precipitation as model inputs they used vapor pressure deficit vpd as water stress input mu et al 2011 however vpd would be overestimated when the soil water content is high which results in the underestimated soil evaporation and canopy transpiration hu et al 2015 et models can capture soil wetness variances with vegetation index lst or soil moisture in most rsms multiple source of data e g lai and lst are used to reduce the uncertainty increases in et could be reflected corresponding to relatively higher vegetation index lower lst and higher soil moisture for irrigated areas than non irrigated areas long et al 2014 however lsms lack the irrigation information and lead to underestimating et over cropland for example lsms in nldas 2 and nldas 3 underperformed ssebop over cropland fig 2 gleam lacks inputs of vegetation growth information that may result in lower accuracy compared with gfet and other rsms at point scale the sac model lacks vegetation factor to derive et inter annual variation and fails to capture the et inter annual variation well the model input dataset errors and scale mismatch between inputs and outputs affect the accuracy of et products the input dataset including meteorological and land surface variables that can be divided into water energy vegetation and other factors table 4 the slightly higher relative uncertainties of nldas models in high altitude areas of the western conus could be attributed to its precipitation input which presents large negative biases pan et al 2003 xia et al 2015b errors in lst satellite data is one of the main reasons why ssebop and mod16 underperformed in the mountain regions fig 8 lst has low accuracy in the mountains caused by cloud sky senay et al 2013 moreover the mountains affect the shortwave radiation observations which leads to higher uncertainties in mod16 et over mountain areas hofste 2014 furthermore coarse spatial resolution 1 1 25 meteorological inputs in mod16 et products deteriorate the effects of elevation the accuracy of lai dataset is affected by the leaf shadowing mehrez et al 1992 especially for tall and dense forests besides shaded leaves are not light saturated which would result in diffuse sunlight conditions and then lead to having a higher fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar in the shaded leaves areas he et al 2013 jenkins et al 2007 errors in lai may lead to lsms failing to capture the season cycle well over enf model calibration has a significant impact on the accuracy of et simulation take nldas 2 as an example noah28 has been calibrated with arm cart et and streamflow observations wei et al 2013 sac and vic403 model were calibrated with the annual streamflow observation troy et al 2008 however mosaic has not been calibrated with any of these dataset mitchell et al 2004 this model calibration is consistent with the evaluation result in this study wherein noah28 have the best performance and it is followed by vic403 sac and mosaic fig 8 the gfet model was trained by fluxnet observations which show the good performance at any spatial temporal scale 5 2 uncertainties in reference dataset and evaluation method the ec observed et has been usually used as reference data to evaluate modeled et however the limitations for et validation can t be ignored including 1 spatial scale mismatch the spatial representativeness of et measurements from ec systems is about 100 m liu et al 2011 2018 while the size of computational pixels is mostly larger than 10 km in most regional applications hence there is a mismatch between the model estimates and ground observations which increase the uncertainties for model validation 2 energy imbalance ec measurements suffer from energy imbalance problem that can be represented as the available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux larger than ec measured sensible and latent heat fluxes wilson et al 2002 nevertheless the monthly et observation used in this study were sourced from supplementary data of jung et al 2010 which has been corrected for closure 3 limited observation sites the ec sites are sparsely distributed and cover limited land surfaces around the world hundreds of sites which cannot cover the full continent or globe thus it is hard to evaluate et products with ec observations overall conditions the wbet has been used as reference to validate et products at basin scale over multi year scale the twsc are ignored in the validation process the wbet is different from ncdc precipitation and usgs total runoff which is largely depended upon precipitation and runoff quality as indicated by many previous studies pan et al 2003 mo et al 2012 gauge based precipitation exhibits large errors in central and western conus this is because 1 there are few gauge stations when compared to eastern conus and western coastline 2 most stations are located in the valley in western mountainous regions and 3 there is a rapid decrease of stations after the year 2002 mo et al 2012 although usgs monthly runoff is a promising dataset it has some questionable aspects and limitations oubeidillah et al 2014 for instance there are very few usgs streamflow gauge stations in the central conus so that these runoff data have large errors in addition since the exact weighting factors for each streamflow station are not provided by usgs it would be difficult to examine and further quantify the influence of highly regulated stations e g reservoir or diversion on quality and accuracy of monthly total runoff therefore precipitation and runoff errors will affect the quality of wbet data particularly in central us and western mountainous regions furthermore there are only 12 samples in 12 basins for each et product the insufficient sample numbers would bring some uncertainties to the validation results moreover the omission of twsc may lead to uncertainties in et derivation as the twsc may change over the multi year scale i e 10 years because twsc may change when there is sustained climate change and or human impacts on the hydrological system as reported twscs have been decreased significantly due to glacier and snow melting in headwaters of rivers chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 climate change in lots of high altitude and latitude regions rodell et al 2018 and groundwater withdrawal for agricultural depletion deng and chen 2017 long et al 2016 pan et al 2016 rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2012 etc the twsc from grace can be used in wbetgrace at monthly scale fig 10 shows the monthly et validation results using wbetgrace as a reference at the basin scale from fig 10 the correlation coefficient are much lower compared to results in fig 4 that is because wbetgrace has higher uncertainty compared to et from rsms i e mod16 and avhrr based et and nldas 2 lsms long et al 2014 relatively large footprint of grace data 1 5 2 0 105 km2 masks a great deal of finer scale variability in effects of et and groundwater abstractions on the groundwater storage and fluxes which may cause high uncertainty in wbetgrace downscaling grace tws data with a forward modeling approach might be helpful for this sort of effort in future studies long et al 2016 with reference to the wbetgrace the performance of all models is very similar with each other except for mod16 and ssebop the results is consistent with the uncertainty quantification results from tch method at the monthly scale table 3 and fig 8 mod16 underperformed over the five drier and high elevation basins i e cb cn ab wg and mb and ssebop has low accuracy over most basins i e wg ab se lm cn and nw noah28 has a slightly larger difference with the reference data at the north basins due to largely constrain aerodynamic conductance value for stable boundary case xia et al 2015b sac shows slightly lower skill score at the north basins i e ne ma nw nc and oh and vic403 displays slightly poor performance at the four basins in eastern conus i e ma oh lm and se due to use of under optimal soil and hydrological parameters troy et al 2008 xia et al 2016b 6 conclusion this study evaluated 12 et products i e gfet ssebop mod16 gleam mosaic noah28 sac vic403 clsm25 noah36 noahmp36 and vic412 over the conterminous united states conus the ameriflux observations and water balance method derived et wbet were used to validate these products at point and basin scale the three corned hat tch method was employed to quantify uncertainties of these et products over basin scale and in each grid over the whole conus the et interannual variability and the impacts of drought on et were analyzed over the basin scale and texas moreover the performance of an advanced version of nldas nldas 3 is compared with currently operational version nldas 2 the results indicate that all models are able to capture the general features of et at seasonal cycle compared to ameriflux observations the most rsms are slightly closer to the observations and outperform most nldas models except noah28 and vic412 for seasonal variations all evaluated et products are close to the wbet r larger than 0 83 over basin scale in which noah28 and vic412 have smallest largest rmsd r of 27 32 mm year 0 99 and 42 78 mm year 0 99 respectively over basin scale the uncertainties from tch method indicate that nldas 3 monthly et has much lower uncertainties 4 7 mm month than nldas 2 et 7 8 mm month and two modis et mod16 and ssebop 10 15 mm month the gfet 4 37 mm month and gleam 6 44 mm month have comparable uncertainties with nldas 3 et products over 12 basins moreover relative uncertainties of most et products are relatively lower in summer and spring than those in fall and winter spatial distribution of uncertainty over conus shows that relative uncertainties are lower over eastern conus and higher over western conus which may be caused by terrain effect in western mountain areas overall this study further demonstrates that gfet and gleam are promising datasets to evaluate lsms among nldas 2 and nldas 3 et products noah28 and vic403 are closest to wbet by ignoring twsc over multi year scale fig 4 however all models perform very similarly with each other except for mod16 and ssebop compared to wbetgrace considering twsc from grace at monthly scale fig 10 compared to nldas 2 the next generation of nldas nldas 3 advanced noah28 and vic403 to noah36 noahmp36 andvic412 replaced the mosaic model with clsm25 and excluded sac model as shown in table 3 noah36 noahmp36 reduced 47 19 et uncertainty compared to noah28 vic412 reduced 19 et uncertainty compared to vic403 clsm25 reduced 19 et uncertainty compared to mosaic the evaluations for et simulations suggest that nldas 3 has smaller uncertainty when compared with nldas 2 which is in good agreement with the findings from kumar et al 2017 where they found that 4 models are more similar in nldas 3 than nldas 2 this

6173,this study proposes a new integrated framework to evaluate groundwater safety by characterizing the short term spatiotemporal variations of methane migration risk attributed to shale gas development a set of probabilistic and conditionally probabilistic based algorithms is used to represent the temporal and spatial distributions of reliability resilience vulnerability rrv over the study domain using rrv calculation and copula functions the gas migration index gmi is calculated to identify the interrelationships among rrv for identifying the synergetic variation of rrv levels the framework is demonstrated and discussed through the southwest shale of bradford county pennsylvania results show that 1 reliability is quite high 0 7 over the southern parts while the midland remains high risk of contamination 2 low level reliability spreads to the northern and southern areas from the central parts and gradually diffuses through most grids sparsely reliability implies negative correlations with methane concentrations 3 the spatiotemporal variation of resilience has high concordance with those of reliability except subtle discrepancies and 4 the spatial distribution of high level vulnerability has subtler classifications besides similar outlines to that of low reliability moreover results from the gmi analysis show that 1 the gas migration risk is consistently low in the south and the north in middle blocks and 2 high level gmi shows an apparent rampant tendency across the blocks and spreads to the whole north ultimately therefore gmi is better at characterizing groundwater contamination risk than using a single metric the framework will contribute significantly to improve management practices taken by shale gas operators and regulators in protecting groundwater quality keywords shale gas gas migration groundwater spatiotemporal variation 1 introduction at present thousands of aquifers can be contaminated due to the potential large scale shale gas activities in the usa in addition to transportation related risks and other outdoor practices well sites are exposed to extreme weather and environmental conditions such as heavy rain severe storm surges and freezing conditions which can also result in potentially dangerous fluid leaks eshleman and elmore 2013 lu et al 2019 chen et al 2017 kondash et al 2018 this situation poses an evident risk to environmental quality and human health thus some policies are required to control and remove potential contaminants from soil and groundwater hildenbrand et al 2016 huang et al 2019 liu et al 2018 shen et al 2016 us epa 2016 vengosh et al 2014 a series of comprehensive indices and models is developed to provide decision support for assessing groundwater safety for its protection drollette et al 2015 huang et al 2017 siegel et al 2015a b yu et al 2016 several efforts have been made to reveal and assess the potential impacts of shale gas operations on water quality and human health brantley et al 2014 burg and gersman 2016 drollette et al 2015 gorody 2012 hildenbrand et al 2016 jackson et al 2013a b meng 2015 molofsky et al 2013 olmstead et al 2013 siegel et al 2015a b us epa 2016 vidic et al 2013 warner et al 2012 for instance osborn et al 2011 documented systematic evidence for methane contamination of shallow drinking water systems associated with shale gas extraction they suggested important environmental risks accompanying shale gas exploration worldwide jackson et al 2013 examined natural gas concentrations and isotopic signatures of 141 drinking water wells with proximity to shale gas wells across the appalachian plateaus physiographic province they found that some homeowners living within 1 km from shale gas wells have drinking water contaminated with stray gases darrah et al 2014 analyzed hydrocarbon abundance and isotopic compositions of drinking water wells overlying the marcellus and barnett shales they identified the sources and mechanisms of contamination of shale gas extraction vengosh et al 2014 summarized shale gas extraction case studies in the usa they concluded four potential risks that shale gas extraction poses to water resources the contamination of shallow aquifers with fugitive hydrocarbon gases the contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater the accumulation of toxic and radioactive elements and water shortages caused by over extraction us epa 2016 proposed certain conditions under which shale gas extraction can cause severe impacts water withdrawals in times or areas of low water availability injection or spills of fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity or groundwater resources and mishandled discharge disposal or storage of wastewater trenck et al 2018 developed assessment criteria for specific contaminated groundwater to assess groundwater contamination shih 2018 provided a practical assessment process for groundwater contamination by characterizing the nature of leaky confined aquifers the existing research can reflect the potential impacts of shale gas operations on water quality and human health to some extent however a few challenges in the above mentioned studies drive this research first multiple indices to comprehensively evaluate the groundwater resources safety at the regional scale are lacking meanwhile reliability resilience and vulnerability rrv have been individually or jointly introduced in water resource assessment chebana et al 2009 fowler et al 2003 hashimoto et al 1982 maier et al 2001 moy et al 1986 he et al 2018 nevertheless they have been seldom applied to comprehensively evaluate groundwater safety especially those systems exposed to the shale gas contaminations second most of the current rrv studies on groundwater depend on non probabilistic methods while probabilistic ones are particularly desired in most studies where the uncertainty in input data extensively exists and needs to be addressed sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 maity et al 2013 chen et al 2015 cheng et al 2016 third few studies have discussed the interrelationships among rrv thus dynamic synergetic variations with shale gas exploration are barely identified identifying such interrelationships will be beneficial to not only comprehensively evaluate groundwater safety but also assist in establishing groundwater management policies for joint long term control of rrv at the regional scale therefore this study aims to evaluate groundwater resource safety based on a new evaluation paradigm that introduces rrv method first a set of probabilistic and conditionally probabilistic based algorithms will be used to estimate the temporal and spatial levels of rrv then spatiotemporal variation of dissolved methane in regional aquifers will be assumed to be equivalent to the operation process of a water supply reservoir within this context a new index called gas migration index gmi will be derived by combining the estimated rrv results and copula functions to identify the interrelationships among rrv the framework will be demonstrated and discussed through a shale gas reservoir located at marcellus shale of bradford county pennsylvania in the usa this study will be the first to characterize the spatiotemporal variations in rrv for groundwater systems exposed to potential shale gas contamination and enhance understanding of the groundwater risks of shale gas exploitation 2 methodology fig 1 shows the framework of this research methodology the three steps involved in the framework are summarized as follows i calculating rrv of gridded methane data over the target area ii obtaining the joint probability distribution of resilience and vulnerability using copula models and iii calculating gmi at each gridded location over the target area the formulas and procedures are presented as follows and additional details are presented in the appendix 2 1 computation of reliability resilience vulnerability rrv rrv are three important measures of system performance the concept of rrv in the context of water resource systems was established by hashimoto et al 1982 and was successfully applied into hydrological field asefa et al 2014 reliability α is defined by the probability that a system is in satisfactory state hashimoto et al 1982 a reservoir system is considered to be in satisfactory state when it satisfies the demand for which it is designed otherwise it is said to be in unsatisfactory state analogously when dissolved methane concentrations in groundwater rise over the environmental threshold ambient subsurface aquifer is recognized as high contamination risk and failure occurs it is given by 1 α p x t s where s represents satisfactory state for a given time series reliability is computed as 2 α lim n 1 n t 1 n z t where zt 1 if xt s and zt 0 if xt f here f represents failure state and n is the total number of time series resilience β describes how quickly a system will recover from failure state once failure has occurred hashimoto et al 1982 thus it is given by 3 β ρ 1 α where ρ p xt f xt 1 s p xt s xt 1 f and α p xt s for a given series resilience can be computed as 4 β lim n 1 n t 1 n wt 1 lim n z t where wt indicates the event of transformation from satisfactory to failure state or vice versa wt 1 if xt f and xt 1 s and wt 0 otherwise the resilience can also be expressed as the conditional probability of recovery from failure state that is 5 β p x t 1 s x t f vulnerability γ is a measure of the severity of damage caused by a failure event hashimoto et al 1982 defined it as 6 γ j f s j e j where s j is the numerical indicator of severity for an observation x j which belongs to unsatisfactory state e j is the probability of x j corresponding to s j which is the most unsatisfactory and severe outcome that occurs from the set of unsatisfactory states s j is interpreted as the criticality of the thresholds hierarchies here in the absence of specific knowledge about the probability e j of occurrence of an event of severity s j s j of dissolved methane is ranked by distinguishable thresholds thus e j is computed as follows 7 e j p r j x t r j 1 where rj j 1 n is the corresponding level of grade j and n represents the number of grades in the context of groundwater methane classification is evaluated in the context of its respective primary or secondary maximum contaminant limits mcls health advisory levels or other suggested levels as provided in the us epa s drinking water standards to obtain a reasonably stable estimate the time series is segmented into semiannual moving window and a series of rrv estimates is obtained during the 2 year period the reliability and resilience are expected to follow a deterministic relation as indicated in eq 3 thus the joint relationship between any of the two pairs will bear the signature of distribution characteristic for a given region chanda et al 2015 2 2 joint probability distribution of rrv using copula the interrelationship of rrv needs to be considered when establishing the joint probability distribution copula functions can couple different marginal distributions to the corresponding multivariate joint probability distribution effectively and easily because of the flexible and margin free characteristics of the method wei et al 2015 chen et al 2015 thus this function is an attractive tool for modeling the joint distribution of rrv copulas have been introduced in hydrology field for providing a realistic evaluation of risks associated to flood or drought events by characterizing multiple aspects of the hydrographs chebana and ouarda 2009 requena et al 2013 salvadori and de michele 2004 shiau et al 2006 chanda et al 2014 maity et al 2013 however the application of rrv indicators coupled with the copulas has not been practically applied in shale gas field resilience and vulnerability are found to be negatively correlated discussed in the sections below thus frank and plackett copulas are initially the two choices to capture the joint behavior between resilience and vulnerability their suitability are compared and the suitable model is selected in terms of their fitting tests with empirical copula of joint probability 2 3 computation of gmi by design gmi is a probabilistic risk index based on joint probability of resilience and vulnerability that differ from other indices gmi accounts for the readiness of a system to be able to bounce back from failure below a predefined threshold which is a factor that has not been considered in formulating risk relief and management plans in unconventional shale gas field the previous discussion indicates that more favorable conditions can be indicated with the increase in resilience by contrast conditions are less favorable with the increase in vulnerability here gas migration is identified as an unfavorable phenomenon thus the proposed index should increase with the increase in vulnerability and with the decrease in resilience and vice versa this condition can be achieved by a joint measure of probability that indicates exceedance in resilience and non exceedance in vulnerability thus the gmi is defined as 16 gm i τ loc p r r τ loc v ν τ loc where rτ loc and vτ loc are the specific values of reduced resilience and reduced vulnerability respectively for a given location loc and for a given period τ the range of gmi which is a probabilistic measure is from 0 to 1 a high value indicates high contamination risk and vice versa semiannual scale 4 blocks are selected to obtain a reasonably stable estimate of gmi for deriving fine possible temporal resolution to assess the variation in methane distribution characteristics over the successive periods of semiannual moving window gmi values can be computed to obtain the series that bears the temporal variation similarly over the different gridded locations preferably gridded such series can be computed to obtain the spatiotemporal variation of gmi 3 case study 3 1 study area and data collection the aquifers located in the marcellus shale of bradford county pennsylvania constitute the study domain for illustration gridded locations 1000 m 1000 m in the target area are obtained from global mapper the geographic positions and regionalism of the target area and its 844 gridded locations are incorporated visually in fig 2 meanwhile dissolved methane data are gathered from shale network in 2011 and 2012 and the data horizon is divided into 4 blocks of semiannual scale jan to jun in 2011 for block 1 jul to dec in 2011 for block 2 and so on for temporal variation research notably the methane database which is accessible on shale network is funded by the national science foundation to publish data about water resources that may be affected by shale gas exploitation this database contains various types of data such as surface water groundwater formation flowback and production water these data are accepted from providers with some level of quality assurance and control including volunteers who have received training from service providers in pennsylvania such as alliance for aquatic resource monitoring however information regarding the depth flow and piezometric levels of groundwater on the observation sites cannot be accessible the shale layer of the study area is middle devonian shale deposits as impermeable layer with low porosity approximately 6 10 and permeability coefficient 1 2 10 7 cm s 2 3 10 5 cm s sandstone deposits are thick in the east and black and gray shale layers are thin in the west the shale develops two groups of microfractures along the northeast and northwest areas which constitute the main pore types john 2002 scott 2009 meng and hou 2012 multiple reasons contribute to the uncertainty of water quality impact assessment including the lack of systematic surveys of water quality pre and post drilling production substantial dilution and slow transport over months to hundreds of years along flow paths from contaminated sites to private wells or public water supplies and natural fluctuations of groundwater chemistry these complexities make studies inadequate to determine a well defined groundwater impact from unconventional shale gas activities due to the lack of transparent and accessible data yan et al 2017 brantley et al 2014 on this basis monte carlo simulation based on probability and statistics theory is utilized here to augment samples through numerical simulation and uncertainty evaluation is obtained with the hypothesis that levels of dissolved methane in groundwater are primarily associated with unconventional shale gas activities after normal transformation and ordinary kriging interpolation each grid consists of 100 methane concentration data and follow an approximately normal distribution which can be simulated by monte carlo simulation to generate 1000 analogue data for precise rrv computation the thresholds used in vulnerability classifications are defined as 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 and 5 mg l with the corresponding weights of 1 2 5 10 20 and 50 respectively which are established on account of water quality standards such as primary or secondary mcls and health advisory levels the threshold in reliability and resilience formulas is set to 0 2 mg l which is assigned to distinguish satisfactory and unsatisfactory states 3 2 results and discussion 3 2 1 analysis of reliability resilience and vulnerability rrv reliability is calculated for all grids in each block by eq 2 resilience and vulnerability are obtained using eqs 4 and 6 respectively the ranges of reliability and resilience are between 0 and 1 because they are measured on the probability scale the value domain of vulnerability lies on probability based classified weighted sum assigned to each grid after normal transformation the ordinary kriging interpolation in geostatistical analysis on arcgis is utilized to gain interpolated dissolved methane concentrations and rrv levels at all grid locations in the entire domain the spatiotemporal variation characteristics indicated by dissolved methane concentrations and rrv indicators over the target area are presented in figs 3 6 fig 3 displays the spatiotemporal distributions of dissolved methane concentrations across the targeted area in blocks 1 2 3 and 4 fig 3 a b c and d represent the corresponding blocks the results suggest that the methane concentrations are consistently low 3 mg l across the area except the partial central and eastern regions between 2011 and 2012 among fig 3 a b and d high level methane concentrations 12 mg l present temporal tendency of westward migration and diffusion with gradually increasing area in fig 3 c the high level concentrations decline largely 9 mg l due to impacts from variations in various factors such as drilling locations wastewater disposal and groundwater flow in the subplots of fig 4 the spatiotemporal variation of reliability can present its distribution propensity reliability is quite high 0 7 over the southern parts and the midland remains high risk of contamination low reliability all the time the trend is in accordance with that of methane concentration distribution with regard to fig 4 a b and c low level reliability spreads to the northern and southern areas from the central parts and gradually diffuses through most grids sparsely when in block 4 reliability centralizes in the northwest area densely spatiotemporal characteristics of reliability shows some negative correlation with methane distribution primarily due to the judging criterion of satisfactory states provided by reliability additional indices are needed for detailed distinction the resilience contour maps fig 5 show spatiotemporal distributions of resilience and fig 5 b c and d refer to resilience levels between blocks 2 and 1 blocks 3 and 2 and blocks 4 and 3 respectively with parallel legends the spatiotemporal characteristics of resilience show high concordance with those of reliability except subtle discrepancies thus high positive correlation between resilience and reliability can be easily found high vulnerability grids can inflict high severity of damage when contamination events occur fig 6 a b and c shows that vulnerability estimates are rather low 10 across the study area except the middle regions the highest level vulnerability 35 has a tendency of dispersion and eastward migration in spatiotemporal variation and then disappears in block 4 the distributions of high level vulnerability 5 have similar outlines to that of low level reliability but have subtler classification due to more thresholds rrv maps have correspondence mutually in the spatiotemporal variation in some cases for further study the pairwise relationships of rrv are presented in fig 7 b c and d the labels in these scatter plots have corresponding blocks in the different blocks the distributions of reliability vulnerability and resilience vulnerability points are found to be negatively correlated with varying degrees thus the differences among copula parameters in different blocks can be interpreted in fig 7 b and c the variation ranges of data points in different periods are wider than those in fig 7 d this result is due to the strong positive correlation of reliability and resilience which causes difficulty in observing many points individually reliability and resilience are connected with eq 3 thus their relationship is deterministic in nature and they exhibit a well defined monotonic behavior that allows the specification of one given the other any one of the pairs of reliability vulnerability or resilience vulnerability can be considered into probabilistic assessment of methane migration risk through gmi chanda et al 2015 as mentioned before rrv of the events should be considered simultaneously while assessing the aqueous characteristics in this study spatiotemporal variation of gmi over the study domain using resilience and vulnerability is discussed in the following subsections for analyzing the short term migration characteristics of dissolved methane 3 2 2 analysis of gmi the relationships between vulnerability and resilience are found to be negative in fig 7 b thus their joint distribution can be derived by plackett or frank copula as discussed in the methodology first the calculated resilience and vulnerability values of each block at the same grids are used to develop the copula parameters by eqs a5 a6 and a8 their marginal distributions are fitted by appropriate distribution patterns realized by easyfit 5 6 a software package for data fitting their distribution patterns and parameters are listed in table 1 then corresponding cdfs of all grids are obtained on the basis of the probability of resilience and vulnerability by computing cross product ratio among the sample variables the dependence parameters of plackett copula in blocks 2 3 and 4 are obtained as θp2 0 0278 θp3 0 0083 and θp4 0 004 respectively subsequently the dependence parameters of frank copula in blocks 2 3 and 4 are obtained as θf2 9 7654 θf3 12 1626 and θf4 8 6598 respectively by calculating kendall tau rank correlation coefficient τ values of bivariate empirical copula are arranged in an ascending order and plotted as a solid line in fig 8 where the x coordinate represents points arranged as per the ascending order of corresponding empirical cdf corresponding to values of empirical cdf cdfs using frank and plackett copulas are also obtained by the same data these values are also plotted in fig 8 which exhibits the joint cdfs based on frank and plackett copulas and their fitting testing results using empirical cdf in block 2 their joint cdfs are too approximate to compare easily the joint cdfs of resilience and vulnerability simulated by frank copula are readily found to be close to empirical cdf in block 3 however the result is contrary in block 4 rmse and aic values of joint cdfs based on frank and plackett copulas are computed and listed in table 2 for obtaining certain conclusions statistical measures rmse and aic of frank copula are low in blocks 2 and 3 while those of plackett copula are low in block 4 as a result suitable copulas are frank frank and plackett copulas for blocks 2 3 and 4 respectively the corresponding joint cdfs of resilience and vulnerability computed by the selected copulas in respective blocks are obtained and gmi at each grid is computed from the corresponding joint cdf the spatiotemporal variation of gmi are shown by a series of gmi contour plots across the study domain in successive blocks in fig 9 gmi is found to be consistently low 0 3 in south and far north in blocks 2 and 3 this situation is a consequence of high resilience and low vulnerability high level gmi 0 6 spreads apparently over time and then spreads to the entire northwest area in block 4 this condition indicates increasing contamination risk for methane aggregation in the area because of its low resilience and high vulnerability 3 2 3 utility analysis via gmi this section illustrates that gmi which incorporates the resilience and vulnerability is better at characterizing the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of dissolved methane rather than using a single metric the amount by which the methane concentrations deviated from the minimum level required for groundwater conservation represented by thresholds is captured successfully by the gmi in situations where reliability fails to make a distinction two grid locations a and b are considered fig 10 a in block 2 these grids have the same values of reliability 0 24 and significantly different values of gmi 0 23 and 0 06 the gmi reflects the considerable difference in methane concentrations 0 29 and 0 02 mg l high gmi which indicates high contamination risk corresponds to high methane concentrations at these grids similar behavior is observed at other blocks as well thus even if the reliability of two grids is equal at a given point in time they may be exposed to different magnitudes of migration propensities as represented by their gmi in general if the methane concentrations rise in successive blocks at any particular grid then gmi increases for example at grid a fig 10a the gmi is found to rise slightly from 0 23 to 0 9 from block 2 to block 3 as a result of a rise in methane concentrations from 0 29 mg l to 1 18 mg l the aforementioned examples are straightforward but the aim of developing spatiotemporal variation of gmi is to characterize the methane migration risk of a location considering the average severity vulnerability and the chance of recovery resilience when elevated methane levels occur thus a simple rise or drop in methane concentrations does not necessarily indicate high or low contamination risk which is reflect from the gmi values in other words a rise or drop in methane concentrations is not necessarily always accompanied by a rise or drop in gmi grid c is considered where gmi rises 0 374 0 928 from block 2 to block 3 in spite of a decrease 7 83 5 42 in average methane concentrations over blocks this condition may be counter intuitive at first but a look at the methane concentrations of grid c during the concerned blocks can explain the apparent paradox in block 2 the mean value and standard deviation of grid c are 7 83 and 8 1 respectively and its corresponding rrv values calculated from simulative data are 0 164 0 167 and 4 912 respectively the mean value standard deviation and corresponding rrv of grid c during block 3 are 5 42 1 65 0 002 0 002 and 38 18 respectively contrary to block 2 the distribution of concentration data of grid c is more aggregated in high levels relatively in block 3 in spite of its lower mean concentration thus this case is characterized by low reliability and resilience for data series of grid c they spread over various levels of vulnerability classifications dispersedly in block 2 which leads to lower vulnerability than that in block 3 consequently gmi in grid c is high in block 3 which indicates great possibility of gas migration propensity 4 discussion and conclusions this study proposes a new

6173,this study proposes a new integrated framework to evaluate groundwater safety by characterizing the short term spatiotemporal variations of methane migration risk attributed to shale gas development a set of probabilistic and conditionally probabilistic based algorithms is used to represent the temporal and spatial distributions of reliability resilience vulnerability rrv over the study domain using rrv calculation and copula functions the gas migration index gmi is calculated to identify the interrelationships among rrv for identifying the synergetic variation of rrv levels the framework is demonstrated and discussed through the southwest shale of bradford county pennsylvania results show that 1 reliability is quite high 0 7 over the southern parts while the midland remains high risk of contamination 2 low level reliability spreads to the northern and southern areas from the central parts and gradually diffuses through most grids sparsely reliability implies negative correlations with methane concentrations 3 the spatiotemporal variation of resilience has high concordance with those of reliability except subtle discrepancies and 4 the spatial distribution of high level vulnerability has subtler classifications besides similar outlines to that of low reliability moreover results from the gmi analysis show that 1 the gas migration risk is consistently low in the south and the north in middle blocks and 2 high level gmi shows an apparent rampant tendency across the blocks and spreads to the whole north ultimately therefore gmi is better at characterizing groundwater contamination risk than using a single metric the framework will contribute significantly to improve management practices taken by shale gas operators and regulators in protecting groundwater quality keywords shale gas gas migration groundwater spatiotemporal variation 1 introduction at present thousands of aquifers can be contaminated due to the potential large scale shale gas activities in the usa in addition to transportation related risks and other outdoor practices well sites are exposed to extreme weather and environmental conditions such as heavy rain severe storm surges and freezing conditions which can also result in potentially dangerous fluid leaks eshleman and elmore 2013 lu et al 2019 chen et al 2017 kondash et al 2018 this situation poses an evident risk to environmental quality and human health thus some policies are required to control and remove potential contaminants from soil and groundwater hildenbrand et al 2016 huang et al 2019 liu et al 2018 shen et al 2016 us epa 2016 vengosh et al 2014 a series of comprehensive indices and models is developed to provide decision support for assessing groundwater safety for its protection drollette et al 2015 huang et al 2017 siegel et al 2015a b yu et al 2016 several efforts have been made to reveal and assess the potential impacts of shale gas operations on water quality and human health brantley et al 2014 burg and gersman 2016 drollette et al 2015 gorody 2012 hildenbrand et al 2016 jackson et al 2013a b meng 2015 molofsky et al 2013 olmstead et al 2013 siegel et al 2015a b us epa 2016 vidic et al 2013 warner et al 2012 for instance osborn et al 2011 documented systematic evidence for methane contamination of shallow drinking water systems associated with shale gas extraction they suggested important environmental risks accompanying shale gas exploration worldwide jackson et al 2013 examined natural gas concentrations and isotopic signatures of 141 drinking water wells with proximity to shale gas wells across the appalachian plateaus physiographic province they found that some homeowners living within 1 km from shale gas wells have drinking water contaminated with stray gases darrah et al 2014 analyzed hydrocarbon abundance and isotopic compositions of drinking water wells overlying the marcellus and barnett shales they identified the sources and mechanisms of contamination of shale gas extraction vengosh et al 2014 summarized shale gas extraction case studies in the usa they concluded four potential risks that shale gas extraction poses to water resources the contamination of shallow aquifers with fugitive hydrocarbon gases the contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater the accumulation of toxic and radioactive elements and water shortages caused by over extraction us epa 2016 proposed certain conditions under which shale gas extraction can cause severe impacts water withdrawals in times or areas of low water availability injection or spills of fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity or groundwater resources and mishandled discharge disposal or storage of wastewater trenck et al 2018 developed assessment criteria for specific contaminated groundwater to assess groundwater contamination shih 2018 provided a practical assessment process for groundwater contamination by characterizing the nature of leaky confined aquifers the existing research can reflect the potential impacts of shale gas operations on water quality and human health to some extent however a few challenges in the above mentioned studies drive this research first multiple indices to comprehensively evaluate the groundwater resources safety at the regional scale are lacking meanwhile reliability resilience and vulnerability rrv have been individually or jointly introduced in water resource assessment chebana et al 2009 fowler et al 2003 hashimoto et al 1982 maier et al 2001 moy et al 1986 he et al 2018 nevertheless they have been seldom applied to comprehensively evaluate groundwater safety especially those systems exposed to the shale gas contaminations second most of the current rrv studies on groundwater depend on non probabilistic methods while probabilistic ones are particularly desired in most studies where the uncertainty in input data extensively exists and needs to be addressed sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 maity et al 2013 chen et al 2015 cheng et al 2016 third few studies have discussed the interrelationships among rrv thus dynamic synergetic variations with shale gas exploration are barely identified identifying such interrelationships will be beneficial to not only comprehensively evaluate groundwater safety but also assist in establishing groundwater management policies for joint long term control of rrv at the regional scale therefore this study aims to evaluate groundwater resource safety based on a new evaluation paradigm that introduces rrv method first a set of probabilistic and conditionally probabilistic based algorithms will be used to estimate the temporal and spatial levels of rrv then spatiotemporal variation of dissolved methane in regional aquifers will be assumed to be equivalent to the operation process of a water supply reservoir within this context a new index called gas migration index gmi will be derived by combining the estimated rrv results and copula functions to identify the interrelationships among rrv the framework will be demonstrated and discussed through a shale gas reservoir located at marcellus shale of bradford county pennsylvania in the usa this study will be the first to characterize the spatiotemporal variations in rrv for groundwater systems exposed to potential shale gas contamination and enhance understanding of the groundwater risks of shale gas exploitation 2 methodology fig 1 shows the framework of this research methodology the three steps involved in the framework are summarized as follows i calculating rrv of gridded methane data over the target area ii obtaining the joint probability distribution of resilience and vulnerability using copula models and iii calculating gmi at each gridded location over the target area the formulas and procedures are presented as follows and additional details are presented in the appendix 2 1 computation of reliability resilience vulnerability rrv rrv are three important measures of system performance the concept of rrv in the context of water resource systems was established by hashimoto et al 1982 and was successfully applied into hydrological field asefa et al 2014 reliability α is defined by the probability that a system is in satisfactory state hashimoto et al 1982 a reservoir system is considered to be in satisfactory state when it satisfies the demand for which it is designed otherwise it is said to be in unsatisfactory state analogously when dissolved methane concentrations in groundwater rise over the environmental threshold ambient subsurface aquifer is recognized as high contamination risk and failure occurs it is given by 1 α p x t s where s represents satisfactory state for a given time series reliability is computed as 2 α lim n 1 n t 1 n z t where zt 1 if xt s and zt 0 if xt f here f represents failure state and n is the total number of time series resilience β describes how quickly a system will recover from failure state once failure has occurred hashimoto et al 1982 thus it is given by 3 β ρ 1 α where ρ p xt f xt 1 s p xt s xt 1 f and α p xt s for a given series resilience can be computed as 4 β lim n 1 n t 1 n wt 1 lim n z t where wt indicates the event of transformation from satisfactory to failure state or vice versa wt 1 if xt f and xt 1 s and wt 0 otherwise the resilience can also be expressed as the conditional probability of recovery from failure state that is 5 β p x t 1 s x t f vulnerability γ is a measure of the severity of damage caused by a failure event hashimoto et al 1982 defined it as 6 γ j f s j e j where s j is the numerical indicator of severity for an observation x j which belongs to unsatisfactory state e j is the probability of x j corresponding to s j which is the most unsatisfactory and severe outcome that occurs from the set of unsatisfactory states s j is interpreted as the criticality of the thresholds hierarchies here in the absence of specific knowledge about the probability e j of occurrence of an event of severity s j s j of dissolved methane is ranked by distinguishable thresholds thus e j is computed as follows 7 e j p r j x t r j 1 where rj j 1 n is the corresponding level of grade j and n represents the number of grades in the context of groundwater methane classification is evaluated in the context of its respective primary or secondary maximum contaminant limits mcls health advisory levels or other suggested levels as provided in the us epa s drinking water standards to obtain a reasonably stable estimate the time series is segmented into semiannual moving window and a series of rrv estimates is obtained during the 2 year period the reliability and resilience are expected to follow a deterministic relation as indicated in eq 3 thus the joint relationship between any of the two pairs will bear the signature of distribution characteristic for a given region chanda et al 2015 2 2 joint probability distribution of rrv using copula the interrelationship of rrv needs to be considered when establishing the joint probability distribution copula functions can couple different marginal distributions to the corresponding multivariate joint probability distribution effectively and easily because of the flexible and margin free characteristics of the method wei et al 2015 chen et al 2015 thus this function is an attractive tool for modeling the joint distribution of rrv copulas have been introduced in hydrology field for providing a realistic evaluation of risks associated to flood or drought events by characterizing multiple aspects of the hydrographs chebana and ouarda 2009 requena et al 2013 salvadori and de michele 2004 shiau et al 2006 chanda et al 2014 maity et al 2013 however the application of rrv indicators coupled with the copulas has not been practically applied in shale gas field resilience and vulnerability are found to be negatively correlated discussed in the sections below thus frank and plackett copulas are initially the two choices to capture the joint behavior between resilience and vulnerability their suitability are compared and the suitable model is selected in terms of their fitting tests with empirical copula of joint probability 2 3 computation of gmi by design gmi is a probabilistic risk index based on joint probability of resilience and vulnerability that differ from other indices gmi accounts for the readiness of a system to be able to bounce back from failure below a predefined threshold which is a factor that has not been considered in formulating risk relief and management plans in unconventional shale gas field the previous discussion indicates that more favorable conditions can be indicated with the increase in resilience by contrast conditions are less favorable with the increase in vulnerability here gas migration is identified as an unfavorable phenomenon thus the proposed index should increase with the increase in vulnerability and with the decrease in resilience and vice versa this condition can be achieved by a joint measure of probability that indicates exceedance in resilience and non exceedance in vulnerability thus the gmi is defined as 16 gm i τ loc p r r τ loc v ν τ loc where rτ loc and vτ loc are the specific values of reduced resilience and reduced vulnerability respectively for a given location loc and for a given period τ the range of gmi which is a probabilistic measure is from 0 to 1 a high value indicates high contamination risk and vice versa semiannual scale 4 blocks are selected to obtain a reasonably stable estimate of gmi for deriving fine possible temporal resolution to assess the variation in methane distribution characteristics over the successive periods of semiannual moving window gmi values can be computed to obtain the series that bears the temporal variation similarly over the different gridded locations preferably gridded such series can be computed to obtain the spatiotemporal variation of gmi 3 case study 3 1 study area and data collection the aquifers located in the marcellus shale of bradford county pennsylvania constitute the study domain for illustration gridded locations 1000 m 1000 m in the target area are obtained from global mapper the geographic positions and regionalism of the target area and its 844 gridded locations are incorporated visually in fig 2 meanwhile dissolved methane data are gathered from shale network in 2011 and 2012 and the data horizon is divided into 4 blocks of semiannual scale jan to jun in 2011 for block 1 jul to dec in 2011 for block 2 and so on for temporal variation research notably the methane database which is accessible on shale network is funded by the national science foundation to publish data about water resources that may be affected by shale gas exploitation this database contains various types of data such as surface water groundwater formation flowback and production water these data are accepted from providers with some level of quality assurance and control including volunteers who have received training from service providers in pennsylvania such as alliance for aquatic resource monitoring however information regarding the depth flow and piezometric levels of groundwater on the observation sites cannot be accessible the shale layer of the study area is middle devonian shale deposits as impermeable layer with low porosity approximately 6 10 and permeability coefficient 1 2 10 7 cm s 2 3 10 5 cm s sandstone deposits are thick in the east and black and gray shale layers are thin in the west the shale develops two groups of microfractures along the northeast and northwest areas which constitute the main pore types john 2002 scott 2009 meng and hou 2012 multiple reasons contribute to the uncertainty of water quality impact assessment including the lack of systematic surveys of water quality pre and post drilling production substantial dilution and slow transport over months to hundreds of years along flow paths from contaminated sites to private wells or public water supplies and natural fluctuations of groundwater chemistry these complexities make studies inadequate to determine a well defined groundwater impact from unconventional shale gas activities due to the lack of transparent and accessible data yan et al 2017 brantley et al 2014 on this basis monte carlo simulation based on probability and statistics theory is utilized here to augment samples through numerical simulation and uncertainty evaluation is obtained with the hypothesis that levels of dissolved methane in groundwater are primarily associated with unconventional shale gas activities after normal transformation and ordinary kriging interpolation each grid consists of 100 methane concentration data and follow an approximately normal distribution which can be simulated by monte carlo simulation to generate 1000 analogue data for precise rrv computation the thresholds used in vulnerability classifications are defined as 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 and 5 mg l with the corresponding weights of 1 2 5 10 20 and 50 respectively which are established on account of water quality standards such as primary or secondary mcls and health advisory levels the threshold in reliability and resilience formulas is set to 0 2 mg l which is assigned to distinguish satisfactory and unsatisfactory states 3 2 results and discussion 3 2 1 analysis of reliability resilience and vulnerability rrv reliability is calculated for all grids in each block by eq 2 resilience and vulnerability are obtained using eqs 4 and 6 respectively the ranges of reliability and resilience are between 0 and 1 because they are measured on the probability scale the value domain of vulnerability lies on probability based classified weighted sum assigned to each grid after normal transformation the ordinary kriging interpolation in geostatistical analysis on arcgis is utilized to gain interpolated dissolved methane concentrations and rrv levels at all grid locations in the entire domain the spatiotemporal variation characteristics indicated by dissolved methane concentrations and rrv indicators over the target area are presented in figs 3 6 fig 3 displays the spatiotemporal distributions of dissolved methane concentrations across the targeted area in blocks 1 2 3 and 4 fig 3 a b c and d represent the corresponding blocks the results suggest that the methane concentrations are consistently low 3 mg l across the area except the partial central and eastern regions between 2011 and 2012 among fig 3 a b and d high level methane concentrations 12 mg l present temporal tendency of westward migration and diffusion with gradually increasing area in fig 3 c the high level concentrations decline largely 9 mg l due to impacts from variations in various factors such as drilling locations wastewater disposal and groundwater flow in the subplots of fig 4 the spatiotemporal variation of reliability can present its distribution propensity reliability is quite high 0 7 over the southern parts and the midland remains high risk of contamination low reliability all the time the trend is in accordance with that of methane concentration distribution with regard to fig 4 a b and c low level reliability spreads to the northern and southern areas from the central parts and gradually diffuses through most grids sparsely when in block 4 reliability centralizes in the northwest area densely spatiotemporal characteristics of reliability shows some negative correlation with methane distribution primarily due to the judging criterion of satisfactory states provided by reliability additional indices are needed for detailed distinction the resilience contour maps fig 5 show spatiotemporal distributions of resilience and fig 5 b c and d refer to resilience levels between blocks 2 and 1 blocks 3 and 2 and blocks 4 and 3 respectively with parallel legends the spatiotemporal characteristics of resilience show high concordance with those of reliability except subtle discrepancies thus high positive correlation between resilience and reliability can be easily found high vulnerability grids can inflict high severity of damage when contamination events occur fig 6 a b and c shows that vulnerability estimates are rather low 10 across the study area except the middle regions the highest level vulnerability 35 has a tendency of dispersion and eastward migration in spatiotemporal variation and then disappears in block 4 the distributions of high level vulnerability 5 have similar outlines to that of low level reliability but have subtler classification due to more thresholds rrv maps have correspondence mutually in the spatiotemporal variation in some cases for further study the pairwise relationships of rrv are presented in fig 7 b c and d the labels in these scatter plots have corresponding blocks in the different blocks the distributions of reliability vulnerability and resilience vulnerability points are found to be negatively correlated with varying degrees thus the differences among copula parameters in different blocks can be interpreted in fig 7 b and c the variation ranges of data points in different periods are wider than those in fig 7 d this result is due to the strong positive correlation of reliability and resilience which causes difficulty in observing many points individually reliability and resilience are connected with eq 3 thus their relationship is deterministic in nature and they exhibit a well defined monotonic behavior that allows the specification of one given the other any one of the pairs of reliability vulnerability or resilience vulnerability can be considered into probabilistic assessment of methane migration risk through gmi chanda et al 2015 as mentioned before rrv of the events should be considered simultaneously while assessing the aqueous characteristics in this study spatiotemporal variation of gmi over the study domain using resilience and vulnerability is discussed in the following subsections for analyzing the short term migration characteristics of dissolved methane 3 2 2 analysis of gmi the relationships between vulnerability and resilience are found to be negative in fig 7 b thus their joint distribution can be derived by plackett or frank copula as discussed in the methodology first the calculated resilience and vulnerability values of each block at the same grids are used to develop the copula parameters by eqs a5 a6 and a8 their marginal distributions are fitted by appropriate distribution patterns realized by easyfit 5 6 a software package for data fitting their distribution patterns and parameters are listed in table 1 then corresponding cdfs of all grids are obtained on the basis of the probability of resilience and vulnerability by computing cross product ratio among the sample variables the dependence parameters of plackett copula in blocks 2 3 and 4 are obtained as θp2 0 0278 θp3 0 0083 and θp4 0 004 respectively subsequently the dependence parameters of frank copula in blocks 2 3 and 4 are obtained as θf2 9 7654 θf3 12 1626 and θf4 8 6598 respectively by calculating kendall tau rank correlation coefficient τ values of bivariate empirical copula are arranged in an ascending order and plotted as a solid line in fig 8 where the x coordinate represents points arranged as per the ascending order of corresponding empirical cdf corresponding to values of empirical cdf cdfs using frank and plackett copulas are also obtained by the same data these values are also plotted in fig 8 which exhibits the joint cdfs based on frank and plackett copulas and their fitting testing results using empirical cdf in block 2 their joint cdfs are too approximate to compare easily the joint cdfs of resilience and vulnerability simulated by frank copula are readily found to be close to empirical cdf in block 3 however the result is contrary in block 4 rmse and aic values of joint cdfs based on frank and plackett copulas are computed and listed in table 2 for obtaining certain conclusions statistical measures rmse and aic of frank copula are low in blocks 2 and 3 while those of plackett copula are low in block 4 as a result suitable copulas are frank frank and plackett copulas for blocks 2 3 and 4 respectively the corresponding joint cdfs of resilience and vulnerability computed by the selected copulas in respective blocks are obtained and gmi at each grid is computed from the corresponding joint cdf the spatiotemporal variation of gmi are shown by a series of gmi contour plots across the study domain in successive blocks in fig 9 gmi is found to be consistently low 0 3 in south and far north in blocks 2 and 3 this situation is a consequence of high resilience and low vulnerability high level gmi 0 6 spreads apparently over time and then spreads to the entire northwest area in block 4 this condition indicates increasing contamination risk for methane aggregation in the area because of its low resilience and high vulnerability 3 2 3 utility analysis via gmi this section illustrates that gmi which incorporates the resilience and vulnerability is better at characterizing the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of dissolved methane rather than using a single metric the amount by which the methane concentrations deviated from the minimum level required for groundwater conservation represented by thresholds is captured successfully by the gmi in situations where reliability fails to make a distinction two grid locations a and b are considered fig 10 a in block 2 these grids have the same values of reliability 0 24 and significantly different values of gmi 0 23 and 0 06 the gmi reflects the considerable difference in methane concentrations 0 29 and 0 02 mg l high gmi which indicates high contamination risk corresponds to high methane concentrations at these grids similar behavior is observed at other blocks as well thus even if the reliability of two grids is equal at a given point in time they may be exposed to different magnitudes of migration propensities as represented by their gmi in general if the methane concentrations rise in successive blocks at any particular grid then gmi increases for example at grid a fig 10a the gmi is found to rise slightly from 0 23 to 0 9 from block 2 to block 3 as a result of a rise in methane concentrations from 0 29 mg l to 1 18 mg l the aforementioned examples are straightforward but the aim of developing spatiotemporal variation of gmi is to characterize the methane migration risk of a location considering the average severity vulnerability and the chance of recovery resilience when elevated methane levels occur thus a simple rise or drop in methane concentrations does not necessarily indicate high or low contamination risk which is reflect from the gmi values in other words a rise or drop in methane concentrations is not necessarily always accompanied by a rise or drop in gmi grid c is considered where gmi rises 0 374 0 928 from block 2 to block 3 in spite of a decrease 7 83 5 42 in average methane concentrations over blocks this condition may be counter intuitive at first but a look at the methane concentrations of grid c during the concerned blocks can explain the apparent paradox in block 2 the mean value and standard deviation of grid c are 7 83 and 8 1 respectively and its corresponding rrv values calculated from simulative data are 0 164 0 167 and 4 912 respectively the mean value standard deviation and corresponding rrv of grid c during block 3 are 5 42 1 65 0 002 0 002 and 38 18 respectively contrary to block 2 the distribution of concentration data of grid c is more aggregated in high levels relatively in block 3 in spite of its lower mean concentration thus this case is characterized by low reliability and resilience for data series of grid c they spread over various levels of vulnerability classifications dispersedly in block 2 which leads to lower vulnerability than that in block 3 consequently gmi in grid c is high in block 3 which indicates great possibility of gas migration propensity 4 discussion and conclusions this study proposes a new integrated framework to evaluate groundwater resource safety by characterizing spatiotemporal variations of methane migration risk to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to integrate the concepts of probabilistic based rrv and copula functions in characterizing the groundwater system under shale gas development gmi index which is developed using rrv rationale and copula models

6174,the development of tools to help cities and water utility authorities communicate and plan for long term sustainable solutions is of utmost importance in the era of a changing and uncertain climate this study introduces a hybrid modeling concept for the cosimulation of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems and conventional urban sewer networks the hybrid model successfully introduces the retention detention effects of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems to the hydraulic dynamics of the sewer network the cosimulation package was further facilitated with a cost oriented multiobjective optimization algorithm the aim of the scalar multiobjective optimization was to minimize the total cost comprising both flooding costs and action costs both parameters solely representing the financial components of cost through optimal placement of mesoscale blue green systems of optimal size the suggested methodology provides a useful platform for sustainable management of the existing sewer networks in cities from a hydroeconomic perspective keywords blue green stormwater mesoscale macroscale urban drainage urban infrastructure optimization hybrid modeling cosimulation 1 introduction the limitation in drainage capacity and its consequent outcomes have been discussed among urban engineers since the late 19th century kuichling 1889 lloyd davies 1906 the focus on urban flooding as a serious challenge has been intensified due to the observed increase in the frequency of rainfall events pluvial floods as a result of climate change cities have struggled with the mitigation of urban flooding ever since and have recently become interested in the notion of blue green stormwater solutions also known as stormwater control measures scm however there is still no consensus in the scientific community or among the city authorities on how where and to what extent these solutions shall be implemented many large and old cities have inherited a larger proportion of their infrastructure from the far past in a changing climate it is highly desirable to sustain the functionality of the existing infrastructure and to maintain resilience in the case of natural catastrophes this is especially desirable from an economic point of view as the intensity and frequency of extreme rain events are increasing this can be done by introducing flexibility to urban infrastructure avoiding a technical lock in to solely pipe based drainage systems in addition further urbanization in terms of altered land use and further densification leads to increased impermeable surfaces compared to the situation for which the drainage system was designed this means that even under a constant climate scenario elevated flooding will still be a serious challenge considering the current urban planning and engineering practices berndtsson et al 2019 cities are trying to enhance the capacity of the drainage system by increasing the safety margins in the design criteria as well as by replacing the existing pipes with larger culverts this is done for instance by introducing climate factors to design criteria arnbjerg nielsen 2012 swwa 2016 watt et al 2003 updating intensity durationfrequency idf curves guo 2006 hailegeorgis et al 2013 lima et al 2018 mailhot et al 2007 and construction of large stormwater tunnels in cities dolowitz et al 2018 va syd 2019 such measures might be effective to some extent but in the era of a nonstationary climate as demonstrated and argued by milly et al 2008 vogel et al 2011 and liu et al 2017b manipulation of drainage capacity might not be an optimal solution a parallel solution would be to manipulate the contributing catchments by introducing retention detention capacities e g via blue green stormwater systems to modify the volume and the flow of the generated runoff azzout et al 1995 fletcher et al 2015 stahre 2006 1993 blue green stormwater systems aim to mimic a naturally oriented water cycle as well as introducing amenity by juxtaposing water and greenery in urban environments everett et al 2015 these systems combine natural hydrological and ecological values and are shown to have considerable contributions to flood mitigation bluegreencities 2019 this is done by slowing down runoff and by improving infiltration evapotranspiration detention and surface storage green roofs wet and dry ponds swales biofilters raingardens and infiltration basins are all individual solutions scms within the context of blue green stormwater management in this paper however a blue green system is defined as an interconnected group of blue green stormwater solutions or scms which can be implemented on different scales depending on the effect they are expected to deliver demuzere et al 2014 the presented definition for the blue green stormwater systems as used within the context of this paper is also regarded as sustainable drainage systems suds fletcher et al 2015 according to a classification by haghighatafshar et al 2018b blue green stormwater systems can be implemented at microscale where single and discrete blue green stormwater solutions or scms are implemented locally and the discharge from each scm is directly connected to the urban drainage network mesoscale where the blue green stormwater system is implemented as a group of tree structured scms in which the discharge from one or more scm s flows into the next immediate scm lying downstream and eventually to the recipient urban drainage network this configuration of scms is frequently referred to as suds management train kirby 2005 a detailed conceptualization of mesoscale systems is presented and discussed by haghighatafshar et al 2018a as a definition for blue green stormwater systems macroscale where blue green stormwater systems are upscaled to the city level and in a hydraulic context might have considerable effects on the functionality of the existing urban drainage network whilst acknowledging all legal and institutional obstacles berndtsson et al 2019 wihlborg et al 2019 one of the possible scenarios with respect to the realization of the macroscale blue green stormwater systems is to upscale the mesoscale blue green stormwater system i e to replicate the mesoscale blue green stormwater system in multiple locations of the city haghighatafshar et al 2018a the replication of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems in multiple locations in the city could result in the concept of sponge cities a concept and practice developed in china liu et al 2017a ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 or a macroscale blue green stormwater system haghighatafshar et al 2018a in which city surfaces are designed to contain enough infiltration retention or detention volume to overcome the consequences of flooding along with stormwater management rainwater harvesting and stormwater quality improvement zhang et al 2018 the collection of these services in the cities could potentially help survival of the highly contrasted wet and dry seasons trenberth et al 2014 that lead to floods and droughts respectively the literature available concerning the macroscale implementation of blue green stormwater systems within the context of sponge cities is increasing and different aspects of the challenge are addressed fenner and richard 2017 li et al 2019 ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for instance land availability land use population density topology and geological characteristics have been addressed for the implementation of stormwater control measures by investigating the urban morphology bach et al 2013 romnée et al 2015 there are also studies that have looked into biophysical factors as well as the sociodemographic status of urban districts for the likely implementation of blue green stormwater systems kuller et al 2016 zischg et al 2018 and cunha et al 2016 have studied how microscale scms single blue green stormwater measures and underground storage units along the pipes affect the performance of the local pipe network under design storm scenarios and have consequently recommended a placement strategy a similar study was carried out by wang et al 2017 who have optimized placement of storage tanks using a two stage approach for flood mitigation zischg et al 2019 take a step further and develop a methodology for assessing the influence of different sociotechnical pathways on the future transitions of urban drainage systems there are also studies through which microscale implementations of blue green measures in smaller urban districts are optimized eckart et al 2018 huang et al 2018 leimgruber et al 2019 furthermore investigations regarding the macroscale hydroeconomic optimization of multiple mesoscale blue green stormwater systems in interaction with the existing and mostly underground urban drainage infrastructure have recently been drawing attention in the scientific community e g bakhshipour et al 2019 glenis et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 sustaining the functionality of the existing drainage network especially the combined sewer network which is associated with basement flooding and higher health risks is a crucial subject in cities worldwide such upscaling of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems has hypothetically the potential to prevent the hydraulic overloading of the drainage network however economic consequences should also be taken into consideration since economy along with ecology and society is one of the fundamental pillars of sustainability wilkins 2008 this means that both the quantity retention volume and location of the mesoscale blue green stormwater systems i e distribution of retention volumes with respect to the existing drainage network must be investigated and optimized with regard to costs and benefits costs and benefits may in a broad context include a range of different socio ecological factors in addition to monetary financial aspects however in order to delimit the study boundaries in this paper we focus on strictly financial costs related to the implementation of blue green systems and flood hydraulics therefore the aim of this study is to develop and introduce a methodology to systematically locate mesoscale blue green stormwater systems throughout the city to achieve the lowest possible flooding damage related costs through a cost effective implementation scenario having the methodology development in focus at a large scale view a generic transfer of mesoscale blue green systems is applied in order to facilitate the theoretical siting and sizing of these systems throughout cities it should be noted that practical implementation with regard to detailed design and choice of scms according to local circumstances in each catchment e g land availability land ownership and physical characteristics of the area is left for complementing studies 2 software architecture to perform the optimization study cosimulation of physical rainfall runoff processes encompassing three different domains was structured these domains were d1 hydrological simulation of conventional catchments d2 hydrological and hydraulic simulation of blue green catchments d3 hydrodynamic simulation of the sewer system loaded by the results from domains d1 and d2 to manage the cosimulation of these three domains a hybrid model consisting of two modules hydrological and hydraulic was constructed domains d1 and d2 are included in the hydrological module whereas domain d3 is simulated under the hydraulic module the model concerning the simulation of the mesoscale blue green system domain d2 is the model developed and presented in detail by haghighatafshar et al 2019 while the rainfall runoff engine of mike urban by dhi was employed for the hydrological simulation of conventional catchments domain d1 the mesoscale blue green model mesobgm introduced by haghighatafshar et al 2019 simulates the hydrograph of the discharge from a mesoscale blue green stormwater system this discharge is then accumulated with mike urban s rainfall runoff mike rr output and is introduced as the input to the 1d mike urban hydrodynamic simulation model mike hd mike operations by dhi were employed as the cosimulation platform to facilitate communication between the three models i e mesobgm mike rr and mike hd the suggested algorithm implemented in mike operations is presented in fig 1 encompassing four major modules user defined automated feed where the parameter sets for the definition of catchments as well as the system parameters are managed hydrological module for calculation of the hydrological load d1 and d2 hydraulic module for assessing the performance of the drainage network d3 optimization module for performing the optimization based on the cost benefit assessment the characteristics of the urban catchment in the joint model are defined in the user defined automated feed block which is in turn fed into the hydrological module the estimation of model parameters for d1 is performed according to the standard procedure recommended by the swedish water and wastewater association swwa 2016 whereas the characteristics of the mesoscale blue green stormwater system d2 are defined according to haghighatafshar et al 2019 in addition to network setup runoff coefficients time area curves retention volumes etc the introduced feed also consists of the blue green retrofit area a bg i in the i th subcatchment with a total area of a sc i based on the introduced feed d1 and d2 generate hydrological load schemes denoted as q mu i and q bg i time series respectively in which the contributing area to q mu i is a sc i a bg i in the next stage the overall hydrologic load total runoff q tr as a cumulated time series is calculated according to eq 1 1 q tr i 1 n q mu i q bg i this means that the discharge from the mesoscale blue green system is still connected to the sewer network the cumulative total flow q tr is then introduced as the network load to the mike hd model d3 through which 1d saint venant s mass and momentum equations are applied for the computation of flow q and piezometric pressure hydraulic head h in the pipes dhi 2017 the ground level in the context of a separate sewer network and the basement level in the context of a combined sewer network for each manhole can be used to define a critical hydraulic head h cr at which exceedance can be interpreted as flooding it should also be noted that the 0d 1d nature of the hybrid model made it appropriate for performing numerous large scale simulations in terms of simulation time and computational costs 2 1 the optimization module as shown in fig 1 optimization is performed with regard to flood economics the basic idea is that the investment in flood mitigation measures would lead to lower flood damage costs hence these two parameters i e investment in measures and maintenance cost of action act and flood damage cost flood can be incorporated into a scalar cost function however it is necessary that these costs are quantified according to the specific perspective of the stakeholder who performs the optimization e g insurance companies water utility companies municipalities or government note that additional socio ecological benefits associated with blue green stormwater systems are not included in this study incorporation of monetized and quantified added socio ecological values would presumably have strong impacts on optimization results the annual cost of action and flood damage cost are calculated according to eqs 2 and 3 respectively as follows 2 c a c t f a b g u c b g i l a b g c b g i 1 i l 1 i l 1 m l l 0 l 1 1 α l where a b g u is the total area of the retrofitted blue green stormwater

standard assumption in infrastructure investments m is the annual maintenance cost α is the average annual pay raise 2 and i is the average interest rate 3 a similar approach for computing the annual cost of action was also adopted by huang et al 2018 3 c f l o o d f n f n u c f n i t c f n n f n u i 1 i t 1 where n f n u is the number of flooded manholes in scenario u c f n is the average damage

during t years assuming that the flood recurrence follows the recurrence period of the rainfall event using a sinking fund factor blank and tarquin 2012 subsequently a scalar total cost function can be introduced eq 4 this total cost function eq 4 is later incorporated in the scalar multiobjective to determine a scenario matrix u resulting in the minimum possible cost 4 φ u c act u c flood u where u is the scenario matrix representing the implementation extent of the blue green stormwater system in different sub catchments for instance in a drainage model with k subcatchments u can be

blue green stormwater systems in an urban catchment drained through a combined sewer network this case study presents an example of how the developed methodology can be employed to enhance and understand the functionality of urban drainage systems 3 1 study area malmö sweden malmö is the 3rd largest city in sweden located in the southern part of the country and is populated by over 330 000 people malmö stad 2018 the drainage network in the city is mainly dominated by a combined sewer system in densely built central areas while in the suburbs mainly separate sewer networks are functional this study focuses specifically on the combined sewer network and its corresponding catchment the reason is that the city has been struck by extreme rainfall events several times and has undergone a relatively large burden of expenses due to basement flooding in the combined sewer network catchments haghighatafshar et al 2014 sörensen and mobini 2017 for this study part of the combined sewer network and its corresponding catchment which is drained into the turbinen pump station in malmö was selected as shown in fig 2 the pump station receives combined sewer flows from two separate catchments namely the west catchment and the east catchment drained from the south and southeast respectively toward the pump station more information about the distribution of the combined and separate sewer networks in malmö can be found in haghighatafshar et al 2018b and sörensen and mobini 2017 the fundamental approach in this study is to replicate the mesoscale blue green system in augustenborg as the reference mesoscale retrofit described in haghighatafshar et al 2019 2018a to achieve an optimized upscaling scenario augustenborg comprises two major mesoscale blue green stormwater systems one each in the south southern system implemented 1999 2001 with a drainage area of roughly 9 6 ha and north northern system implemented 2002 2003 with a drainage area of approximately 6 3 ha in addition a separate local stormwater pipe system was constructed in 2003 covering a drainage area of about 3 5 ha these three subsystems of augustenborg are illustrated in fig 3 for more information about the configuration of the mesoscale blue green stormwater systems in augustenborg refer to haghighatafshar et al 2019 2018a in this study it is assumed that the southern system in augustenborg accounting for a total drainage area of 9 6 ha a aug can be replicated as a scaled retrofit depending on the area of the target catchment in other words the configuration in augustenborg with regard to the drainage area retention detention volumes and infiltration capacities can be linearly upsized downsized to fit in the target catchment at various implementation extents f bg i in this way two major simplifications are introduced into the modeling process first there is no need to design and simulate specific systems based on local circumstances for each and every target catchment second the original shape and form of the output hydrograph from augustenborg qaug is retained intact while values are manipulated by factor ξ i upsizing and downsizing the augustenborg system is performed according to the equations below 7 ξ i a bg i a aug 8 q tr i q mu q bg q frc i 1 f bg i q src i q ww i ξ i q aug where a bg is the area occupied by the blue green

infiltration and q tr total runoff to be handled by the pipe network 3 2 the optimization problem the goal of the unconstrained bounded optimization problem was to minimize the total cost of flooded nodes flood and the cost of implementation of the blue green systems based on the augustenborg system act the cost of flooded nodes was expressed using the average cost per flooded node cfn based on a rough assessment of the available data from the extensive flooding in malmö in 2014 thus flood in the case of a 10 year rainfall event as employed in this study was estimated at 47 000 sek year flooded node and act including maintenance was estimated to be 110 000 sek year retrofitted area during the 50 year lifespan of the built system it should be noted that these values are preliminary assessments and cannot be considered as verified template costs in other contexts the cost of action was assumed to be linear with respect to the area of the constructed blue green systems as described in eqs 2 and 3 and the costs were then combined according to eq 4 a performance indicator pi was then constructed and used as the objective for the optimization to more easily discern whether a tested solution is cheaper than the reference case pi 0 or worse pi 0 the 1d model area was divided into 30 different subcatchments as presented in table 1 and fig 4 in other words the optimization space to be investigated was a high dimensional space with 30 dimensions corresponding to the 30 decision variables that the subcatchments constitute the implementation extent of each catchment f bg i defined in eqs 5 and 6 was used as decision variables the decision variables were bounded by the characteristics of the catchments by setting the bounds to 0 1 representing catchments that are empty or full or in between with regards to the blue green systems with the reference case of no implemented blue green solutions i e φ ref c f l o o d 0 the full optimization problem was expressed as min p i φ u φ ref φ ref w r t u f bg 1 f bg k s t f bg i 0 1 for i 1 2 k 4 results and discussion the optimization problem was solved using the scipy implementation of the algorithm known as constrained optimization by linear approximation cobyla which is a derivative free method conn et al 1997 powell 1994 the optimization was performed for a chicago design storm cds keifer and chu 1957 with a recurrence interval of 10 years denoted as 10y cds the initial values for the decision variables were the reference case i e f bg i 0 in the reference case the water level in 779 manholes was over the average basement level assumed to be 1 3 m below the ground level leading to basement flooding the spatial distribution of the flooded manholes model nodes is illustrated in fig 5 after the simulation of the reference case scenario the optimization process under the 10y cds continues to locate an optimum local minimum for φ u according to the design of the cobyla algorithm fig 6 is a two dimensional illustration of approximately 100 iterations as shown in fig 6 the optimization started with the reference scenario and all subsequent iterations are presented in the clockwise order the first 30 iterations have an average pi value of approximately 0 04 increased costs the optimization continues with systematic alterations in the implementation extents and moves toward an average pi of approximately 0 01 decreased costs and ultimately finds an optimal solution with a pi of almost 0 03 and 714 flooded nodes the results of the optimization process suggested that subcatchments 1 and 19 should be transformed to mesoscale blue green stormwater systems at 56 6 10 ha and 63 6 8 5 ha respectively based on this optimization the total cost of a 10y cds event will be 3 lower than the cost of flooding under the reference case scenario this shows that there is at least one scenario through which implementation of blue green stormwater systems would lead to less overall costs i e the sum of action and flood costs than the reference case scenario although the financial benefit is limited in the optimized scenario the total number of the flooded nodes is decreased by approximately 8 5 the green nodes in fig 7 show the spatial distribution of 65 nodes that do not flood in the optimized scenario compared to the reference it is also interesting to note that the majority of the saved nodes 44 nodes lie within the boundaries of the optimally retrofitted subcatchments i e 1 and 19 while the rest 21 nodes are in other subcatchments with f bg i 0 this shows that the benefits of mesoscale blue green retrofits are not limited to the retrofit boundaries although economic savings 3 are modest it should be noted that this value exclusively represents the monetary and financial aspects of the action however from a cost benefit perspective the value of the blue green systems is much more comprehensive and may include aesthetics societal add ons in terms of human well being amenity and promoted biodiversity in this respect tools for monetization and quantification of multiple benefits of blue green stormwater systems such as best ashley et al 2016 2018 are becoming widely available these tools can be employed and adapted to local contexts in order to enhance the decision making process as seen in fig 6 there is one iteration marked with d that despite introduced blue green retrofits leading to elevated costs by approximately 8 the number of flooded nodes has increased to 789 compared to the reference scenario 779 flooded nodes an explanation for this deteriorated behavior is that in the complex system of catchment sewer interactions even detained and retained discharges from catchments can possibly coincide with some peak discharge along the way causing elevated hydraulic head and hence flooding this agrees with the recommendation by haghighatafshar et al 2018b who advise the implementation of blue green stormwater retrofits in the upstream areas of a city catchment to avoid or decrease the risk of deteriorative flow coincidences the deteriorated flood situation despite the introduction of blue green stormwater systems is an indication that unoptimized retrofits of blue green systems in which the discharge is connected to the same sewer network do not necessarily improve the hydraulic performance of the network the same phenomenon could also occur when rainfalls other than the optimization rainfall with different hyetograph characteristics strike thus there might be situations through which a different rainfall would lead to different times of concentration and lag times so that the aforementioned unprecedented flow coincidences and flooding occur a safe retrofitting strategy would thus be the total separation of the blue green stormwater retrofits through which the overflow from the system does not enter the original sewer network but is diverted into a separate stormwater pipe network as is the case for augustenborg see fig 4 further research must be performed to achieve a better understanding of the complex behavior of sewer networks a sensitivity analysis was conducted according to the one factor at a time ofat method with respect to a c t and f l o o d in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the pi to the quality of the cost estimation it should be noted that different perturbations to c f n c b g and m were performed as f l o o d is directly proportional to c f n and a c t is directly proportional to c b g m provided c b g and m are simultaneously and identically perturbed all else unchanged in effect perturbations to the action cost and flooding cost as well as their simultaneous perturbation i e φ u were performed ranging from 50 to 50 all other parameters such as the hydrological characteristics of the toolchain total retrofitted blue green area and number of flooded manholes were kept unchanged the resulting outcomes of these perturbations with regard to the delivered pi are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the pi is extremely sensitive to the estimation of f l o o d rather than a c t for instance it is observed that a reduced cost of flooding by 30 would enhance the pi by a factor of 10 from 0 03 to 0 3 while the corresponding pi change in the case of perturbations in a c t is negligible this is also reflected in the simultaneous perturbation of the costs both cost of action and cost of flood as it is in strong agreement with the sensitivity to f l o o d only however the provided results do not necessarily imply that the quality of the estimated cost of action implementation and maintenance of the blue green systems has a trivial impact on the optimization outcome the small impact of a c t on the pi is mainly due to the fixed blue green scenario the scenario presented in fig 7 under which all perturbations are tested as noted in fig 7 the retrofitted area is relatively small in comparison to the reference case approximately 2 of the total modeled catchment area while the proportion of the flooded manholes in the optimized scenario compared to the reference scenario is approximately 92 this specific optimized setup thus underlines the importance of estimation of f l o o d opposed to act however it is highly anticipated that perturbations in either of the associated costs or both would result in substantial changes in the outcome of the optimization process regarding the returned optimal f bg i matrix as well as the pi further investigations must be carried out to study the direct sensitivity of the optimization process to deviations and errors in the estimated cost components 5 concluding remarks a hybrid model was structured to run cosimulations of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems and the pipe bound sewerage network the model was subsequently facilitated with an optimization algorithm to suggest hydroeconomically optimal solutions for citywide siting and sizing of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems the developed software package was tested on a city scale catchment drained through a combined sewer system the model delivered satisfactory results concerning promoted hydraulic performance of the sewer network in terms of decreased flooded nodes and financial gains however locating the global optimum remains a challenge due to the extremely high dimensionality of the optimization space given these circumstances the model performance was shown to fulfill the general aim of the study further research is required to improve the optimization process and move the solution toward a global optimum this can be done by employment of different gradient free optimization techniques such as evolutionary or simulated annealing algorithms or by employing algorithms that make use of formulated analytical jacobians there is also the possibility to implement decision variable selection techniques to decrease the dimensionality of the decision space moreover there are indications that the performance of the optimized scenario might be specifically valid for the exact rainfall hyetograph for which the model is optimized this also remains a serious challenge considering the stochastic nature of rainfalls and the complexity of sewer networks it is also implied that random sizing and siting of blue green retrofits without investigating the hydraulic consequences on the existing sewer network could lead to deterioration in the performance of the sewer network in terms of the number of flooded nodes credit authorship contribution statement salar haghighatafshar conceptualization

6174,the development of tools to help cities and water utility authorities communicate and plan for long term sustainable solutions is of utmost importance in the era of a changing and uncertain climate this study introduces a hybrid modeling concept for the cosimulation of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems and conventional urban sewer networks the hybrid model successfully introduces the retention detention effects of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems to the hydraulic dynamics of the sewer network the cosimulation package was further facilitated with a cost oriented multiobjective optimization algorithm the aim of the scalar multiobjective optimization was to minimize the total cost comprising both flooding costs and action costs both parameters solely representing the financial components of cost through optimal placement of mesoscale blue green systems of optimal size the suggested methodology provides a useful platform for sustainable management of the existing sewer networks in cities from a hydroeconomic perspective keywords blue green stormwater mesoscale macroscale urban drainage urban infrastructure optimization hybrid modeling cosimulation 1 introduction the limitation in drainage capacity and its consequent outcomes have been discussed among urban engineers since the late 19th century kuichling 1889 lloyd davies 1906 the focus on urban flooding as a serious challenge has been intensified due to the observed increase in the frequency of rainfall events pluvial floods as a result of climate change cities have struggled with the mitigation of urban flooding ever since and have recently become interested in the notion of blue green stormwater solutions also known as stormwater control measures scm however there is still no consensus in the scientific community or among the city authorities on how where and to what extent these solutions shall be implemented many large and old cities have inherited a larger proportion of their infrastructure from the far past in a changing climate it is highly desirable to sustain the functionality of the existing infrastructure and to maintain resilience in the case of natural catastrophes this is especially desirable from an economic point of view as the intensity and frequency of extreme rain events are increasing this can be done by introducing flexibility to urban infrastructure avoiding a technical lock in to solely pipe based drainage systems in addition further urbanization in terms of altered land use and further densification leads to increased impermeable surfaces compared to the situation for which the drainage system was designed this means that even under a constant climate scenario elevated flooding will still be a serious challenge considering the current urban planning and engineering practices berndtsson et al 2019 cities are trying to enhance the capacity of the drainage system by increasing the safety margins in the design criteria as well as by replacing the existing pipes with larger culverts this is done for instance by introducing climate factors to design criteria arnbjerg nielsen 2012 swwa 2016 watt et al 2003

is a crucial subject in cities worldwide such upscaling of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems has hypothetically the potential to prevent the hydraulic overloading of the drainage network however economic consequences should also be taken into consideration since economy along with ecology and society is one of the fundamental pillars of sustainability wilkins 2008 this means that both the quantity retention volume and location of the mesoscale blue green stormwater systems i e distribution of retention volumes with respect to the existing drainage network must be investigated and optimized with regard to costs and benefits costs and benefits may in a broad context include a range of different socio ecological factors in addition to monetary financial aspects however in order to delimit the study boundaries in this paper we focus on strictly financial costs related to the implementation of blue green systems and flood hydraulics therefore the aim of this study is to develop and introduce a methodology to systematically locate mesoscale blue green stormwater systems throughout the city to achieve the lowest possible flooding damage related costs through a cost effective implementation scenario having the methodology development in focus at a large scale view a generic transfer of mesoscale blue green systems is applied in order to facilitate the theoretical siting and sizing of these systems throughout cities it should be noted that practical implementation with regard to detailed design and choice of scms according to local circumstances in each catchment e g land availability land ownership and physical characteristics of the area is left for complementing studies 2 software architecture to perform the optimization study cosimulation of physical rainfall runoff processes encompassing three different domains was structured these domains were d1 hydrological simulation of conventional catchments d2 hydrological and hydraulic simulation of blue green catchments d3 hydrodynamic simulation of the sewer system loaded by the results from domains d1 and d2 to manage the cosimulation of these three domains a hybrid model consisting of two modules hydrological and hydraulic was constructed domains d1 and d2 are included in the hydrological module whereas domain d3 is simulated under the hydraulic module the model concerning the simulation of the mesoscale blue green system domain d2 is the model developed and presented in detail by haghighatafshar et al 2019 while the rainfall runoff engine of mike urban by dhi was employed for the hydrological simulation of conventional catchments domain d1 the mesoscale blue green model mesobgm introduced by haghighatafshar et al 2019 simulates the hydrograph of the discharge from a mesoscale blue green stormwater system this discharge is then accumulated with mike urban s rainfall runoff mike rr output and is introduced as the input to the 1d mike urban hydrodynamic simulation model mike hd mike operations by dhi were employed as the cosimulation platform to facilitate communication between the three models i e mesobgm mike rr and mike hd the suggested algorithm implemented in mike operations is presented in fig 1 encompassing four major modules user defined automated feed where the parameter sets for the definition of catchments as well as the system parameters are managed hydrological module for calculation of the hydrological load d1 and d2 hydraulic module for assessing the performance of the drainage network d3 optimization module for performing the optimization based on the cost benefit assessment the characteristics of the urban catchment in the joint model are defined in the user defined automated feed block which is in turn fed into the hydrological module the estimation of model parameters for d1 is performed according to the standard procedure recommended by the swedish water and wastewater association swwa 2016 whereas the characteristics of the mesoscale blue green stormwater system d2 are defined according to haghighatafshar et al 2019 in addition to network setup runoff coefficients time area curves retention volumes etc the introduced feed also consists of the blue green retrofit area a bg i in the i th subcatchment with a total area of a sc i based on the introduced feed d1 and d2 generate hydrological load schemes denoted as q mu i and q bg i time series respectively in which the contributing area to q mu i is a sc i a bg i in the next stage the overall hydrologic load total runoff q tr as a cumulated time series is calculated according to eq 1 1 q tr i 1 n q mu i q bg i this means that the discharge from the mesoscale blue green system is still connected to the sewer network the cumulative total flow q tr is then introduced as the network load to the mike hd model d3 through which 1d saint venant s mass and momentum equations are applied for the computation of flow q and piezometric pressure hydraulic head h in the pipes dhi 2017 the ground level in the context of a separate sewer network and the basement level in the context of a combined sewer network for each manhole can be used to define a critical hydraulic head h cr at which exceedance can be interpreted as flooding it should also be noted that the 0d 1d nature of the hybrid model made it appropriate for performing numerous large scale simulations in terms of simulation time and computational costs 2 1 the optimization module as shown in fig 1 optimization is performed with regard to flood economics the basic idea is that the investment in flood mitigation measures would lead to lower flood damage costs hence these two parameters i e investment in measures and maintenance cost of action act and flood damage cost flood can be incorporated into a scalar cost function however it is necessary that these costs are quantified according to the specific perspective of the stakeholder who performs the optimization e g insurance companies water utility companies municipalities or government note that additional socio ecological benefits associated with blue green stormwater systems are not included in this study incorporation of monetized and quantified added socio ecological values would presumably have strong impacts on optimization results the annual cost of action and flood damage cost are calculated according to eqs 2 and 3 respectively as follows 2 c a c t f a b g u c b g i l a b g c b g i 1 i l 1 i l 1 m l l 0 l 1 1 α l where a b g u is the total area of the retrofitted blue green stormwater system ha according to scenario u c b g is the average cost of blue green stormwater retrofits per hectare sek ha l is the technical lifespan of the constructed system 50 years which is the local standard assumption in infrastructure investments m is the annual maintenance cost α is the average annual pay raise 2 and i is the average interest rate 3 a similar approach for computing the annual cost of action was also adopted by huang et al 2018 3 c f l o o d f n f n u c f n i t c f n n f n u i 1 i t 1 where n f n u is the number of flooded manholes in scenario u c f n is the average damage cost per flooded manhole sek manhole t is the recurrence interval of the optimization storm years and i is the average interest rate 3 eq 2 represents the uniform annual worth of the investment in

during t years assuming that the flood recurrence follows the recurrence period of the rainfall event using a sinking fund factor blank and tarquin 2012 subsequently a scalar total cost function can be introduced eq 4 this total cost function eq 4 is later incorporated in the scalar multiobjective to determine a scenario matrix u resulting in the minimum possible cost 4 φ u c act u c flood u where u is the scenario matrix representing the implementation extent of the blue green stormwater system in different sub catchments for instance in a drainage model with k subcatchments u can be

blue green stormwater systems in an urban catchment drained through a combined sewer network this case study presents an example of how the developed methodology can be employed to enhance and understand the functionality of urban drainage systems 3 1 study area malmö sweden malmö is the 3rd largest city in sweden located in the southern part of the country and is populated by over 330 000 people malmö stad 2018 the drainage network in the city is mainly dominated by a combined sewer system in densely built central areas while in the suburbs mainly separate sewer networks are functional this study focuses specifically on the combined sewer network and its corresponding catchment the reason is that the city has been struck by extreme rainfall events several times and has undergone a relatively large burden of expenses due to basement flooding in the combined sewer network catchments haghighatafshar et al 2014 sörensen and mobini 2017 for this study part of the combined sewer network and its corresponding catchment which is drained into the turbinen pump station in malmö was selected as shown in fig 2 the pump station receives combined sewer flows from two separate catchments namely the west catchment and the east catchment drained from the south and southeast respectively toward the pump station more information about the distribution of the combined and separate sewer networks in malmö can be found in haghighatafshar et al 2018b and sörensen and mobini 2017 the fundamental approach in this study is to replicate the mesoscale blue green system in augustenborg as the reference mesoscale retrofit described in haghighatafshar et al 2019 2018a to achieve an optimized upscaling scenario augustenborg comprises two major mesoscale blue green stormwater systems one each in the south southern system implemented 1999 2001 with a drainage area of roughly 9 6 ha and north northern system implemented 2002 2003 with a drainage area of approximately 6 3 ha in addition a separate local stormwater pipe system was constructed in 2003 covering a drainage area of about 3 5 ha these three subsystems of augustenborg are illustrated in fig 3 for more information about the configuration of the mesoscale blue green stormwater systems in augustenborg refer to haghighatafshar et al 2019 2018a in this study it is assumed that the southern system in augustenborg accounting for a total drainage area of 9 6 ha a aug can be replicated as a scaled retrofit depending on the area of the target catchment in other words the configuration in augustenborg with regard to the drainage area retention detention volumes and infiltration capacities can be linearly upsized downsized to fit in the target catchment at various implementation extents f bg i in this way two major simplifications are introduced into the modeling process first there is no need to design and simulate specific systems based on local circumstances for each and every target catchment second the original shape and form of the output hydrograph from augustenborg qaug is retained intact while values are manipulated by factor ξ i upsizing and downsizing the augustenborg system is performed according to the equations below 7 ξ i a bg i a aug 8 q tr i q mu q bg q frc i 1 f bg i q src i q ww i ξ i q aug where a bg is the area occupied by the blue green

infiltration and q tr total runoff to be handled by the pipe network 3 2 the optimization problem the goal of the unconstrained bounded optimization problem was to minimize the total cost of flooded nodes flood and the cost of implementation of the blue green systems based on the augustenborg system act the cost of flooded nodes was expressed using the average cost per flooded node cfn based on a rough assessment of the available data from the extensive flooding in malmö in 2014 thus flood in the case of a 10 year rainfall event as employed in this study was estimated at 47 000 sek year flooded node and act including maintenance was estimated to be 110 000 sek year retrofitted area during the 50 year lifespan of the built system it should be noted that these values are preliminary assessments and cannot be considered as verified template costs in other contexts the cost of action was assumed to be linear with respect to the area of the constructed blue green systems as described in eqs 2 and 3 and the costs were then combined according to eq 4 a performance indicator pi was then constructed and used as the objective for the optimization to more easily discern whether a tested solution is cheaper than the reference case pi 0 or worse pi 0 the 1d model area was divided into 30 different subcatchments as presented in table 1 and fig 4 in other words the optimization space to be investigated was a high dimensional space with 30 dimensions corresponding to the 30 decision variables that the subcatchments constitute the implementation extent of each catchment f bg i defined in eqs 5 and 6 was used as decision variables the decision variables were bounded by the characteristics of the catchments by setting the bounds to 0 1 representing catchments that are empty or full or in between with regards to the blue green systems with the reference case of no implemented blue green solutions i e φ ref c f l o o d 0 the full optimization problem was expressed as min p i φ u φ ref φ ref w r t u f bg 1 f bg k s t f bg i 0 1 for i 1 2 k 4 results and discussion the optimization problem was solved using the scipy implementation of the algorithm known as constrained optimization by linear approximation cobyla which is a derivative free method conn et al 1997 powell 1994 the optimization was performed for a chicago design storm cds keifer and chu 1957 with a recurrence interval of 10 years denoted as 10y cds the initial values for the decision variables were the reference case i e f bg i 0 in the reference case the water level in 779 manholes was over the average basement level assumed to be 1 3 m below the ground level leading to basement flooding the spatial distribution of the flooded manholes model nodes is illustrated in fig 5 after the simulation of the reference case scenario the optimization process under the 10y cds continues to locate an optimum local minimum for φ u according to the design of the cobyla algorithm fig 6 is a two dimensional illustration of approximately 100 iterations as shown in fig 6 the optimization started with the reference scenario and all subsequent iterations are presented in the clockwise order the first 30 iterations have an average pi value of approximately 0 04 increased costs the optimization continues with systematic alterations in the implementation extents and moves toward an average pi of approximately 0 01 decreased costs and ultimately finds an optimal solution with a pi of almost 0 03 and 714 flooded nodes the results of the optimization process suggested that subcatchments 1 and 19 should be transformed to mesoscale blue green stormwater systems at 56 6 10 ha and 63 6 8 5 ha respectively based on this optimization the total cost of a 10y cds event will be 3 lower than the cost of flooding under the reference case scenario this shows that there is at least one scenario through which implementation of blue green stormwater systems would lead to less overall costs i e the sum of action and flood costs than the reference case scenario although the financial benefit is limited in the optimized scenario the total number of the flooded nodes is decreased by approximately 8 5 the green nodes in fig 7 show the spatial distribution of 65 nodes that do not flood in the optimized scenario compared to the reference it is also interesting to note that the majority of the saved nodes 44 nodes lie within the boundaries of the optimally retrofitted subcatchments i e 1 and 19 while the rest 21 nodes are in other subcatchments with f bg i 0 this shows that the benefits of mesoscale blue green retrofits are not limited to the retrofit boundaries although economic savings 3 are modest it should be noted that this value exclusively represents the monetary and financial aspects of the action however from a cost benefit perspective the value of the blue green systems is much more comprehensive and may include aesthetics societal add ons in terms of human well being amenity and promoted biodiversity in this respect tools for monetization and quantification of multiple benefits of blue green stormwater systems such as best ashley et al 2016 2018 are becoming widely available these tools can be employed and adapted to local contexts in order to enhance the decision making process as seen in fig 6 there is one iteration marked with d that despite introduced blue green retrofits leading to elevated costs by approximately 8 the number of flooded nodes has increased to 789 compared to the reference scenario 779 flooded nodes an explanation for this deteriorated behavior is that in the complex system of catchment sewer interactions even detained and retained discharges from catchments can possibly coincide with some peak discharge along the way causing elevated hydraulic head and hence flooding this agrees with the recommendation by haghighatafshar et al 2018b who advise the implementation of blue green stormwater retrofits in the upstream areas of a city catchment to avoid or decrease the risk of deteriorative flow coincidences the deteriorated flood situation despite the introduction of blue green stormwater systems is an indication that unoptimized retrofits of blue green systems in which the discharge is connected to the same sewer network do not necessarily improve the hydraulic performance of the network the same phenomenon could also occur when rainfalls other than the optimization rainfall with different hyetograph characteristics strike thus there might be situations through which a different rainfall would lead to different times of concentration and lag times so that the aforementioned unprecedented flow coincidences and flooding occur a safe retrofitting strategy would thus be the total separation of the blue green stormwater retrofits through which the overflow from the system does not enter the original sewer network but is diverted into a separate stormwater pipe network as is the case for augustenborg see fig 4 further research must be performed to achieve a better understanding of the complex behavior of sewer networks a sensitivity analysis was conducted according to the one factor at a time ofat method with respect to a c t and f l o o d in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the pi to the quality of the cost estimation it should be noted that different perturbations to c f n c b g and m were performed as f l o o d is directly proportional to c f n and a c t is directly proportional to c b g m provided c b g and m are simultaneously and identically perturbed all else unchanged in effect perturbations to the action cost and flooding cost as well as their simultaneous perturbation i e φ u were performed ranging from 50 to 50 all other parameters such as the hydrological characteristics of the toolchain total retrofitted blue green area and number of flooded manholes were kept unchanged the resulting outcomes of these perturbations with regard to the delivered pi are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the pi is extremely sensitive to the estimation of f l o o d rather than a c t for instance it is observed that a reduced cost of flooding by 30 would enhance the pi by a factor of 10 from 0 03 to 0 3 while the corresponding pi change in the case of perturbations in a c t is negligible this is also reflected in the simultaneous perturbation of the costs both cost of action and cost of flood as it is in strong agreement with the sensitivity to f l o o d only however the provided results do not necessarily imply that the quality of the estimated cost of action implementation and maintenance of the blue green systems has a trivial impact on the optimization outcome the small impact of a c t on the pi is mainly due to the fixed blue green scenario the scenario presented in fig 7 under which all perturbations are tested as noted in fig 7 the retrofitted area is relatively small in comparison to the reference case approximately 2 of the total modeled catchment area while the proportion of the flooded manholes in the optimized scenario compared to the reference scenario is approximately 92 this specific optimized setup thus underlines the importance of estimation of f l o o d opposed to act however it is highly anticipated that perturbations in either of the associated costs or both would result in substantial changes in the outcome of the optimization process regarding the returned optimal f bg i matrix as well as the pi further investigations must be carried out to study the direct sensitivity of the optimization process to deviations and errors in the estimated cost components 5 concluding remarks a hybrid model was structured to run cosimulations of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems and the pipe bound sewerage network the model was subsequently facilitated with an optimization algorithm to suggest hydroeconomically optimal solutions for citywide siting and sizing of mesoscale blue green stormwater systems the developed software package was tested on a city scale catchment drained through a combined sewer system the model delivered satisfactory results concerning promoted hydraulic performance of the sewer network in terms of decreased flooded nodes and financial gains however locating the global optimum remains a challenge due to the extremely high dimensionality of the optimization space given these circumstances the model performance was shown to fulfill the general aim of the study further research is required to improve the optimization process and move the solution toward a global optimum this can be done by employment of different gradient free optimization techniques such as evolutionary or simulated annealing algorithms or by employing algorithms that make use of formulated analytical jacobians there is also the possibility to implement decision variable selection techniques to decrease the dimensionality of the decision space moreover there are indications that the performance of the optimized scenario might be specifically valid for the exact rainfall hyetograph for which the model is optimized this also remains a serious challenge considering the stochastic nature of rainfalls and the complexity of sewer networks it is also implied that random sizing and siting of blue green retrofits without investigating the hydraulic consequences on the existing sewer network could lead to deterioration in the performance of the sewer network in terms of the number of flooded nodes credit authorship contribution statement salar haghighatafshar conceptualization
