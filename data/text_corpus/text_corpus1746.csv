8730,in the water industry an accurate estimation of end use water consumption is helpful for the implementation of efficient water systems and water saving technologies this study aimed to explore the characteristics of water consumption at nine households north of amsterdam the netherlands subjected to water consumption monitoring at high temporal resolution i e 1 s overall 36 297 water use events monitored over about 447 days were automatically segmented into 44 115 individual events by means of a new rule based filtering algorithm and then labelled by expert analysts a multi stage analysis was then conducted in order to evaluate daily per capita end use water consumption daily end use profiles average end use parameter average and their statistical distributions the results achieved provide insight into the features of end use consumption confirming that the largest components are typically related to showers bathtubs toilets and washing machines whereas different end use parameter distributions can emerge keywords water end uses water consumption combined event segmentation individual event labelling daily profiles end use parameters data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water distribution systems are being ever more stressed due to climate change population growth and urbanization which are increasingly influencing water availability in several regions 1 4 periodic water shortage has already affected hundreds of millions of people in areas where there is no longer a balance between water supply and demand 5 6 leading to a progressive depletion of the available water resources in this context strategies have to be adopted to cope with water shortages and ensure water availability to future generations 7 8 these can range from imposing water use restrictions to controlling leakages revising water pricing tailoring water rates introducing smart water policies promoting incentives for the installation of efficient appliances or adoption of water reuse technologies informing and educating 9 11 however most of the above mentioned strategies to increase water system efficiency and resiliency cannot generally be implemented if an accurate estimation of water consumption i e an in depth knowledge of water consumption drivers and variations in space and time is not available 12 16 therefore in recent years many studies have been conducted with the aim of exploring the characteristics of water consumption they have demonstrated that consumption is typically affected by a variety of climatic geographic economic sociodemographic and behavioural factors 17 19 by way of example studies exploring climatic drivers of water consumption reveal that the latter can be significantly affected by rainfall and temperature 20 25 whereas the scarce availability of water resources in some geographical contexts can directly limit the amount of water consumed by users 26 28 moreover the influence of economic or sociodemographic factors such as income water prices occupation and level of education has been proved 29 33 behavioural factors may have impacts on water consumption as well in greater detail it has been widely shown that water demand is generally characterized by a daily or weekly pattern reflecting people s typical habits and lifestyles 31 34 37 however the way in which people consume water may be significantly altered by emergency situations disasters or exceptional circumstances as demonstrated for example by a number of studies exploring how the restrictive measures recently imposed in many countries to prevent the spread of covid 19 have impacted on water use 38 41 in the last two decades a noteworthy contribution to the investigation of water consumption and its drivers has been given by smart metering specifically smart meters have made water consumption data available at very high spatial and temporal resolutions i e up to the user or end use micro component level and from sub daily up to a few seconds respectively 42 43 the availability of data at such a level of spatiotemporal detail allows water utilities to gain a better understanding of when and how water is used 44 detect domestic leakages 45 or other anomalies 46 47 and provide water use feedback to users thus inducing them to save water 10 48 smart meter data also allow the development of a variety of models and technologies for water reuse and recycling e g refs 49 51 as well as methods for automated water end use disaggregation and classification e g refs 34 52 59 and urban e g refs 60 63 or user level e g refs 64 66 water demand models capable of simulating and forecasting water consumption patterns for different residential and non residential contexts the above tools have been proved to significantly support water utilities in making strategic assessments in the field of short and long term planning of water supply and distribution systems 67 however despite their relevance it is worth noting that from an operational standpoint water reuse and user level demand models generally have to be calibrated validated or parametrized with water consumption data at the end use level which may be unavailable to water utilities and researchers the availability of water consumption data at the level of end use would also allow other applications in the field of water systems management enabling water utilities to tailor water pricing in order to prevent excessive water use and develop action plans to promote sustainable and aware behaviours towards water consumption 68 69 the current study aimed to exploit high resolution data to investigate the characteristics of end use water consumption at nine households located north of amsterdam the netherlands in which smart water use monitoring at 1 s temporal resolution and with 0 1 l pulse accuracy started in 2019 in greater detail this study seeks to answer four main research questions 1 which end uses of water most greatly affect overall household consumption 2 how are water end uses distributed throughout the day 3 which of them are typically characterized by the longest duration the largest consumption the greatest flow rate and the highest daily frequency of use 4 what is the statistical behaviour of the above end use parameters from an operational standpoint the aggregate water consumption observed over about 447 days of monitoring was automatically pre processed by means of a rule based algorithm for the segmentation of combined water uses which allowed 44 115 individual end use events to be identified these in turn were manually labelled by expert analysts a multi stage approach was then adopted to answer the above research questions and therefore investigate daily per capita end use water consumption daily end use profiles average end use parameter values and their probability distributions finally the results obtained were compared against those of other end use studies conducted with reference to similar or dissimilar geographical contexts indeed studies investigating the features of end use water consumption in the netherlands are available in the literature i e 70 74 however in all these cases water consumption characteristics and end use parameter values were estimated based on coarse resolution e g monthly water meter readings and by relying on surveys about water use submitted to a sample population to the authors knowledge this study is the first in which end use water consumption in the netherlands was explored by directly exploiting high resolution data collected in field furthermore the current study investigated aspects such as the daily profiles of end use water consumption and the statistical distributions of all end use parameters which go beyond the results typically reported in the end use studies available in the literature e g refs 31 34 75 78 in fact the outcomes of these studies are typically limited to general considerations on daily average per capita end use water consumption and the average end use parameter values and they seldom include an in depth statistical analysis of all end use parameters in the following sections the water consumption monitoring procedure adopted and the multi stage method followed to achieve the goal of the study are presented materials and methods the results obtained with reference to the overall group of households selected are then reported and discussed results and discussion finally the key findings of the study along with recommendations for future research are highlighted conclusions 2 materials and methods this section includes a description of the measurement campaign conducted to obtain high resolution water consumption data and the main phases of the methodology see fig 1 applied to answer the study research questions in greater detail the high resolution monitoring of aggregate level water consumption was first carried out with regard to a group of selected households second the raw data collected were converted and subjected to linear interpolation in order to obtain water consumption time series at the 1 s temporal resolution third each water use detected in the aggregate water consumption time series was segmented into individual events by means of a rule based automated filtering algorithm and then manually labelled by expert analysts based on the consumption features e g duration volume time of occurrence etc and relying on the results of water consumption surveys submitted to household inhabitants fourth the obtained end use water consumption dataset was subjected to a multi stage analysis aimed at exploring its most relevant characteristics daily per capita end use water consumption daily end use profiles average end use parameter values and end use parameter probability distributions 2 1 materials 2 1 1 water consumption monitoring the high resolution monitoring of water consumption started in mid 2019 and went on until early 2020 i e before the adoption of restrictive measures to limit the spread of the covid 19 overall n h 9 households located north of amsterdam the netherlands were selected for monitoring among those owned by water utility employees who had previously agreed to take part in the research due to privacy reasons specifically households with different number of inhabitants and family types were considered in order to explore the characteristics of water consumption with regard to different socio demographic contexts the main features of each household subjected to water consumption monitoring are included in table 1 monitoring systems made up of itron centron r400 smart water meters with 0 1 l pulse accuracy and iotsensreader devices for remote data collection were installed at each household water inlet point it is worth noting that the above mentioned monitoring systems recorded the number of pulses produced over time and specifically over 1 or 2 s time intervals by each water meter so a pre processing of data was initially required to convert this information into water consumption data l min overall raw data were recorded over a total of about 447 days albeit with different monitoring periods based on the household concerned specifically the number of monitored days ranged from a maximum of 94 days in the case of household h1 to a minimum of 12 days in the case of household h9 indeed although the study was initially intended to be conducted by monitoring each household for at least one month data collection periods were reduced considerably in some cases due to periods of inhabitants absence thus showing null consumption or malfunctioning in the monitoring system thus including data gaps however the duration of all monitoring periods is in line with that reported in many similar studies i e 2 4 weeks 34 75 76 78 specifically this duration has generally been considered as sufficient in order to gain insight into the seasonal water use behaviour of people in individual households 2 1 2 water consumption survey in addition to the smart monitoring of water consumption surveys about the main features of water end uses and inhabitants behaviours in terms of water use were submitted to the residents of households h1 h9 specifically the survey sent to each household was designed in order to gather information about 1 family composition i e number of inhabitants age range and employment as shown in table 1 2 presence type and characteristics of domestic end uses i e dishwasher washing machine mixer or knob taps dual flush toilet and bathtub 3 average frequency of use of the dishwasher washing machine and shower bathtub and 4 outdoor or other special water uses e g garden taps active irrigation systems etc the analysis of the replies sent back by the inhabitants of households h1 h9 revealed that 1 households were occupied by 2 5 people in the period concerned including children teenagers and adults or seniors part or full time workers more in detail the absence of unemployed or retired residents resulted in a general absence of continuous and distributed water uses throughout the day except during weekends or holidays since all the residents typically spent at least a half day away at work or school 2 all the households are equipped with a washing machine and a dishwasher except household h5 for which no information about dishwasher presence was given 3 only households h1 h3 and h6 are equipped with a bathtub although only the inhabitants of households h1 and h3 declared that it is used sometimes 4 households h1 h3 h6 and h7 are equipped with garden taps but only the inhabitants of household h6 declared that it was occasionally used during the monitoring period mainly for washing bicycles and not for irrigating 2 2 methods 2 2 1 automated pre processing data conversion and interpolation the raw data collected in the households considered in the case study i e number of pulses over time were initially converted to water consumption data according to equation 1 1 q i t a n i t d i t c f where q i t l min is the average flow rate observed at the water inlet point of the i th household i 1 9 during the t th time interval of the monitoring period t 1 t i a 0 1 l pulse is the accuracy of the itron centron r400 smart meter used for monitoring n i t is the number of pulses counted by the water meter installed at the water inlet point of the i th household during the t th time interval d i t s is the length of the time interval typically 1 2 s and c f 60 is a conversion factor allowing flow rate conversion from l s to l min it is worth noting that most of the domestic water uses being typically characterized by durations of one to a few minutes as also demonstrated in the following sections flow rate values are expressed in l min to make it easier to figure out which consumed water volumes per use are potentially relatable to different flow rate values specifically the application of equation 1 led to high resolution i e 1 or 2 s aggregate water consumption time series these time series were first subjected to linear interpolation to obtain a homogeneous set of water consumption data at the 1 s temporal resolution for all the households linear interpolation was automatically carried out by using matlab r2019a programming software in addition all water use events i e time periods characterized by a positive flow rate and isolated from other events by a time interval of at least 1 s with no consumption of a duration of only 1 s and volume of 0 1 l were removed from the 1 s resolution time series obtained in fact these events characterized by individual water meter pulses and reasonably assumed to be due to pulse conversion or meter inaccuracies were likely to be unrelated to any actual end use event a total of 36 297 water use events of a duration longer than 1 s and volume larger than 0 1 l were observed in the water consumption time series of the n h monitored households 2 2 2 automated pre processing event segmentation and clustering during the monitoring period the itron smart water meters were installed at the water inlet point of each household selected as a result the water consumption time series obtained are representative of the total amount of water entering the households each second with no information about the number and type of devices producing water inflow therefore both individual and combined water use events were included in the raw aggregate water consumption trace of households h1 h9 in the light of the above a new rule based automated method for the segmentation of combined water uses into individual uses was developed and applied to each event detected in the aggregate water consumption time series automated segmentation was carried out with the aim of providing the analysts a dataset of individual water uses to label without the need to manually segment combined water uses into individual events in greater detail the method is based on the following assumptions similarly adopted by buchberger et al 79 1 individual water uses are typically characterized by a constant or nearly constant flow rate so they can be described by a rectangular shape in the time flow plane whose respective area indicates the volume of water consumed and 2 combinations of individual uses i e combined events generally appear as composite rectangular shapes due to partial overlaps of individual uses the main structure of the automated method for individual event segmentation is described below and shown in fig 2 each water use event i e each portion of the raw aggregate water consumption time series with a positive flow rate is considered in turn fig 2a a moving window of limited width e g 3 s is used to filter the raw time series based on a moving average technique specifically if an abrupt flow rate variation is observed in the raw signal i e if the absolute difference between the average flow rate obtained by means of the moving average techniques at time t s and that obtained at time t 1 s exceeds a threshold value e g 1 l min this is related to a new opening or closing manoeuvre all the time instants related to the occurrence of opening or closing manoeuvres are considered to split the raw time series into sub periods with a nearly constant flow rate fig 2b the raw time series is smoothed based on the average value of flow rates observed in each sub period fig 2c moreover the magnitude i e flow rate variation of each opening o and closing c manoeuvre detected is calculated it is worth noting that in the case of non combined water uses only two manoeuvres i e an opening and a closing manoeuvre of the same magnitude are detected by the algorithm due to the presence of an individual end use event in the case of combined water uses by contrast more than two manoeuvres at least three are detected as far as combined water uses i e water uses composed of more than one individual event are concerned a first group of individual events making up the water use considered is identified through the direct matching of opening and closing manoeuvres of similar magnitude fig 2d in turn each opening manoeuvre is matched to its most similar closing manoeuvre i e the manoeuvre associated with the most similar flow rate variation moreover the portion of the combined event between the time instants of occurrence of the two matched manoeuvres is considered as an individual water use event characterized by a flow rate equal to that of the two matched manoeuvres the detected individual event is then removed from the smoothed time series in the event that not all the manoeuvres are directly relatable e g in the case of manoeuvres of different magnitude or combined water uses for which a different number of opening and closing manoeuvres are identified the residual portion of the smoothed time series is segmented through horizontal cuts fig 2e in this case two or more closing manoeuvres are relatable to a single opening manoeuvre or vice versa all the combined and non combined events are removed from the raw water consumption time series and the related set of individual events detected are considered instead the effectiveness of the automated method for the segmentation of water consumption data observed in households h1 h9 into individual events was first checked by testing its performance with regard to a series of 50 combined uses including from one to four individual end use events for which segmentation could be reasonably verified by the analysts however it is worth specifying that the lack of a dataset of known combined water use events to use as a benchmark precluded a full evaluation of the overall performance of the method in successfully segmenting the combined water uses also different results may be obtained where the method is applied with different threshold values e g 5 s wide moving window or a minimum flow rate variation during opening and closing manoeuvres of 2 l min overall the application of the method for the segmentation of the combined water consumption data observed in households h1 h9 in individual events led to an increase in the number of water uses from 36 297 4 319 of which combined i e 11 9 to 44 115 more specifically the 4 319 combined uses detected were automatically segmented into 12 137 individual events indicating that on average each combined water use is composed of 2 81 individual end use events once the set of 44 115 individual end use events had been obtained a clustering analysis was performed in order to provide the analysts with further information for event labelling in greater detail for each household the frequency of occurrence of individual events was explored by locating each event on the duration volume plane i e by evaluating the number of events falling within each cell of a duration volume mesh based on event duration and volume of water consumed as shown in fig 3 where the results of household h3 water use segmentation are considered by way of example the analysis revealed that in general 1 water use events were typically below a line whose slope is equal to the maximum flow rate that can be provided by the domestic end uses of the household considered 2 some events were spread over lines and they were most likely related to human controlled end uses due to different durations and the constant flow rate 3 some other events were lumped into single hotspots and they were most likely related to fixed volume or automated end use events e g toilet flushing or appliance uses specifically the above analysis allowed the obtainment of helpful information about the possible end use category of individual events this information was considered along with the information provided by the household inhabitants through surveys when individual event labelling was conducted as detailed in the following subsection 2 2 3 manual labelling of events all the individual uses resulting from the automated segmentation of the water consumption trace observed in households h1 h9 were manually labelled i e assigned to specific end use categories event labelling was carried out with the aim of obtaining a water use dataset not only at high temporal level of detail but also at high spatial level of detail i e end use level more in detail classification was conducted based on engineering judgment and relying both on the information obtained by clustering the events in the duration volume mesh and that obtained from the replies of water use surveys submitted to the inhabitants specifically events were individually classified based on 1 physical features of water use duration volume flow rate 2 time of occurrence 3 frequency of occurrence of events with similar characteristics and 4 temporal distance from other events with similar or dissimilar characteristics in particular the following n e u 5 end use categories were assumed for labelling dishwasher taps washing machine shower bathtub and toilet additionally all the events whose characteristics did not allow high confidence classification were labelled as uncertain uses it is worth noting that shower and bathtub uses were considered together in this study due to 1 the similarity in duration and volume per use between these two categories making manual discrimination rather difficult in most of the cases 2 the current tendency of people to mostly use the bathtub for having showers instead of baths by basically activating the same tap and 3 the limited use of the bathtub in the households concerned as reported in the surveys from an operational standpoint classification was carried out by visualizing each event along with its features by means of matlab r2019a programming software two analysts with prior experience in manually classifying residential water use events i e researchers who had taken part in similar research carried out by mazzoni et al 58 were selected for labelling in greater detail labelling was first performed by one of them considering each individual event in turn along with its characteristics and position in the aggregate water consumption time series to avoid bias the results were then checked and supervised by the other analyst in the event that the opinion of the latter was not in line with the decision of the former classification of the water use concerned was jointly discussed and revised accordingly if after discussion an agreement between the two analysts was not reached the individual end use event concerned was classified as uncertain use specifically a set of rules was applied by the two analysts to perform manual labelling by way of example shower bathtub uses were searched among those infrequent uses either continuous or composed by many shorter events separated by limited periods of flow interruption lasting several minutes and characterized by medium or high consumption and constant or nearly constant flow rate thus spread over the same line of the duration volume plane similar rules were also adopted to identify tap uses even though by considering shorter durations lower volumes a higher flow rate variability and a more frequent daily use toilet and appliance uses by contrast were searched among the repeated blocks with a constant flow rate and related to lumped durations and volumes in the light of the fact that they generally appear as hotspots in the duration volume plane due to the fixed characteristics of flushing systems and appliance water inflows overall given that 1 the two analysts were capable of labelling a maximum of 2 000 individual events per working day and 2 an additional time of nearly 2 h per household was required to cluster individual events and process the information available on the water use surveys it took a total of about 150 h to perform manual labelling of all the 36 297 individual water use events resulting from the automated segmentation phase 2 2 4 multi stage analysis of end use water consumption the primary objective of the current study was to explore the characteristics of end use water consumption in the households considered highlighting similarities and differences with regard to the end use data available in the literature for similar geographical contexts this was achieved through a multi stage analysis carried out in relation to the overall group of n h monitored households in order to compensate for the differences in water consumption behaviours observed in single households specifically the following four stage analysis was conducted to address the four main research questions 1 evaluation of daily per capita end use water consumption l person day 2 evaluation of normalized standardized profiles of daily end use water consumption specifically daily profiles of water consumption i e a set of 24 hourly water consumption coefficients c k t were calculated for each end use as shown in equation 2 2 c k t 1 n h i 1 n h v i k t 1 n h 1 24 t 1 24 i 1 n h v i k t where v i k t is the total hourly water consumption of end use k k 1 n e u in household i i 1 n h over the t th hour of the day t 1 24 therefore the numerator defines the average volume of water consumed by end use k in all the n h households at hour t of the day whereas the denominator represents the daily average water consumption of end use k calculated considering all the n h households by way of example a c k t value equal to 2 suggests that at hour t and with regard to the overall household sample the water consumption of end use k is twice its daily average 3 evaluation of end use parameter values i e volume per use duration per use flow rate per use and daily frequency of use and comparison against the values available in the literature more precisely the following units of measurements were adopted l use in the case of volume per use min use in the case of duration per use l min in the case of flow rate per use and uses person day in the case of frequency of use it is worth noting that in this analysis a minimum temporal distance between two subsequent events of the same category was assumed for each end use class above which they were considered as separated water uses specifically a minimum temporal distance of 5 s was considered in the case of taps and toilets whereas a threshold of 2 min was assumed in the case of showers given that people may be used to turning off the water several times and also for some minutes during a shower in addition as far as electric appliances are concerned dishwasher and washing machine events occurring more than 90 min after the previous ones were considered to be related to different operating cycles hereinafter denoted as loads 4 evaluation of end use parameter empirical distributions and identification of the type and the parameters of the best fitting statistical distribution in greater detail the empirical probability density functions pdfs of individual households were first obtained through the kernel density estimation for each end use and parameter distribution individual pdf curves were then averaged over all n h households to obtain an overall set of empirical pdfs the average empirical pdfs were then subjected to automated curve fitting by means of matlab r2019a software specifically in accordance with the results reported in similar studies available in the literature e g blokker et al 64 and the cited references five statistical pdfs were considered for fitting 1 normal 2 lognormal 3 exponential 4 gamma and 5 weibull the above mentioned set of continuous pdfs was selected due to the non discrete nature of the four end use parameters investigated in this study the akaike information criterion aic 80 was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of each statistical pdf type the best fitting pdf was finally selected based on the distribution type characterized by the minimum aic parameter value 3 results and discussion this section includes a discussion of the results obtained by applying the four stage analysis described in the materials and methods section to investigate the characteristics of the end use water consumption in the households monitored all the numerical results presented hereinafter will be expressed with decimal precision except those related to the daily per capita frequency of use in this case centesimal precision will be considered instead to properly account for end uses which occur with very low daily frequency 3 1 evaluation of daily per capita end use water consumption as far as the daily per capita water consumption is concerned an aggregate average value of 121 5 l person day was observed in the monitored households the largest part of which tied to the use of showers bathtubs 46 2 l person day i e 38 0 and toilets 32 8 l person day i e 27 0 as indicated in fig 4 conversely lower volumes were related to the use of washing machines 17 0 l person day i e 14 0 taps 14 6 l person day i e 12 0 and dishwashers 3 6 l person day i e 3 0 with a residual amount of about 7 3 l person day i e 6 0 classified as uncertain use of water overall the results obtained indicate that on average the largest components of daily residential water consumption are related to the use of showers bathtubs and toilets followed by washing machines and taps whose daily per capita water consumption values are generally rather close this finding is coherent with the results of other end use studies conducted in similar or different geographical contexts e g refs 31 34 70 78 as far as individual end uses of water are concerned it is first worth noting that the results obtained are in line with those reported by the other end use studies conducted in the netherlands i e 70 74 the results of which are shown in table 2 except as regards the daily per capita water consumption of dishwashers and toilets which is slightly outside the ranges reported in the other dutch studies cited i e 2 0 3 0 and 33 7 37 1 l person day respectively as demonstrated in the following subsection and shown in table 2 this is mainly due to variations in the daily frequency of dishwasher and toilet use along with lower average volumes per toilet flush in addition larger differences among end uses emerge when the results of the current study are compared against those reported for different countries such as the united states i e 31 75 or australia i e 31 76 78 for example the toilet water consumption reported in this study is considerably lower than the values shown in the american studies 49 7 70 0 l person day and higher than the values indicated in the australian ones 14 3 31 0 l person day whereas higher water consumption values for washing machines and taps were observed in all the aforementioned american and australian studies 20 7 56 9 and 17 4 41 2 l person day respectively it is believed that the reported differences are partially due to different levels of technological development reflected in the studies concerned explaining why for example the largest consumption associated with toilet use was observed in the most outdated study i e 34 and partially to behavioural factors related to water availability and drought risk the latter aspect could explain for example why the lowest toilet water consumption values were observed in the australian studies lastly no significant differences among studies were observed in the case of dishwasher and shower bathtub uses 3 2 evaluation of normalized profiles of daily end use water consumption the evaluation of the normalized i e standardized end use water consumption profiles revealed on a daily basis different hourly distributions of water consumption based on the end use category considered as shown in fig 5 on the one hand it emerged that as expected the water consumption of toilets fig 5f and taps fig 5b is minimum at night and pretty constant in diurnal hours confirming that the above end uses generally occur in a constant manner throughout the day although peaks in water consumption emerge in the morning and at dinner time respectively when people are most likely to be at home on the other hand in the case of showers bathtubs fig 5d water consumption is more concentrated at specific times of the day these end uses being characterized by a higher peak in the morning when people get up along with a lower peak in the evening when people come back home breaking down water consumption further two peaks occur in the morning the first of which at around 7 00 and the second of which at around 9 00 these different behaviours in terms of water use are most likely due to the different profiles of the inhabitants who include children students and part or full time workers and also different habits such as having showers before or after breakfast time furthermore as far as appliance profiles are concerned a single peak of water consumption was observed around midday in the case of washing machines fig 5c whereas a rather heterogeneous profile emerged in the case of dishwasher use fig 5a although it may be observed that this appliance is typically used around breakfast mealtime or during the night overall the daily end use profiles obtained are in line with those shown in the rather limited number of end use studies including this kind of information see for example 31 34 76 78 3 3 evaluation of average end use parameter values the availability of high resolution information about end use water consumption also allowed an investigation of end use parameters such as daily frequency of use volume per use duration per use and flow rate per use end use parameters were obtained by statistically analysing in turn the characteristics of all the events included in each end use category moreover the results of the analysis were compared against those reported in studies previously conducted in the same geographical area as shown in table 2 in this regard the studies conducted on a three yearly basis in the netherlands for the period between 2004 and 2016 70 74 were considered as a benchmark when the frequency of use is considered it emerged that on average taps are activated most frequently 13 83 times person day followed by toilets 4 22 flushes person day moreover inhabitants are used to having a shower or a bath about three times every four days 0 76 uses person day whereas dishwashers and washing machines are typically loaded with daily or higher frequency only in households with at least 3 4 inhabitants 0 27 loads person day as far as the duration per use is concerned the results show that only shower uses last several minutes 8 0 min use whereas the duration of toilet and tap use is only of a few seconds 0 8 min use i e about 48 s use in the former case and 0 2 min use i e about 12 s use in the latter it was also observed that despite the considerably long duration per appliance load which may last up to 3 h the total duration of washing machine and dishwasher inflow is only about 8 2 and 4 3 min load respectively revealing that appliances typically work without drawing water in for most of the duration of the load in addition considering volume per use the statistical analysis showed that showers bathtubs and washing machines are the most consuming end uses with about 63 6 l use and 62 9 l load respectively they are followed by dishwashers 11 4 l load toilets 6 8 l flush and taps 1 2 l use in greater detail it is worth noting that although toilet and tap volumes per use are the smallest the contribution of these end uses to the total indoor water consumption is significant because of their considerably high daily frequency finally considering flow rate per use the highest average values were observed in the case of toilets 8 3 l min showers bathtubs 7 9 l min and washing machines 7 0 l min whereas lower values emerged in the case of taps 4 8 l min and dishwashers 2 8 l min in general the average end use parameter values are in line with those of previous dutch studies albeit with some exceptions by way of example the daily frequency of tap and toilet use is slightly lower than the corresponding values reported in other studies 70 74 i e 19 21 20 01 uses person day and 5 86 6 27 flushes person day respectively this is most likely due to the fact that all the residents of the n h monitored households are students or workers so they generally spend at least a half day away with consequent reduced toilet or tap use at home in addition an increase in the frequency of dishwasher use emerged in the current study resulting overall in an increase in daily per capita water consumption associated with dishwashers whereas no relevant changes in frequency were observed in the case of washing machines and showers bathtubs as far as volumes per use are considered the value obtained in the current study with regard to dishwasher use confirms the decreasing trend highlighted in the other studies 70 74 whereas an inverse behaviour emerged in the case of washing machine use despite the similar decreasing trend reported in the above mentioned studies where average consumption was nearly 10 l higher than the consumption observed in the last decade see e g refs 72 74 with regard to toilets a considerably lower volume per flush was observed in the current study compared to the other values reported 70 74 which may reasonably be attributed to technological advancements more specifically 7 of the n h 9 monitored households have toilets with dual flush systems leading to non negligible water savings per individual flush lastly no relevant differences emerged in the case of shower duration and flow rate per use i e the only end use for which duration and flow rate were investigated in previous studies 3 4 evaluation of end use parameter probability distributions the findings with regard to the average end use parameter values were confirmed by the outcomes of the analysis of their empirical and statistical distributions pdfs from an operational standpoint as far as duration per use is concerned the analysis was carried out by expressing all durations in seconds s use s load or s flush based on the end use considered and all volumes in litres l use l load or l flush respectively whereas the flow rate was expressed in litres per minute l min moreover considering the distribution of appliance use duration it is worth noting that the total length of the periods during which the appliance drew in water was considered rather than the duration of the overall load in fact appliance uses typically involve a number of inflow events lasting a few minutes and taking place between longer periods of time during which the machine does not draw in water finally as regards the daily frequency of use statistical distributions are expressed in uses person day taps showers bathtubs flushes person day toilets or loads person day electric appliances so as to be comparable with the results available in the literature the best fitting statistical pdfs of the overall end use dataset are shown in fig 6 blue lines along with details about distribution type and parameters as expected the mean of these distributions is in line with the average parameter values shown in table 2 statistical pdfs were also compared against their respective empirical pdfs thick grey lines obtained with respect to the overall h1 h9 dataset overall different parameter distributions were estimated depending on the end use and the parameter considered more specifically right skewed statistical pdfs emerged in most of the cases fitted by lognormal weibull or gamma distributions however some parameter distributions were fitted by normal or nearly normal curves e g toilet flush duration shower flow rate and toilet flush flow rate indicating that in these cases the end use parameter values were distributed almost symmetrically around the average an exception is represented by washing machine flow rate values which were fitted by a slightly left skewed weibull pdf moreover as far as duration and volume distributions are concerned empirical and statistical pdfs substantially correspond in the case of some end uses taps washing machine shower bathtub whereas larger differences emerged for the others dishwasher toilet this deviation between empirical and statistical pdfs of dishwasher and toilet uses is partially due to the limited number of monitored users making the empirical distribution of parameter values nearly multimodal and partially due to the limited variability of appliance and toilet parameters in the same household given that their volume and duration were generally constant in fact the parameter empirical pdfs of individual households were considerably narrower than the corresponding best fitting statistical pdfs of the overall set of n h households differences between empirical and statistical pdfs were also observed in the case of flow rate distributions which differed from household to household these differences emerged for all end use flow rates and are most likely due to 1 household location i e pressure head available at the household inlet point 2 plumbing system layout and age i e pressure head available at the end use and 3 end use type i e device make and model the only exception is represented by the tap flow rate which was characterized by a smoothed empirical pdf with the absence of multiple peaks this is most likely due to the fact that taps are typically used in a variety of ways even within the same household i e not only for different durations but also with manual adjustments in the flow rate lastly with regard to the daily frequency of use most of the best fitting statistical pdfs obtained nearly symmetrical or right skewed weibull or gamma distributions closely approximated their respective empirical pdfs the largest differences were observed in the case of taps in relation to which a multi peak empirical pdf fitted by a slightly right skewed weibull curve was found this distribution reflects the different behaviours in terms of tap use within households not only as regards timing of use and modulation see by way of example the best fitting statistical distribution of tap duration per use and flow rate but also as regards frequency of use 5 conclusions the current study was conducted with the aim of investigating the characteristics of water consumption at the end use level by exploiting high resolution data collected at nine households in the netherlands differing in terms of occupancy rates inhabitants profiles and available end uses the study entailed 1 developing and applying a method for automated data pre processing i e segmentation of water uses into individual events and 2 manually labelling the individual events obtained based on engineering judgment and the information available from water consumption surveys submitted to household inhabitants a multi stage analysis was then conducted in order to explore the main features of end use water consumption in the selected households specifically the following findings emerged the average daily per capita water consumption was of 121 5 l person day with the use of showers bathtubs and toilets accounting for the largest part of consumption 46 2 and 32 8 l person day respectively whereas lower consumption was associated with washing machines taps and dishwashers 17 0 14 6 and 3 6 l person day respectively the use of toilets and taps was rather constant during the day whereas a more concentrated use of showers bathtubs and washing machines could be observed at specific times of the day in addition a heterogeneous daily profile emerged in the case of dishwasher use taps were activated the most during the day 13 83 times person day followed by toilets 4 22 flushes person day whereas showers bathtubs and appliances were typically used once or less than once per person per day only shower bathtub uses generally lasted several minutes on average 8 2 min use whereas the average duration of toilet and tap uses was shorter than 1 min 0 8 and 0 2 min use respectively in addition despite the long duration of appliance operating cycles loads the total duration of inflow is only of a few minutes per load the largest average volumes per use were tied to showers bathtubs and washing machines 63 6 and 62 9 l use respectively followed by dishwashers toilet and taps 11 4 6 8 and 1 2 l use respectively the highest flow rates per use were observed in the case of toilets showers bathtubs and washing machines 8 3 7 9 and 7 0 l min respectively whereas lower values emerged in the case of taps and dishwashers 4 8 and 2 8 l min respectively different parameter distributions were estimated depending on end use and the parameter considered right skewed empirical distributions pdfs were observed in most of the cases generally fitted by lognormal weibull or gamma statistical pdfs as expected the empirical pdfs of manually regulated end uses e g showers bathtubs and taps were generally well fitted by the above statistical pdf types in the light of the fact that the parameters involved basically depend on human habits and their values may cover a rather wide range even within the same household conversely the empirical pdfs of automated or fixed volume end uses i e electric appliances and toilets were quite narrow in the case of individual households and nearly multimodal thus poorly fitted by the above statistical pdf types with regard to the overall household dataset this is a consequence of the fact that toilet and appliance parameters are typically not variable within the same household whereas considerable differences may be observed from household to household it is worth noting that the end use data obtained refer to a limited set of households in addition nearly all data were acquired during the in between or cold seasons i e when outdoor water consumption is typically minimum or null and some indoor end uses e g taps or showers may be affected by reductions in the frequency of use therefore and similarly to refs 70 74 the seasonal variability of end use water consumption was not investigated in the current study due to the lack of extensive data collected during warmer periods despite the above the results obtained may represent a first helpful benchmark against which to compare the results of future end use studies including the monitoring of residential water consumption in fact unlike other studies conducted on water consumption in the netherlands e g refs 70 74 which made use of surveys and questionnaires to gather information about water end uses this study relied on actual water consumption time series collected at high temporal resolution whilst the information obtained through surveys which may be unreliable and subjective was used only to support the analysts during the classification phase in addition the current study investigated some end use water consumption features such as the statistical distribution of end use parameter values which had been previously explored only to a limited degree and which can support the calibration of water demand models available in the literature e g ref 53 in conclusion it is believed that the end use dataset obtained could be used to provide feedback to household inhabitants thereby increasing their awareness and encouraging a more conscious water use behaviour by way of example as far as the households considered in this study are concerned if inhabitants are aware that much of their domestic consumption is tied to specific aspects such as the presence of excessively large toilet tanks e g household h2 including a toilet with a capacity of about 12 l or excessively long showers e g household h4 showers lasting on average about13 3 min they might be encouraged to install more efficient or water saving devices e g dual flush systems or change their consumption behaviour e g by adjusting flow or closing taps the results obtained could also be of interest to water utilities operating in the above geographical context but not only since they provide insight into when and where water is typically consumed in the residential sector this could support intervention plans and strategies not only to optimize water distribution but also to promote a reduction in water consumption through specific information campaigns or incentives for the installation of more efficient devices lastly the results of the study confirm that a detailed characterization of domestic end use water consumption and parameters is feasible even in the case of rather limited monitoring periods of ordinary home activity e g two weeks and that the proposed methodology may be a valid alternative to survey based analyses of water consumption at the end use level future studies will focus on enlarging the water consumption dataset in order to explore the characteristics of residential end uses of water over different periods and evaluate the seasonal variability of end use water consumption in addition analyses will seek to investigate the minimum household sample size required to obtain a representative and statistically significant dataset per family cluster this will allow the end use results obtained to be scaled up to broader contexts in the field of residential and subsequently non residential water consumption further developments will also include the definition of guidelines supporting the automated labelling of individual end use events with considerable time and human resource savings data statement the data presented in this study i e high

8730,in the water industry an accurate estimation of end use water consumption is helpful for the implementation of efficient water systems and water saving technologies this study aimed to explore the characteristics of water consumption at nine households north of amsterdam the netherlands subjected to water consumption monitoring at high temporal resolution i e 1 s overall 36 297 water use events monitored over about 447 days were automatically segmented into 44 115 individual events by means of a new rule based filtering algorithm and then labelled by expert analysts a multi stage analysis was then conducted in order to evaluate daily per capita end use water consumption daily end use profiles average end use parameter average and their statistical distributions the results achieved provide insight into the features of end use consumption confirming that the largest components are typically related to showers bathtubs toilets and washing machines whereas different end use parameter distributions can emerge keywords water end uses water consumption combined event segmentation individual event labelling daily profiles end use parameters data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water distribution systems are being ever more stressed due to climate change population growth and urbanization which are increasingly influencing water availability in several regions 1 4 periodic water shortage has already affected hundreds of millions of people in areas where there is no longer a balance between water supply and demand 5 6 leading to a progressive depletion of the available water resources in this context strategies have to be adopted to cope with water shortages and ensure water availability to future generations 7 8 these can range from imposing water use restrictions to controlling leakages revising water pricing tailoring water rates introducing smart water policies promoting incentives for the installation of efficient appliances or adoption of water reuse technologies informing and educating 9 11 however most of the above mentioned strategies to increase water system efficiency and resiliency cannot generally be implemented if an accurate estimation of water consumption i e an in depth knowledge of water consumption drivers and variations in space and time is not available 12 16 therefore in recent years many studies have been conducted with the aim of exploring the characteristics of water consumption they have demonstrated that consumption is typically affected by a variety of climatic geographic economic sociodemographic and behavioural factors 17 19 by way of example studies exploring climatic drivers of water consumption reveal that the latter can be significantly affected by rainfall and temperature 20 25 whereas the scarce availability of water resources in some geographical contexts can directly limit the amount of water consumed by users 26 28 moreover the influence of economic or sociodemographic factors such as income water prices occupation and level of education has been proved 29 33 behavioural factors may have impacts on water consumption as well in greater detail it has been widely shown that water demand is generally characterized by a daily or weekly pattern reflecting people s typical habits and lifestyles 31 34 37 however the way in which people consume water may be significantly altered by emergency situations disasters or exceptional circumstances as demonstrated for example by a number of studies exploring how the restrictive measures recently imposed in many countries to prevent the spread of covid 19 have impacted on water use 38 41 in the last two decades a noteworthy contribution to the investigation of water consumption and its drivers has been given by smart metering specifically smart meters have made water consumption data available at very high spatial and temporal resolutions i e up to the user or end use micro component level and from sub daily up to a few seconds respectively 42 43 the availability of data at such a level of spatiotemporal detail allows water utilities to gain a better understanding of when and how water is used 44 detect domestic leakages 45 or other anomalies 46 47 and provide water use feedback to users thus inducing them to save water 10 48 smart meter data also allow the development of a variety of models and technologies for water reuse and recycling e g refs 49 51 as well as methods for automated water end use disaggregation and classification e g refs 34 52 59 and urban e g refs 60 63 or user level e g refs 64 66 water demand models capable of simulating and forecasting water consumption patterns for different residential and non residential contexts the above tools have been proved to significantly support water utilities in making strategic assessments in the field of short and long term planning of water supply and distribution systems 67 however despite their relevance it is worth noting that from an operational standpoint water reuse and user level demand models generally have to be calibrated validated or parametrized with water consumption data at the end use level which may be unavailable to water utilities and researchers the availability of water consumption data at the level of end use would also allow other applications in the field of water systems management enabling water utilities to tailor water pricing in order to prevent excessive water use and develop action plans to promote sustainable and aware behaviours towards water consumption 68 69 the current study aimed to exploit high resolution data to investigate the characteristics of end use water consumption at nine households located north of amsterdam the netherlands in which smart water use monitoring at 1 s temporal resolution and with 0 1 l pulse accuracy started in 2019 in greater detail this study seeks to answer four main research questions 1 which end uses of water most greatly affect overall household consumption 2 how are water end uses distributed throughout the day 3 which of them are typically characterized by the longest duration the largest consumption the greatest flow rate and the highest daily frequency of use 4 what is the statistical behaviour of the above end use parameters from an operational standpoint the aggregate water consumption observed over about 447 days of monitoring was automatically pre processed by means of a rule based algorithm for the segmentation of combined water uses which allowed 44 115 individual end use events to be identified these in turn were manually labelled by expert analysts a multi stage approach was then adopted to answer the above research questions and therefore investigate daily per capita end use water consumption daily end use profiles average end use parameter values and their probability distributions finally the results obtained were compared against those of other end use studies conducted with reference to similar or dissimilar geographical contexts indeed studies investigating the features of end use water consumption in the netherlands are available in the literature i e 70 74 however in all these cases water consumption characteristics and end use parameter values were estimated based on coarse resolution e g monthly water meter readings and by relying on surveys about water use submitted to a sample population to the authors knowledge this study is the first in which end use water consumption in the netherlands was explored by directly exploiting high resolution data collected in field furthermore the current study investigated aspects such as the daily profiles of end use water consumption and the statistical distributions of all end use parameters which go beyond the results typically reported in the end use studies available in the literature e g refs 31 34 75 78 in fact the outcomes of these studies are typically limited to general considerations on daily average per capita end use water consumption and the average end use parameter values and they seldom include an in depth statistical analysis of all end use parameters in the following sections the water consumption monitoring procedure adopted and the multi stage method followed to achieve the goal of the study are presented materials and methods the results obtained with reference to the overall group of households selected are then reported and discussed results and discussion finally the key findings of the study along with recommendations for future research are highlighted conclusions 2 materials and methods this section includes a description of the measurement campaign conducted to obtain high resolution water consumption data and the main phases of the methodology see fig 1 applied to answer the study research questions in greater detail the high resolution monitoring of aggregate level water consumption was first carried out with regard to a group of selected households second the raw data collected were converted and subjected to linear interpolation in order to obtain water consumption time series at the 1 s temporal resolution third each water use detected in the aggregate water consumption time series was segmented into individual events by means of a rule based automated filtering algorithm and then manually labelled by expert analysts based on the consumption features e g duration volume time of occurrence etc and relying on the results of water consumption surveys submitted to household inhabitants fourth the obtained end use water consumption dataset was subjected to a multi stage analysis aimed at exploring its most relevant characteristics daily per capita end use water consumption daily end use profiles average end use parameter values and end use parameter probability distributions 2 1 materials 2 1 1 water consumption monitoring the high resolution monitoring of water consumption started in mid 2019 and went on until early 2020 i e before the adoption of restrictive measures to limit the spread of the covid 19 overall n h 9 households located north of amsterdam the netherlands were selected for monitoring among those owned by water utility employees who had previously agreed to take part in the research due to privacy reasons specifically households with different number of inhabitants and family types were considered in order to explore the characteristics of water consumption with regard to different socio demographic contexts the main features of each household subjected to water consumption monitoring are included in table 1 monitoring systems made up of itron centron r400 smart water meters with 0 1 l pulse accuracy and iotsensreader devices for remote data collection were installed at each household water inlet point it is worth noting that the above mentioned monitoring systems recorded the number of pulses produced over time and specifically over 1 or 2 s time intervals by each water meter so a pre processing of data was initially required to convert this information into water consumption data l min overall raw data were recorded over a total of about 447 days albeit with different monitoring periods based on the household concerned specifically the number of monitored days ranged from a maximum of 94 days in the case of household h1 to a minimum of 12 days in the case of household h9 indeed although the study was initially intended to be conducted by monitoring each household for at least one month data collection periods were reduced considerably in some cases due to periods of inhabitants absence thus showing null consumption or malfunctioning in the monitoring system thus including data gaps however the duration of all monitoring periods is in line with that reported in many similar studies i e 2 4 weeks 34 75 76 78 specifically this duration has generally been considered as sufficient in order to gain insight into the seasonal water use behaviour of people in individual households 2 1 2 water consumption survey in addition to the smart monitoring of water consumption surveys about the main features of water end uses and inhabitants behaviours in terms of water use were submitted to the residents of households h1 h9 specifically the survey sent to each household was designed in order to gather information about 1 family composition i e number of inhabitants age range and employment as shown in table 1 2 presence type and characteristics of domestic end uses i e dishwasher washing machine mixer or knob taps dual flush toilet and bathtub 3 average frequency of use of the dishwasher washing machine and shower bathtub and 4 outdoor or other special water uses e g garden taps active irrigation systems etc the analysis of the replies sent back by the inhabitants of households h1 h9 revealed that 1 households were occupied by 2 5 people in the period concerned including children teenagers and adults or seniors part or full time workers more in detail the absence of unemployed or retired residents resulted in a general absence of continuous and distributed water uses throughout the day except during weekends or holidays since all the residents typically spent at least a half day away at work or school 2 all the households are equipped with a washing machine and a dishwasher except household h5 for which no information about dishwasher presence was given 3 only households h1 h3 and h6 are equipped with a bathtub although only the inhabitants of households h1 and h3 declared that it is used sometimes 4 households h1 h3 h6 and h7 are equipped with garden taps but only the inhabitants of household h6 declared that it was occasionally used during the monitoring period mainly for washing bicycles and not for irrigating 2 2 methods 2 2 1 automated pre processing data conversion and interpolation the raw data collected in the households considered in the case study i e number of pulses over time were initially converted to water consumption data according to equation 1 1 q i t a n i t d i t c f where q i t l min is the average flow rate observed at the water inlet point of the i th household i 1 9 during the t th time interval of the monitoring period t 1 t i a 0 1 l pulse is the accuracy of the itron centron r400 smart meter used for monitoring n i t is the number of pulses counted by the water meter installed at the water inlet point of the i th household during the t th time interval d i t s is the length of the time interval typically 1 2 s and c f 60 is a conversion factor allowing flow rate conversion from l s to l min it is worth noting that most of the domestic water uses being typically characterized by durations of one to a few minutes as also demonstrated in the following sections flow rate values are expressed in l min to make it easier to figure out which consumed water volumes per use are potentially relatable to different flow rate values specifically the application of equation 1 led to high resolution i e 1 or 2 s aggregate water consumption time series these time series were first subjected to linear interpolation to obtain a homogeneous set of water consumption data at the 1 s temporal resolution for all the households linear interpolation was automatically carried out by using matlab r2019a programming software in addition all water use events i e time periods characterized by a positive flow rate and isolated from other events by a time interval of at least 1 s with no consumption of a duration of only 1 s and volume of 0 1 l were removed from the 1 s resolution time series obtained in fact these events characterized by individual water meter pulses and reasonably assumed to be due to pulse conversion or meter inaccuracies were likely to be unrelated to any actual end use event a total of 36 297 water use events of a duration longer than 1 s and volume larger than 0 1 l were observed in the water consumption time series of the n h monitored households 2 2 2 automated pre processing event segmentation and clustering during the monitoring period the itron smart water meters were installed at the water inlet point of each household selected as a result the water consumption time series obtained are representative of the total amount of water entering the households each second with no information about the number and type of devices producing water inflow therefore both individual and combined water use events were included in the raw aggregate water consumption trace of households h1 h9 in the light of the above a new rule based automated method for the segmentation of combined water uses into individual uses was developed and applied to each event detected in the aggregate water consumption time series automated segmentation was carried out with the aim of providing the analysts a dataset of individual water uses to label without the need to manually segment combined water uses into individual events in greater detail the method is based on the following assumptions similarly adopted by buchberger et al 79 1 individual water uses are typically characterized by a constant or nearly constant flow rate so they can be described by a rectangular shape in the time flow plane whose respective area indicates the volume of water consumed and 2 combinations of individual uses i e combined events generally appear as composite rectangular shapes due to partial overlaps of individual uses the main structure of the automated method for individual event segmentation is described below and shown in fig 2 each water use event i e each portion of the raw aggregate water consumption time series with a positive flow rate is considered in turn fig 2a a moving window of limited width e g 3 s is used to filter the raw time series based on a moving average technique specifically if an abrupt flow rate variation is observed in the raw signal i e if the absolute difference between the average flow rate obtained by means of the moving average techniques at time t s and that obtained at time t 1 s exceeds a threshold value e g 1 l min this is related to a new opening or closing manoeuvre all the time instants related to the occurrence of opening or closing manoeuvres are considered to split the raw time series into sub periods with a nearly constant flow rate fig 2b the raw time series is smoothed based on the average value of flow rates observed in each sub period fig 2c moreover the magnitude i e flow rate variation of each opening o and closing c manoeuvre detected is calculated it is worth noting that in the case of non combined water uses only two manoeuvres i e an opening and a closing manoeuvre of the same magnitude are detected by the algorithm due to the presence of an individual end use event in the case of combined water uses by contrast more than two manoeuvres at least three are detected as far as combined water uses i e water uses composed of more than one individual event are concerned a first group of individual events making up the water use considered is identified through the direct matching of opening and closing manoeuvres of similar magnitude fig 2d in turn each opening manoeuvre is matched to its most similar closing manoeuvre i e the manoeuvre associated with the most similar flow rate variation moreover the portion of the combined event between the time instants of occurrence of the two matched manoeuvres is considered as an individual water use event characterized by a flow rate equal to that of the two matched manoeuvres the detected individual event is then removed from the smoothed time series in the event that not all the manoeuvres are directly relatable e g in the case of manoeuvres of different magnitude or combined water uses for which a different number of opening and closing manoeuvres are identified the residual portion of the smoothed time series is segmented through horizontal cuts fig 2e in this case two or more closing manoeuvres are relatable to a single opening manoeuvre or vice versa all the combined and non combined events are removed from the raw water consumption time series and the related set of individual events detected are considered instead the effectiveness of the automated method for the segmentation of water consumption data observed in households h1 h9 into individual events was first checked by testing its performance with regard to a series of 50 combined uses including from one to four individual end use events for which segmentation could be reasonably verified by the analysts however it is worth specifying that the lack of a dataset of known combined water use events to use as a benchmark precluded a full evaluation of the overall performance of the method in successfully segmenting the combined water uses also different results may be obtained where the method is applied with different threshold values e g 5 s wide moving window or a minimum flow rate variation during opening and closing manoeuvres of 2 l min overall the application of the method for the segmentation of the combined water consumption data observed in households h1 h9 in individual events led to an increase in the number of water uses from 36 297 4 319 of which combined i e 11 9 to 44 115 more specifically the 4 319 combined uses detected were automatically segmented into 12 137 individual events indicating that on average each combined water use is composed of 2 81 individual end use events once the set of 44 115 individual end use events had been obtained a clustering analysis was performed in order to provide the analysts with further information for event labelling in greater detail for each household the frequency of occurrence of individual events was explored by locating each event on the duration volume plane i e by evaluating the number of events falling within each cell of a duration volume mesh based on event duration and volume of water consumed as shown in fig 3 where the results of household h3 water use segmentation are considered by way of example the analysis revealed that in general 1 water use events were typically below a line whose slope is equal to the maximum flow rate that can be provided by the domestic end uses of the household considered 2 some events were spread over lines and they were most likely related to human controlled end uses due to different durations and the constant flow rate 3 some other events were lumped into single hotspots and they were most likely related to fixed volume or automated end use events e g toilet flushing or appliance uses specifically the above analysis allowed the obtainment of helpful information about the possible end use category of individual events this information was considered along with the information provided by the household inhabitants through surveys when individual event labelling was conducted as detailed in the following subsection 2 2 3 manual labelling of events all the individual uses resulting from the automated segmentation of the water consumption trace observed in households h1 h9 were manually labelled i e assigned to specific end use categories event labelling was carried out with the aim of obtaining a water use dataset not only at high temporal level of detail but also at high spatial level of detail i e end use level more in detail classification was conducted based on engineering judgment and relying both on the information obtained by clustering the events in the duration volume mesh and that obtained from the replies of water use surveys submitted to the inhabitants specifically events were individually classified based on 1 physical features of water use duration volume flow rate 2 time of occurrence 3 frequency of occurrence of events with similar characteristics and 4 temporal distance from other events with similar or dissimilar characteristics in particular the following n e u 5 end use categories were assumed for labelling dishwasher taps washing machine shower bathtub and toilet additionally all the events whose characteristics did not allow high confidence classification were labelled as uncertain uses it is worth noting that shower and bathtub uses were considered together in this study due to 1 the similarity in duration and volume per use between these two categories making manual discrimination rather difficult in most of the cases 2 the current tendency of people to mostly use the bathtub for having showers instead of baths by basically activating the same tap and 3 the limited use of the bathtub in the households concerned as reported in the surveys from an operational standpoint classification was carried out by visualizing each event along with its features by means of matlab r2019a programming software two analysts with prior experience in manually classifying residential water use events i e researchers who had taken part in similar research carried out by mazzoni et al 58 were selected for labelling in greater detail labelling was first performed by one of them considering each individual event in turn along with its characteristics and position in the aggregate water consumption time series to avoid bias the results were then checked and supervised by the other analyst in the event that the opinion of the latter was not in line with the decision of the former classification of the water use concerned was jointly discussed and revised accordingly if after discussion an agreement between the two analysts was not reached the individual end use event concerned was classified as uncertain use specifically a set of rules was applied by the two analysts to perform manual labelling by way of example shower bathtub uses were searched among those infrequent uses either continuous or composed by many shorter events separated by limited periods of flow interruption lasting several minutes and characterized by medium or high consumption and constant or nearly constant flow rate thus spread over the same line of the duration volume plane similar rules were also adopted to identify tap uses even though by considering shorter durations lower volumes a higher flow rate variability and a more frequent daily use toilet and appliance uses by contrast were searched among the repeated blocks with a constant flow rate and related to lumped durations and volumes in the light of the fact that they generally appear as hotspots in the duration volume plane due to the fixed characteristics of flushing systems and appliance water inflows overall given that 1 the two analysts were capable of labelling a maximum of 2 000 individual events per working day and 2 an additional time of nearly 2 h per household was required to cluster individual events and process the information available on the water use surveys it took a total of about 150 h to perform manual labelling of all the 36 297 individual water use events resulting from the automated segmentation phase 2 2 4 multi stage analysis of end use water consumption the primary objective of the current study was to explore the characteristics of end use water consumption in the households considered highlighting similarities and differences with regard to the end use data available in the literature for similar geographical contexts this was achieved through a multi stage analysis carried out in relation to the overall group of n h monitored households in order to compensate for the differences in water consumption behaviours observed in single households specifically the following four stage analysis was conducted to address the four main research questions 1 evaluation of daily per capita end use water consumption l person day 2 evaluation of normalized standardized profiles of daily end use water consumption specifically daily profiles of water consumption i e a set of 24 hourly water consumption coefficients c k t were calculated for each end use as shown in equation 2 2 c k t 1 n h i 1 n h v i k t 1 n h 1 24 t 1 24 i 1 n h v i k t where v i k t is the total hourly water consumption of end use k k 1 n e u in household i i 1 n h over the t th hour of the day t 1 24 therefore the numerator defines the average volume of water consumed by end use k in all the n h households at hour t of the day whereas the denominator represents the daily average water consumption of end use k calculated considering all the n h households by way of example a c k t value equal to 2 suggests that at hour t and with regard to the overall household sample the water consumption of end use k is twice its daily average 3 evaluation of end use parameter values i e volume per use duration per use flow rate per use and daily frequency of use and comparison against the values available in the literature more precisely the following units of measurements were adopted l use in the case of volume per use min use in the case of duration per use l min in the case of flow rate per use and uses person day in the case of frequency of use it is worth noting that in this analysis a minimum temporal distance between two subsequent events of the same category was assumed for each end use class above which they were considered as separated water uses specifically a minimum temporal distance of 5 s was considered in the case of taps and toilets whereas a threshold of 2 min was assumed in the case of showers given that people may be used to turning off the water several times and also for some minutes during a shower in addition as far as electric appliances are concerned dishwasher and washing machine events occurring more than 90 min after the previous ones were considered to be related to different operating cycles hereinafter denoted as loads 4 evaluation of end use parameter empirical distributions and identification of the type and the parameters of the best fitting statistical distribution in greater detail the empirical probability density functions pdfs of individual households were first obtained through the kernel density estimation for each end use and parameter distribution individual pdf curves were then averaged over all n h households to obtain an overall set of empirical pdfs the average empirical pdfs were then subjected to automated curve fitting by means of matlab r2019a software specifically in accordance with the results reported in similar studies available in the literature e g blokker et al 64 and the cited references five statistical pdfs were considered for fitting 1 normal 2 lognormal 3 exponential 4 gamma and 5 weibull the above mentioned set of continuous pdfs was selected due to the non discrete nature of the four end use parameters investigated in this study the akaike information criterion aic 80 was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of each statistical pdf type the best fitting pdf was finally selected based on the distribution type characterized by the minimum aic parameter value 3 results and discussion this section includes a discussion of the results obtained by applying the four stage analysis described in the materials and methods section to investigate the characteristics of the end use water consumption in the households monitored all the numerical results presented hereinafter will be expressed with decimal precision except those related to the daily per capita frequency of use in this case centesimal precision will be considered instead to properly account for end uses which occur with very low daily frequency 3 1 evaluation of daily per capita end use water consumption as far as the daily per capita water consumption is concerned an aggregate average value of 121 5 l person day was observed in the monitored households the largest part of which tied to the use of showers bathtubs 46 2 l person day i e 38 0 and toilets 32 8 l person day i e 27 0 as indicated in fig 4 conversely lower volumes were related to the use of washing machines 17 0 l person day i e 14 0 taps 14 6 l person day i e 12 0 and dishwashers 3 6 l person day i e 3 0 with a residual amount of about 7 3 l person day i e 6 0 classified as uncertain use of water overall the results obtained indicate that on average the largest components of daily residential water consumption are related to the use of showers bathtubs and toilets followed by washing machines and taps whose daily per capita water consumption values are generally rather close this finding is coherent with the results of other end use studies conducted in similar or different geographical contexts e g refs 31 34 70 78 as far as individual end uses of water are concerned it is first worth noting that the results obtained are in line with those reported by the other end use studies conducted in the netherlands i e 70 74 the results of which are shown in table 2 except as regards the daily per capita water consumption of dishwashers and toilets which is slightly outside the ranges reported in the other dutch studies cited i e 2 0 3 0 and 33 7 37 1 l person day respectively as demonstrated in the following subsection and shown in table 2 this is mainly due to variations in the daily frequency of dishwasher and toilet use along with lower average volumes per toilet flush in addition larger differences among end uses emerge when the results of the current study are compared against those reported for different countries such as the united states i e 31 75 or australia i e 31 76 78 for example the toilet water consumption reported in this study is considerably lower than the values shown in the american studies 49 7 70 0 l person day and higher than the values indicated in the australian ones 14 3 31 0 l person day whereas higher water consumption values for washing machines and taps were observed in all the aforementioned american and australian studies 20 7 56 9 and 17 4 41 2 l person day respectively it is believed that the reported differences are partially due to different levels of technological development reflected in the studies concerned explaining why for example the largest consumption associated with toilet use was observed in the most outdated study i e 34 and partially to behavioural factors related to water availability and drought risk the latter aspect could explain for example why the lowest toilet water consumption values were observed in the australian studies lastly no significant differences among studies were observed in the case of dishwasher and shower bathtub uses 3 2 evaluation of normalized profiles of daily end use water consumption the evaluation of the normalized i e standardized end use water consumption profiles revealed on a daily basis different hourly distributions of water consumption based on the end use category considered as shown in fig 5 on the one hand it emerged that as expected the water consumption of toilets fig 5f and taps fig 5b is minimum at night and pretty constant in diurnal hours confirming that the above end uses generally occur in a constant manner throughout the day although peaks in water consumption emerge in the morning and at dinner time respectively when people are most likely to be at home on the other hand in the case of showers bathtubs fig 5d water consumption is more concentrated at specific times of the day these end uses being characterized by a higher peak in the morning when people get up along with a lower peak in the evening when people come back home breaking down water consumption further two peaks occur in the morning the first of which at around 7 00 and the second of which at around 9 00 these different behaviours in terms of water use are most likely due to the different profiles of the inhabitants who include children students and part or full time workers and also different habits such as having showers before or after breakfast time furthermore as far as appliance profiles are concerned a single peak of water consumption was observed around midday in the case of washing machines fig 5c whereas a rather heterogeneous profile emerged in the case of dishwasher use fig 5a although it may be observed that this appliance is typically used around breakfast mealtime or during the night overall the daily end use profiles obtained are in line with those shown in the rather limited number of end use studies including this kind of information see for example 31 34 76 78 3 3 evaluation of average end use parameter values the availability of high resolution information about end use water consumption also allowed an investigation of end use parameters such as daily frequency of use volume per use duration per use and flow rate per use end use parameters were obtained by statistically analysing in turn the characteristics of all the events included in each end use category moreover the results of the analysis were compared against those reported in studies previously conducted in the same geographical area as shown in table 2 in this regard the studies conducted on a three yearly basis in the netherlands for the period between 2004 and 2016 70 74 were considered as a benchmark when the frequency of use is considered it emerged that on average taps are activated most frequently 13 83 times person day followed by toilets 4 22 flushes person day moreover inhabitants are used to having a shower or a bath about three times every four days 0 76 uses person day whereas dishwashers and washing machines are typically loaded with daily or higher frequency only in households with at least 3 4 inhabitants 0 27 loads person day as far as the duration per use is concerned the results show that only shower uses last several minutes 8 0 min use whereas the duration of toilet and tap use is only of a few seconds 0 8 min use i e about 48 s use in the former case and 0 2 min use i e about 12 s use in the latter it was also observed that despite the considerably long duration per appliance load which may last up to 3 h the total duration of washing machine and dishwasher inflow is only about 8 2 and 4 3 min load respectively revealing that appliances typically work without drawing water in for most of the duration of the load in addition considering volume per use the statistical analysis showed that showers bathtubs and washing machines are the most consuming end uses with about 63 6 l use and 62 9 l load respectively they are followed by dishwashers 11 4 l load toilets 6 8 l flush and taps 1 2 l use in greater detail it is worth noting that although toilet and tap volumes per use are the smallest the contribution of these end uses to the total indoor water consumption is significant because of their considerably high daily frequency finally considering flow rate per use the highest average values were observed in the case of toilets 8 3 l min showers bathtubs 7 9 l min and washing machines 7 0 l min whereas lower values emerged in the case of taps 4 8 l min and dishwashers 2 8 l min in general the average end use parameter values are in line with those of previous dutch studies albeit with some exceptions by way of example the daily frequency of tap and toilet use is slightly lower than the corresponding values reported in other studies 70 74 i e 19 21 20 01 uses person day and 5 86 6 27 flushes person day respectively this is most likely due to the fact that all the residents of the n h monitored households are students or workers so they generally spend at least a half day away with consequent reduced toilet or tap use at home in addition an increase in the frequency of dishwasher use emerged in the current study resulting overall in an increase in daily per capita water consumption associated with dishwashers whereas no relevant changes in frequency were observed in the case of washing machines and showers bathtubs as far as volumes per use are considered the value obtained in the current study with regard to dishwasher use confirms the decreasing trend highlighted in the other studies 70 74 whereas an inverse behaviour emerged in the case of washing machine use despite the similar decreasing trend reported in the above mentioned studies where average consumption was nearly 10 l higher than the consumption observed in the last decade see e g refs 72 74 with regard to toilets a considerably lower volume per flush was observed in the current study compared to the other values reported 70 74 which may reasonably be attributed to technological advancements more specifically 7 of the n h 9 monitored households have toilets with dual flush systems leading to non negligible water savings per individual flush lastly no relevant differences emerged in the case of shower duration and flow rate per use i e the only end use for which duration and flow rate were investigated in previous studies 3 4 evaluation of end use parameter probability distributions the findings with regard to the average end use parameter values were confirmed by the outcomes of the analysis of their empirical and statistical distributions pdfs from an operational standpoint as far as duration per use is concerned the analysis was carried out by expressing all durations in seconds s use s load or s flush based on the end use considered and all volumes in litres l use l load or l flush respectively whereas the flow rate was expressed in litres per minute l min moreover considering the distribution of appliance use duration it is worth noting that the total length of the periods during which the appliance drew in water was considered rather than the duration of the overall load in fact appliance uses typically involve a number of inflow events lasting a few minutes and taking place between longer periods of time during which the machine does not draw in water finally as regards the daily frequency of use statistical distributions are expressed in uses person day taps showers bathtubs flushes person day toilets or loads person day electric appliances so as to be comparable with the results available in the literature the best fitting statistical pdfs of the overall end use dataset are shown in fig 6 blue lines along with details about distribution type and parameters as expected the mean of these distributions is in line with the average parameter values shown in table 2 statistical pdfs were also compared against their respective empirical pdfs thick grey lines obtained with respect to the overall h1 h9 dataset overall different parameter distributions were estimated depending on the end use and the parameter considered more specifically right skewed statistical pdfs emerged in most of the cases fitted by lognormal weibull or gamma distributions however some parameter distributions were fitted by normal or nearly normal curves e g toilet flush duration shower flow rate and toilet flush flow rate indicating that in these cases the end use parameter values were distributed almost symmetrically around the average an exception is represented by washing machine flow rate values which were fitted by a slightly left skewed weibull pdf moreover as far as duration and volume distributions are concerned empirical and statistical pdfs substantially correspond in the case of some end uses taps washing machine shower bathtub whereas larger differences emerged for the others dishwasher toilet this deviation between empirical and statistical pdfs of dishwasher and toilet uses is partially due to the limited number of monitored users making the empirical distribution of parameter values nearly multimodal and partially due to the limited variability of appliance and toilet parameters in the same household given that their volume and duration were generally constant in fact the parameter empirical pdfs of individual households were considerably narrower than the corresponding best fitting statistical pdfs of the overall set of n h households differences between empirical and statistical pdfs were also observed in the case of flow rate distributions which differed from household to household these differences emerged for all end use flow rates and are most likely due to 1 household location i e pressure head available at the household inlet point 2 plumbing system layout and age i e pressure head available at the end use and 3 end use type i e device make and model the only exception is represented by the tap flow rate which was characterized by a smoothed empirical pdf with the absence of multiple peaks this is most likely due to the fact that taps are typically used in a variety of ways even within the same household i e not only for different durations but also with manual adjustments in the flow rate lastly with regard to the daily frequency of use most of the best fitting statistical pdfs obtained nearly symmetrical or right skewed weibull or gamma distributions closely approximated their respective empirical pdfs the largest differences were observed in the case of taps in relation to which a multi peak empirical pdf fitted by a slightly right skewed weibull curve was found this distribution reflects the different behaviours in terms of tap use within households not only as regards timing of use and modulation see by way of example the best fitting statistical distribution of tap duration per use and flow rate but also as regards frequency of use 5 conclusions the current study was conducted with the aim of investigating the characteristics of water consumption at the end use level by exploiting high resolution data collected at nine households in the netherlands differing in terms of occupancy rates inhabitants profiles and available end uses the study entailed 1 developing and applying a method for automated data pre processing i e segmentation of water uses into individual events and 2 manually labelling the individual events obtained based on engineering judgment and the information available from water consumption surveys submitted to household inhabitants a multi stage analysis was then conducted in order to explore the main features of end use water consumption in the selected households specifically the following findings emerged the average daily per capita water consumption was of 121 5 l person day with the use of showers bathtubs and toilets accounting for the largest part of consumption 46 2 and 32 8 l person day respectively whereas lower consumption was associated with washing machines taps and dishwashers 17 0 14 6 and 3 6 l person day respectively the use of toilets and taps was rather constant during the day whereas a more concentrated use of showers bathtubs and washing machines could be observed at specific times of the day in addition a heterogeneous daily profile emerged in the case of dishwasher use taps were activated the most during the day 13 83 times person day followed by toilets 4 22 flushes person day whereas showers bathtubs and appliances were typically used once or less than once per person per day only shower bathtub uses generally lasted several minutes on average 8 2 min use whereas the average duration of toilet and tap uses was shorter than 1 min 0 8 and 0 2 min use respectively in addition despite the long duration of appliance operating cycles loads the total duration of inflow is only of a few minutes per load the largest average volumes per use were tied to showers bathtubs and washing machines 63 6 and 62 9 l use respectively followed by dishwashers toilet and taps 11 4 6 8 and 1 2 l use respectively the highest flow rates per use were observed in the case of toilets showers bathtubs and washing machines 8 3 7 9 and 7 0 l min respectively whereas lower values emerged in the case of taps and dishwashers 4 8 and 2 8 l min respectively different parameter distributions were estimated depending on end use and the parameter considered right skewed empirical distributions pdfs were observed in most of the cases generally fitted by lognormal weibull or gamma statistical pdfs as expected the empirical pdfs of manually regulated end uses e g showers bathtubs and taps were generally well fitted by the above statistical pdf types in the light of the fact that the parameters involved basically depend on human habits and their values may cover a rather wide range even within the same household conversely the empirical pdfs of automated or fixed volume end uses i e electric appliances and toilets were quite narrow in the case of individual households and nearly multimodal thus poorly fitted by the above statistical pdf types with regard to the overall household dataset this is a consequence of the fact that toilet and appliance parameters are typically not variable within the same household whereas considerable differences may be observed from household to household it is worth noting that the end use data obtained refer to a limited set of households in addition nearly all data were acquired during the in between or cold seasons i e when outdoor water consumption is typically minimum or null and some indoor end uses e g taps or showers may be affected by reductions in the frequency of use therefore and similarly to refs 70 74 the seasonal variability of end use water consumption was not investigated in the current study due to the lack of extensive data collected during warmer periods despite the above the results obtained may represent a first helpful benchmark against which to compare the results of future end use studies including the monitoring of residential water consumption in fact unlike other studies conducted on water consumption in the netherlands e g refs 70 74 which made use of surveys and questionnaires to gather information about water end uses this study relied on actual water consumption time series collected at high temporal resolution whilst the information obtained through surveys which may be unreliable and subjective was used only to support the analysts during the classification phase in addition the current study investigated some end use water consumption features such as the statistical distribution of end use parameter values which had been previously explored only to a limited degree and which can support the calibration of water demand models available in the literature e g ref 53 in conclusion it is believed that the end use dataset obtained could be used to provide feedback to household inhabitants thereby increasing their awareness and encouraging a more conscious water use behaviour by way of example as far as the households considered in this study are concerned if inhabitants are aware that much of their domestic consumption is tied to specific aspects such as the presence of excessively large toilet tanks e g household h2 including a toilet with a capacity of about 12 l or excessively long showers e g household h4 showers lasting on average about13 3 min they might be encouraged to install more efficient or water saving devices e g dual flush systems or change their consumption behaviour e g by adjusting flow or closing taps the results obtained could also be of interest to water utilities operating in the above geographical context but not only since they provide insight into when and where water is typically consumed in the residential sector this could support intervention plans and strategies not only to optimize water distribution but also to promote a reduction in water consumption through specific information campaigns or incentives for the installation of more efficient devices lastly the results of the study confirm that a detailed characterization of domestic end use water consumption and parameters is feasible even in the case of rather limited monitoring periods of ordinary home activity e g two weeks and that the proposed methodology may be a valid alternative to survey based analyses of water consumption at the end use level future studies will focus on enlarging the water consumption dataset in order to explore the characteristics of residential end uses of water over different periods and evaluate the seasonal variability of end use water consumption in addition analyses will seek to investigate the minimum household sample size required to obtain a representative and statistically significant dataset per family cluster this will allow the end use results obtained to be scaled up to broader contexts in the field of residential and subsequently non residential water consumption further developments will also include the definition of guidelines supporting the automated labelling of individual end use events with considerable time and human resource savings data statement the data presented in this study i e high

8731,a condensate generated from air in air conditioning ac units is a reliable and a stable source of water possible to be reused in different forms this study focuses on condensate recovery from heating ventilation air conditioning hvac systems maintaining ambient or indoor air the database of experiments conducted in outdoor air is much larger than those conducted in indoor air the experiments conducted in greenhouses plant factories vertical farms and space systems and applications come with assistance the latter include facilities such as the international space station and closed analog ecosystems simulating future space bases in these locations condensate is mainly recovered for crew needs consumption hygiene etc from these studies it is possible to derive knowledge of what treatment processes are required to obtain water of high quality in general the most important parameters affecting the quantity and quality of recovered condensate are climate zone and associated climate parameters building type building use and supply air volume additionally in case of indoor air recovery the most important parameters are the climatic conditions people activity plant types grown and whether the system has to operate in a closed loop other important parameters influencing condensate composition is construction and material of the hvac system and the condensate capture system the growing interest in the market for vertical farms and closed loop grow chambers is observed globally thus this study will favor future research on condensate recovery from these facilities this paper deepens the look at the problem of hvac condensate recovery by including previously not considered places such as closed ecological systems where condensate is used for drinking water purposes keywords condensate water recovery circular management data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water stress and climate change are one of the major current problems of humanity 1 rapid population growth is accompanied by widespread globalization industrialization and modernization of developing countries resulting in freshwater scarcity which slowly becomes not only a regional but also a global problem 2 already global water demand is estimated to increase at a rate of 1 year to year associated with an increasing demand for water for industrial and domestic use 3 only 0 76 of the earth s water is available and accessible to human activities 4 two thirds of freshwater is unavailable for human consumption because it is preserved as ice phases in ice caps glaciers and permanent snow in addition an intensive exploitation of groundwaters causes the congestion of available aquifers thereby forcing the use of appropriate treatment processes 5 6 growing population intensive industrialization and urbanization coupled with climate change are exacerbating the problem of a hollow food production chain thereby further increasing the demand for water for agricultural reasons the need to look for new sources of water recovery can be seen in the sustainable development goals sdgs these are hidden in sdg 2 which requires zero hunger sdg 3 which is ensuring healthy lives sdg 6 which is an access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation for all and protecting water resources from pollution among others it is also evident in sdg 14 1 which demands to reduce marine pollution explicitly mentioning nutrient pollution all these goals should be achieved by 2030 7 ensuring future water security requires broad community support as well as changes in policy practice and technology to increase the committed provision of alternative water resources 8 many technologies are already in use for water recovery and reuse of wastewater examples include desalination e g through evaporation reverse osmosis electrodialysis solar distillation cloud seeding atmospheric water vapor harvesting and water recovery from wastewater streams e g through membrane techniques or conventional techniques for e g rainwater 1 9 another potential source is worth noting the air both indoor and outdoor which can contain a large amount of water the potential of the water recovery from the air is already noted and reviewed in earlier studies 10 11 this source of water is expected to be more popular since the global heating ventilation air conditioning hvac market is predicted to grow nearly 6 by 2023 compared to the last 5 years 12 the use of air conditioning systems is rapidly increasing worldwide and is now almost a necessity in parallel with the widespread demand for thermal comfort which until recently was a luxury 12 both thermal and cooling comfort provisions involve the possibility of water recovery through hvac equipment there are a few air conditioning related technologies where such recovery would be possible vapor compression units 11 recuperators crossflow counterflow 13 14 indirect evaporative exchangers operating in a condensation variant 15 sorption desiccant systems 10 a key process is condensation which allows for obtaining the condensate obtained to be used for various applications thus striving to create a closed water cycle additionally current knowledge regarding condensate recovery from hvac might be supplemented with space research experience this data is important because typically these systems operate in a closed loop system e g the atmosphere inside the space object must be regenerated without an access to fresh ambient atmospheric air for obvious reasons moreover considering the need for the water recovery condensate is usually used for potable purposes thus condensate management in space application is one of the most demanding examples of such a recovery system the data of condensate management systems has been available from the previous years from space missions in stations such as mir 16 17 and from recent times due to the continued operation of the international space station 18 21 a special case is the condensate recovery from plant cultivation growth facilities implemented in closed analog systems e g lunar palace nasa biomass production chamber etc 22 29 plants transpire large amounts of water into the air which can be successfully recovered fortson et al 1994 23 presented detailed data on condensed water transpiring from the biomass production chamber bpc of a nasa closed ecosystem this chamber had a volume of 113 m3 and when growing wheat its daily condensation rates ranged from 23 to 84 l d by analyzing the data obtained from the bpc the species of crop grown can affect the composition of the condensate 30 for example the condensate from the chamber where wheat was grown had higher concentrations of potassium calcium and zinc compared to the experiments where potatoes were grown the analysis of data regarding the composition of recovered condensate from greenhouses is particularly important because of the growing popularity of vertical soilless farms applied in terrestrial condition an increasing number of new installations being built is indicative of the growing popularity of these solutions 31 an interesting project which combines water recovery and vertical farming is the suskult project it assumes the spatial integration of wastewater treatment plants with food production in vertical farm with soilless systems 32 their vision is to combine urban wastewater treatment systems and efficient agricultural production systems in densely populated urban areas thus it can be predicted that the potential for condensate utilization will only increase therefore it is reasonable and appropriate to perform a review relating to the prediction models of volume of condensate stream parameters possible treatment methods and management with special focus on condensate stream gained from plants cultivation chambers this paper aims at compiling the data available in the literature regarding the quantitative and qualitative parameters of water recovered from liquefaction in conventional systems terrestrial hvac and in space closed loop systems the factors that may influence the parameters of the resulting condensate are analyzed as well as possible uses and technologies for management and treatment of this stream this approach will outline opportunities for the integrated design of hvac systems optimized for water production in addition to air treatment in terrestrial systems this paper deepens the look at the problem of hvac condensate recovery by including previously not considered places such as closed ecological systems where condensate is used for drinking water purposes 2 classification of condensate generating systems a general division prepared for the purpose of this study is presented in fig 1 water in the form of water vapor can be recovered from both ambient and indoor air systems generating condensate from the ambient air can be also divided into those in which the condensate is a by product usually in the vapor compression based air conditioning systems and those in which condensation is specially induced to collect the condensate the same chillers sorption systems thermoelectric modules etc the second source of obtaining water is the air exhausted generally the facilities where high humidity is required present the highest potential in particular greenhouses or plant factories in extract air heat recovery condensate is a by product in recuperative or evaporative exchangers this happens if the appropriate configuration is used often this water is not used and is directed to the sewage system nevertheless striving for a closed circuit it is worth referring to the facility such as the iss in which there is no possibility of draining the unwanted condensate to the sewage system on the contrary it is a source of water for cosmonauts 3 condensate characteristics 3 1 condensate recovery from ambient air there are systems where the primary purpose is to recover water from outdoor air e g cloud seeding or artificial rain dew water collection and fog water collection a detailed review on this topic was described by shafein et al 10 kandeal et al 33 raavesh et al 34 and wang et al 35 in this chapter the study focuses on condensate generated as a byproduct from the ambient air maintenance the collection of condensate depends on several factors however the air parameters such as temperature and humidity ratio hence the dew point temperature and the cold contact surface temperature are the main factors that determine the amount of condensate generated from hvac equipment 36 geographical location temperature and humidity ratio of the air as well as the type of building and its style of use are also important factors influencing the production of condensate for example the areas with a cold climate will have less condensate recovery potential from the ambient air than areas with a tropical and humid climate similarly a typical production building equipped with machinery and lighting and intensive human activity will burden air conditioning more than an empty building which will increase condensate production from the indoor air 37 as the amount of generated condensate is also related to the size of the air stream supplied to the air conditioning unit therefore it will be generated less in single family buildings than in large multi family or commercial buildings in humid climates more water can be recovered in laboratory and clinical buildings which require 100 outdoor air in each air exchange process while other buildings generally recirculate some of the conditioned air along with the outdoor air 38 39 some cities have decided to legally resolve the issue of condensate accumulation for example san antonio usa requires all new commercial buildings with a total cooling capacity of 10 refrigeration ton 35 kw or more to design drain lines that trap condensate from air conditioning systems and discharge this water to one location in the building 38 39 this encourages the reuse of condensate and its management in the most optimal way which in turn helps to alleviate the growing demand for limited water resources and the city s water infrastructure 39 the examples of the amount of generated condensate from commercial buildings in the city are 946 and 5184 l d from the mall and library respectively 38 39 a collective list of systems generating condensate from the ambient air with the division into commercial and residential buildings is presented in table 1 the authors siam et al and alipour et al show the need for changes on the legal level as well as social education so that the reuse of condensate becomes more popular 43 46 a detailed analysis of the next steps before implementing the condensate recirculation was presented by siam et al 46 theoretical models are one of the helpful tools in assessing the feasibility and profitability of a condensate capture and reuse installation however the theoretical model may differ significantly from actual measurements for example in lawernce et al 36 study condensate volume was predicted using a model that was based on the climate conditions of their location study and tonnage of the system the observed values of condensate were 30 higher than the predicted values the difference in estimation was mainly attributed to an error in measurement of the relative humidity and the supply air flow rate 36 chosen research is shown in table 2 3 2 condensate recovery from indoor air the condensation process can also be carried out with the use of indoor air from such places as greenhouses closed plant production chambers or halls space stations and other closed ecosystems extensive review on dehumidification process in greenhouses including condensate recovery was conducted by soussi et al 58 a collective list of systems generating condensate from the indoor air is presented in table 3 the case of the international space station is particularly interesting because the collection of condensate takes place in microgravity conditions 19 the maintenance of appropriate environmental parameters requires the removal of both the sensible heat and the water vapor generated inside space station to achieve this condensing a heat exchanger is installed onboard iss 18 the current system uses a two step process including condensation in a heat exchanger and further a two phase air water mixture separation in a rotary separator before the stream reaches a separator it is passed through the particle filter further condensate treatment includes catalytical oxidation multifiltration process with catalysts sorbents and ion exchange resins and ion exchange the purified water is mineralized with inorganic salts and preserved with ionic silver for potable purposes other non obvious places from which it is possible to gain knowledge about condensate recovery are closed ecosystems mainly used to simulate space missions on earth it is worth noting that the papers describing production of condensate by the systems intended to work ultimately in extraterrestrial conditions do not precisely describe the condensate generation technology it is essential since in those experiments it is assumed that it is necessary to create closed or closely closed loops of all consumables such water energy nutrients etc the water recovered from condensate is used for liquid fertilizer production but also for potable purposes thus it also shows necessary treatment chain to achieve good quality this also gives a perspective that can also be faced by humans in earthly conditions in the future there are some theoretical studies on condensate generation system from indoor air including greenhouses and closed plant factories a list of selected studies is presented in table 4 despite the small amount of theoretical research on this subject an increase in modeling the possibilities of water recovery in plant factories or vertical farms is expected to extend considering the growing popularity of these forms of intensive agriculture 69 70 more importantly numerical simulations and theoretical models will help design effective systems at such facilities however in order to create a precise mathematical model basics knowledge of mass and heat transfer is required but also plant physiology and processes taking place in them 4 condensate quality and management the quality of the condensate is a very important indicator due to the fact that the purpose of the condensate recovery is to use it for another use it can be as simple as make up water in cooling towers providing 15 to even 45 of the required make up water for a cooling tower for typical commercial buildings and specialist buildings such as laboratories 37 other common applications are the use of condensate for flushing toilets irrigation of green areas as process water 38 39 during analog and actual space missions condensate is used mainly for potable purposes and for fertilizer production 19 the air entering the ahu both ambient and indoor is one of the sources of contamination in the condensate preliminary air filtration allows for the removal of contaminants suspended in the air however particles not captured will pass further into the condensation water this is especially seen in closed facilities such as the international space station where it is reported that the dissolved organics ammonia ions and microorganisms are present in captured stream 63 condensate is cleaner in places where the human presence is combined with plants cultivation 63 this was the case of lunar palace 1 where transpiring water reduced the level of contamination but at the same time increased the amount of wastewater generated 270 4 kg d versus 2 27 kg d condensate produced per crewmember in iss more importantly goto 30 observed the crop variety also affects the composition of the condensate for example the condensate from the wheat growing chamber had higher concentrations of potassium calcium and zinc compared to the experiments where potatoes were grown in addition to metal contamination small amounts of bacteria were another questionable parameter the composition of the water recovered from plant transpiration in the future extraterrestrial colony will therefore depend on the size and type of cultivation plant species and the type of system used the second source of contamination is the surface on which condensate is generated e g cooling coils and the entire remaining condensate handling system e g transport lines collection tanks etc since condensate is usually slightly acidic and contains not completely dissolved solids 39 it tends to react with surfaces to form metal ions and other chemical contamination and thus requires further handling this was visible in the closed growth chamber with soilless cultivation where higher concentrations of copper cadmium and zinc were associated with the direct leaching of these elements from the condensation system in which copper condensation coils and cadmium and tin solder were used 30 a condensate storage tank is necessary in most cases due to the time buffer between collection and re use inside the tank and in pipeline biofilm may grow on the walls which might result in microorganisms development microbial contamination of condensate than would be dependent on thickness and composition of biofilm and also flow velocity thus when water is reused for human use a microbiological control is required to detect possible pathogenic microorganisms as it can be seen various factors may affect the quality of the condensate and its composition may vary depending on the type of air used ambient indoor summary of condensate quality gathered from ambient air and indoor air are shown in tables 5 and 6 respectively it can be seen that typically the ph of the outdoor air condensate is lower than the ph of the indoor air condensate according to alipour et al 43 lower ph of the condensate may be related to the presence of gases especially carbon dioxide in the air overall however the ph of the condensate samples is quite close to the epa standard values the ec of water can be defined as the ability to conduct electricity by the presence of electrolytes producing cations and anions 71 alipour et al 43 observed that in the quayside areas the mean ec and tds of condensate is higher than in offshore areas the reason for the increased content is probably the dissolution of sea salt in the air the soilless plant cultivation experiments had a similar salinity which could in turn be related to the evaporation of the saline nutrient solution 22 alipour et al 43 predicted that the turbidity of the condensate may be greater in the case of the outside air than in the case of the inside air due to the greater pollution caused by for example the emission of particles from vehicles cod appeared to be higher in condensate originated from ambient air than from indoor air however it should be noted that activities undertaken indoors can significantly affect the quality of the condensate in terms of cod for example zhao et al 22 noted large differences between cod in condensates collected from different rooms the authors state that the reason for the differences is straw chopping conducted by the crew members in the storage room connected with plant cabin ii which caused straw powders discharge into atmospheric environments this is especially important when designing condensate recovery in vertical cannabis farms where the process of processing plant material can also cause such effects the main nutrients n p k are present in rather small amounts except in a few cases the highest nitrogen concentrations were found in the condensate from the iss which is caused by the source of the condensate itself i e sweat and moisture exhaled by the crew 18 potassium content was especially visible in condensate from wheat experiment in nasa s biomass production chamber and onboard mir station 16 23 this was not the case in experiments using ambient air where potassium content was close to 0 magnesium calcium and chloride content were similar for both condensate sources slightly higher values of mg and ca were noticed in al farayedhi study 44 and cl in mudget study 16 compared to the other studies shown in tables 5 and 6 except for the case of the mir station 16 and the glawe study 39 where higher sodium concentrations were reported 8 30 and 11 30 mg l the other cases had negligible sodium content a similar relationship was noted for sulfate only al farayedh 44 and mudget 16 study observed higher values 5 38 and 6 30 mg l generally the presence of microelements i e fe mn etc in condensate allows for using it as a supplementation to liquid fertilizers used for growing plants the lack of certain nutrients will limit plant growth and quality which is a particular problem in closed systems 72 acetate and formate are volatile constituents of many cleaning compounds and are present in other consumer products and hence may appear in the condensate 45 this is important as acetate and formate can corrode the copper radiator coils which can lead to premature coil aging or even complete deterioration 73 additionally as electron donors they can create biological control problems and biofilm can form in the system 45 glawe 39 explains the presence of aluminum and copper by the fact that these metals are the basic materials that make up the cooling coils on the other hand iron and nickel can come from a galvanized steel tank as well as from transport pipes reuter noticed those constituents as well as the content of organic substances low alkalinity and ph might be the biggest challenge regardless of the chosen method of treatment 45 precipitation of copper and aluminum compounds can be a problem in general the choice of condensate treatment methods will depend on the intended use of the reclaimed water non human contact applications e g cooling towers will have lower requirements than those where human contact may occur such as landscape watering toilet flushing and flat surface cleaning if the condensate will be used as drinking or hygienic water it must meet all potable water standards such a variant occurs primarily in experiments relating to closed loops space systems examples of process sequences include but are not limited to processes such as filtration catalytic oxidation and ion exchange are used in iss 18 pp column prefiltration activated carbon adsorption column ultrafiltration and uv disinfection in first experiments in lunar palace analog 63

ultraviolet sterilization in biosphere 2 28 61 62 similar processes including ion exchange resins and electrochemical processes were used in terrestrial systems using ambient air for condensate recovery for potable purposes 53 when the condensate was used to produce liquid fertilizer the authors typically used uv disinfection 64 5 challenges regarding condensate systems according to literature reports it is crucial for earth systems to include a condensate capture and management system already at the design stage of new buildings this would greatly facilitate its management etc proper commissioning of the system would allow potential faults to be caught earlier in addition scheduled inspections and maintenance are critical to maintaining continuous efficient operation of the system glawe 39 presented the main challenges and recommendations facing condensate capture for terrestrial systems with hvac appropriately designed storage tanks in terms of size material combination of condensate with other on site sources of reclaimed water to optimize return of investment poor maintenance of hvac system condensate management system and storage tanks might result in major failures since any condensate use system in a building must be able to be supplemented with tap water a measurement of the amount of condensate and tap water must be implemented algae and biofilm growth in the condensate system which in turn can clog pipes and components further downstream an additional threat is pathogenic microorganisms such as legionella in the context of closed loop systems designed for space applications the case is somewhat different the issues shown above are equally important however reduced or microgravity conditions are an additional challenge which must be considered at the design stage additionally the systems must be reliable which is why synthetically created condensate is often used for long term testing 74 this approach can also be used to test condensate management systems and treatment methods another essential factor is cost of the system it is sad that condensate recovery systems add approximately 3 5 to the total cost of mechanical engineering for a new building 75 upgrade costs of addition of such system to the existing buildings are slightly higher but still reasonable 75 kajale 41 summarized initial cost of installation of condensate recovery system in the university of alabama at birmingham condensate recovery system depending on the building cost was in the range of 2475 29 965 the variation in the installation cost was due to the varying number of air handlers in the buildings sharing of the 500 gallon storage tank and also its location with final total cost of 148 460 other examples shown by the author is

requirement considering the challenges facing municipal water infrastructures due to a climate change intensive urbanization and globalization it is necessary to look for alternative water sources the condensate obtained from the air as a relatively stable and predictable not heavily polluted source of water should be considered already at the design stage of the building alongside other solutions such as rainwater harvesting such solutions were presented among others by jurga et al 76 niloy 77 ghimire et al 78 6 summary and conclusions summary of this study could be concluded in following sentences outdoor air water recovery via hvac from commercial and residential buildings is more discerned than indoor air water recovery experience gained from experiments relating to space missions can be useful in future research the quantity and quality of recovered condensate from outdoor air will be influenced by parameters such as climate zone and associated climate parameters the type of building how it is used and the volume of the supply air in contrast for indoor air recovery the main parameters are the purpose of the building and required climate parameters whether people live in it whether crops are grown if so which crops whether the system is to operate in a closed loop the amount of recovered condensate depends on the capacity of the installed air conditioning equipment and the outdoor or exhaust air parameters in many of the cases analyzed the amount of recovered condensate is sufficient to cover all or part of the water demand for plant watering cooling tower feed or toilet flushing there are cases in which the recovered amount of condensate exceeds the water demand of the building sanitary and urinal water paintner et al 49 therefore the validity of condensate recovery could be considered on a case by case basis already during the design of the building s internal systems condensate can be used both as part of water and energy savings when used for ventilation air pre cooling or as feed water for evaporative cooling equipment of the cases analyzed the largest amount of condensate per day 10 200 l was obtained by analyzing the recovery in a hotel building in abu dhabi magrini et al 55 57 in alabama at the university of birmingham an experiment was conducted in which 55 27 million l of condensate was recovered in 17 months it should be noted that the condensate flux is not constant over time and depends on among other things the parameters of the air from which the water is recovered condensate ph values vary in the range 5 0 7 76 higher values are observed in indoor experiments condensate ec vary in the range 30 220 4 μs cm the greater the salt content of the air due to e g close proximity to the beach or evaporation of salt rich fertilizers the greater the ec of the condensate cod appeared to be higher in condensate originated from ambient air 18 150 mg l than from indoor air 1 92 25 12 mg l the main macro nutrients n p k are present in rather small amounts 2 0 mg l exception is n nh4 in indoor experiments 3 61 88 mg l mg ca and cl content is similar for both sources indoor and ambient 0 02 0 933 mg l 0 054 1 26 mg l 0 10 1 70 mg l for mg ca and cl respectively except for the two cases where higher sodium concentrations were reported 8 30 and 11 30 mg l the other studies had negligible sodium content a similar relationship was noted for sulfate 5 38 and 6 30 mg l micronutrients presence is visible the highest values are observed for zn 1 86 mg l cu 0 96 mg l and ni 1 40 mg l each in indoor experiments other constituents that may appear in the condensate are acetate formate methanol other alcohols due to the increasing need for intensive agriculture such as vertical farms and plant factories future research directions should focus on the recovery of condensate from these sites and more on combining various growth parameters with water recovery energy balance and higher crop yields systems that use both condensate and rainwater appear to have great potential for future studies 7 recommendation for future research and perspectives the use of condensate recovery systems in the future may become a necessity there is a need to include the political bodies that establish the law in the discussion there is also a need for more education of the community responsible for urban planning and architecture as well as making the public aware of the positives of introducing such solutions it is also advisable to introduce probabilistic risk based assessment models to support decision making in water system risk management e g as in ref 79 combined with detailed cost analyses of recovery systems according to the authors the review performed demonstrates one of the future perspectives of

8731,a condensate generated from air in air conditioning ac units is a reliable and a stable source of water possible to be reused in different forms this study focuses on condensate recovery from heating ventilation air conditioning hvac systems maintaining ambient or indoor air the database of experiments conducted in outdoor air is much larger than those conducted in indoor air the experiments conducted in greenhouses plant factories vertical farms and space systems and applications come with assistance the latter include facilities such as the international space station and closed analog ecosystems simulating future space bases in these locations condensate is mainly recovered for crew needs consumption hygiene etc from these studies it is possible to derive knowledge of what treatment processes are required to obtain water of high quality in general the most important parameters affecting the quantity and quality of recovered condensate are climate zone and associated climate parameters building type building use and supply air volume additionally in case of indoor air recovery the most important parameters are the climatic conditions people activity plant types grown and whether the system has to operate in a closed loop other important parameters influencing condensate composition is construction and material of the hvac system and the condensate capture system the growing interest in the market for vertical farms and closed loop grow chambers is observed globally thus this study will favor future research on condensate recovery from these facilities this paper deepens the look at the problem of hvac condensate recovery by including previously not considered places such as closed ecological systems where condensate is used for drinking water purposes keywords condensate water recovery circular management data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water stress and climate change are one of the major current problems of humanity 1 rapid population growth is accompanied by widespread globalization industrialization and modernization of developing countries resulting in freshwater scarcity which slowly becomes not only a regional but also a global problem 2 already global water demand is estimated to increase at a rate of 1 year to year associated with an increasing demand for water for industrial and domestic use 3 only 0 76 of the earth s water is available and accessible to human activities 4 two thirds of freshwater is unavailable for human consumption because it is preserved as ice phases in ice caps glaciers and permanent snow in addition an intensive exploitation of groundwaters causes the congestion of available aquifers thereby forcing the use of appropriate treatment processes 5 6 growing population intensive industrialization and urbanization coupled with climate change are exacerbating the problem of a hollow food production chain thereby further increasing the demand for water for agricultural reasons the need to look for new sources of water recovery can be seen in the sustainable development goals sdgs these are hidden in sdg 2 which requires zero hunger sdg 3 which is ensuring healthy lives sdg 6 which is an access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation for all and protecting water resources from pollution among others it is also evident in sdg 14 1 which demands to reduce marine pollution explicitly mentioning nutrient pollution all these goals should be achieved by 2030 7 ensuring future water security requires broad community support as well as changes in policy practice and technology to increase the committed provision of alternative water resources 8 many technologies are already in use for water recovery and reuse of wastewater examples include desalination e g through evaporation reverse osmosis electrodialysis solar distillation cloud seeding atmospheric water vapor harvesting and water recovery from wastewater streams e g through membrane techniques or conventional techniques for e g rainwater 1 9 another potential source is worth noting the air both indoor and outdoor which can contain a large amount of water the potential of the water recovery from the air is already noted and reviewed in earlier studies 10 11 this source of water is expected to be more popular since the global heating ventilation air conditioning hvac market is predicted to grow nearly 6 by 2023 compared to the last 5 years 12 the use of air conditioning systems is rapidly increasing worldwide and is now almost a necessity in parallel with the widespread demand for thermal comfort which until recently was a luxury 12 both thermal and cooling comfort provisions involve the possibility of water recovery through hvac equipment there are a few air conditioning related technologies where such recovery would be possible vapor compression units 11 recuperators crossflow counterflow 13 14 indirect evaporative exchangers operating in a condensation variant 15 sorption desiccant systems 10 a key process is condensation which allows for obtaining the condensate obtained to be used for various applications thus striving to create a closed water cycle additionally current knowledge regarding condensate recovery from hvac might be supplemented with space research experience this data is important because typically these systems operate in a closed loop system e g the atmosphere inside the space object must be regenerated without an access to fresh ambient atmospheric air for obvious reasons moreover considering the need for the water recovery condensate is usually used for potable purposes thus condensate management in space application is one of the most demanding examples of such a recovery system the data of condensate management systems has been available from the previous years from space missions in stations such as mir 16 17 and from recent times due to the continued operation of the international space station 18 21 a special case is the condensate recovery from plant cultivation growth facilities implemented in closed analog systems e g lunar palace nasa biomass production chamber etc 22 29 plants transpire large amounts of water into the air which can be successfully recovered fortson et al 1994 23 presented detailed data on condensed water transpiring from the biomass production chamber bpc of a nasa closed ecosystem this chamber had a volume of 113 m3 and when growing wheat its daily condensation rates ranged from 23 to 84 l d by analyzing the data obtained from the bpc the species of crop grown can affect the composition of the condensate 30 for example the condensate from the chamber where wheat was grown had higher concentrations of potassium calcium and zinc compared to the experiments where potatoes were grown the analysis of data regarding the composition of recovered condensate from greenhouses is particularly important because of the growing popularity of vertical soilless farms applied in terrestrial condition an increasing number of new installations being built is indicative of the growing popularity of these solutions 31 an interesting project which combines water recovery and vertical farming is the suskult project it assumes the spatial integration of wastewater treatment plants with food production in vertical farm with soilless systems 32 their vision is to combine urban wastewater treatment systems and efficient agricultural production systems in densely populated urban areas thus it can be predicted that the potential for condensate utilization will only increase therefore it is reasonable and appropriate to perform a review relating to the prediction models of volume of condensate stream parameters possible treatment methods and management with special focus on condensate stream gained from plants cultivation chambers this paper aims at compiling the data available in the literature regarding the quantitative and qualitative parameters of water recovered from liquefaction in conventional systems terrestrial hvac and in space closed loop systems the factors that may influence the parameters of the resulting condensate are analyzed as well as possible uses and technologies for management and treatment of this stream this approach will outline opportunities for the integrated design of hvac systems optimized for water production in addition to air treatment in terrestrial systems this paper deepens the look at the problem of hvac condensate recovery by including previously not considered places such as closed ecological systems where condensate is used for drinking water purposes 2 classification of condensate generating systems a general division prepared for the purpose of this study is presented in fig 1 water in the form of water vapor can be recovered from both ambient and indoor air systems generating condensate from the ambient air can be also divided into those in which the condensate is a by product usually in the vapor compression based air conditioning systems and those in which condensation is specially induced to collect the condensate the same chillers sorption systems thermoelectric modules etc the second source of obtaining water is the air exhausted generally the facilities where high humidity is required present the highest potential in particular greenhouses or plant factories in extract air heat recovery condensate is a by product in recuperative or evaporative exchangers this happens if the appropriate configuration is used often this water is not used and is directed to the sewage system nevertheless striving for a closed circuit it is worth referring to the facility such as the iss in which there is no possibility of draining the unwanted condensate to the sewage system on the contrary it is a source of water for cosmonauts 3 condensate characteristics 3 1 condensate recovery from ambient air there are systems where the primary purpose is to recover water from outdoor air e g cloud seeding or artificial rain dew water collection and fog water collection a detailed review on this topic was described by shafein et al 10 kandeal et al 33 raavesh et al 34 and wang et al 35 in this chapter the study focuses on condensate generated as a byproduct from the ambient air maintenance the collection of condensate depends on several factors however the air parameters such as temperature and humidity ratio hence the dew point temperature and the cold contact surface temperature are the main factors that determine the amount of condensate generated from hvac equipment 36 geographical location temperature and humidity ratio of the air as well as the type of building and its style of use are also important factors influencing the production of condensate for example the areas with a cold climate will have less condensate recovery potential from the ambient air than areas with a tropical and humid climate similarly a typical production building equipped with machinery and lighting and intensive human activity will burden air conditioning more than an empty building which will increase condensate production from the indoor air 37 as the amount of generated condensate is also related to the size of the air stream supplied to the air conditioning unit therefore it will be generated less in single family buildings than in large multi family or commercial buildings in humid climates more water can be recovered in laboratory and clinical buildings which require 100 outdoor air in each air exchange process while other buildings generally recirculate some of the conditioned air along with the outdoor air 38 39 some cities have decided to legally resolve the issue of condensate accumulation for example san antonio usa requires all new commercial buildings with a total cooling capacity of 10 refrigeration ton 35 kw or more to design drain lines that trap condensate from air conditioning systems and discharge this water to one location in the building 38 39 this encourages the reuse of condensate and its management in the most optimal way which in turn helps to alleviate the growing demand for limited water resources and the city s water infrastructure 39 the examples of the amount of generated condensate from commercial buildings in the city are 946 and 5184 l d from the mall and library respectively 38 39 a collective list of systems generating condensate from the ambient air with the division into commercial and residential buildings is presented in table 1 the authors siam et al and alipour et al show the need for changes on the legal level as well as social education so that the reuse of condensate becomes more popular 43 46 a detailed analysis of the next steps before implementing the condensate recirculation was presented by siam et al 46 theoretical models are one of the helpful tools in assessing the feasibility and profitability of a condensate capture and reuse installation however the theoretical model may differ significantly from actual measurements for example in lawernce et al 36 study condensate volume was predicted using a model that was based on the climate conditions of their location study and tonnage of the system the observed values of condensate were 30 higher than the predicted values the difference in estimation was mainly attributed to an error in measurement of the relative humidity and the supply air flow rate 36 chosen research is shown in table 2 3 2 condensate recovery from indoor air the condensation process can also be carried out with the use of indoor air from such places as greenhouses closed plant production chambers or halls space stations and other closed ecosystems extensive review on dehumidification process in greenhouses including condensate recovery was conducted by soussi et al 58 a collective list of systems generating condensate from the indoor air is presented in table 3 the case of the international space station is particularly interesting because the collection of condensate takes place in microgravity conditions 19 the maintenance of appropriate environmental parameters requires the removal of both the sensible heat and the water vapor generated inside space station to achieve this condensing a heat exchanger is installed onboard iss 18 the current system uses a two step process including condensation in a heat exchanger and further a two phase air water mixture separation in a rotary separator before the stream reaches a separator it is passed through the particle filter further condensate treatment includes catalytical oxidation multifiltration process with catalysts sorbents and ion exchange resins and ion exchange the purified water is mineralized with inorganic salts and preserved with ionic silver for potable purposes other non obvious places from which it is possible to gain knowledge about condensate recovery are closed ecosystems mainly used to simulate space missions on earth it is worth noting that the papers describing production of condensate by the systems intended to work ultimately in extraterrestrial conditions do not precisely describe the condensate generation technology it is essential since in those experiments it is assumed that it is necessary to create closed or closely closed loops of all consumables such water energy nutrients etc the water recovered from condensate is used for liquid fertilizer production but also for potable purposes thus it also shows necessary treatment chain to achieve good quality this also gives a perspective that can also be faced by humans in earthly conditions in the future there are some theoretical studies on condensate generation system from indoor air including greenhouses and closed plant factories a list of selected studies is presented in table 4 despite the small amount of theoretical research on this subject an increase in modeling the possibilities of water recovery in plant factories or vertical farms is expected to extend considering the growing popularity of these forms of intensive agriculture 69 70 more importantly numerical simulations and theoretical models will help design effective systems at such facilities however in order to create a precise mathematical model basics knowledge of mass and heat transfer is required but also plant physiology and processes taking place in them 4 condensate quality and management the quality of the condensate is a very important indicator due to the fact that the purpose of the condensate recovery is to use it for another use it can be as simple as make up water in cooling towers providing 15 to even 45 of the required make up water for a cooling tower for typical commercial buildings and specialist buildings such as laboratories 37 other common applications are the use of condensate for flushing toilets irrigation of green areas as process water 38 39 during analog and actual space missions condensate is used mainly for potable purposes and for fertilizer production 19 the air entering the ahu both ambient and indoor is one of the sources of contamination in the condensate preliminary air filtration allows for the removal of contaminants suspended in the air however particles not captured will pass further into the condensation water this is especially seen in closed facilities such as the international space station where it is reported that the dissolved organics ammonia ions and microorganisms are present in captured stream 63 condensate is cleaner in places where the human presence is combined with plants cultivation 63 this was the case of lunar palace 1 where transpiring water reduced the level of contamination but at the same time increased the amount of wastewater generated 270 4 kg d versus 2 27 kg d condensate produced per crewmember in iss more importantly goto 30 observed the crop variety also affects the composition of the condensate for example the condensate from the wheat growing chamber had higher concentrations of potassium calcium and zinc compared to the experiments where potatoes were grown in addition to metal contamination small amounts of bacteria were another questionable parameter the composition of the water recovered from plant transpiration in the future extraterrestrial colony will therefore depend on the size and type of cultivation plant species and the type of system used the second source of contamination is the surface on which condensate is generated e g cooling coils and the entire remaining condensate handling system e g transport lines collection tanks etc since condensate is usually slightly acidic and contains not completely dissolved solids 39 it tends to react with surfaces to form metal ions and other chemical contamination and thus requires further handling this was visible in the closed growth chamber with soilless cultivation where higher concentrations of copper cadmium and zinc were associated with the direct leaching of these elements from the condensation system in which copper condensation coils and cadmium and tin solder were used 30 a condensate storage tank is necessary in most cases due to the time buffer between collection and re use inside the tank and in pipeline biofilm may grow on the walls which might result in microorganisms development microbial contamination of condensate than would be dependent on thickness and composition of biofilm and also flow velocity thus when water is reused for human use a microbiological control is required to detect possible pathogenic microorganisms as it can be seen various factors may affect the quality of the condensate and its composition may vary depending on the type of air used ambient indoor summary of condensate quality gathered from ambient air and indoor air are shown in tables 5 and 6 respectively it can be seen that typically the ph of the outdoor air condensate is lower than the ph of the indoor air condensate according to alipour et al 43 lower ph of the condensate may be related to the presence of gases especially carbon dioxide in the air

reported 8 30 and 11 30 mg l the other cases had negligible sodium content a similar relationship was noted for sulfate only al farayedh 44 and mudget 16 study observed higher values 5 38 and 6 30 mg

and the outdoor or exhaust air parameters in many of the cases analyzed the amount of recovered condensate is sufficient to cover all or part of the water demand for plant watering cooling tower feed or toilet flushing there are cases in which the recovered amount of condensate exceeds the water demand of the building sanitary and urinal water paintner et al 49 therefore the validity of condensate recovery could be considered on a case by case basis already during the design of the building s internal systems condensate can be used both as part of water and energy savings when used for ventilation air pre cooling or as feed water for evaporative cooling equipment of the cases analyzed the largest amount of condensate per day 10 200 l was obtained by analyzing the recovery in a hotel building in abu dhabi magrini et al 55 57 in alabama at the university of birmingham an experiment was conducted in which 55 27 million l of condensate was recovered in 17 months it should be noted that the condensate flux is not constant over time and depends on among other things the parameters of the air from which the water is recovered condensate ph values vary in the range 5 0 7 76 higher values are observed in indoor experiments condensate ec vary in the range 30 220 4 μs cm the greater the salt content of the air due to e g close proximity to the beach or evaporation of salt rich fertilizers the greater the ec of the condensate cod appeared to be higher in condensate originated from ambient air 18 150 mg l than from indoor air 1 92 25 12 mg l the main macro nutrients n p k are present in rather small amounts 2 0 mg l exception is n nh4 in indoor experiments 3 61 88 mg l mg ca and cl content is similar for both sources indoor and ambient 0 02 0 933 mg l 0 054 1 26 mg l 0 10 1 70 mg l for mg ca and cl respectively except for the two cases where higher sodium concentrations were reported 8 30 and 11 30 mg l the other studies had negligible sodium content a similar relationship was noted for sulfate 5 38 and 6 30 mg l micronutrients presence is visible the highest values are observed for zn 1 86 mg l cu 0 96 mg l and ni 1 40 mg l each in indoor experiments other constituents that may appear in the condensate are acetate formate methanol other alcohols due to the increasing need for intensive agriculture such as vertical farms and plant factories future research directions should focus on the recovery of condensate from these sites and more on combining various growth parameters with water recovery energy balance and higher crop yields systems that use both condensate and rainwater appear to have great potential for future studies 7 recommendation for future research and perspectives the use of condensate recovery systems in the future may become a necessity there is a need to include the political bodies that establish the law in the discussion there is also a need for more education of the community responsible for urban planning and architecture as well as making the public aware of the positives of introducing such solutions it is also advisable to introduce probabilistic risk based assessment models to support decision making in water system risk management e g as in ref 79 combined with detailed cost analyses of recovery systems according to the authors the review performed demonstrates one of the future perspectives of the direction of research development which is condensate recovery in closed cultivation halls i e urban farming vertical farming aquaponic farms future theoretical and experimental research should

8732,sulfate radical aops sr aop were successfully utilized in degradation of antibiotics in water and wastewater treatment the review discusses details on sr aops mechanisms and applications for antibiotics degradation the progress in this field was discussed highlighting the most promising developments and remaining challenges the applicability of sr aops was summarized revealing the most susceptible and persistent to oxidation groups of pharmaceuticals highest effectiveness was reported for degradation of pharmaceuticals on ppb level systems revealed a scavenging effect in case of oxidant dose 0 7 mm of the ps and 2 mm of pms future development demands simple persulfates activation systems for real matrix treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes sulfate radicals hydroxyl radicals pharmaceuticals oxidation water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction antibiotics as compounds having antibacterial antiviral and antifungal activity are widely used in eradicating and preventing the growth of microorganisms in medicine and veterinary 1 they are entered the environment through a variety of sources such as the pharmaceutical industry hospital sewage and disposal of human and animal wastes 2 approximately 30 90 of antibiotics remain active and non metabolized and are disposed to the environment through urine and feces 3 4 the inability of conventional wastewater treatment processes to remove antibiotics and their discharge into the environment can result in adverse effects on the ecosystem and human there is strong evidence for the presence of antibiotics in aqueous solutions at the level of nano and micrograms per liter 5 6 which can lead to the development of antibiotic resistant pathogens that potentially threaten the ecosystem and human health 7 8 conventional wastewater treatment processes are known to be non effective for the removal or degradation of several organic chemicals especially pharmaceuticals these compounds due to their high toxicity in particular to the bacterial community can cease the biological process of wastewater treatment 9 10 various methods have been used to remove pharmaceutical compounds but the best method for removing these compounds is advanced oxidation processes aops which were first introduced by glaze in 1987 for water and wastewater treatment 11 aops are the most effective method for treatment of highly polluted industrial toxic hazardous resistant and non biodegradable organic pollutants in aqueous solutions which has gained an important place in water and wastewater treatment 12 13 today the best way to degrade more effectively the pollutants present in aquatic and soil environments is to apply the aops without the formation of hazardous and intermediate substances 14 16 aops fundamentally are the methods that produce strong oxidizing agents such as oh so4 cl and some oxidizers that allow direct electron transfer 17 18 the oxidation potential of some common oxidants is shown in table 1 19 the two types of radicals oh and so4 are strong oxidizing radicals with redox potentials e 2 8v and 2 5 3 1v respectively which can rapidly and non selectively oxidize and decompose most organic compounds in water and wastewater 20 21 today aops based on so4 have received high attention due to some unique features aops can be classified according to the type of produced radicals the aops based on the production of oh and so4 are called hr aop and sr aop respectively 22 23 aops are used to achieve the oxidation and decomposition of pollutants into neutral and low risk products 9 the advantages of aops are complete mineralization of organic matter the low production of residual materials and the ability to combine with biological systems 24 25 the aim of this review study is to evaluate the effect and mechanism of persulfate ps and peroxymonosulfate pms activated by different methods to remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions this study also investigated the impact of scavengers by products formation and assessment of toxicity of treated effluents 2 idea of persulfates application for aops 2 1 properties of persulfate persulfate ps s2o8 2 is a one of two most popular chemicals used in this field its properties were already well summarized in respect s aops 26 briefly it was compiled in supp info section s1 supporting information 2 1 1 activation methods 2 1 1 1 persulfate activated by uv several papers proved possibility of ps activation by uv table 2 explanation of mechanism and main achievements are summarized in supp info section s2 it is clear that excess of oxidant calculated as the molar ratio of oxidant to pollutant i e rox is needed reasonable performance well obtained for rox between 8 and 10 in other cases much higher rox as 40 or even 150 was used because in most of the studies the authors do not focus on the rox defining the concentration of oxidant as molar concentration and pollutant in mg l this relation is not directly visible although in some cases high effectiveness was obtained the 40 or 150 m excess of oxidant seems to be out of scope and real sense in relation to the possible implementation of such process in the real scenario ps has high molecular mass thus such molar excess means high mass dose of oxidant which is relatively expensive in the chloramphenicol degradation process the addition of cl 1 mm so4 2 0 5 mm and no3 10 mm increases the degradation efficiency low cl concentration has a positive effect on the degradation of chloramphenicol two scenarios are possible through uv irradiation first so4 is produced for reaction with no3 so that no3 is produced with significant oxidation power ered1 2 2 50v eq 1 second no3 becomes a source of nitrite and oxygen radicals eq 2 o could enhance cap oxidation upon reaction with water to generate ho eq 3 responsible for more cap degradation other studies proved that in the case of the presence of sulfate ions excess energy introduced into the liquid can cause the formation of so4 34 1 no3 so4 no3 so4 2 2 no3 uv no2 o 3 o h2o ho ho a break even point was determined for ps 0 25 ps 0 5 mm at a fluence of 330j for 1h reaction uv ps system was ph independent full cap degradation was reached in 1h upon increasing ps 2 5 mm along with the uv fluence 874j in the optimal condition 29 the main reason for the high degradation of oxytetracycline in the uv ps system is the presence of hco3 20 mm and cu2 1 mm due to the reaction of cu2 with ps the possibility of forming additional so4 increases according to eq 4 also the presence of hco3 due to the production of carbonate radicals has a positive role in the degradation of otc eq 5 4 cu2 s2o8 2 cu3 so4 2 so4 5 so4 hco3 so4 2 co3 h it was found that so4 was probably the predominant radical species for the degradation of otc by uv ps at ph 7 the kobs was the highest at near neutral conditions 31 the degradation of otc by uv ps method was shown in fig 1 2 1 1 2 persulfate activated by heat many studies verified the activation of ps by heat table 3 extra information about this method is summarized in supp info section s3 the reason for the high degradation efficiency for sulfamethazine smz is the presence of bicarbonate and chloride enhanced smz degradation since smz contains aniline moiety the enhancement in smz degradation rate was likely a result of hco3 co3 reaction which offsets the negative effect of so4 and or ho scavenging the enhancement in smz oxidation with increasing cl concentration was likely due to the contribution of reactions involving reactive chlorine species which compensated for the depletion of so4 and or ho due to cl scavenging in this study heat ps oxidation of smz in the aqueous solution was systematically investigated it was shown that increasing the temperature and ps dosage significantly enhanced the removal rate of smz smz could be degraded efficiently at the ph ranged from 7 0 to 9 0 but higher and lower ph showed inhibitory effects 40 fig 2 demonstrate the degradation of smz by heat activated ps see also fig 3 under the optimal condition tetracycline ttc degraded in 100 the cc double bond and phenolic moiety in ttc molecule are the reactive sites toward so4 attack potential reactive sites may include c2 c3 keto enol moiety c7 c9 and c11a c12 double bond increasing the temperature and solution ph favored the removal of ttc ttc was degraded faster in artificial surface water asw than that in milli q water suggesting that the natural water constituents may facilitate the degradation of tcs by sr aops approximately 70 ttc was degraded after 240min at 40 c whereas ttc was completely eliminated within 30min at 70 c higher temperature promoted the activation of ps and enhanced the formation rate of sr which favored the degradation of ttc furthermore the chemical reactions initiated by the radical attack were significantly elevated at higher temperatures according to thermodynamic law the degradation of ttc showed a ph dependence and kobs increased with increasing the ph since ttc has three pka this result suggests that the deprotonated non dissociated ttc was more reactive for sr attack the phenolate form of phenolicdiketone group and the unprotonated dimethylamine moiety were more reactive most likely due to the higher electron densities of these moieties which favored the electrophilic attack of sr 42 2 1 1 3 persulfate activated by transition metals various studies have used the transition metals method to activate the ps table 4 which is given in supp info section s4 application of magnetic particles makes their isolation from the reaction system after the process easier by means of the magnetic field in all cases studied the ph was acidic due to the needed form of metal cations activating ps in many cases the time needed to obtain satisfactory results was less than 1hr in almost a half of studies only 30min of treatment was needed to obtain quantitative degradation the cause of high degradation sulfamonomethoxine smm is fe3o4 mnps activate ps yield so4 species and then accelerate the decomposition of smm 43 the degradation efficiencies of the ag agcl various weight percentage of zero valent iron particles nzvi modified zeolite x catalysts ag agcl x fex for total tetracycline removal were high due to the enhanced adsorptive capacity of x fex the x denotes the weight percentage of nzvi the extended absorbance in the visible light region and improved space separation of photo induced charge carriers 45 2 1 1 4 persulfate activated by ultrasound irradiation some researchers are proved the ability of us for activation of ps table 5 the additional information is summarized in supp info section s5 the reason for the high efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride degradation in us ps method was to increase the intensity of ultrasound by 500w it is clear that the increase of ultrasound intensity to a specific high level promoted the decomposition of s2o8 2 and generation of reactive species and consequently increased the rate of tetracycline hydrochloride degradation in addition the increase of the power intensity leads to a significant increase of the number of cavitation bubbles the degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride under optimal condition was 88 51 55 2 1 1 5 persulfate activated by carbon materials another method of ps activation is based on application of carbon based materials activated carbon ac biochar bc carbon nanotubes cnt and graphene as carbon based materials are widely used as adsorbents and catalysts high specific surface area high pore volume and affordability are their main advantages 56 58 2 1 1 5 1 activated carbon one of the most widely used non metallic catalysts for the activation of persulfate is activated carbon ac among its advantages can be mentioned the developed porous structure large specific surface area abundant functional groups and cost effectiveness surface functional groups delocalized π electrons sp2 hybrid carbon at defect edges and oxygen containing functional groups cooh c oh c o are among the active sites of ac for persulfate activation 59 60 these sites react with persulfate and produce hydroxyl and sulfate radicals in order to remove pollutants 61 there are different types of activated carbon including powdered activated carbon pac granular activated carbon gac and activated carbon fiber acf in addition to the mentioned advantages the main problem of activated carbon is the poor mass transfer of pollutant molecules due to the size of micropores which limits the rate of degradation because catalytic reactions occur only on the surface of the carbon or the adjacent boundary layers thus causing weak ac performance but this problem can be solved by changing the porous structure to mesoporous or hierarchical pores by soft hard mold method 62 the mechanisms of pollutant degradation by persulfate activated with carbon can be summarized in three aspects adsorption free radical pathway and nonradical pathway the non radical path can be divided into singlet oxygen electron transfer and direct oxidation these persulfate activation mechanisms can occur simultaneously in one reaction 63 64 various factors such as surface functional groups surface electrochemical impedance graphitization degree and porous structure which are related to the raw materials preparation strategies and modification methods can affect the activation of persulfate by carbon materials 65 66 according to eqs 6 8 persulfate produces sulfate and hydroxyl radicals through the interaction with the surface of activated carbon ac through the electron transfer mechanism and finally these generated radicals decompose organic pollutants into inorganic compounds and organic intermediates 67 6 s2o8 2 ac so4 ho ac 7 s2o8 2 ac ho so4 2 ac 8 ho so4 contaminates co2 h2o so4 2 reaction intermediates table 6 shows some research on the activation of persulfate by activated carbon in order to remove antibiotics generally application of ac allows effective activation of persulfates providing close to 90 degradation effectiveness of studied antibiotics however at least 100 time molar excess of oxidant in respect to pollutant rox is needed to obtain such results which seems to be a high value especially in respect to costs of treatment process future studies should focus on ps ac systems in real case scenario i e to treat real effluents instead of studies performed in idead deionized water environment 2 1 1 5 2 biochar biochar bc is produced from biomass waste by pyrolysis process no oxygen or limited oxygen and temperature 800 300 c 61 71 common types of biochars can be mention to the wood based biochar 72 algae based biochar 65 sludge based biochar 73 straw based biochar 74 and shell based biochar 75 since biochar is produced by pyrolysis of biomass waste without adding any chemical or physical activating agents koh h3po4 zncl2 co2 and steam it has a lower specific surface area 500 m2 g than ac 61 but due to its low cost and having many functional groups it is used as a catalyst for persulfate activation oxygen functional groups and stable free radicals on bc surface activate persulfate 76 wang et al proposed a possible activation mechanism of persulfate by bc they found that the activation of persulfate depends on the formed defective structures and stable free radicals in bc including semiquinones and phenoxyls and also the activation of persulfate can be enhanced due to the high degree of graphitization and aromatic conjugated π electrons in bc 77 according to data compiled in table 7 application of biochar allows to obtain above 90 degradation of studied antibiotics typically reported rox still mostly exceeded value of 100 however in one study 34 a 100 degradation of tetracycline was possible by ps activated with biochar at rox of 11 this approach seems to be reasonable in respect to application in real case scenario 2 1 1 5 3 carbon nanotubes good conductivity high mobility of electrons on the surface and low mass transfer resistance have caused the high reactive activity of carbon nanotubes cnt 82 different dimensions and surface chemistry of cnt are responsible for different catalytic performance compared to other carbon materials the catalytic reaction of cnt is related to the defect level and electronic state which can be changed by increasing wall layers and doping heteroatoms 59 83 cnt can be divided into two groups single walled cnt swcnt and multi walled cnt mwcnt the surface of mwcnt is much more active than swcnt due to the presence of a large number of surface functional groups such as cooh c o and oh some researchers showed that by doping nitrogen to cnt enclosed with fe3c it can be used to activate persulfate through hydroxylation oxidation ring opening bond cleavage and sulfonation in order to degrade sulfamethoxazole and as a result they found that the catalytic performance of persulfate by cnt doped with nitrogen increases due to higher absorption and faster charge transfer 84 shang et al shown that a 100 degradation of sulfamethoxazole was obtained with ps nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes with encapsulated fe3c nanoparticles during this process the fe3c encapsulated ncnts were beneficial both for the electron transfer and to avoid the fe3c from dissolving in the solution epr spectra revealed that the so4 ho and 1o2 contributed to the degradation of sulfamethoxazole 84 also few other studies table 8 confirmed the activation of ps by carbon nanotubes in this case rox between 50 and 70 revealed to be effective for 100 antibiotics removal 2 1 1 5 4 graphene graphene is a thin carbon sheet with a six membered carbon ring as the core structure and various types of edge defects graphene has various functional groups including hydroxyl oh carboxyl cooh carbonyl c o and epoxy groups c o c 88 graphene can be divided into reduced graphene oxide rgo graphene oxide go and pristine graphene based on the degree of surface oxidation go rgo have an acidic surface and as a result they need a basic surface to activate persulfate modified graphene is a suitable option for persulfate activation due to its higher specific surface area for adsorption and catalysis compared to cnt and bc as well as good electrical conductivity and electron mobility for the redox reaction of sp2 electrons 89 also removing oxygen containing groups on rgo surface by thermal method can improve the integrity of the π conjugated structure and surface hydrophobicity 90 nucleophilic ketone and quinoid functional groups can act as active sites for redox reactions and persulfate activation due to having many electrons 91 but the most important disadvantages of using graphene for persulfate activation relates to being expensive compared to other carbon materials and using dangerous oxidizing materials h2so4 hno3 and kmno4 in the classical hummers synthesis method for go 61 peng et al applied n rgo fe3o4 to activate ps in order to degrade norfloxacin incorporation of n rgo with fe3o4 nanoparticles improved the catalytic efficiency in 210 min it caused complete removal of norfloxacin also based on the esr spectrum it was determined that both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are produced during the activation some researches proved the possibility of ps activation by carbon nanotube and graphene for degradation of antibiotics table 8 in summary it can be concluded that carbon based catalysts are effective activators of persulfates for antibiotics activation it is possible to obtain a 100 degradation of antibiotics using relatively low amounts of catalyst 0 1 0 5 gl 1 however in some studies load above 1gl 1 also was reported as optimal which seems to be not reasonable amount for real large scale applications in few studies it was proved that effective degradation can be obtained with minimized consumption of oxidant resulting in rox values of 10 20 unfortunately in many studies much higher load of oxidant rox exceeding 100 was reported such a high values of oxidant dose could be typical for direct oxidation but cannot be named as acceptable for advanced catalytic systems thus in future studies a milestone optimal parameter should be oriented on the best reported values 2 2 properties of peroxymonosulfate peroxymonosulfate hso5 also known as pms and oxone is another popular oxidant that used for degradation of pollutants 26 briefly it was compiled in supp info section s6 2 2 1 activation methods 2 2 1 1 peroxymonosolfate activated by uv many literatures are explained the use of uv for activation of pms table 9 more information is given in supp info section s7 the performance of uv pms and uv pms used for degradation sulfamethazine was compared uv pms provided more thorough degradation of sulfamethazine as demonstrated by the complete degradation of 0 2μgl 1 of sulfamethazine within 5min at an initial pms 1mgl 1 ph 7 5 uv 254 nm rox 1 4 uv promoted sulfamethazine degradation by pms resulting in a higher effectiveness of the combined process comparing to the sole use of uv photolysis or pms pms decomposes with uv by cleavage of its peroxide bond which produces so4 and ho 92 the pyrimidine ring structure of sulfamethazine is resistant to oxidation by so4 thus their rapid degradation is attributed to oxidation of the aniline moiety and cleavage of the sulfonamide bond by so4 or ho a study on degradation of ciprofloxacin demonstrated the effectiveness of s aops for treatment of domestic wastewater containing this pharmaceutical by comparing three uv 254nm based aops uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 in distilled water the order of degradation efficiency was uv ps uv pms uv h2o2 while in wastewater the most efficient process was uv pms uv ps uv h2o2 mainly because pms decomposition into sulfate radical anion was activated by bicarbonate ions uv pms has demonstrated better kinetic performances over uv h2o2 system for cip removal wastewater treatment plant effluents mainly because bicarbonate ions are able to activate pms decomposition into sra and due to the higher selectivity in reactivity of sra with respect to hr in organic rich matrices cip was completely degraded in wastewater at the optimized parameters the disadvantage of pms applied as oxone is the triple salt form which results in high mass dose of oxone needed to obtain desired rox the price of chemical is related to its mass not moles thus pms processes with comparable rox to ps will be much more expensive sulfate radical anion attacks prompted transformations at the piperazinyl ring through the one electron oxidation mechanism as a major pathway while oh attacks were mainly responsible for quinolone moiety transformations as a minor pathway sulfate radical anion generation has made uv pms a kinetically effective process in degradation cip from wastewater 94 2 2 1 2 peroxymonosolfate activated by graphene oxide transition metals nanoscale magnetic and α mno2 multiple studies have been confirming the activation of pms by transition metals nanoscale magnetic and α mno2 and graphene oxide the information about these methods exists in supp info section s8 babayi et al shown the performance of graphene based cofe2o4 in the activation of pms and amoxicillin removal from aqueous solutions in optimum condition the amoxicillin cod and toc removal efficiency was 99 27 83 1 and 61 11 respectively showing that despite high degradation efficiency of the amoxicillin it was not fully mineralized 96 almost 40 of the remaining toc indicates the by products of degradation were not effectively degraded in such cases an evaluation of by products toxicity is a must to fully present the advantages of the developed process many by products of pharmaceuticals degradation can be much more toxic comparing to primary form thus there is a risk that biotoxicity of the treated effluent could significantly increase they used ph 3 9 and concluded that aops based on co pms have better performance in neutral and alkaline ph the best process efficiency was achieved in the removal of amoxicillin in ph 6 however the optimal performance of the system in ph 4 to 7 does not differ much from each other but in ph 4 and ph 7 the efficiency of the system significantly decreases the reason for this decrease in acidic ph is the lack of effective activation of pms according to eq 9 9 co2 hooso3 coso5 h the reason for the decrease in efficiency in alkaline ph 7 is the reaction of free so4 with hydroxyl ions and the production of sulfate ions and free oh this free oh is rapidly converted to free radical hydrogen which is much weaker than so4 another important parameter in g cofe2o4 pms process is the catalyst concentration which plays a significant role in the removal of amoxicillin in this experiment the optimum concentration of catalyst was obtained 0 5gl 1 the removal efficiency of amoxicillin increases to a concentration of 0 5gl 1 from the catalyst but there was no significant difference from 0 5 to 1 25gl 1 as the dose of catalyst increases the efficiency of removal increases which is due to the increase in active sites available for pms decomposition and the production of more free so4 96 in this study the rox 150 which means the authors do not focus on the rox defining the concentration of oxidant as molar concentration and pollutant in mgl 1 this relation is not directly visible the antibiotic removal with transition metals pms was shown in table 10 feng et al used α fe2o3 as the activator of pms for degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx the weight ratio between cu2o and α fe2o3 influenced the degradation of smx and the optimal ratio depended on the dosage of pms and catalyst with 40mgl 1 pms and 0 6gl 1 catalyst a pseudo first order constant of 0 019min 1 was achieved for ct2 5 cu2o whereas only 0 004min 1 was realized for α fe2o3 nearly complete degradation of the sulfamethoxazole was achieved within 180min under the conditions of 40mgl 1 pms 0 4gl 1 ct2 5 cu2o and ph 6 8 the ct2 5 cu2o had efficient reactivity for smx degradation and the highest stoichiometric efficiency value after a reaction time of 60min the reactivity of the ct2 5 cu2o was highly dependent on its contact time with the pms 97 deng et al by survey of some conditions such as catalyst 0 02 0 4gl 1 ph 3 11 and pms 0 2 4 mm for decomposition of chloramphenicol by pms activated with co3o4 are concluded that by optimum conditions ph 7 catalyst dosage 0 1gl 1 and pms 1 mm chloramphenicol degraded completely the superior catalytic performance of co3o4 kit6 was ascribed to the combination of multiple unique characteristics including the large specific surface area high pore volume high co2 content and high density of surface active sites higher catalyst dosage higher pms concentration neutral ph and higher reaction temperature favored the removal the balance among co2 co3 o2 o2 and pms decomposed in solution ensured the continuous generation of oh and so4 and the latter made the predominant contribution for the cap degradation considering its outstanding catalytic activity excellent reusability and long term stability mesoporous co3o4 are other advantages of that 98 zhang et al used cubi2o4 mno2 pms to degrade ceftiofur cef the authors concluded that by the optimization of selected parameters such as mass ratio of cubi2o4 to mno2 1 5 cef 5mgl 1 pms 0 4gl 1 and ph 11 it was possible to obtain a cef degradation reaching 93 6 the degradation of cef was tested in the ph range of 3 11 it could be noticed that the degradation efficiency of cef increased from 83 3 to 93 6 with the ph increasing from 3 to 11 the increase of solution ph helped the formation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of cubi2o4 mno2 composite which could be served as the active site for the electron transfer to improve the activation of pms also by increasing pms concentration from 0 to 0 5gl 1 the degradation rate was increased the higher pms concentrations could lead to higher catalytic performance corresponding the kapp of cef removal was increased from 0 00772min 1 to 0 05624min 1 as the concentration of pms increased from 0 to 0 5gl 1 indicating the accelerated reaction rates probably it follows from the fact that more so4 would be produced with the increase of pms concentration resulting in the enhancement of cef degradation efficiency however when the pms concentration was continuously increased from 0 4gl 1 to 0 5gl 1 a limited increase was clearly observed which might be due to the reaction between excess pms and active species a self scavenging effect thus inhibited degradation of the cef 102 deng et al revealed under optimal parameters the degradation of ciprofloxacin was obtained 93 6 nanoscale α mno2 with different morphologies nanoparticles nanoflowers and nanorods were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and tested in pms activation for cip degradation the catalytic activity of α mno2 mainly relied on the specific surface area and crystallinity and followed the order of α mno2 nanoflowers α mno2 nanorods α mno2 nanoparticles commercial mno2 the removal efficiency decreased from 93 68 to 83 81 as solution ph increased from 3 to 7 suggesting that acidic conditions were more favorable to the degradation than neutral condition without mno2 catalysts only16 99 cip was removed by pms alone indicating that pms was not effective as an oxidant to directly degrade this pollutant in the absence of pms mno2 caused a slight reduction of cip less than 7 which was primarily attributed to the adsorption of cip on the catalyst surface among the four mno2 samples α mno2 nanoflowers presented the highest efficiency in cip adsorption which resulted from its highest bet surface area when pms and mno2 were simultaneously introduced into the solution the cip removal was evidently enhanced because of the involvement of so4 and ho which originated from the decomposition of pms caused by the electron exchange between mn3 and mn4 in mno2 the removal efficiencies of cip with α mno2 nanoflowers nanorods nanoparticles and commercial mno2 as pms initiators were 93 68 71 33 61 97 and 22 94 respectively 103 2 2 1 3 peroxymonosolfate activated by heat using heat to activate pms is also used to degrade pollutants in water and wastewater elevated temperatures are needed to activate pms and on the other hand its not high efficiency makes this activation method not practical for large scales the exemption are process effluents that due to previous stages of operation initially could have temperatures exceeding 40 c on the other hand comparing to other activation methods the use of heat allows to shorten the required reaction time and activation energy 104 in the heat activated ps oxidation process only so4 radicals are formed while from the activation of pms with heat both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are produced eq 10 the activation mechanism of pms with heat is to cleave the o o bond and produce sulfate radicals compared to the thermal activation of ps fewer studies were conducted on the thermal activation of pms yang et al showed that heat activation is effective for ps while not for pms 105 therefore more studies should be done on the mechanism of pms activation by heat so far this method rarely has been used to activate pms for the degradation of antibiotics and studies in this field are scarce 35 10 hso 5 heat oh so4 only a few studies have been conducted to remove antibiotics using heat activated peroxymonosulfate ulucan altuntas et al used pms activated by heat for degradation of oxytetracycline in this method they shown that optimal conditions are obtained at temperature of 75 c allowing to obtain 84 degradation in 20 min of treatment 35 in another study milh et al revealed that pms heat process under optimum conditions at 70 c allowed to obtain 94 degradation of sulfamethoxazole in 60 min 106 2 2 1 4 peroxymonosulfate and persulfate activated by gamma radiation the use of gamma radiation in wastewater and water treatment to remove toxic pollutants is a relatively new technology with gamma radiation hydroxyl radicals hydrated electrons and hydrogen radicals are produced 107 these active species through the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals and the reduction of hydrated electrons can cause the decomposition of pollutants and also cause the activation of ps and pms in addition due to the high energy of the gamma ray it can activate ps and pms by cleavage of o o bond although gamma rays have a high penetration comparing to uv the cost of making gamma ray equipment is much higher than uv equipment for this reason applications of this method are not common 35 108 according to eqs 1 11 13 kgy irradiated dose of radiation produces 10 5 mol eaq and h which can theoretically convert 10 5 mol sulfate to so4 109 11 s2o8 2 γ ray so4 12 s2o8 2 eaq so4 so4 2 k 1 1 1010 m 1s 1 13 s2o8 2 h so4 so4 2 h k 2 5 107 m 1s 1 when the eaq are produced from gamma radiation they react with pms and can produce oh and so4 eqs 14 and 15 35 14 hso 5 eaq oh so4 2 k 8 4 109 m 1s 1 15 hso 5 eaq so4 oh k 8 4 109 m 1s 1 some papers investigated the possibility of activation of ps and pms by gamma radiation for the degradation of antibiotics table 11 importantly in all studies a rox values below 100 were reported it follows from high effectiveness of this method of activation however with high energy costs a variety of reported effectiveness also in respect to same pollutant see carbamazepine confirms that this type of activation demands standardization of experimental conditions and validation of performance to allow real comparison of results according to already published data this method has high potential for future studies 3 effect of operation parameters for antibiotics degradation 3 1 effect of ph the ph is one of the most important and influential parameters on the amount and type of radicals formed under aops and as well as the efficacy of antibiotics in most chemical and electrochemical processes ph of solution is one of the most important factors in the management and process efficiency this factor can affect process efficiency by affecting the pollutant properties and used methods therefore the main factor in determining the dominant radical in the process is completely influenced by the ph of solution 33 ps in different phs of the solution is stable while pms can be affected by different ph pms is stable in ph 6 or ph 12 when ph 9 it showed the poorest stability where half of hso5 decomposes to so5 2 112 under alkaline conditions ps can be decomposed to so4 sulfate radicals can further transform into oh thus so4 play a major role in degrading the organic compounds under alkaline conditions while so4 are the primary reactive species at acid conditions under neutral conditions both oh and so4 contributed to the degradation of organic pollutants 113 as mentioned above ps presented stability in the solution at different ph while the existing form of pms was significantly influenced by the solution of ph alkaline conditions can activate both ps and pms in ph 5 hydrogen ion acts as the scavenger of so4 and oh j 114 in general ps and pms have a wide ph range of application although their oxidation potential changes with the ph the appropriate ph should be adjusted based on ps and pms activation methods 115 3 1 1 effect of ph on activation method by uv the best ph for activating ps and pms to produce so4 is in the range of 5 and 7 in both uv ps and uv pms systems at ph 7 especially 3 to 5 the superiority is with so4 generation according to eq 16 when the ph is between 7 and 9 so4 and oh are present in the system and in alkaline conditions especially ph 12 so4 react with hydroxyl ions and generate oh eq 17 therefore the presence of so4 will be superior and in alkaline conditions the potential of oh oxidation will be greatly reduced 116 also at higher phs so4 and oh react with each other according to eq 18 which the process efficiency is significantly reduced so that the oxidation system becomes vacant of radicals 117 16 so4 h2o oh h so4 2 17 so4 oh oh so4 2 18 so4 oh h so4 2 1 2o2 in the process of activating ps and pms with uv some studies reported data also confirming this statement similarly to these studies it was shown that the highest degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine 28 ciprofloxacin 118 chloramphenicol 29 sulfamethoxazole 93 119 oxytetracycline 31 penicillin g 20 ofloxacin 33 and cefexime 120 were obtained at ph 5 8 7 with ps uvc however some studies present in the literature are in contrast with this theory in these cases the highest degradation efficiency was obtained for ph 7 for example the highest degradation efficiency of sulfamethoxazole 93 metronidazole 32 sulfamerazine sulfamethizole sulfachloropyridazine 92 and tetracycline 95 were obtained at ph between 7 5 and 11 they have a different result in comparison with previous studies from these studies it appears that each system based on uv ps has different performance at different phs and it has been proved that the characteristics of the pollutant and its decomposition mechanism are probably responsible for this difference 115 3 1 2 effect of ph on activation method by heat in this method the optimal ph is between 5 and 7 because at ph 7 the activation is focused on formation of so4 it should be noted that at certain temperatures ph also affects the conversion of so4 to oh it has been reported that so4 at ph 7 so4 and oh at ph 9 and oh at ph 12 predominate 115 the type and rate of the produced radicals are among the important effects of ph changes on aops at neutral ph the so4 radicals are dominant at ph 9 both so4 and oh radicals are presented and in ph 12 the oh radical is dominant when ps is used as an oxidizer according to eq 9 in addition to so4 oh radical is also generated so the degradation efficiency of antibiotics is reduced at high ph eq 19 due to the reaction of so4 radical by oh that conduces to higher consumption of so4 and subsequently degradation efficiency in addition reactions in eqs 20 and 21 also occur in the presence of oh at ph 9 and 11 respectively the reaction of oh with oh can conduce to a quick loss of oh in an alkaline solution in alkaline conditions the redox potential of oh decreases about 2 0v and leading to the drop in the oxidation potential of oh so the degradation efficiency in alkaline conditions would be less than that in acidic and neutral conditions 121 19 so4 oh so4 2 oh 20 oh s2o8 2 oh s2o8 21 oh oh h2o2 similar to these studies the highest degradation efficiency of fluconazole 38 enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin 39 penicillin g 37 chloramphenicol 36 sulfamethazin 40 tetracycline 42 and triclosan 41 was obtained in ph 3 to 7 8 respectively 3 1 3 effect of ph on activation method by ultrasound naseeri et al surveyed the effect of ph on degradation of tetracycline by using peroxydisulfate activated by ultrasound irradiation the tetracycline degradation efficiencies in ph 4 7 and 10 on batch mode by using an ultrasonic bath with ultrasound power 500w 35 khz were obtained 77 35 62 46 and 88 51 respectively the pka values of tetracycline are 3 3 7 7 and 9 7 in addition it is an amphoteric molecule so the molecules of tetracycline had a positive charge and they are neutral at ph 4 on the other hand at ph 9 they had negative charge tetracycline molecules with negative charge cause reactive species like oh due to high electrical density on the ring system that accelerated degradation of tetracycline 52 yin et al used ultrasound irradiation for activation of pms in different ranges of ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 to degrade sulfamethazine the studies revealed that at ph 5 7 9 and 11 a 99 degradation was obtained while at ph 3 the removal efficiency was decreased to 90 at ph lower than 5 h act as a scavenger for hydroxyl and so4 which explains the reported decrease in degradation efficiency on the other hand in basic ph the presence of oh can activate pms and subsequently the removal efficiency has increased 55 3 1 4 effect of ph on activation method by transition metals the effect of ph on s aops based on transition metals activation of ps was studied in several papers the authors proved the importance of ph optimization cobalt oxide is known as an effective activator in s aops at high ph cobalt oxides convert to cobalt hydroxide complexes which reduces its catalytic activity in addition ph also effects the surface charge of metal oxide which effectively affects the activation function of metal oxides y 122 y 123 in the process of ps activation with iron ph has a direct effect on the type and state of iron required by the ps and it is also effective in determining the dominant type of formed radicals 117 at ph 4 fe2 ions are converted to fe3 which has low ability to activate ps and generate so4 with increasing ph the fe3 ions are converted to ferric hydroxide which results in absence of cations as well as increases the production of sludge also with increasing ph iron precipitates as colloidal feoh according to eq 22 124 that is unable to participate in the activation of ps 22 fe2 h2o feoh h by increasing ph 9 species of oxyhydroxylperic acid fe oh 3 fe oh 4 feoh3 and fe2 oh 3 4 are produced this type of iron species has very low ability to activate ps 125 also by changing the ph to alkaline the product of ps activation with fe2 which is so4 can change and lead the reaction to the production of oh 116 the reason for this decrease was that at high ph so4 and oh react with each other in which case the efficiency of the process decreases so that the oxidation system becomes vacant of radicals according to eq 23 49 23 so4 oh h so4 2 1 2o2 feng et al showed that at the optimized ph 6 8 a total degradation of sulfamethoxazole was obtained 100 by using cu2o for activated pms while by activated pms by α fe2o3 under similar conditions the removal efficiency was obtained less than 20 97 deng et al also showed that the highest 100 degradation efficacy in respect to chloramphenicol degradation was obtained at neutral ph 98 in another study feng et al used cufeo2 rhombohedral crystal catalyzed pms for degradation of sulfadiazine and showed the sulfadiazine degradation efficiency was obtained about 100 at ph 8 5 on the other hand by reducing the ph to 4 and 5 acidic conditions the degradation efficiency was decreased when ph is in the range of 4 8 5 due to pka values of pms pka1 0 and pka2 9 4 therefore pms is present as hso 5 the inhibitory effect of h could be described by the effect of stabilizing h on hso5 99 additional information about ph effects on persulfates can be found in supp info section s9 3 2 effect of antibiotic concentration the initial concentration of antibiotics also has a significant impact on the performance of aops with ps and pms 17 in all the studies with increasing the concentration of antibiotics the decomposition efficiency decreases because with increasing antibiotic concentration the proportion of oh to pollutant decreases in addition the tendency of intermediate compounds for consume of oh increases too 126 also due to the short life of the produced free radicals such as so4 and oh which are about 4 s and 20 ns respectively they may react with the intermediate compounds immediately after production and before reacting with the contaminant for this reason lower concentrations of antibiotics lead to fewer intermediates hence the removal rate increases while the decomposition efficiency decreases with increasing antibiotic concentration where more intermediates are formed 127 128 3 3 effect of persulfate and peroxymonosolfate concentration in all activation methods by increasing the concentration of ps and pms the production of so4 increases and leads to an increase in removal efficiency however as the concentration increases further the removal efficiency is constant and sometimes decreases this reduction in efficiency is due to the high concentration of oxidants in the environment which acts as a radical scavenger and reduces so4 and oh in the environment according to eqs 24 and 25 high concentration of ps acts as a radical scavenger of so4 and also the excessive concentration of so4 can lead to so4 consumption 129 130 24 so4 s2o8 2 so2 2 s2o8 25 so4 so4 s2o8 2 in the process of ps and pms activation by uv heat ultrasounds and transition metals some studies reported data also confirming the scavenging effect of higher concentrations of oxidants similarly to these studies it was showed that by increasing the concentration of ps and pms to some extent the removal efficiency of tetracycline 52 sulfamethazine 92 ampicillin 8 penicillin g 37 cefixime 120 chloramphenicol 36 and metronidazole 32 were increased and with increasing oxidant to excessive concentration due to the production of radical scavengers the removal efficiency decreases naseri et al degraded tetracycline by using us pms and concluded that by increasing the concentration of s2o8 2 from 1 mm to 4 mm under the optimal conditions alkaline ph and 120min the degradation efficiency of tetracycline increased from 55 76 to 88 51 due to the production of more so4 but with increasing the concentration more than 4 mm the removal efficiency did not increase significantly in this study concentrations higher than 6 mm were not investigated to determine however by increasing s2o8 2 too much the possibility of sulfate anions being formed without the production of so4 increases 52 fan et al survey the effect of heat ps for degradation of sulfamethazine in this study with increasing the concentration of ps kobs of sulfamethazine increased significantly and also the half life of sulfamethazine decreased with increasing the concentration of ps from 0 25 mm to 0 4 mm from 258 to 27min respectively so with increasing ps concentration the removal efficiency increases in this study the effect of more than 4 mm of oxidant and also its excessive effect as a radical scavenger were not investigated also the effect of excessive oxidant concentration which acts as a radical scavenger has not been investigated 40 frontistis et al investigated the degradation of antibiotic ampicillin on boron doped diamond anode using the combined electrochemical oxidation sodium ps process and observed that by increasing the concentration of ps from 100mgl 1 to 500mgl 1 the ampicillin removal efficiency increased according eqs 26 28 so4 on the cathode can be electrogenerated while anodic oxidation of sulfate ions produces ps ps can also react with oh at the anode surface to produce excess so4 131 26 s2o8 2 e so4 so4 2 27 2so4 2 s2o8 2 2e 28 s2o8 2 oh hso4 so4 0 5o2 previously some researchers suggested a non radical pathway to increase the efficiency of combining bdd with ps according to this method the non radical electro activation of ps is similar to carbon catalysts activating ps ps should be used with caution as it may increase treatment costs and sulfate anions at concentrations above 250mgl 1 are considered as contaminants according to the who 132 since the removal efficiency at concentrations of 250mgl 1 and 500mgl 1 was not much different for the reason mentioned above the optimal concentration was determined to be 250mgl 1 in this study the effect of scavengers was not investigated 8 norzaee et al used heat ps for degradation of penicillin g concluding that increasing the ps concentration from 0 05 mm to 0 1 mm increased the removal efficiency of penicillin g to 97 25 in 75min on the other hand when the concentration was further increased above 0 1 mm the removal efficiency was significantly decreased ps acted as a scavenger of so4 and also it was found that excessive increase of so4 may lead to termination of other sulfate radicals molecules therefore excessive presence of ps leads to a decrease in the removal efficiency of penicillin g 121 khazaei et al used the uv pms method to remove cefixime in this approach with increasing the concentration of pms the removal efficiency of the antibiotic increased but with its increase to more than 1 37 mm the removal efficiency decreased 3 4 effect of scavengers there are many ions present in real conditions in aqueous media that can have different effects on so4 and oh resulting from the activation of ps and pms chloride ion is a major ion in water sources experimental findings show that the presence of chloride ion can decrease or sometimes increase the removal efficiency of some contaminants chloride ions react with so4 to produce chloride radicals which reduce so4 in addition other secondary radicals such as dichloride radicals can be generated due to the reaction of the chloride radical with the chloride ion according to eqs 29 31 133 29 cl so4 so4 2 cl 30 cl cl cl2 31 cl oh cl oh carbonate bicarbonate sulfate nitrate and nitrite ions have a negative effect on so4 and oh because these ions can suppress so4 and oh among these anions the sulfate ion can not only suppress radicals but can also chelate metal oxide phosphate has a stronger inhibition effect on the removal of organic pollutants by so4 and oh comparing to other anions 134 interestingly chloride bicarbonate carbonate and hydrogen phosphate can effectively activate pms but not ps in addition the activation performance increases with increasing concentration of chloride bicarbonate and hydrogen phosphate and decreases with increasing concentration of carbonate natural organic matter has been shown to have a negative effect on the removal of organic pollutants by ps and pms activated methods it has also been shown that the negative effect has a link with ph of the solution 135 in the case of heterogeneous catalytic systems at low ph the natural organic matter scavenged the positive holes on the surface of the catalyst while at the high ph the natural organic compounds mainly scavenged the radicals some components of natural organic matter such as hydroquinones quinones and phenols can effectively activate pms in general the negative impact of wastewater compounds caused by ubiquitous anions is mainly due to the action of inhibiting anions to radicals the positive effects of chloride bicarbonate carbonate and hydrogen phosphate are mainly due to the formation of chlorine and carbonate radicals 136 in the case of chlorine the positive effect can be explained by two reasons one is that chlorine radicals are formed because the reaction between chlorine and so4 and oh can react with pollutants the second reason is that chlorine radicals react mainly with water to form so4 and oh which can further reduce pollutants 137 for carbonate a positive effect occurs only when the carbonate concentration is much higher comparing to the concentration of ps or pms in this case so4 and oh can be completely converted to carbonate radicals which can further degrade some organic pollutants it should be noted that chloride and nitrate radicals lead to the production of chlorinated by products and nitrated by products which could pose a potential risk to the environment and human health 115 norzaee et al used the heat ps method for removing penicillin g and investigated the effect of chloride and carbonate as radical scavengers the degradation efficiency of penicillin g in the presence of radical scavengers was reduced according to the results at 75min contact time with the addition of chloride and carbonate anions the removal efficiency decreased from 98 to 73 40 and 60 74 respectively 37 possible reactions that occur in the presence of radical mineral scavengers are shown in eq 32 33 138 32 co3 2 so4 co3 so4 2 33 co3 2 oh co3 oh according to eqs 29 31 chloride ions can form various radicals by reacting with reactive species according to eq 29 low concentrations of chloride may cause reduce the recombination frequency of so4 to sulfate ions because cl can consume activated so4 and thus increase the concentration of so4 2 in solution 139 however at very high concentrations of chloride so4 turn into chlorine less reactive species such as cl2 and this condition reduces the decomposition efficiency carbonate anion can inactivate so4 and oh carbonate anion can act as a scavenger of so4 and oh and produce carbonate radicals co3 according to eqs 32 and 33 so pre treatment of wastewater can be effective in removing or reducing radical scavengers 40 nasseri et al studied the effect of humic acid on the decomposition process of tetracycline and concluded that humic acid at low concentrations 5mgl 1 increases the rate of tetracycline degradation while increasing the concentration of humic acid to 10 20mgl 1 has a negative effect on the decomposition of tetracycline addition of 10 20 mgl 1 of humic acids reduced the degradation efficiency of tetracycline from 88 51 to 78 92 and 64 65 respectively 52 these results indicate that humic acid consumes so4 and oh faster than tetracycline humic acids act as a oh at low concentrations but act as a strong radical scavenger at high concentrations while by adding an excess of s2o8 the negative effect of ha was omitted 140 khazaei et al reported that for uv pms process for degradation of cefeximen scavengers have reduced the decomposition efficiency from 95 removal to 85 in case of carbonates presence while lowest efficiency related to the presence of chloride ions 75 was reported thus luckily the effect of scavengers was not so high 3 5 effects of water matrix aqueous environments contain different organic compounds as well as mineral anions and the concentration of these compounds is different in surface and underground waters which can interfere with s aops these matrix components can react with active species formed intentionally in treatment system to degrade target pollutant 141 obviously in such cases the effectiveness of treatment process will be lowered or higher dose of oxidant will be needed depending on dominant mechanism of degradation process co existing ions and natural organic matter nom have different effects on persulfate based and peroxymonosulfate based systems 84 142 143 table 12 summarizes the effects of the water matrix on the removal of antibiotics by s aops which are discussed in following paragraphs 3 5 1 coexisting anions in general on the basis of available literature it can be concluded that the coexisting anions have a stonger effect on the free radical pathway than the nonradical pathway however depending on applied system of persulfates activation cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 can have different effects on the degradation of antibiotics in s aops processes 156 3 5 2 effect of chloride ions in the process of chloramphenicol degradation by persulfate uv increasing the chlorine ion concentration from 1 mm to 10 mm the kobs value also increased from 3 13 0 11 10 2 to 4 02 0 24 10 2 min 1 and as a result the removal efficiency increased due to the increase in the oxidative power of the reactive medium after producing cl in another study tan et al showed that in the ps uv method of chloramphenicol decomposition in the presence of cl with a concentration of 1 10 mm the removal efficiency increased and on the other hand at a concentration higher than 10 mm the kobs value decreased to 1 5 0 05 10 2 min 1 but increasing the chlorine ion concentration to 100 mm increased the kobs value to 2 22 0 090 10 2 min 1 which indicates that cl can play an additional role in the presence of high density of cl as well as cl2 ered 1 2 2 09 v where chloramphenicol radical reactions become more important than radical radical quenching reactions comparison of ered 1 2 for studied system revealed that such conditions can have a positive effect on the ps uv process in the degradation of antibiotics in brackish water with high cl concentration 14 140 mm on the other hand at higher concentrations cl can scavenge sulfate and hydroxyl radicals and reduce their degradation efficiency according to eqs 34 39 81 34 so4 cl so4 2 cl 35 cl cl cl2 36 cl2 cl2 2cl cl2 37 cl cl cl2 38 cl hso 5 so4 2 hocl 39 2cl hso 5 h so4 2 cl2 h2o importantly in case of tetracycline degradation by uv ps addition of cl decreased only slightly from 96 06 to 95 26 zhang et al on the other hand presence of br doubled the degradation rate of tetracycline which indicated that bromine improves the degradation of tetracycline it was also found that in the presence of 5 8 μm of br br e0 2 00 v and br 2 e0 1 63 v are produced with a concentration of 1 2 times higher than sulfate radicals which can increase the efficiency of tetracycline 27 sulfamethoxazole 157 and ofloxacin 158 degradation in the uv ps system interestingly frontistis et al reported that in case of ps transition metal system presence of chlorides up to 151 mg l increases the degradation rate of ampicillin three times while no significant effect was observed with the increase of chloride ion to 303 mg l 159 3 5 3 effect of bicarbonates bicarbonates revealed to have ambivalent effect on persulfate beased systems for degradation of chloramphenicol with ps uv with increasing the concentration of bicarbonate from 1 to 100 mm a 50 decrease in kobs was observed 152 it follows from the fact that the reaction of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals with bicarbonate and the production of co3 with relatively less oxidative properties than the original radicals 156 in contrast the positive effect of bicarbonate in degradation of sulfamethoxazole by ps heat was also reported with increasing bicarbonate concentration from 0 to 20 mm the degradation rate was increased the reason is that hco3 co3 can react with electron rich compounds such as anilines with a relatively high rate constant 108 m 1s 1 and sulfamethoxazole has an aniline moiety as well in other study the degradation of oxytetracycline was enhanced by increasing bicarbonate from 0 to 20 mm by forming co3 according to eq 40 degradation of pollutants 150 40 so4 hco3 so4 2 co3 h k 9 1 106m 1s 1 3 5 4 effect of sulfates sulfate anions have generally a positive effect in persulfate based systems for example degradation of chloramphenicol with uv ps process was aided by addition of sulfates in concentration range of 12 48 mg l where kobs rate increased by 35 and 39 above this concentration range 96 mg l sulfates caused decrease of rate constant by 31 the rate constant of the quenching reaction of so4 with s2o8 2 is almost 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of so4 with an organic compounds containing atoms of low ionization energy accordingly the uv ps process can be a good method for the treatment of underground water and some special effluents contaminated with pharmaceutical substances even in the presence of nitrate 10 10 mgl 1 and sulfate 0 125 1 0 mm in the natural concentration s range 152 3 5 5 effect of nitrite anions for degradation of chloramphenicol with uv ps process ghauch et al shown that the presence of nitrite at a concentration of 0 5 mgl 1 does not have a significant effect on kobs less than 20 small decrease is explained mostly by quenching of sulfate radicals by nitrite which is not as strong oxidizing agent for chloramphenicol degradation ered 1 2 1 02 v however nitrate in concentrations 10 mgl 1 caused a significant improvement of kobs up to 37 but at concentrations of 2 5 and 50 mg l a decrease of 9 and 37 was observed in kobs respectively a two hypotheses explaining this behavior were proposed first that the sulfate radicals react with nitrate to produce no3 radicals with a relatively strong oxidizing potential ered 1 2 2 5 v second that nitrate becomes a source of nitrite and oxygen radicals eq 41 nitrite is not an oxidizer of chloramphenicol while o can increase the oxidization of chloramphenicol by reacting with water to produce ho eq 42 which is responsible for further degradation of chloramphenicol 139 152 41 no3 uv no2 o 42 o h2o ho oh zhao et al studying a pms magnetic γ fe2o3 mno2 system for the degradation of ciprofloxacin concluded that by adding cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 ions up to 1 mm didn t significantly lowered the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin the low effect of these ions on the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin by the visible light pms γ fe2o3 mno2 method indicates the high selectivity of the this coupled system 144 on the other hand it must be taken into account that this system was evaluated only under low concentration of anions conditions 3 5 6 natural organic matter nom natural organic matter nom contains a mixture of weak organic acids and organic compounds of unknown structure that are commonly found in water and wastewater humic acid ha formic acid fa and fulvic acids are important components of nom which make up 60 of water soluble organic matter ha contains a large number of carboxyl phenolic and hydroxyl alkyl functional groups that can interact with the functional groups of the catalyst surface or organic compounds 160 in case of abovementioned system based on visible light γ fe2o3 mno2 pms zhao et al confirmed negative effect of nom on the removal of ciprofloxacin this sytem was effective degradation 90 for nom concentrations up to 2 mg l while above this value degradation consequently decreased to 72 1 for nom concentration of 6 mg l in case of sulfamethazine degradation using a simpler thermal activation of ps it was reported that nom had inhibitive effect above 10 mg l 147 the decrease in ciprofloxacin removal efficiency can be explained relating to three aspects first the negatively charged ha binds to the positively charged ciprofloxacin and prevents it from moving towards the catalyst surface second ha attenuates the light and reduces the number of photons on the catalyst surface and in the third case ha traps oxygen carrying radicals 144 in another study ghauch et al concluded that ha in concentrations of 5 and 20 mgl 1reduces the rate of kobs to 35 and 63 however in a low concentration 0 5 mgl 1 the effect is neglected importantly it was highlighted that fa has a greater effect on reducing the rate of kobs so by increasing the concentration of fa from 12 to 582 mgl 1 the kobs rate decreased from 29 to even 86 respectively this significant decrease in kobs is attributed to the smaller size of fa molecules as well as its higher oxygen content compared to ha which makes them more effective to quenching of so4 in addition ha and fa act as internal filter effect which absorb well in the 254 nm range and thus reduce the amount of sulfate radicals that are produced by uv and on the other hand they have electron rich sites which are prone to absorb sulfate and hydroxyl electrophilic radicals therefore in the presence of ha and fa the efficiency of chloramphenicol degradation by uv ps method decreases 152 in other study tetracycline degradation was partially inhibited in presence of ha at concentrations exceeding 10 mgl 1 52 importantly in case of oxytetracycline degradation the negative effect of ha was observed even at 3mgl 1 level 150 in overall it can be concluded that systems based on formation of singlet oxygen are not negatively affected by presence of inorganic anions and what is advantageous in most of reported cases the effect of inorganic anions was positive such situation was observed for sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine tetracycline penicillin g this observation is particularly important for real case scenarios with high salinity effluents correct reports suggests that persulfate systems able to form singlet oxygen should be effective for treatment of this type of sewages in case of systems based on radical degradation pathway such a generalization is not possible it seems that several systems are effective in case of low concentration of anions while high concentrations strongly decrease the degradation however observed effects depend of type of anion for instance for chlorides presence a partially positive effect was reported for norfloxacin and chloramphenicol and for most of antibiotics effect was negative also for carbonates positive effect was reported for norfloxacin oxytetracycline while for most of reviewed pollutants it was negative different effect depending on compound was also reported for nitrates and sulfates reported positive effects of anions on mentioned antibiotics results from reactivity of these compounds with formed by reaction od hydroxyl or sulfate radicals with anions secondary radical species making their contribution in degradation process this proved importance of studies of matrix effects on effectiveness of developed processes on the other hand it is known that secondary radicals despite improvement of degradation of main pollutant can cause formation of secondary pollutants like cl or no2 containing derivatives with higher toxicity than primary pollutant 34 161 this aspect should be also considered in future studies in respect to catalytic systems the evaluation of risks on by product formation should include studies of sorption of these compounds on catalyst surface 3 6 mechanisms of degradation compared to conventional aop methods that rely exclusively on hydroxyl radicals s aop involves much more complex oxidation pathways which differ depending on water compositions and types of activators used although sulfate and hydroxyl radicals can decompose various types of organic compounds however the pollutant degradation mechanism is significantly different depending on the free radical and the nature of the pollutant the mechanism of degradation of organic pollutants by sulfate radicals usually includes electron transfer while hydroxyl radicals also include hydrogen atom abstraction reactions in addition to electron transfer 57 162 in the path of electron transfer this process generally takes place through two mechanisms the bridged and outer space mechanisms the bridged mechanism has a slow electron transfer rate because it requires the formation of a transition bond while no bond formation is required for the outer space mechanism 163 164 the degradation and decomposition of organic pollutants by sulfate and hydroxyl radicals include different mechanisms so4 participates mainly in outer space mechanism for electron transfer reaction while oh undergoes reaction via bridge mechanism c c c n c s addition and h abstraction reactions for degradation of organic pollutants 165 the mechanisms of antibiotic degradation are compared in table 13 in the process of chloramphenicol cap decomposition by ps uv ghauch et al proposed that chloramphenicol molecules first undergo the following processes 1 direct photolysis 2 abstraction of hydrogen by hydroxyl radicals that are created directly by water splitting or indirectly by the reaction of sulfate radicals with water 3 electron abstraction which occurs mainly on the nitrobenzene ring via sulfate radicals to produce the corresponding unstable cap and in the next step hydroxylated cap and unstable cap undergo oxidation to produce further hydroxylated cap and sulfonated hydroxylated cap finally intermediates produced through direct photolysis are oxidized by sulfate or hydroxyl radicals and are converted into smaller molecules as a result it can be said that in this process chloramphenicol is degraded by direct photolysis hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer 152 zhang et al showed that the main degradation pathway of tetracycline by uv ps process was via functional group shedding and ring opening reactions taking place sequentially by sulfate and hydroxyl radicals in this study the degradation of tetracycline molecules in deionized water was divided into three paths first so4 selectively reacted with electron rich groups amide group tertiary amine group hydroxyl group and double bond and oh showed high activity for olefin double bond in the first pathway the tertiary amine groups of tc then hydroxyl methyl and formamide were destroyed and after the ring opening and substitution reactions some intermediate products were produced in the second pathway the cycloaddition of oh it occurred through the loss of formamide and methyl groups followed by a series of ring opening and replacement reactions to produce other intermediate compounds in the third pathway the removal of carboxamide and the third amine group from tetracycline molecules and the production of intermediate products occurred and finally by using cycloaddition of oh and dimethylation reaction the intermediate products were converted into small molecular products among the three degradation pathways the electron withdrawing groups such as carbonyl and carboxyl were not easily directly attacked but were continuously degraded by the gradual opening of the ring structure of tetracycline molecules 27 in the degradation process of sulfadiazine by us fe0 ps process two degradation pathways were proposed in first the sulfate radicals caused the oxidation of the amine group and produced nitro sd derivatives and then by attacking the nitro sd derivatives the ring opening of the heterocyclic ring took place in the second path of degradation sulfate radicals caused direct oxidative cleavage of the s n bond the results of the ion chromatography tests revealed that formic acid acetic acid and some inorganic ions were the final products of sulfadiazine decomposition 51 3 7 kinetics the oxidation process of antibiotics by ps and pms generally follows the pseudo first order kinetic model 170 various operating factors such as ph temperature oxidant concentration antibiotic concentration and the presence of water matrix affect the rate constant 171 for all kinetic experiments under different conditions the degradation of antibiotics is fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic equation eq 43 43 ln c0 ct kobs t where c0 and ct are the molar concentrations of antibiotic at the time 0 and reaction time t respectively kobs is the pseudo first order constant min 1 table 14 compare the kinetics of degradation of antibiotics with different activation methods beside general conclusions pointed out at the end of this paragraph some researchers formed useful observations for instance fan et al confirmed a general rule about positive influence of increased temperature on rate constant value in case of sulfamethazine the degradation rate increased with increasing temperature in heat activated ps systems from 20 to 70 as the temperature increased from 40 c to 60 c while the value of kobs increased by 21 times 147 it follows from high sensitivity to temperature of thermally activated persulfate systems where heat as sole factor can significantly gain the performance of such systems 104 all of the research that investigated the rate constant values of antibiotics degradation by different methods of ps and pms activation concluded that with increasing oxidant concentration to some extent the kobs also increases for instance by studying the degradation of oxytetracycline by uv ps process and investigating the reaction kinetics liu et al concluded that the destruction of oxytetracycline follows pseudo first order kinetics so that with the increase of persulfate concentration up to 1 mm it seems that kobs was proportional to the linear regression slope of 0 0214 cm2mj 1mm 1 r2 0 99 and with the increase of ps concentration a non linear increase was observed which is due to the self scavenging effect of ps and the recombination of sulfate radicals 150 zhang et al by examining the kinetics of tetracycline degradation by uv ps method concluded that with increasing persulfate concentration from 0 to 30 mgl 1 the degradation rate constant increased from 0 008 to 0 1 min 1 and the removal efficiency reached 95 73 while increasing the concentration to 40 and 50 mgl 1 the degradation of tetracycline did not improve because the excess persulfate acted as a scavenger and reacted with sulfate radicals reducing the rate constant and thus the removal efficiency 27 in overall according to compared results it can be stated that rate constant under optimized conditions is strongly dependent of structure of target pollutant there is no clear relation between the used excess of oxidant or type of radical species with rate constant order of magnitude 27 55 98 144 147 152 170 175 for example tetracycline degradation rate constant in a two strongly different oxidation systems was in the range of 0 1 0 21 min 1 while for chloramphenicol it was in the range of 0 036 0079 min 1 typically rate constant values seem to be in range of 0 05 0 2 min 1 4 conclusion because the reaction rate of ps and pms is slow when directly reacting with the contaminants activation of ps and pms is essential for the treatment of organic contaminants different types of activation methods for ps and pms were reviewed and compared exclusively in terms of process ph contact time initial concentration of antibiotic and concentration of oxidant this analysis revealed that the optimal ph in the s aop process depends on the method of activation of oxidant so it has to be optimized for every new type of catalyst the decomposition efficiency of antibiotics by all methods for activating ps and pms increases with increasing contact time generally more than 30min is required for most published processes to obtain final degradation over 90 in all the studies with increasing the concentration of antibiotics the decomposition efficiency as it lowers the ratio of radial species to radical species at fixed dose of oxidant as well as due to presence of secondary pollutants also reacting with radicals this aspect clearly shows the need of process optimization using a molar ratio of oxidant to pollutant rox as one of parameters therefore the highest degradation efficiency of antibiotics was obtained for studies with the lowest concentration of antibiotics in fact these results are promising as the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is mostly at ppb level thus studies of ppm level are not proving their usefulness in all activation methods by increasing the concentration of ps and pms the production of so4 increases and leads to improved removal efficiency however as the concentration increases further the removal efficiency is constant and sometimes decreases this reduction in efficiency is due to the high concentration of oxidants in the environment which acts as a radical scavenger and reduces so4 and oh in the environment typically scavenging effect was observed above 0 7 mm of the ps and 2 mm of pms aops based on ps and pms have been widely studied as an efficient and effective method for degrading various kinds of organic pollutants especially antibiotics and aid in environmental restoration complete degradation of organic pollutants is possible by using ps and pms chloramphenicol oxytetracycline sulfamethazine tetracycline sulfamonomethoxine were effectively degraded by ps based processes while sulfamethazine ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole chloramphenicol and sulfadiazine were completely degraded by pms thus it can be said that for certain compounds both ps and pms were highly effective on the other hand the degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride enrofloxacin fluconazole and norfloxacin by using ps and pms was not so effective degradation below 90 was reported thus further developments should focus on effective degradation via s aops of these persistent types of molecules instead of proving effectiveness to pharmaceuticals that were already degraded via s aops however the optimal operating conditions for cost effective and fast decomposition in real systems still need to be reconsidered in addition the presence of excess sulfate ions can have adverse effects on the environment therefore it is necessary to study the effects and methods of sulfate reduction finally a proper activation method should be developed despite the scientific value of papers relating to very sophisticated catalysts which preparation sounds more like jewelry art their applicability in routine applications seems to be very limited it follows from several stages of preparation often off green chemistry approach as well as high costs finally their management at the waste stage is not addressed on the other hand processes developed on their basis revealed a much higher sensitivity to real matrix components such as anions or nom comparing uv based and thermally activated s aops several attempts on the application of relatively simple catalysts based on carbon type materials proved their effectiveness to degrade environmental pollutants via s aops thus future progress on s aops should strongly focus on applications of such low cost catalysts for pharmaceuticals degradation most of the studied articles lacked many important parameters such as measuring the amount of pollutant mineralization by determining the final cod or toc values most of the articles did not describe the pathway of pollutant degradation and even the intermediate products and by products were not examined secondly metals leaching from catalyst into the effluents should be always controlled therefore it is not possible to decide on the safety of many already developed methods declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

8732,sulfate radical aops sr aop were successfully utilized in degradation of antibiotics in water and wastewater treatment the review discusses details on sr aops mechanisms and applications for antibiotics degradation the progress in this field was discussed highlighting the most promising developments and remaining challenges the applicability of sr aops was summarized revealing the most susceptible and persistent to oxidation groups of pharmaceuticals highest effectiveness was reported for degradation of pharmaceuticals on ppb level systems revealed a scavenging effect in case of oxidant dose 0 7 mm of the ps and 2 mm of pms future development demands simple persulfates activation systems for real matrix treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes sulfate radicals hydroxyl radicals pharmaceuticals oxidation water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction antibiotics as compounds having antibacterial antiviral and antifungal activity are widely used in eradicating and preventing the growth of microorganisms in medicine and veterinary 1 they are entered the environment through a variety of sources such as the pharmaceutical industry hospital sewage and disposal of human and animal wastes 2 approximately 30 90 of antibiotics remain active and non metabolized and are disposed to the environment through urine and feces 3 4 the inability of conventional wastewater treatment processes to remove antibiotics and their discharge into the environment can result in adverse effects on the ecosystem and human there is strong evidence for the presence of antibiotics in aqueous solutions at the level of nano and micrograms per liter 5 6 which can lead to the development of antibiotic resistant pathogens that potentially threaten the ecosystem and human health 7 8 conventional wastewater treatment processes are known to be non effective for the removal or degradation of several organic chemicals especially pharmaceuticals these compounds due to their high toxicity in particular to the bacterial community can cease the biological process of wastewater treatment 9 10 various methods have been used to remove pharmaceutical compounds but the best method for removing these compounds is advanced oxidation processes aops which were first introduced by glaze in 1987 for water and wastewater treatment 11 aops are the most effective method for treatment of highly polluted industrial toxic hazardous resistant and non biodegradable organic pollutants in aqueous solutions which has gained an important place in water and wastewater treatment 12 13 today the best way to degrade more effectively the pollutants present in aquatic and soil environments is to apply the aops without the formation of hazardous and intermediate substances 14 16 aops fundamentally are the methods that produce strong oxidizing agents such as oh so4 cl and some oxidizers that allow direct electron transfer 17 18 the oxidation potential of some common oxidants is shown in table 1 19 the two types of radicals oh and so4 are strong oxidizing radicals with redox potentials e 2 8v and 2 5 3 1v respectively which can rapidly and non selectively oxidize and decompose most organic compounds in water and wastewater 20 21 today aops based on so4 have received high attention due to some unique features aops can be classified according to the type of produced radicals the aops based on the production of oh and so4 are called hr aop and sr aop respectively 22 23 aops are used to achieve the oxidation and decomposition of pollutants into neutral and low risk products 9 the advantages of aops are complete mineralization of organic matter the low production of residual materials and the ability to combine with biological systems 24 25 the aim of this review study is to evaluate the effect and mechanism of persulfate ps and peroxymonosulfate pms activated by different methods to remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions this study also investigated the impact of scavengers by products formation and assessment of toxicity of treated effluents 2 idea of persulfates application for aops 2 1 properties of persulfate persulfate ps s2o8 2 is a one of two most popular chemicals used in this field its properties were already well summarized in respect s aops 26 briefly it was compiled in supp info section s1 supporting information 2 1 1 activation methods 2 1 1 1 persulfate activated by uv several papers proved possibility of ps activation by uv table 2 explanation of mechanism and main achievements are summarized in supp info section s2 it is clear that excess of oxidant calculated as the molar ratio of oxidant to pollutant i e rox is needed reasonable performance well obtained for rox between 8 and 10 in other cases much higher rox as 40 or even 150 was used because in most of the studies the authors do not focus on the rox defining the concentration of oxidant as molar concentration and pollutant in mg l this relation is not directly visible although in some cases high effectiveness was obtained the 40 or 150 m excess of oxidant seems to be out of scope and real sense in relation to the possible implementation of such process in the real scenario ps has high molecular mass thus such molar excess means high mass dose of oxidant which is relatively expensive in the chloramphenicol degradation process the addition of cl 1 mm so4 2 0 5 mm and no3 10 mm increases the degradation efficiency low cl concentration has a positive effect on the degradation of chloramphenicol two scenarios are possible through uv irradiation first so4 is produced for reaction with no3 so that no3 is produced with significant oxidation power ered1 2 2 50v eq 1 second no3 becomes a source of nitrite and oxygen radicals eq 2 o could enhance cap oxidation upon reaction with water to generate ho eq 3 responsible for more cap degradation other studies proved that in the case of the presence of sulfate ions excess energy introduced into the liquid can cause the formation of so4 34 1 no3 so4 no3 so4 2 2 no3 uv no2 o 3 o h2o ho ho a break even point was determined for ps 0 25 ps 0 5 mm at a fluence of 330j for 1h reaction uv ps system was ph independent full cap degradation was reached in 1h upon increasing ps 2 5 mm along with the uv fluence 874j in the optimal condition 29 the main reason for the high degradation of oxytetracycline in the uv ps system is the presence of hco3 20 mm and cu2 1 mm due to the reaction of cu2 with ps the possibility of forming additional so4 increases according to eq 4 also the presence of hco3 due to the production of carbonate radicals has a positive role in the degradation of otc eq 5 4 cu2 s2o8 2 cu3 so4 2 so4 5 so4 hco3 so4 2 co3 h it was found that so4 was probably the predominant radical species for the degradation of otc by uv ps at ph 7 the kobs was the highest at near neutral conditions 31 the degradation of otc by uv ps method was shown in fig 1 2 1 1 2 persulfate activated by heat many studies verified the activation of ps by heat table 3 extra information about this method is summarized in supp info section s3 the reason for the high degradation efficiency for sulfamethazine smz is the presence of bicarbonate and chloride enhanced smz degradation since smz contains aniline moiety the enhancement in smz degradation rate was likely a result of hco3 co3 reaction which offsets the negative effect of so4 and or ho scavenging the enhancement in smz oxidation with increasing cl concentration was likely due to the contribution of reactions involving reactive chlorine species which compensated for the depletion of so4 and or ho due to cl scavenging in this study heat ps oxidation of smz in the aqueous solution was systematically investigated it was shown that increasing the temperature and ps dosage significantly enhanced the removal rate of smz smz could be degraded efficiently at the ph ranged from 7 0 to 9 0 but higher and lower ph showed inhibitory effects 40 fig 2 demonstrate the degradation of smz by heat activated ps see also fig 3 under the optimal condition tetracycline ttc degraded in 100 the cc double bond and phenolic moiety in ttc molecule are the reactive sites toward so4 attack potential reactive sites may include c2 c3 keto enol moiety c7 c9 and c11a c12 double bond increasing the temperature and solution ph favored the removal of ttc ttc was degraded faster in artificial surface water asw than that in milli q water suggesting that the natural water constituents may facilitate the degradation of tcs by sr aops approximately 70 ttc was degraded after 240min at 40 c whereas ttc was completely eliminated within 30min at 70 c higher temperature promoted the activation of ps and enhanced the formation rate of sr which favored the degradation of ttc furthermore the chemical reactions initiated by the radical attack were significantly elevated at higher temperatures according to thermodynamic law the degradation of ttc showed a ph dependence and kobs increased with increasing the ph since ttc has three pka this result suggests that the deprotonated non dissociated ttc was more reactive for sr attack the phenolate form of phenolicdiketone group and the unprotonated dimethylamine moiety were more reactive most likely due to the higher electron densities of these moieties which favored the electrophilic attack of sr 42 2 1 1 3 persulfate activated by transition metals various studies have used the transition metals method to activate the ps table 4 which is given in supp info section s4 application of magnetic particles makes their isolation from the reaction system after the process easier by means of the magnetic field in all cases studied the ph was acidic due to the needed form of metal cations activating ps in many cases the time needed to obtain satisfactory results was less than 1hr in almost a half of studies only 30min of treatment was needed to obtain quantitative degradation the cause of high degradation sulfamonomethoxine smm is fe3o4 mnps activate ps yield so4 species and then accelerate the decomposition of smm 43 the degradation efficiencies of the ag agcl various weight percentage of zero valent iron particles nzvi modified zeolite x catalysts ag agcl x fex for total tetracycline removal were high due to the enhanced adsorptive capacity of x fex the x denotes the weight percentage of nzvi the extended absorbance in the visible light region and improved space separation of photo induced charge carriers 45 2 1 1 4 persulfate activated by ultrasound irradiation some researchers are proved the ability of us for activation of ps table 5 the additional information is summarized in supp info section s5 the reason for the high efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride degradation in us ps method was to increase the intensity of ultrasound by 500w it is clear that the increase of ultrasound intensity to a specific high level promoted the decomposition of s2o8 2 and generation of reactive species and consequently increased the rate of tetracycline hydrochloride degradation in addition the increase of the power intensity leads to a significant increase of the number of cavitation bubbles the degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride under optimal condition was 88 51 55 2 1 1 5 persulfate activated by carbon materials another method of ps activation is based on application of carbon based materials activated carbon ac biochar bc carbon nanotubes cnt and graphene as carbon based materials are widely used as adsorbents and catalysts high specific surface area high pore volume and affordability are their main advantages 56 58 2 1 1 5 1 activated carbon one of the most widely used non metallic catalysts for the activation of persulfate is activated carbon ac among its advantages can be mentioned the developed porous structure large specific surface area abundant functional groups and cost effectiveness surface functional groups delocalized π electrons sp2 hybrid carbon at defect edges and oxygen containing functional groups cooh c oh c o are among the active sites of ac for persulfate activation 59 60 these sites react with persulfate and produce hydroxyl and sulfate radicals in order to remove pollutants 61 there are different types of activated carbon including powdered activated carbon pac granular activated carbon gac and activated carbon fiber acf in addition to the mentioned advantages the main problem of activated carbon is the poor mass transfer of pollutant molecules due to the size of micropores which limits the rate of degradation because catalytic reactions occur only on the surface of the carbon or the adjacent boundary layers thus causing weak ac performance but this problem can be solved by changing the porous structure to mesoporous or hierarchical pores by soft hard mold method 62 the mechanisms of pollutant degradation by persulfate activated with carbon can be summarized in three aspects adsorption free radical pathway and nonradical pathway the non radical path can be divided into singlet oxygen electron transfer and direct oxidation these persulfate activation mechanisms can occur simultaneously in one reaction 63 64 various factors such as surface functional groups surface electrochemical impedance graphitization degree and porous structure which are related to the raw materials preparation strategies and modification methods can affect the activation of persulfate by carbon materials 65 66 according to eqs 6 8 persulfate produces sulfate and hydroxyl radicals through the interaction with the surface of activated carbon ac through the electron transfer mechanism and finally these generated radicals decompose organic pollutants into inorganic compounds and organic intermediates 67 6 s2o8 2 ac so4 ho ac 7 s2o8 2 ac ho so4 2 ac 8 ho so4 contaminates co2 h2o so4 2 reaction intermediates table 6 shows some research on the activation of persulfate by activated carbon in order to remove antibiotics generally application of ac allows effective activation of persulfates providing close to 90 degradation effectiveness of studied antibiotics however at least 100 time molar excess of oxidant in respect to pollutant rox is needed to obtain such results which seems to be a high value especially in respect to costs of treatment process future studies should focus on ps ac systems in real case scenario i e to treat real effluents instead of studies performed in idead deionized water environment 2 1 1 5 2 biochar biochar bc is produced from biomass waste by pyrolysis process no oxygen or limited oxygen and temperature 800 300 c 61 71 common types of biochars can be mention to the wood based biochar 72 algae based biochar 65 sludge based biochar 73 straw based biochar 74 and shell based biochar 75 since biochar is produced by pyrolysis of biomass waste without adding any chemical or physical activating agents koh h3po4 zncl2 co2 and steam it has a lower specific surface area 500 m2 g than ac 61 but due to its low cost and having many functional groups it is used as a catalyst for persulfate activation oxygen functional groups and stable free radicals on bc surface activate persulfate 76 wang et al proposed a possible activation mechanism of persulfate by bc they found that the activation of persulfate depends on the formed defective structures and stable free radicals in bc including semiquinones and phenoxyls and also the activation of persulfate can be enhanced due to the high degree of graphitization and aromatic conjugated π electrons in bc 77 according to data compiled in table 7 application of biochar allows to obtain above 90 degradation of studied antibiotics typically reported rox still mostly exceeded value of 100 however in one study 34 a 100 degradation of tetracycline was possible by ps activated with biochar at rox of 11 this approach seems to be reasonable in respect to application in real case scenario 2 1 1 5 3 carbon nanotubes good conductivity high mobility of electrons on the surface and low mass transfer resistance have caused the high reactive activity of carbon nanotubes cnt 82 different dimensions and surface chemistry of cnt are responsible for different catalytic performance compared to other carbon materials the catalytic reaction of cnt is related to the defect level and electronic state which can be changed by increasing wall layers and doping heteroatoms 59 83 cnt can be divided into two groups single walled cnt swcnt and multi walled cnt mwcnt the surface of mwcnt is much more active than swcnt due to the presence of a large number of surface functional groups such as cooh c o and oh some researchers showed that by doping nitrogen to cnt enclosed with fe3c it can be used to activate persulfate through hydroxylation oxidation ring opening bond cleavage and sulfonation in order to degrade sulfamethoxazole and as a result they found that the catalytic performance of persulfate by cnt doped with nitrogen increases due to higher absorption and faster charge transfer 84 shang et al shown that a 100 degradation of sulfamethoxazole was obtained with ps nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes with encapsulated fe3c nanoparticles during this process the fe3c encapsulated ncnts were beneficial both for the electron transfer and to avoid the fe3c from dissolving in the solution epr spectra revealed that the so4 ho and 1o2 contributed to the degradation of sulfamethoxazole 84 also few other studies table 8 confirmed the activation of ps by carbon nanotubes in this case rox between 50 and 70 revealed to be effective for 100 antibiotics removal 2 1 1 5 4 graphene graphene is a thin carbon sheet with a six membered carbon ring as the core structure and various types of edge defects graphene has various functional groups including hydroxyl oh carboxyl cooh carbonyl c o and epoxy groups c o c 88 graphene can be divided into reduced graphene oxide rgo graphene oxide go and pristine graphene based on the degree of surface oxidation go rgo have an acidic surface and as a result they need a basic surface to activate persulfate modified graphene is a suitable option for persulfate activation due to its higher specific surface area for adsorption and catalysis compared to cnt and bc as well as good electrical conductivity and electron mobility for the redox reaction of sp2 electrons 89 also removing oxygen containing groups on rgo surface by thermal method can improve the integrity of the π conjugated structure and surface hydrophobicity 90 nucleophilic ketone and quinoid functional groups can act as active sites for redox reactions and persulfate activation due to having many electrons 91 but the most important disadvantages of using graphene for persulfate activation relates to being expensive compared to other carbon materials and using dangerous oxidizing materials h2so4 hno3 and kmno4 in the classical hummers synthesis method for go 61 peng et al applied n rgo fe3o4 to activate ps in order to degrade norfloxacin incorporation of n rgo with fe3o4 nanoparticles improved the catalytic efficiency in 210 min it caused complete removal of norfloxacin also based on the esr spectrum it was determined that both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are produced during the activation some researches proved the possibility of ps activation by carbon nanotube and graphene for degradation of antibiotics table 8 in summary it can be concluded that carbon based catalysts are effective activators of persulfates for antibiotics activation it is possible to obtain a 100 degradation of antibiotics using relatively low amounts of catalyst 0 1 0 5 gl 1 however in some studies load above 1gl 1 also was reported as optimal which seems to be not reasonable amount for real large scale applications in few studies it was proved that effective degradation can be obtained with minimized consumption of oxidant resulting in rox values of 10 20 unfortunately in many studies much higher load of oxidant rox exceeding 100 was reported such a high values of oxidant dose could be typical for direct oxidation but cannot be named as acceptable for advanced catalytic systems thus in future studies a milestone optimal parameter should be oriented on the best reported values 2 2 properties of peroxymonosulfate peroxymonosulfate hso5 also known as pms and oxone is another popular oxidant that used for degradation of pollutants 26 briefly it was compiled in supp info section s6 2 2 1 activation methods 2 2 1 1 peroxymonosolfate activated by uv many literatures are explained the use of uv for activation of pms table 9 more information is given in supp info section s7 the performance of uv pms and uv pms used for degradation sulfamethazine was compared uv pms provided more thorough degradation of sulfamethazine as demonstrated by the complete degradation of 0 2μgl 1 of sulfamethazine within 5min at an initial pms 1mgl 1 ph 7 5 uv 254 nm rox 1 4 uv promoted sulfamethazine degradation by pms resulting in a higher effectiveness of the combined process comparing to the sole use of uv photolysis or pms pms decomposes with uv by cleavage of its peroxide bond which produces so4 and ho 92 the pyrimidine ring structure of sulfamethazine is resistant to oxidation by so4 thus their rapid degradation is attributed to oxidation of the aniline moiety and cleavage of the sulfonamide bond by so4 or ho a study on degradation of ciprofloxacin demonstrated the effectiveness of s aops for treatment of domestic wastewater containing this pharmaceutical by comparing three uv 254nm based aops uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 in distilled water the order of degradation efficiency was uv ps uv pms uv h2o2 while in wastewater the most efficient process was uv pms uv ps uv h2o2 mainly because pms decomposition into sulfate radical anion was activated by bicarbonate ions uv pms has demonstrated better kinetic performances over uv h2o2 system for cip removal wastewater treatment plant effluents mainly because bicarbonate ions are able to activate pms decomposition into sra and due to the higher selectivity in reactivity of sra with respect to hr in organic rich matrices cip was completely degraded in wastewater at the optimized parameters the disadvantage of pms applied as oxone is the triple salt form which results in high mass dose of oxone needed to obtain desired rox the price of chemical is related to its mass not moles thus pms processes with comparable rox to ps will be much more expensive sulfate radical anion attacks prompted transformations at the piperazinyl ring through the one electron oxidation mechanism as a major pathway while oh attacks were mainly responsible for quinolone moiety transformations as a minor pathway sulfate radical anion generation has made uv pms a kinetically effective process in degradation cip from wastewater 94 2 2 1 2 peroxymonosolfate activated by graphene oxide transition metals nanoscale magnetic and α mno2 multiple studies have been confirming the activation of pms by transition metals nanoscale magnetic and α mno2 and graphene oxide the information about these methods exists in supp info section s8 babayi et al shown the performance of graphene based cofe2o4 in the activation of pms and amoxicillin removal from aqueous solutions in optimum condition the amoxicillin cod and toc removal efficiency was 99 27 83 1 and 61 11 respectively showing that despite high degradation efficiency of the amoxicillin it was not fully mineralized 96 almost 40 of the remaining toc indicates the by products of degradation were not effectively degraded in such cases an evaluation of by products toxicity is a must to fully present the advantages of the developed process many by products of pharmaceuticals degradation can be much more toxic comparing to primary form thus there is a risk that biotoxicity of the treated effluent could significantly increase they used ph 3 9 and concluded that aops based on co pms have better performance in neutral and alkaline ph the best process efficiency was achieved in the removal of amoxicillin in ph 6 however the optimal performance of the system in ph 4 to 7 does not differ much from each other but in ph 4 and ph 7 the efficiency of the system significantly decreases the reason for this decrease in acidic ph is the lack of effective activation of pms according to eq 9 9 co2 hooso3 coso5 h the reason for the decrease in efficiency in alkaline ph 7 is the reaction of free so4 with hydroxyl ions and the production of sulfate ions and free oh this free oh is rapidly converted to free radical hydrogen which is much weaker than so4 another important parameter in g cofe2o4 pms process is the catalyst concentration which plays a significant role in the removal of amoxicillin in this experiment the optimum concentration of catalyst was obtained 0 5gl 1 the removal efficiency of amoxicillin increases to a concentration of 0 5gl 1 from the catalyst but there was no significant difference from 0 5 to 1 25gl 1 as the dose of catalyst increases the efficiency of removal increases which is due to the increase in active sites available for pms decomposition and the production of more free so4 96 in this study the rox 150 which means the authors do not focus on the rox defining the concentration of oxidant as molar concentration and pollutant in mgl 1 this relation is not directly visible the antibiotic removal with transition metals pms was shown in table 10 feng et al used α fe2o3 as the activator of pms for degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx the weight ratio between cu2o and α fe2o3 influenced the degradation of smx and the optimal ratio depended on the dosage of pms and catalyst with 40mgl 1 pms and 0 6gl 1 catalyst a pseudo first order constant of 0 019min 1 was achieved for ct2 5 cu2o whereas only 0 004min 1 was realized for α fe2o3 nearly complete degradation of the sulfamethoxazole was achieved within 180min under the conditions of 40mgl 1 pms 0 4gl 1 ct2 5 cu2o and ph 6 8 the ct2 5 cu2o had efficient reactivity for smx degradation and the highest stoichiometric efficiency value after a reaction time of 60min the reactivity of the ct2 5 cu2o was highly dependent on its contact time with the pms 97 deng et al by survey of some conditions such as catalyst 0 02 0 4gl 1 ph 3 11 and pms 0 2 4 mm for decomposition of chloramphenicol by pms activated with co3o4 are concluded that by optimum conditions ph 7 catalyst dosage 0 1gl 1 and pms 1 mm chloramphenicol degraded completely the superior catalytic performance of co3o4 kit6 was ascribed to the combination of multiple unique characteristics including the large specific surface area high pore volume high co2 content and high density of surface active sites higher catalyst dosage higher pms concentration neutral ph and higher reaction temperature favored the removal the balance among co2 co3 o2 o2 and pms decomposed in solution ensured the continuous generation of oh and so4 and the latter made the predominant contribution for the cap degradation considering its outstanding catalytic activity excellent reusability and long term stability mesoporous co3o4 are other advantages of that 98 zhang et al used cubi2o4 mno2 pms to degrade ceftiofur cef the authors concluded that by the optimization of selected parameters such as mass ratio of cubi2o4 to mno2 1 5 cef 5mgl 1 pms 0 4gl 1 and ph 11 it was possible to obtain a cef degradation reaching 93 6 the degradation of cef was tested in the ph range of 3 11 it could be noticed that the degradation efficiency of cef increased from 83 3 to 93 6 with the ph increasing from 3 to 11 the increase of solution ph helped the formation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of cubi2o4 mno2 composite which could be served as the active site for the electron transfer to improve the activation of pms also by increasing pms concentration from 0 to 0 5gl 1 the degradation rate was increased the higher pms concentrations could lead to higher catalytic performance corresponding the kapp of cef removal was increased from 0 00772min 1 to 0 05624min 1 as the concentration of pms increased from 0 to 0 5gl 1 indicating the accelerated reaction rates probably it follows from the fact that more so4 would be produced with the increase of pms concentration resulting in the enhancement of cef degradation efficiency however when the pms concentration was continuously increased from 0 4gl 1 to 0 5gl 1 a limited increase was clearly observed which might be due to the reaction between excess pms and active species a self scavenging effect thus inhibited degradation of the cef 102 deng et al revealed under optimal parameters the degradation of ciprofloxacin was obtained 93 6 nanoscale α mno2 with different morphologies nanoparticles nanoflowers and nanorods were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and tested in pms activation for cip degradation the catalytic activity of α mno2 mainly relied on the specific surface area and crystallinity and followed the order of α mno2 nanoflowers α mno2 nanorods α mno2 nanoparticles commercial mno2 the removal efficiency decreased from 93 68 to 83 81 as solution ph increased from 3 to 7 suggesting that acidic conditions were more favorable to the degradation than neutral condition without mno2 catalysts only16 99 cip was removed by pms alone indicating that pms was not effective as an oxidant to directly degrade this pollutant in the absence of pms mno2 caused a slight reduction of cip less than 7 which was primarily attributed to the adsorption of cip on the catalyst surface among the four mno2 samples α mno2 nanoflowers presented the highest efficiency in cip adsorption which resulted from its highest bet surface area when pms and mno2 were simultaneously introduced into the solution the cip removal was evidently enhanced because of the involvement of so4 and ho which originated from the decomposition of pms caused by the electron exchange between mn3 and mn4 in mno2 the removal efficiencies of cip with α mno2 nanoflowers nanorods nanoparticles and commercial mno2 as pms initiators were 93 68 71 33 61 97 and 22 94 respectively 103 2 2 1 3 peroxymonosolfate activated by heat using heat to activate pms is also used to degrade pollutants in water and wastewater elevated temperatures are needed to activate pms and on the other hand its not high efficiency makes this activation method not practical for large scales the exemption are process effluents that due to previous stages of operation initially could have temperatures exceeding 40 c on the other hand comparing to other activation methods the use of heat allows to shorten the required reaction time and activation energy 104 in the heat activated ps oxidation process only so4 radicals are formed while from the activation of pms with heat both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are produced eq 10 the activation mechanism of pms with heat is to cleave the o o bond and produce sulfate radicals compared to the thermal activation of ps fewer studies were conducted on the thermal activation of pms yang et al showed that heat activation is effective for ps while not for pms 105 therefore more studies should be done on the mechanism of pms activation by heat so far this method rarely has been used to activate pms for the degradation of antibiotics and studies in this field are scarce 35 10 hso 5 heat oh so4 only a few studies have been conducted to remove antibiotics using heat activated peroxymonosulfate ulucan altuntas et al used pms activated by heat for degradation of oxytetracycline in this method they shown that optimal conditions are obtained at temperature of 75 c allowing to obtain 84 degradation in 20 min of treatment 35 in another study milh et al revealed that pms heat process under optimum conditions at 70 c allowed to obtain 94 degradation of sulfamethoxazole in 60 min 106 2 2 1 4 peroxymonosulfate and persulfate activated by gamma radiation the use of gamma radiation in wastewater and water treatment to remove toxic pollutants is a relatively new technology with gamma radiation hydroxyl radicals hydrated electrons and hydrogen radicals are produced 107 these active species through the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals and the reduction of hydrated electrons can cause the decomposition of pollutants and also cause the activation of ps and pms in addition due to the high energy of the gamma ray it can activate ps and pms by cleavage of o o bond although gamma rays have a high penetration comparing to uv the cost of making gamma ray equipment is much higher than uv equipment for this reason applications of this method are not common 35 108 according to eqs 1 11 13 kgy irradiated dose of radiation produces 10 5 mol eaq and h which can theoretically convert 10 5 mol sulfate to so4 109 11 s2o8 2 γ ray so4 12 s2o8 2 eaq so4 so4 2 k 1 1 1010 m 1s 1 13 s2o8 2 h so4 so4 2 h k 2 5 107 m 1s 1 when the eaq are produced from gamma radiation they react with pms and can produce oh and so4 eqs 14 and 15 35 14 hso 5 eaq oh so4 2 k 8 4 109 m 1s 1 15 hso 5 eaq so4 oh k 8 4 109 m 1s 1 some papers investigated the possibility of activation of ps and pms by gamma radiation for the degradation of antibiotics table 11 importantly in all studies a rox values below 100 were reported it follows from high effectiveness of this method of activation however with high energy costs a variety of reported effectiveness also in respect to same pollutant see carbamazepine confirms that this type of activation demands standardization of experimental conditions and validation of performance to allow real comparison of results according to already published data this method has high potential for future studies 3 effect of operation parameters for antibiotics degradation 3 1 effect of ph the ph is one of the most important and influential parameters on the amount and type of radicals formed under aops and as well as the efficacy of antibiotics in most chemical and electrochemical processes ph of solution is one of the most important factors in the management and process efficiency this factor can affect process efficiency by affecting the pollutant properties and used methods therefore the main factor in determining the dominant radical in the process is completely influenced by the ph of solution 33 ps in different phs of the solution is stable while pms can be affected by different ph pms is stable in ph 6 or ph 12 when ph 9 it showed the poorest stability where half of hso5 decomposes to so5 2 112 under alkaline conditions ps can be decomposed to so4 sulfate radicals can further transform into oh thus so4 play a major role in degrading the organic compounds under alkaline conditions while so4 are the primary reactive species at acid conditions under neutral conditions both oh and so4 contributed to the degradation of organic pollutants 113 as mentioned above ps presented stability in the solution at different ph while the existing form of pms was significantly influenced by the solution of ph alkaline conditions can activate both ps and pms in ph 5 hydrogen ion acts as the scavenger of so4 and oh j 114 in general ps and pms have a wide ph range of application although their oxidation potential changes with the ph the appropriate ph should be adjusted based on ps and pms activation methods 115 3 1 1 effect of ph on activation method by uv the best ph for activating ps and pms to produce so4 is in the range of 5 and 7 in both uv ps and uv pms systems at ph 7 especially 3 to 5 the superiority is with so4 generation according to eq 16 when the ph is between 7 and 9 so4 and oh are present in the system and in alkaline conditions especially ph 12 so4 react with hydroxyl ions and generate oh eq 17 therefore the presence of so4 will be superior and in alkaline conditions the potential of oh oxidation will be greatly reduced 116 also at higher phs so4 and oh react with each other according to eq 18 which the process efficiency is significantly reduced so that the oxidation system becomes vacant of radicals 117 16 so4 h2o oh h so4 2 17 so4 oh oh so4 2 18 so4 oh h so4 2 1 2o2 in the process of activating ps and pms with uv some studies reported data also confirming this statement similarly to these studies it was shown that the highest degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine 28 ciprofloxacin 118 chloramphenicol 29 sulfamethoxazole 93 119 oxytetracycline 31 penicillin g 20 ofloxacin 33 and cefexime 120 were obtained at ph 5 8 7 with ps uvc however some studies present in the literature are in contrast with this theory in these cases the highest degradation efficiency was obtained for ph 7 for example the highest degradation efficiency of sulfamethoxazole 93 metronidazole 32 sulfamerazine sulfamethizole sulfachloropyridazine 92 and tetracycline 95 were obtained at ph between 7 5 and 11 they have a different result in comparison with previous studies from these studies it appears that each system based on uv ps has different performance at different phs and it has been proved that the characteristics of the pollutant and its decomposition mechanism are probably responsible for this difference 115 3 1 2 effect of ph on activation method by heat in this method the optimal ph is between 5 and 7 because at ph 7 the activation is focused on formation of so4 it should be noted that at certain temperatures ph also affects the conversion of so4 to oh it has been reported that so4 at ph 7 so4 and oh at ph 9 and oh at ph 12 predominate 115 the type and rate of the produced radicals are among the important effects of ph changes on aops at neutral ph the so4 radicals are dominant at ph 9 both so4 and oh radicals are presented and in ph 12 the oh radical is dominant when ps is used as an oxidizer according to eq 9 in addition to so4 oh radical is also generated so the degradation efficiency of antibiotics is reduced at high ph eq 19 due to the reaction of so4 radical by oh that conduces to higher consumption of so4 and subsequently degradation efficiency in addition reactions in eqs 20 and 21 also occur in the presence of oh at ph 9 and 11 respectively the reaction of oh with oh can conduce to a quick loss of oh in an alkaline solution in alkaline conditions the redox potential of oh decreases about 2 0v and leading to the drop in the oxidation potential of oh so the degradation efficiency in alkaline conditions would be less than that in acidic and neutral conditions 121 19 so4 oh so4 2 oh 20 oh s2o8 2 oh s2o8 21 oh oh h2o2 similar to these studies the highest degradation efficiency of fluconazole 38 enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin 39 penicillin g 37 chloramphenicol 36 sulfamethazin 40 tetracycline 42 and triclosan 41 was obtained in ph 3 to 7 8 respectively 3 1 3 effect of ph on activation method by ultrasound naseeri et al surveyed the effect of ph on degradation of tetracycline by using peroxydisulfate activated by ultrasound irradiation the tetracycline degradation efficiencies in ph 4 7 and 10 on batch mode by using an ultrasonic bath with ultrasound power 500w 35 khz were obtained 77 35 62 46 and 88 51 respectively the pka values of tetracycline are 3 3 7 7 and 9 7 in addition it is an amphoteric molecule so the molecules of tetracycline had a positive charge and they are neutral at ph 4 on the other hand at ph 9 they had negative charge tetracycline molecules with negative charge cause reactive species like oh due to high electrical density on the ring system that accelerated degradation of tetracycline 52 yin et al used ultrasound irradiation for activation of pms in different ranges of ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 to degrade sulfamethazine the studies revealed that at ph 5 7 9 and 11 a 99 degradation was obtained while at ph 3 the removal efficiency was decreased to 90 at ph lower than 5 h act as a scavenger for hydroxyl and so4 which explains the reported decrease in degradation efficiency on the other hand in basic ph the presence of oh can activate pms and subsequently the removal efficiency has increased 55 3 1 4 effect of ph on activation method by transition metals the effect of ph on s aops based on transition metals activation of ps was studied in several papers the authors proved the importance of ph optimization cobalt oxide is known as an effective activator in s aops at high ph cobalt oxides convert to cobalt hydroxide complexes which reduces its catalytic activity in addition ph also effects the surface charge of metal oxide which effectively affects the activation function of metal oxides y 122 y 123 in the process of ps activation with iron ph has a direct effect on the type and state of iron required by the ps and it is also effective in determining the dominant type of formed radicals 117 at ph 4 fe2 ions are converted to fe3 which has low ability to activate ps and generate so4 with increasing ph the fe3 ions are converted to ferric hydroxide which results in absence of cations as well as increases the production of sludge also with increasing ph iron precipitates as colloidal feoh according to eq 22 124 that is unable to participate in the activation of ps 22 fe2 h2o feoh h by increasing ph 9 species of oxyhydroxylperic acid fe oh 3 fe oh 4 feoh3 and fe2 oh 3 4 are produced this type of iron species has very low ability to activate ps 125 also by changing the ph to alkaline the product of ps activation with fe2 which is so4 can change and lead the reaction to the production of oh 116 the reason for this decrease was that at high ph so4 and oh react with each other in which case the efficiency of the process decreases so that the oxidation system becomes vacant of radicals according to eq 23 49 23 so4 oh h so4 2 1 2o2 feng et al showed that at the optimized ph 6 8 a total degradation of sulfamethoxazole was obtained 100 by using cu2o for activated pms while by activated pms by α fe2o3 under similar conditions the removal efficiency was obtained less than 20 97 deng et al also showed that the highest 100 degradation efficacy in respect to chloramphenicol degradation was obtained at neutral ph 98 in another study feng et al used cufeo2 rhombohedral crystal catalyzed pms for degradation of sulfadiazine and showed the sulfadiazine degradation efficiency was obtained about 100 at ph 8 5 on the other hand by reducing the ph to 4 and 5 acidic conditions the degradation efficiency was decreased when ph is in the range of 4 8 5 due to pka values of pms pka1 0 and pka2 9 4 therefore pms is present as hso 5 the inhibitory effect of h could be described by the effect of stabilizing h on hso5 99 additional information about ph effects on persulfates can be found in supp info section s9 3 2 effect of antibiotic concentration the initial concentration of antibiotics also has a significant impact on the performance of aops with ps and pms 17 in all the studies with increasing the concentration of antibiotics the decomposition efficiency decreases because with increasing antibiotic concentration the proportion of oh to pollutant decreases in addition the tendency of intermediate compounds for consume of oh increases too 126 also due to the short life of the produced free radicals such as so4 and oh which are about 4 s and 20 ns respectively they may react with the intermediate compounds immediately after production and before reacting with the contaminant for this reason lower concentrations of antibiotics lead to fewer intermediates hence the removal rate increases while the decomposition efficiency decreases with increasing antibiotic concentration where more intermediates are formed 127 128 3 3 effect of persulfate and peroxymonosolfate concentration in all activation methods by increasing the concentration of ps and pms the production of so4 increases and leads to an increase in removal efficiency however as the concentration increases further the removal efficiency is constant and sometimes decreases this reduction in efficiency is due to the high concentration of oxidants in the environment which acts as a radical scavenger and reduces so4 and oh in the environment according to eqs 24 and 25 high concentration of ps acts as a radical scavenger of so4 and also the excessive concentration of so4 can lead to so4 consumption 129 130 24 so4 s2o8 2 so2 2 s2o8 25 so4 so4 s2o8 2 in the process of ps and pms activation by uv heat ultrasounds and transition metals some studies reported data also confirming the scavenging effect of higher concentrations of oxidants similarly to these studies it was showed that by increasing the concentration of ps and pms to some extent the removal efficiency of tetracycline 52 sulfamethazine 92 ampicillin 8 penicillin g 37 cefixime 120 chloramphenicol 36 and metronidazole 32 were increased and with increasing oxidant to excessive concentration due to the production of radical scavengers the removal efficiency decreases naseri et al degraded tetracycline by using us pms and concluded that by increasing the concentration of s2o8 2 from 1 mm to 4 mm under the optimal conditions alkaline ph and 120min the degradation efficiency of tetracycline increased from 55 76 to 88 51 due to the production of more so4 but with increasing the concentration more than 4 mm the removal efficiency did not increase significantly in this study concentrations higher than 6 mm were not investigated to determine however by increasing s2o8 2 too much the possibility of sulfate anions being formed without the production of so4 increases 52 fan et al survey the effect of heat ps for degradation of sulfamethazine in this study with increasing the concentration of ps kobs of sulfamethazine increased significantly and also the half life of sulfamethazine decreased with increasing the concentration of ps from 0 25 mm to 0 4 mm from 258 to 27min respectively so with increasing ps concentration the removal efficiency increases in this study the effect of more than 4 mm of oxidant and also its excessive effect as a radical scavenger were not investigated also the effect of excessive oxidant concentration which acts as a radical scavenger has not been investigated 40 frontistis et al investigated the degradation of antibiotic ampicillin on boron doped diamond anode using the combined electrochemical oxidation sodium ps process and observed that by increasing the concentration of ps from 100mgl 1 to 500mgl 1 the ampicillin removal efficiency increased according eqs 26 28 so4 on the cathode can be electrogenerated while anodic oxidation of sulfate ions produces ps ps can also react with oh at the anode surface to produce excess so4 131 26 s2o8 2 e so4 so4 2 27 2so4 2 s2o8 2 2e 28 s2o8 2 oh hso4 so4 0 5o2 previously some researchers suggested a non radical pathway to increase the efficiency of combining bdd with ps according to this method the non radical electro activation of ps is similar to carbon catalysts activating ps ps should be used with caution as it may increase treatment costs and sulfate anions at concentrations above 250mgl 1 are considered as contaminants according to the who 132 since the removal efficiency at concentrations of 250mgl 1 and 500mgl 1 was not much different for the reason mentioned above the optimal concentration was determined to be 250mgl 1 in this study the effect of scavengers was not investigated 8 norzaee et al used heat ps for degradation of penicillin g concluding that increasing the ps concentration from 0 05 mm to 0 1 mm increased the removal efficiency of penicillin g to 97 25 in 75min on the other hand when the concentration was further increased above 0 1 mm the removal efficiency was significantly decreased ps acted as a scavenger of so4 and also it was found that excessive increase of so4 may lead to termination of other sulfate radicals molecules therefore excessive presence of ps leads to a decrease in the removal efficiency of penicillin g 121 khazaei et al used the uv pms method to remove cefixime in this approach with increasing the concentration of pms the removal efficiency of the antibiotic increased but with its increase to more than 1 37 mm the removal efficiency decreased 3 4 effect of scavengers there are many ions present in real conditions in aqueous media that can have different effects on so4 and oh resulting from the activation of ps and pms chloride ion is a major ion in water sources experimental findings show that the presence of chloride ion can decrease or sometimes increase the removal efficiency of some contaminants chloride ions react with so4 to produce chloride radicals which reduce so4 in addition other secondary radicals such as dichloride radicals can be generated due to the reaction of the chloride radical with the chloride ion according to eqs 29 31 133 29 cl so4 so4 2 cl 30 cl cl cl2 31 cl oh cl oh carbonate bicarbonate sulfate nitrate and nitrite ions have a negative effect on so4 and oh because these ions can suppress so4 and oh among these anions the sulfate ion can not only suppress radicals but can also chelate metal oxide phosphate has a stronger inhibition effect on the removal of organic pollutants by so4 and oh comparing to other anions 134 interestingly chloride bicarbonate carbonate and hydrogen phosphate can effectively activate pms but not ps in addition the activation performance increases with increasing concentration of chloride bicarbonate and hydrogen phosphate and decreases with increasing concentration of carbonate natural organic matter has been shown to have a negative effect on the removal of organic pollutants by ps and pms activated methods it has also been shown that the negative effect has a link with ph of the solution 135 in the case of heterogeneous catalytic systems at low ph the natural organic matter scavenged the positive holes on the surface of the catalyst while at the high ph the natural organic compounds mainly scavenged the radicals some components of natural organic matter such as hydroquinones quinones and phenols can effectively activate pms in general the negative impact of wastewater compounds caused by ubiquitous anions is mainly due to the action of inhibiting anions to radicals the positive effects of chloride bicarbonate carbonate and hydrogen phosphate are mainly due to the formation of chlorine and carbonate radicals 136 in the case of chlorine the positive effect can be explained by two reasons one is that chlorine radicals are formed because the reaction between chlorine and so4 and oh can react with pollutants the second reason is that chlorine radicals react mainly with water to form so4 and oh which can further reduce pollutants 137 for carbonate a positive effect occurs only when the carbonate concentration is much higher comparing to the concentration of ps or pms in this case so4 and oh can be completely converted to carbonate radicals which can further degrade some organic pollutants it should be noted that chloride and nitrate radicals lead to the production of chlorinated by products and nitrated by products which could pose a potential risk to the environment and human health 115 norzaee et al used the heat ps method for removing penicillin g and investigated the effect of chloride and carbonate as radical scavengers the degradation efficiency of penicillin g in the presence of radical scavengers was reduced according to the results at 75min contact time with the addition of chloride and carbonate anions the removal efficiency decreased from 98 to 73 40 and 60 74 respectively 37 possible reactions that occur in the presence of radical mineral scavengers are shown in eq 32 33 138 32 co3 2 so4 co3 so4 2 33 co3 2 oh co3 oh according to eqs 29 31 chloride ions can form various radicals by reacting with reactive species according to eq 29 low concentrations of chloride may cause reduce the recombination frequency of so4 to sulfate ions because cl can consume activated so4 and thus increase the concentration of so4 2 in solution 139 however at very high concentrations of chloride so4 turn into chlorine less reactive species such as cl2 and this condition reduces the decomposition efficiency carbonate anion can inactivate so4 and oh carbonate anion can act as a scavenger of so4 and oh and produce carbonate radicals co3 according to eqs 32 and 33 so pre treatment of wastewater can be effective in removing or reducing radical scavengers 40 nasseri et al studied the effect of humic acid on the decomposition process of tetracycline and concluded that humic acid at low concentrations 5mgl 1 increases the rate of tetracycline degradation while increasing the concentration of humic acid to 10 20mgl 1 has a negative effect on the decomposition of tetracycline addition of 10 20 mgl 1 of humic acids reduced the degradation efficiency of tetracycline from 88 51 to 78 92 and 64 65 respectively 52 these results indicate that humic acid consumes so4 and oh faster than tetracycline humic acids act as a oh at low concentrations but act as a strong radical scavenger at high concentrations while by adding an excess of s2o8 the negative effect of ha was omitted 140 khazaei et al reported that for uv pms process for degradation of cefeximen scavengers have reduced the decomposition efficiency from 95 removal to 85 in case of carbonates presence while lowest efficiency related to the presence of chloride ions 75 was reported thus luckily the effect of scavengers was not so high 3 5 effects of water matrix aqueous environments contain different organic compounds as well as mineral anions and the concentration of these compounds is different in surface and underground waters which can interfere with s aops these matrix components can react with active species formed intentionally in treatment system to degrade target pollutant 141 obviously in such cases the effectiveness of treatment process will be lowered or higher dose of oxidant will be needed depending on dominant mechanism of degradation process co existing ions and natural organic matter nom have different effects on persulfate based and peroxymonosulfate based systems 84 142 143 table 12 summarizes the effects of the water matrix on the removal of antibiotics by s aops which are discussed in following paragraphs 3 5 1 coexisting anions in general on the basis of available literature it can be concluded that the coexisting anions have a stonger effect on the free radical pathway than the nonradical pathway however depending on applied system of persulfates activation cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 can have different effects on the degradation of antibiotics in s aops processes 156 3 5 2 effect of chloride ions in the process of chloramphenicol degradation by persulfate uv increasing the chlorine ion concentration from 1 mm to 10 mm the kobs value also increased from 3 13 0 11 10 2 to 4 02 0 24 10 2 min 1 and as a result the removal efficiency increased due to the increase in the oxidative power of the reactive medium after producing cl in another study tan et al showed that in the ps uv method of chloramphenicol decomposition in the presence of cl with a concentration of 1 10 mm the removal efficiency increased and on the other hand at a concentration higher than 10 mm the kobs value decreased to 1 5 0 05 10 2 min 1 but increasing the chlorine ion concentration to 100 mm increased the kobs value to 2 22 0 090 10 2 min 1 which indicates that cl can play an additional role in the presence of high density of cl as well as cl2 ered 1 2 2 09 v where chloramphenicol radical reactions become more important than radical radical quenching reactions comparison of ered 1 2 for studied system revealed that such conditions can have a positive effect on the ps uv process in the degradation of antibiotics in brackish water with high cl concentration 14 140 mm on the other hand at higher concentrations cl can scavenge sulfate and hydroxyl radicals and reduce their degradation efficiency according to eqs 34 39 81 34 so4 cl so4 2 cl 35 cl cl cl2 36 cl2 cl2 2cl cl2 37 cl cl cl2 38 cl hso 5 so4 2 hocl 39 2cl hso 5 h so4 2 cl2 h2o importantly in case of tetracycline degradation by uv ps addition of cl decreased only slightly from 96 06 to 95 26 zhang et al on the other hand presence of br doubled the degradation rate of tetracycline which indicated that bromine improves the degradation of tetracycline it was also found that in the presence of 5 8 μm of br br e0 2 00 v and br 2 e0 1 63 v are produced with a concentration of 1 2 times higher than sulfate radicals which can increase the efficiency of tetracycline 27 sulfamethoxazole 157 and ofloxacin 158 degradation in the uv ps system interestingly frontistis et al reported that in case of ps transition metal system presence of chlorides up to 151 mg l increases the degradation rate of ampicillin three times while no significant effect was observed with the increase of chloride ion to 303 mg l 159 3 5 3 effect of bicarbonates bicarbonates revealed to have ambivalent effect on persulfate beased systems for degradation of chloramphenicol with ps uv with increasing the concentration of bicarbonate from 1 to 100 mm a 50 decrease in kobs was observed 152 it follows from the fact that the reaction of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals with bicarbonate and the production of co3 with relatively less oxidative properties than the original radicals 156 in contrast the positive effect of bicarbonate in degradation of sulfamethoxazole by ps heat was also reported with increasing bicarbonate concentration from 0 to 20 mm the degradation rate was increased the reason is that hco3 co3 can react with electron rich compounds such as anilines with a relatively high rate constant 108 m 1s 1 and sulfamethoxazole has an aniline moiety as well in other study the degradation of oxytetracycline was enhanced by increasing bicarbonate from 0 to 20 mm by forming co3 according to eq 40 degradation of pollutants 150 40 so4 hco3 so4 2 co3 h k 9 1 106m 1s 1 3 5 4 effect of sulfates sulfate anions have generally a positive effect in persulfate based systems for example degradation of chloramphenicol with uv ps process was aided by addition of sulfates in concentration range of 12 48 mg l where kobs rate increased by 35 and 39 above this concentration range 96 mg l sulfates caused decrease of rate constant by 31 the rate constant of the quenching reaction of so4 with s2o8 2 is almost 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of so4 with an organic compounds containing atoms of low ionization energy accordingly the uv ps process can be a good method for the treatment of underground water and some special effluents contaminated with pharmaceutical substances even in the presence of nitrate 10 10 mgl 1 and sulfate 0 125 1 0 mm in the natural concentration s range 152 3 5 5 effect of nitrite anions for degradation of chloramphenicol with uv ps process ghauch et al shown that the presence of nitrite at a concentration of 0 5 mgl 1 does not have a significant effect on kobs less than 20 small decrease is explained mostly by quenching of sulfate radicals by nitrite which is not as strong oxidizing agent for chloramphenicol degradation ered 1 2 1 02 v however nitrate in concentrations 10 mgl 1 caused a significant improvement of kobs up to 37 but at concentrations of 2 5 and 50 mg l a decrease of 9 and 37 was observed in kobs respectively a two hypotheses explaining this behavior were proposed first that the sulfate radicals react with nitrate to produce no3 radicals with a relatively strong oxidizing potential ered 1 2 2 5 v second that nitrate becomes a source of nitrite and oxygen radicals eq 41 nitrite is not an oxidizer of chloramphenicol while o can increase the oxidization of chloramphenicol by reacting with water to produce ho eq 42 which is responsible for further degradation of chloramphenicol 139 152 41 no3 uv no2 o 42 o h2o ho oh zhao et al studying a pms magnetic γ fe2o3 mno2 system for the degradation of ciprofloxacin concluded that by adding cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 ions up to 1 mm didn t significantly lowered the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin the low effect of these ions on the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin by the visible light pms γ fe2o3 mno2 method indicates the high selectivity of the this coupled system 144 on the other hand it must be taken into account that this system was evaluated only under low concentration of anions conditions 3 5 6 natural organic matter nom natural organic matter nom contains a mixture of weak organic acids and organic compounds of unknown structure that are commonly found in water and wastewater humic acid ha formic acid fa and fulvic acids are important components of nom which make up 60 of water soluble organic matter ha contains a large number of carboxyl phenolic and hydroxyl alkyl functional groups that can interact with the functional groups of the catalyst surface or organic compounds 160 in case of abovementioned system based on visible light γ fe2o3 mno2 pms zhao et al confirmed negative effect of nom on the removal of ciprofloxacin this sytem was effective degradation 90 for nom concentrations up to 2 mg l while above this value degradation consequently decreased to 72 1 for nom concentration of 6 mg l in case of sulfamethazine degradation using a simpler thermal activation of ps it was reported that nom had inhibitive effect above 10 mg l 147 the decrease in ciprofloxacin removal efficiency can be explained relating to three aspects first the negatively charged ha binds to the positively charged ciprofloxacin and prevents it from moving towards the catalyst surface second ha attenuates the light and reduces the number of photons on the catalyst surface and in the third case ha traps oxygen carrying radicals 144 in another study ghauch et al concluded that ha in concentrations of 5 and 20 mgl 1reduces the rate of kobs to 35 and 63 however in a low concentration 0 5 mgl 1 the effect is neglected importantly it was highlighted that fa has a greater effect on reducing the rate of kobs so by increasing the concentration of fa from 12 to 582 mgl 1 the kobs rate decreased from 29 to even 86 respectively this significant decrease in kobs is attributed to the smaller size of fa molecules as well as its higher oxygen content compared to ha which makes them more effective to quenching of so4 in addition ha and fa act as internal filter effect which absorb well in the 254 nm range and thus reduce the amount of sulfate radicals that are produced by uv and on the other hand they have electron rich sites which are prone to absorb sulfate and hydroxyl electrophilic radicals therefore in the presence of ha and fa the efficiency of chloramphenicol degradation by uv ps method decreases 152 in other study tetracycline degradation was partially inhibited in presence of ha at concentrations exceeding 10 mgl 1 52 importantly in case of oxytetracycline degradation the negative effect of ha was observed even at 3mgl 1 level 150 in overall it can be concluded that systems based on formation of singlet oxygen are not negatively affected by presence of inorganic anions and what is advantageous in most of reported cases the effect of inorganic anions was positive such situation was observed for sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine tetracycline penicillin g this observation is particularly important for real case scenarios with high salinity effluents correct reports suggests that persulfate systems able to form singlet oxygen should be effective for treatment of this type of sewages in case of systems based on radical degradation pathway such a generalization is not possible it seems that several systems are effective in case of low concentration of anions while high concentrations strongly decrease the degradation however observed effects depend of type of anion for instance for chlorides presence a partially positive effect was reported for norfloxacin and chloramphenicol and for most of antibiotics effect was negative also for carbonates positive effect was reported for norfloxacin oxytetracycline while for most of reviewed pollutants it was negative different effect depending on compound was also reported for nitrates and sulfates reported positive effects of anions on mentioned antibiotics results from reactivity of these compounds with formed by reaction od hydroxyl or sulfate radicals with anions secondary radical species making their contribution in degradation process this proved importance of studies of matrix effects on effectiveness of developed processes on the other hand it is known that secondary radicals despite improvement of degradation of main pollutant can cause formation of secondary pollutants like cl or no2 containing derivatives with higher toxicity than primary pollutant 34 161 this aspect should be also considered in future studies in respect to catalytic systems the evaluation of risks on by product formation should include studies of sorption of these compounds on catalyst surface 3 6 mechanisms of degradation compared to conventional aop methods that rely exclusively on hydroxyl radicals s aop involves much more complex oxidation pathways which differ depending on water compositions and types of activators used although sulfate and hydroxyl radicals can decompose various types of organic compounds however the pollutant degradation mechanism is significantly different depending on the free radical and the nature of the pollutant the mechanism of degradation of organic pollutants by sulfate radicals usually includes electron transfer while hydroxyl radicals also include hydrogen atom abstraction reactions in addition to electron transfer 57 162 in the path of electron transfer this process generally takes place through two mechanisms the bridged and outer space mechanisms the bridged mechanism has a slow electron transfer rate because it requires the formation of a transition bond while no bond formation is required for the outer space mechanism 163 164 the degradation and decomposition of organic pollutants by sulfate and hydroxyl radicals include different mechanisms so4 participates mainly in outer space mechanism for electron transfer reaction while oh undergoes reaction via bridge mechanism c c c n c s addition and h abstraction reactions for degradation of organic pollutants 165 the mechanisms of antibiotic degradation are compared in table 13 in the process of chloramphenicol cap decomposition by ps uv ghauch et al proposed that chloramphenicol molecules first undergo the following processes 1 direct photolysis 2 abstraction of hydrogen by hydroxyl radicals that are created directly by water splitting or indirectly by the reaction of sulfate radicals with water 3 electron abstraction which occurs mainly on the nitrobenzene ring via sulfate radicals to produce the corresponding unstable cap and in the next step hydroxylated cap and unstable cap undergo oxidation to produce further hydroxylated cap and sulfonated hydroxylated cap finally intermediates produced through direct photolysis are oxidized by sulfate or hydroxyl radicals and are converted into smaller molecules as a result it can be said that in this process chloramphenicol is degraded by direct photolysis hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer 152 zhang et al showed that the main degradation pathway of tetracycline by uv ps process was via functional group shedding and ring opening reactions taking place sequentially by sulfate and hydroxyl radicals in this study the degradation of tetracycline molecules in deionized water was divided into three paths first so4 selectively reacted with electron rich groups amide group tertiary amine group hydroxyl group and double bond and oh showed high activity for olefin double bond in the first pathway the tertiary amine groups of tc then hydroxyl methyl and formamide were destroyed and after the ring opening and substitution reactions some intermediate products were produced in the second pathway the cycloaddition of oh it occurred through the loss of formamide and methyl groups followed by a series of ring opening and replacement reactions to produce other intermediate compounds in the third pathway the removal of carboxamide and the third amine group from tetracycline molecules and the production of intermediate products occurred and finally by using cycloaddition of oh and dimethylation reaction the intermediate products were converted into small molecular products among the three degradation pathways the electron withdrawing groups such as carbonyl and carboxyl were not easily directly attacked but were continuously degraded by the gradual opening of the ring structure of tetracycline molecules 27 in the degradation process of sulfadiazine by us fe0 ps process two degradation pathways were proposed in first the sulfate radicals caused the oxidation of the amine group and produced nitro sd derivatives and then by attacking the nitro sd derivatives the ring opening of the heterocyclic ring took place in the second path of degradation sulfate radicals caused direct oxidative cleavage of the s n bond the results of the ion chromatography tests revealed that formic acid acetic acid and some inorganic ions were the final products of sulfadiazine decomposition 51 3 7 kinetics the oxidation process of antibiotics by ps and pms generally follows the pseudo first order kinetic model 170 various operating factors such as ph temperature oxidant concentration antibiotic concentration and the presence of water matrix affect the rate constant 171 for all kinetic experiments under different conditions the degradation of antibiotics is fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic equation eq 43 43 ln c0 ct kobs t where c0 and ct are the molar concentrations of antibiotic at the time 0 and reaction time t respectively kobs is the pseudo first order constant min 1 table 14 compare the kinetics of degradation of antibiotics with different activation methods beside general conclusions pointed out at the end of this paragraph some researchers formed useful observations for instance fan et al confirmed a general rule about positive influence of increased temperature on rate constant value in case of sulfamethazine the degradation rate increased with increasing temperature in heat activated ps systems from 20 to 70 as the temperature increased from 40 c to 60 c while the value of kobs increased by 21 times 147 it follows from high sensitivity to temperature of thermally activated persulfate systems where heat as sole factor can significantly gain the performance of such systems 104 all of the research that investigated the rate constant values of antibiotics degradation by different methods of ps and pms activation concluded that with increasing oxidant concentration to some extent the kobs also increases for instance by studying the degradation of oxytetracycline by uv ps process and investigating the reaction kinetics liu et al concluded that the destruction of oxytetracycline follows pseudo first order kinetics so that with the increase of persulfate concentration up to 1 mm it seems that kobs was proportional to the linear regression slope of 0 0214 cm2mj 1mm 1 r2 0 99 and with the increase of ps concentration a non linear increase was observed which is due to the self scavenging effect of ps and the recombination of sulfate radicals 150 zhang et al by examining the kinetics of tetracycline degradation by uv ps method concluded that with increasing persulfate concentration from 0 to 30 mgl 1 the degradation rate constant increased from 0 008 to 0 1 min 1 and the removal efficiency reached 95 73 while increasing the concentration to 40 and 50 mgl 1 the degradation of tetracycline did not improve because the excess persulfate acted as a scavenger and reacted with sulfate radicals reducing the rate constant and thus the removal efficiency 27 in overall according to compared results it can be stated that rate constant under optimized conditions is strongly dependent of structure of target pollutant there is no clear relation between the used excess of oxidant or type of radical species with rate constant order of magnitude 27 55 98 144 147 152 170 175 for example tetracycline degradation rate constant in a two strongly different oxidation systems was in the range of 0 1 0 21 min 1 while for chloramphenicol it was in the range of 0 036 0079 min 1 typically rate constant values seem to be in range of 0 05 0 2 min 1 4 conclusion because the reaction rate of ps and pms is slow when directly reacting with the contaminants activation of ps and pms is essential for the treatment of organic contaminants different types of activation methods for ps and pms were reviewed and compared exclusively in terms of process ph contact time initial concentration of antibiotic and concentration of oxidant this analysis revealed that the optimal ph in the s aop process depends on the method of activation of oxidant so it has to be optimized for every new type of catalyst the decomposition efficiency of antibiotics by all methods for activating ps and pms increases with increasing contact time generally more than 30min is required for most published processes to obtain final degradation over 90 in all the studies with increasing the concentration of antibiotics the decomposition efficiency as it lowers the ratio of radial species to radical species at fixed dose of oxidant as well as due to presence of secondary pollutants also reacting with radicals this aspect clearly shows the need of process optimization using a molar ratio of oxidant to pollutant rox as one of parameters therefore the highest degradation efficiency of antibiotics was obtained for studies with the lowest concentration of antibiotics in fact these results are promising as the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is mostly at ppb level thus studies of ppm level are not proving their usefulness in all activation methods by increasing the concentration of ps and pms the production of so4 increases and leads to improved removal efficiency however as the concentration increases further the removal efficiency is constant and sometimes decreases this reduction in efficiency is due to the high concentration of oxidants in the environment which acts as a radical scavenger and reduces so4 and oh in the environment typically scavenging effect was observed above 0 7 mm of the ps and 2 mm of pms aops based on ps and pms have been widely studied as an efficient and effective method for degrading various kinds of organic pollutants especially antibiotics and aid in environmental restoration complete degradation of organic pollutants is possible by using ps and pms chloramphenicol oxytetracycline sulfamethazine tetracycline sulfamonomethoxine were effectively degraded by ps based processes while sulfamethazine ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole chloramphenicol and sulfadiazine were completely degraded by pms thus it can be said that for certain compounds both ps and pms were highly effective on the other hand the degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride enrofloxacin fluconazole and norfloxacin by using ps and pms was not so effective degradation below 90 was reported thus further developments should focus on effective degradation via s aops of these persistent types of molecules instead of proving effectiveness to pharmaceuticals that were already degraded via s aops however the optimal operating conditions for cost effective and fast decomposition in real systems still need to be reconsidered in addition the presence of excess sulfate ions can have adverse effects on the environment therefore it is necessary to study the effects and methods of sulfate reduction finally a proper activation method should be developed despite the scientific value of papers relating to very sophisticated catalysts which preparation sounds more like jewelry art their applicability in routine applications seems to be very limited it follows from several stages of preparation often off green chemistry approach as well as high costs finally their management at the waste stage is not addressed on the other hand processes developed on their basis revealed a much higher sensitivity to real matrix components such as anions or nom comparing uv based and thermally activated s aops several attempts on the application of relatively simple catalysts based on carbon type materials proved their effectiveness to degrade environmental pollutants via s aops thus future progress on s aops should strongly focus on applications of such low cost catalysts for pharmaceuticals degradation most of the studied articles lacked many important parameters such as measuring the amount of pollutant mineralization by determining the final cod or toc values most of the articles did not describe the pathway of pollutant degradation and even the intermediate products and by products were not examined secondly metals leaching from catalyst into the effluents should be always controlled therefore it is not possible to decide on the safety of many already developed methods declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

8733,the public water system management in mexico has recently been criticized due to severe problems with the availability of drinkable water significant differences exist between mexican regions regarding the availability of renewable water and water system distribution moreover water governance in the country is inefficient due to the lack of transparency in the water policies therefore the article aims to investigate whether there is a direct relationship between water system management efficiency and water system improvement efficiency and how the efficiency reflects the size of the population and the availability of renewable water in each state for this a two stage dea model is constructed to evaluate the water system management efficiency in mexico the results indicate high average water management efficiency but very low efficiency in the water system improvements furthermore immense differences in the water system efficiency can be observed with respect to the characteristics and adopted policies keywords data envelopment analysis efficiency analysis investment technology water system management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the territory of mexico is 1964 million square kilometers km2 of which 1959 million correspond to the continental surface and the rest to the island areas due to its geographical location two thirds of the territory is considered arid or semi arid with annual rainfall less than 500 mm while one third the southeast is humid with annual rainfall exceeding 2000 mm per year in most of mexico the rain is more intense in summer mainly torrential based on data from the 2015 intercensal survey of inegi 1 74 metropolitan areas mas were defined fig 1 for which applying the projections of mexico s national population council 2 a population of 78 29 million inhabitants was estimated to 2018 which constitute 62 76 of the projected population for that year thirty seven mas have more than 500 000 inhabitants representing 67 77 million people and 54 33 of the national population the process of concentration of inhabitants in urban localities has accelerated its growth 3 which implies strong pressures on the environment given the increase in demand for services the national water commission conagua as the administrative regulatory technical and advisory body responsible for water management in mexico performs its functions through 13 river basin organizations table 1 whose area of competence is the hydrological administrative regions har hars are formed by groupings of basins considered basic units for the management of water resources 3 population renewable water rw and gdp show significant regional variations the southeast regions har v x xi and xii account for 67 of the country s renewable water with 20 of the population contributing 20 of the national gdp northern har vi vii ix central har iv vi vii xiii and north western regions har i ii iii comprise 33 of the country s renewable water resources around 10 of the population and a regional contribution to the national gdp between 10 and 14 considering the renewable water per capita the available water in the southeastern regions is seven times greater than that available in the rest of the hydrological administrative regions of our country 2 4 5 table 6 this disproportion between regions causes different demands on water resource management the percentage of water used for human consumption in relation to renewable water is an indicator of the degree of stress exerted on the water resource of a country basin or region 3 the degree of stress can be very high high medium low and stress free where a percentage greater than 40 represents a high or very high degree of stress at the national level mexico experiences a stress level of 19 7 5 which is considered low however the country s central northern and north western areas experience high stress table 2 regarding the coverage of piped water services in 2015 the national coverage of access to piped water was 95 3 97 8 urban 87 0 rural while the national coverage of piped water in housing or land was 94 4 97 2 urban 85 0 rural 1 changes in coverage rates should be seen in the context of population growth and urban concentration 2 literature review 2 1 water system productivity analysis water management water management refers to activities directly related to the control of resources material financial or human such as monitoring analysis planning construction and maintenance 6 the urban water sector is a complex system resulting in low sustainability problems poor resource management and different stakeholders needs that is why it is important to use transdisciplinary processes to mitigate conflicts in decision making goals 7 many quantitative and statistical methods exist to evaluate efficiency and performance for the benchmarking techniques frontier analysis has become the most noteworthy approach the non parametric approach based on data envelopment analysis dea is the most used method to assess efficiency and productivity 8 9 with a comprehensive number of successful applications in various industries for example alda and dammert 10 investigated the police performance of 619 peruvian municipalities considering the environmental aspects in which police operate avilés sacoto et al 11 used dea to evaluate the environmental performance of 32 states in mexico flegl et al 12 applied dea to observe the production and investment efficiency in the mexican food industry linh le et al 13 investigated the environmental efficiency of the agricultural sector in east asian countries for the period from 2002 to 2010 vikas and bansal 14 evaluated efficiency of 22 indian oil and gas sector during 2013 2017 period among others data envelopment analysis has also been widely used to evaluate the technical efficiency in the water and sewerage or sanitization sector the efficiency in water resource management is understood as a balance between water use and supply so that water resources are not threatened by excessive extraction in the future 15 in this case the dea analyses operated with diverse objectives first many analyses focus on water and sewerage companies efficiency for example barbosa et al 16 analyzed 12 private and 30 mixed capital water and sewerage companies in brazil using a balanced panel data from 2005 to 2013 the objective of the analysis was to investigate the efficiency of water and sewerage companies and explain the governance ownership and regulation effect molinos senante et al 17 assessed the production efficiency of the chilean full private and concessionary water companies from 2007 to 2015 using the malmquist index maziotis et al 18 calculated the productivity of 22 english and welsh water companies providing drinking water services from 2001 to 2008 walker et al 19 used a double bootstrap dea model to evaluate the economic and environmental efficiency of 13 water and sewage companies in the uk and ireland second the dea analyses investigate the efficiency from a regional point of view for example chopra and ramachandran 20 used a set of 20 multidimensional factors to develop a multidimensional index to quantify the water sector performance in 11 states in india hu et al 21 applied dea to analyze water use and wastewater treatment in 10 cities located on the minjiang river in china jie et al 22 evaluated the industrial environmental efficiency in 30 chinese provinces using a two stage dea analysis liu and fukushige 23 measured the efficiency of the water supply and sewerage sector in japan to investigate the relationship between efficiency and price setting pan et al 24 analyzed the water use efficiency in 17 cities in shandong province in china between 2006 and 2015 applying the super efficiency dea method tourinho et al 25 assessed water supply and sanitation services performance in 448 brazilian municipalities to explore regional differences and the impact of the used governance models and yang et al 26 measured the efficiencies of 30 regional industrial water systems in china during 2008 2014 using dynamic interactive network model in mexico few dea applications can be found ablanedo rosas et al 27 estimated the operational efficiency of 36 major organizations responsible for supplying potable water in the country salazar adams 28 studied the efficiency of 359 mexican water utilities to value the effect of management and reform policies andwandter and ozuna 29 applied dea to measure the operational efficiency of water utilities to assess the link between private ownership and efficiency 2 2 water resource management performance variables the selection of the variables depends primarily on the objective of each analysis the majority of the studies included variables related to the management resources such as invested capital 18 23 24 operational expenditures 18 19 22 chemical treatment 22 personnel 22 30 access to safe drinking water and sanitization 20 21 24 or the water system size 17 19 25 on the other hand the outputs commonly referred to billing incomes 16 water quality 20 water production 17 18 30 and used chemicals and water treatment 19 21 22 among others table 3 summarizes the dea applications for the efficiency analyses in water resource management 2 3 governance governance refers to the administrative political and institutional rules processes and practices necessary for decision making and implementation 31 due to its characteristics and according to the world water council water is a resource sensitive to governance therefore effective governance represents a prerequisite for sustainable and integrated management of water resources 32 in her nobel prize winning work elinor ostrom demonstrated that adaptive governance of natural resources water in this study is more effective in achieving beneficial change where decentralized self organizing institutions are rich in information and empowered to make decisions on collective action through dialogue and deliberation 33 for the mexican case the regional and natural water system administration limits are incompatible and it is vital to consider the inter and multisectoral coordination of those involved mexico could create its water governance model and promote the adoption and implementation of innovative water governance practices among responsible authorities 34 regulatory authorities play a crucial role in governance by supervising providers and ensuring services sustainability to foster sectors efficiency 25 35 for this water efficiency measurements should be implemented to enhance the service level provided to customers consequently improving water efficiency leads to a reduction in operating costs and a lower necessity to develop new supplies and expand water infrastructure 36 however water governance in the country is inefficient because of corruption and the lack of transparency in water policies in addition the resistance to change in how the resource is managed among the responsible authorities is an obstacle to the adoption and implementation of new practices 37 that expand and strengthen the capacities to establish clear and effective regulations and implement sound policies 38 cetrulo marques and malheiros 39 link this problem to the institutional weakness in mexico due to the limited regulatory capacities and limited fiscal efficiencies considering the lack of transparency of water policies and the resistance to change regarding the resources management and adoption of new policies in mexico the objective of the article is to analyze the efficiency of the public water system management in 32 mexican states the rest of the document is structured as follows section 2 presents the model structure used data and the method section 3 summarizes the obtained results with a detailed evaluation of the research questions and section 4 discusses the implications and limitations of the analysis while section 5 provides the final remarks 3 materials and methods 3 1 data envelopment analysis data envelopment analysis evaluates decision making units dmus regarding their multiple inputs and multiple outputs 40 each dmu has different m inputs to produce s different outputs the ccr model developed by charnes et al 41 can be used if the model assumes constant returns to scale the ccr input oriented model for d m u o is formulated as follows e max r 1 s u r y r o subjected to 1 r 1 s u r y r o i 1 m v i x i j 0 i 1 m v i x i j 1 v i ε i 1 2 m u r ε r 1 2 s where x i j is the quantity of the input i of the d m u j y r j is the amount of the output r of the d m u j u r and v i are the weights of the inputs and outputs i 1 2 m j 1 2 n r 1 2 s and ε is the non archimedean element dmu is 100 efficient if e 1 i e whereas dmu is inefficient if e 1 3 2 two stage data envelopment analysis in many cases the single stage process described in 1 may not be suitable to characterize production processes that can be divided into several sub processes in this case some products are outputs of a sub process on the one hand and the inputs of another sub process on the other hand fig 2 considering the notions presented by kao and hwang 42 we assume that each d m u j j 1 2 n has m inputs x i j i 1 2 m to the first stage and d outputs z d j d 1 2 d from that stage then these d outputs become the inputs to the second stage and are referred to as intermediate measures the outputs from the second stage are y r j r 1 2 s in this case the intermediate measures are the only inputs to the second stage of the process and there are no additional independent inputs to the second stage the efficiency in the first stage is denoted as e j 1 and in the second stage as e j 2 for each d m u j using the ccr dea model defined by charnes et al 41 we then define 2 e j 1 d 1 d w d z d j i 1 m v i x i j a n d e j 2 r 1 s u r y r j d 1 d w d z d j where v i w d w d and u r are unknown non negative weights and w d can be equal to w d the overall efficiency of the two stage process is the product of the efficiencies of the two sub processes as e e j 1 e j 2 if we consider a cooperative centralized approach as defined by kao and hwang 42 or liang et al 43 by letting w d w d in 2 the two stage model jointly determines the set of optimal weights on the intermediate factors to maximize the efficiency scores 1 1 the cooperative approach is suitable for the analysis as both stages of the two stage dea model evaluate processes of the same dmu the noncooperative approach is characterized by the leader follower stackelberg model see for example huang and li 44 where the efficiency of the second stage is determined subject to the requirements that the efficiency of the first stage is to stay fixed 28 the efficiency scores of both stages are optimized simultaneously the linear model can be defined as 3 e o max r 1 s u r y r o subjected to r 1 s u r y r j d 1 d w d z d j 0 j 1 2 n d 1 d w d z d j i 1 m v i x i j 0 j 1 2 n i 1 m v i x i o 1 w d ε d 1 2 d v i ε i 1 2 m u r ε r 1 2 s model 3 gives the overall efficiency after the overall efficiency is obtained the divisional efficiency for each stage can be calculated via the efficiency decomposition 40 we denote the optimal value to model 3 as e 0 then e 0 e 0 1 e 0 2 the maximum achievable value for e 0 1 can be determined as 4 e o 1 max d 1 d w d z d o subjected to r 1 s u r y r 0 e 0 d 1 d w d z d j i 1 m v i x i j 0 j 1 2 n r 1 s u r y r j d 1 d w d z d j 0 j 1 2 n i 1 m v i x i o 1 w d ε d 1 2 d v i ε i 1 2 m u r ε r 1 2 s it then follows the minimum of e 0 2 is given by e 0 2 e 0 e 0 1 the maximum of e 0 2 can be calculated using the following linear model as 5 e o 2 max r 1 s u r y r o subjected to r 1 s u r y r 0 e 0 i 1 m v i x i j 0 r 1 s u r y r j d 1 d w d z d j 0 j 1 2 n d 1 d w d z d j i 1 m v i x i j 0 j 1 2 n d 1 d w d z d o 1 w d ε d 1 2 d v i ε i 1 2 m u r ε r 1 2 s the minimum of e 0 1 is then calculated as e k 1 e 0 e 0 2 3 3 model structure and hypothesis if the analysis considers a two stage process evaluation these two processes usually focus on water use efficiency and wastewater treatment 21 26 the research presented in this article considers a two stage process but differs in the second stage stage 1 evaluates the water system management and stage 2 evaluates the water system improvements in each state fig 2 the objective of stage 1 is to evaluate how well each state administrates its public water system network in this case the total expenditures te and total personnel are considered as the inputs in stage 1 while water intakes wi and total revenues tr are the intermediates that enter stage 2 the objective of stage 2 is to assess the capability of each state to improve the public water system network to overtake the increasing water demand this improvement is linked to the water network extension wne pluvial drainage network extension pdne and lifting of the installed extraction capacity iec the analysis aims to investigate the following hypotheses h1 there is a direct relationship between water system management efficiency and water system improvement efficiency in this case two research questions are created r1 is there a relation between the efficiency of the water system management and the efficiency of the water system improvements or rather r2 does a low efficiency of the water system management create higher needs to improve the water system h2 the efficiency of the water system management reflects the size of the population and the availability of renewable water in each state in this case r3 does the population in each state affects the water system management efficiency r4 does the availability of renewable water in each state affects the adopted governance policies 3 4 data the analysis uses data from the national census of municipal governments and territorial demarcations of mexico city in 2019 census 45 which includes statistical and geographic information on the management and performance of the institutions that make up the public administration of each municipality with respect to the functions of government public security municipal justice drinking water and sanitation urban solid waste and the environment the methodology of the census includes information for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 where some questions are linked to the year of application 2019 and others from the year prior to the coverage 2017 however most of the data represent the year 2018 the information is related to the drinking water and sanitation data i e drinking water service from the public network water collection for public supply drinking water plants and administration the total expenditures te indicate the monetary value of the goods and services consumed in the provision of drinking water and sanitation service during the year2018 2 2 the operator of potable water drainage sewerage wastewater treatment and water reuse services of mexico city is sacmex sistema de aguas de la ciudad de méxico which operates under the authority of the country s environment ministry semarnat secretariat of environment and natural resources in mexico that is why the census does not include the information about the total expenditures and total incomes for mexico city however the published information by sacmex include similar expenditure and income chapters this variable includes consumption of electrical energy in pumping equipment in intake works for water collection consumption of chlorine chlorine gas or similar reagent used for the disinfection of water in intake works electrical energy consumption in distribution systems electricity consumption in water treatment plants physical chemical agents reagents and similar supplies used in purification plants electrical energy consumption in municipal wastewater treatment plants or sites physical chemical agents reagents and similar inputs used in municipal wastewater treatment sites or plants salaries paid rights of exploitation use or exploitation of water rights of use of receiving bodies of wastewater discharges total depreciation and other expenditures total personnel tp include the workforce employed by the public network water service in this case this variable covers managers and directors administrative and accounting employees and technical and operational employees the total number of water intakes wi summarizes the connections subject to billing under a metered service scheme this variable represents the supplied volume in m3 under a metered service scheme of household industrial commercial public and mixed water intakes 3 3 in the case of mexico city the supplied volume was extrapolated due to the missing data for this we used the information about the number of water intakes under a metered service scheme in mexico city compared to the number of water intakes and supplied volume in m3 under the same scheme in estado de méxico with respect to the total population and connected population to the water system in both states such calculation can be considered valid as mexico city and estado de méxico occupy the metropolitan zone of mexico city and are registered in the same hydrological administrative regions of waters of the valley of mexico aguas del valle de méxico table 1 total revenues tr refer to the income for the supply of drinking water and sanitation services this variable includes income from drinking water supply sale of treated water sanitation connection and sewerage rights sale of sludge water distribution through pipes other income from supply of goods and services federal state and municipal subsidies fines and surcharges and other incomes the water network extension wne refers to the extension and rehabilitation in kilometers of the water distribution network in each state similarly the pluvial drainage network extension pdne refers to the extension and rehabilitation of the pluvial drainage network in kilometers finally the installed extraction capacity iec is linked to the newly installed water treatment capacity in potability plants in each state in this case the iec variable refers to water extraction from the exploitation of underground sources such as wells and filtering galleries or surface such as rivers dams or springs for the public supply 45 data in the model were recalculated per 100 000 inhabitants therefore all the obtained results are considered per capita table 4 summarizes the variables used in the model and their descriptive statistics and table 7 presents the complete data used in the analysis finally the selected model structure satisfies the discrimination ability required for the dea models 46 4 results for all the calculations the maxdea 7 ultra software was used the model uses constant returns to scale crs as no competition between the states is considered i e each state operates with its specific resources further the output oriented model was chosen as it is desirable in stage 1 to focus on a greater supplied volume and revenues rather than cut expenses in water treatment which may affect its quality similarly stage 2 focuses on extending and enhancing the water system rather than lowering the supplied volume this also goes along with the recommendations proposed by cetrulo et al 39 for water system management evaluation in developing countries 4 1 water resources management efficiency the average efficiency in stage 1 of the analysis was 0 690 with a standard deviation of 0 235 in general stage 1 reveals a very high efficiency of the water system management in mexico table 5 more in detail chiapas chihuahua mexico city guanajuato querétaro and yucatán reached an efficiency of 1 000 whereas the lowest efficiency can be observed in tabasco 0 096 campeche 0 302 tlaxcala 0 365 and guerrero 0 378 as fig 3 shows no specific pattern regarding the water system management efficiency distribution across the country can be identified regarding stage 2 of the model the results indicate a quite different efficiency level in this case the average efficiency was 0 196 with a standard deviation of 0 348 this indicates a shallow orientation towards the improvements of the water resource management systems in mexico fig 4 displays a group of states with very high efficiency hidalgo estado de méxico san luis potosí tlaxcala and veracruz compared to the rest of the country the highly efficient states are located next to each other in the center east of the country putting the results together the average overall efficiency of the two stage model was 0 123 with a standard deviation of 0 236 this shows a very low water resource management efficiency in mexico the best evaluated states were estado de méxico 0 866 veracruz 0 757 san luis potosí 0 613 hidalgo 0 577 and tlaxcala 0 337 alarming 21 out of 31 states 65 6 reported an overall efficiency lower than 0 025 and 25 out of 32 states 78 1 were lower than 0 1 4 2 analysis of the results in this section the obtained results are analyzed with respect to the constructed hypotheses and research questions h1 there is a direct relationship between water system management efficiency and water system improvement efficiency r1 is there a relation between the efficiency of the water system management and the efficiency of the water system improvements the results obtained in stages 1 and 2 gave evidence of high variability in the efficiency both regarding the states and the stages there is no relation between stage 1 and stage 2 as the correlation is weak at 0 155 and not statistically significant fig 5 summarizes the relation between both stages of the model r2 does a low efficiency of the water system management create higher needs to improve the water system we can classify the efficiency of the water system management into four quadrants q as shown in fig 6 q1 symbolizes the country s highest efficiency in water system management the best performing state is estado de méxico with an efficiency of 0 907 in stage 1 and 0 955 in stage 2 veracruz san luis potosí and hidalgo obtained a lower efficiency in stage 1 but were 1 000 efficient in stage 2 the q2 constitutes states with very low water system efficiency but a high orientation towards the improvements in this case this quadrant consists of only one state tlaxcala whose efficiency is 0 365 in stage 1 and 0 923 in stage 2 the q3 represents states with very low efficiency in both stages more in detail we can identify two types of states in this quadrant 1 states with higher efficiency in stage 1 but efficiency close to zero in stage 2 guerrero morelos nayarit and 2 states with very low efficiency in stage 1 but higher efficiency in stage 2 tabasco finally q4 includes states with very high efficiency of the water system management stage 1 but with a lower orientation towards the improvements of the water system stage 2 the highest orientation towards the system improvements is observed in tamaulipas 0 298 and oaxaca 0 221 as seen in fig 6 the rest of the states in q4 perform below 0 120 in stage 2 and across the whole range for stage 1 from 0 540 for michoacán de ocampo to 1 000 for chiapas chihuahua mexico city guanajuato querétaro and yucatán as a result the h1 is rejected as no direct relationship was observed between water system management efficiency and water system improvement efficiency h2 the efficiency of the water system management reflects the size of the population and the availability of renewable water in each state r3 does the population in each state affects the water system management efficiency a question arises what are the drivers factors of such differences between the states regarding their water system management fig 6 shows the relationship between each state s efficiency and population first the correlation between the efficiency in stage 1 and population is 0 425 significant at the 0 05 level 2 tailed p 0 015 whereas the correlation is 0 313 considering stage 2 and population i e the correlation can be considered as moderate nevertheless the less populated states are mainly located in q2 and q3 i e in the low water system management efficiency quadrant the most populated states are in q4 and q1 with higher water system efficiency the result of estado de méxico may be surprising as it is the most populated state 17 6 million people and the best evaluated in both stages r4 does renewable water availability in each state affect the adopted governance policies further water availability in each water system management plays a crucial role as lower access to water resources may encourage the states to focus more on the improvement part of the management fig 7 shows the link between the availability of renewable water 4 4 renewable water represents the maximum amount of water that is feasible to exploit annually in a region state without altering the ecosystem and that is renewed by means of rain in this case the amount is measured as m³ habitant year in each state and the efficiencies in the water management system the average amount of renewable water in mexico is 3620 m3 habitant year but with high differences between the states see table 1 it can be observed that most of the states with the highest level of renewable water are in q3 and q4 which can explain their lower tendency toward improvements in water system management for example chiapas with 20 854 m3 and the efficiency of 0 029 in stage 2 oaxaca 13 685 m3 0 221 tabasco 13 014 m3 0 221 and yucatán 9917 m3 0 037 however these quadrants also include many states with meager availability of renewable water such as aguascalientes 401 m3 0 029 baja california 838 m3 0 014 and guanajuato 653 m3 0 014 another important case is mexico city which has the lowest availability of renewable water in the country 73 m3 and obtained one of the lowest efficiencies regarding water system improvements this contrasts with estado de méxico which reports the second lowest availability of renewable water 272 m3 but its water management works perfectly in both dea stages it is surprising as both states are in the metropolitan zone of mexico city and are registered in the same hydrological administrative regions of waters of the valley of mexico finally tlaxcala the only state in q2 reports only 652 m3 of renewable water in its territory far below the average in the country which may explain its high efficiency in stage 2 as a result a weak correlation is observed between stage 1 and the availability of renewable water 0 125 as well as considering stage 2 0 034 in both cases not statistically significant as a result h2 can be rejected as moderate and weak relation between the water system management and population as well as the availability of renewable water 5 discussion water management in a country like mexico where each state has its hydrological and managerial characteristics shows a broad efficiency range this research was designed to study by using a two stage dea model the water system management and the system improvements to i identify if there is a relationship between the two and ii to identify if the efficiency of the water system management reflects the size of the population and the availability of renewable water in each state the analysis revealed significant differences between the efficiency of the water system management stage 1 and water system improvements stage 2 first although differences between states can be observed the average efficiency in stage 1 0 690 can be considered satisfactory improvements in the water system management especially in tabasco 0 096 campeche 0 302 tlaxcala 0 365 and guerrero 0 378 are still needed though second the efficiency in stage 2 exposed a lack of improvements across the entire country resulting in a very low average efficiency of 0 196 more in detail only five states estado de méxico hidalgo san luis potosí tlaxcala and veracruz out of 32 states reported dea efficiency close to 1 000 third no clear relation between stage 1 and stage 2 results was identified nor was the relation with population and water availability in each state such observations create many areas of opportunities for improvements in the water system management in mexico which is crucial considering recent water problems although in general there is a disbelief that quantitative studies can lead to improvements in the water system s performance in developing countries 39 several recommendations for water policies can be proposed to overcome the severe problems with the availability of drinkable water in mexico the following subsections describe each dea stage results in further detail 5 1 water system management with respect to water system management providing safe drinking water is one of the most pressing challenges that mexico must overcome to meet the 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted by all united nations member states in 2015 47 he et al 48 mention that potential solutions for urban water scarcity involve increasing water availability and reducing water demand approaches to increasing water availability usually include groundwater exploitation seawater desalination reservoir construction and interbasin water transfer to reduce water demand it is necessary to improve water use efficiency water recycling and domestic and industrial water use intensity the water and sewerage industry is highly capital intensive 49 which calls for resource reductions and quality improvements stage 1 results imply a possible average reduction of 31 on the input part of the model i e a reduction in expenditures and personnel maintaining the same level of outputs moreover the possible space for the reduction is much higher for the q3 states fig 5 where the average efficiency is 0 371 potential improvements of 62 9 more precisely the water management system in q3 states reports 15 76 of expenditures compared to the country s average but 17 82 more employees what is more on the output part these states gain 43 31 in revenues and provide 56 98 of water intake on the one side the input reductions can be easier for larger water companies due to the evidence of the increasing returns to scale suggesting that larger water companies can reduce their costs through scale effects 17 however on the other side such changes may be complex due to the resistance to change in how the resources are managed among the responsible authorities and limited regulatory capacities 37 39 therefore it will require long term planning and timely capital investments to close the efficiency gap 5 2 water system improvements the results further show a very low tendency for water system improvements which may look surprising considering the reported water problems in mexico however a similar trend was also observed by flegl et al 12 in the mexican food industry so the low efficiency may clearly illustrate infrastructure investment practices in mexico as cefp 50 observed public investment in mexico has been extremely volatile in the last three decades indicating no adequate planning in public budgets regarding investment in 2018 mexico invested only 2 82 of gdp into infrastructure 1 7 compared to 2013 one of the lowest percentages in latin america and caribbean what is more only 0 08 out of 2 82 corresponded to water infrastructure investments above that water infrastructure together with hydrocarbons and urban development and housing belonged within the three types of infrastructure with the largest net decreases of investments during 2013 2018 period 50 strengthening the management system and science and technology investments are the ways to improve water resource management the necessity for more investments was also stressed by pan et al 24 who recommend more r d personnel to improve the technical efficiency in water management similarly to expand the water resources supply sun et al 51 pointed out that techniques to improve the utilization of water resources must be explored or the existing water supply structure must be expanded to improve the water supply in this case li et al 52 suggest that a certain level of supervision is also recommended in areas with relatively high water resource efficiency to ensure the continued efficient use of water resources higher efficiency of companies should lead to more technological investments 49 this may be understood as a synergy effect between higher service quality and better productivity 18 23 the possible resource reduction optimization in water system management stage 1 may create a space to allocate resources more efficiently by making savings on capital and other inputs it was assumed that the investment in the water system might be linked to the water availability in each state however the analysis did not confirm such assumption see research question 4 as some states with a shallow volume of renewable water such as aguascalientes baja california coahuila nuevo león and quintana roo have very low efficiency in stage 2 more precisely these states gain 86 90 more in revenues and provide 74 32 more water intakes compared to the country s average but on the other hand register 99 56 less water network extension 93 31 less pluvial drainage network extension and 80 23 less new installed extraction capacity this contrasts with tlaxcala which demonstrates very low efficiency in stage 1 0 365 and operates with only 652 m3 hab year of renewable water 4th lowest nevertheless its efficiency in stage 2 is 0 923 5th biggest as tlaxacala reports 215 36 more pluvial drainage network extension compared to the other states no new installed extraction capacity and only 7 21 more water network extension similarly special attention should be paid to mexico city mexico city has only 73 m3 hab year of renewable water the lowest volume in the country table 6 and the city is located in the aguas del valle de méxico hydrological administrative region which reports a very high level of water degree stress table 2 considering this mexico city is supplied by the cutzamala system one of the world s largest water supply systems 3 in the analysis mexico city obtained a water system management efficiency of 1 000 but a water system improvement efficiency of only 0 012 5th worst with respect to the improvements mexico city registered 99 97 water network extension 99 86 pluvial drainage network extension and 94 95 newly installed extraction capacity compared to the country s average in this case the population density may affect the result which commonly has a positive relationship with water system efficiency 53 54 this relationship is known as the economy of densities as there is less network to install and maintain per population and customers resulting in fewer resource inputs per service output 19 49 55 however due to the city s water scarcity it should be reasonable to invest more in water system improvement to increase the water supply finally from the other point of view should the states with a high volume of renewable water take action on water system improvements the results indicate that the states with the most considerable amount of renewable water are located in q3 see fig 7 campeche guerrero nayarit and tabasco and q4 chiapas durango oaxaca and yuacatán i e very low efficiency in water system improvements the high inefficiency in stage 2 may be linked to the prevailing resistance to adopting and implementing new practices 37 but also to their local socio economic characteristics for example oaxaca guerrero chiapas tabasco and campeche are among mexico s ten poorest states with a decentralized government in local rural communities 56 in this case water governance may face challenges of insufficient data sharing between government offices lack of monitoring and enforcement of water quality laws unclear federal policies for water quality surveillance and administrative and technical management of the water services 57 common for rural communities this may cause the low improvement orientation of the water system resulting in inadequate water quality management 56 58 although andwandter and ozuna 29 and salazar adams 28 observed that neither decentralization to the municipal level nor the establishment of an autonomous regulator had a positive impact on the efficiency in mexico 6 conclusion this paper performed a state level two stage dea analysis to study the water system management and water system improvements to understand the current situation and identify the best performers to foster water policy and water practices between the states in mexico this research shows that water system management on average performs better than water system improvements 0 690 vs 0 196 the quadrant analysis of the two stage dea results helped to analyze the water practices of each state and to identify those doing better in q1 than the other states the investigation has shown that water system management improvements are possible by increasing water availability techniques and by reducing water demand which is possible through long term planning and capital investment it also shows that water system improvements have more room for improvement for the mexican states these improvements are not necessarily linked to each state s water availability which is usually assumed these inefficiencies may be linked to the prevailing resistance to adopting and implementing new practices and technologies and to their socio economic characteristics nevertheless caution should be taken when translating dea efficiency scores into policy recommendations since each state has its demographics geographic characteristics and cultural and political practices these are described in the next section 6 1 limitations of the analysis and future works one of the limitations of the analysis is that the results are related to only one period 2018 and the results can be affected by external factors or events 19 to eliminate this limitation the analysis can incorporate the data from the census for 2011 2013 2015 2017 and 2021 not yet published to validate the obtained results moreover including more periods would enable to combine the two stage model with dynamic models such as the window dea malmquist index and network dea 24 40 52 59 further similarly to the previous point the state level can create misleading conclusions in some cases as significant differences exist regarding development within states rurality urbanity for example puebla state includes 217 municipalities where the capital puebla has 1 692 181 people but many municipalities have less than 5000 people which results in socio economic differences considering the economy of density the more rurality exists the more spending of the water companies as a larger number of smaller size treatment plants are distributed across more rural areas such distribution causes inefficiencies in water system management 19 in this case the analysis could eliminate this limitation by applying the analysis to the municipal level or a regional level 21 26 6 2 study s implications these findings have significant implications for understanding how the states perform their water system management practices and water system efficiency practices dea studies have the goodness of identifying the state peers who perform better and for those who are not dea guides each state on how they can become the best performers this study can help the state policy makers to identify how they are performing and to design plans to manage the water better for example water managers should share historical best and worst projects and policy practices at their meetings which are not necessarily occurring at the national governor s conference 5 5 national governor s conference conferencia nacional de gobernadores in spanish conago by its acronym in spanish conago s environment water resources and climate change committee for example has not had meetings in the last three years 60 although water stress in the country has been increasing its importance

8733,the public water system management in mexico has recently been criticized due to severe problems with the availability of drinkable water significant differences exist between mexican regions regarding the availability of renewable water and water system distribution moreover water governance in the country is inefficient due to the lack of transparency in the water policies therefore the article aims to investigate whether there is a direct relationship between water system management efficiency and water system improvement efficiency and how the efficiency reflects the size of the population and the availability of renewable water in each state for this a two stage dea model is constructed to evaluate the water system management efficiency in mexico the results indicate high average water management efficiency but very low efficiency in the water system improvements furthermore immense differences in the water system efficiency can be observed with respect to the characteristics and adopted policies keywords data envelopment analysis efficiency analysis investment technology water system management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the territory of mexico is 1964 million square kilometers km2 of which 1959 million correspond to the continental surface and the rest to the island areas due to its geographical location two thirds of the territory is considered arid or semi arid with annual rainfall less than 500 mm while one third the southeast is humid with annual rainfall exceeding 2000 mm per year in most of mexico the rain is more intense in summer mainly torrential based on data from the 2015 intercensal survey of inegi 1 74 metropolitan areas mas were defined fig 1 for which applying the projections of mexico s national population council 2 a population of 78 29 million inhabitants was estimated to 2018 which constitute 62 76 of the projected population for that year thirty seven mas have more than 500 000 inhabitants representing 67 77 million people and 54 33 of the national population the process of concentration of inhabitants in urban localities has accelerated its growth 3 which implies strong pressures on the environment given the increase in demand for services the national water commission conagua as the administrative regulatory technical and advisory body responsible for water management in mexico performs its functions through 13 river basin organizations table 1 whose area of competence is the hydrological administrative regions har hars are formed by groupings of basins considered basic units for the management of water resources 3 population renewable water rw and gdp show significant regional variations the southeast regions har v x xi and xii account for 67 of the country s renewable water with 20 of the population contributing 20 of the national gdp northern har vi vii ix central har iv vi vii xiii and north western regions har i ii iii comprise 33 of the country s renewable water resources around 10 of the population and a regional contribution to the national gdp between 10 and 14 considering the renewable water per capita the available water in the southeastern regions is seven times greater than that available in the rest of the hydrological administrative regions of our country 2 4 5 table 6 this disproportion between regions causes different demands on water resource management the percentage of water used for human consumption in relation to renewable water is an indicator of the degree of stress exerted on the water resource of a country basin or region 3 the degree of stress can be very high high medium low and stress free where a percentage greater than 40 represents a high or very high degree of stress at the national level mexico experiences a stress level of 19 7 5 which is considered low however the country s central northern and north western areas experience high stress table 2 regarding the coverage of piped water services in 2015 the national coverage of access to piped water was 95 3 97 8 urban 87 0 rural while the national coverage of piped water in housing or land was 94 4 97 2 urban 85 0 rural 1 changes in coverage rates should be seen in the context of population growth and urban concentration 2 literature review 2 1 water system productivity analysis water management water management refers to activities directly related to the control of resources material financial or human such as monitoring analysis planning construction and maintenance 6 the urban water sector is a complex system resulting in low sustainability problems poor resource management and different stakeholders needs that is why it is important to use transdisciplinary processes to mitigate conflicts in decision making goals 7 many quantitative and statistical methods exist to evaluate efficiency and performance for the benchmarking techniques frontier analysis has become the most noteworthy approach the non parametric approach based on data envelopment analysis dea is the most used method to assess efficiency and productivity 8 9 with a comprehensive number of successful applications in various industries for example alda and dammert 10 investigated the police performance of 619 peruvian municipalities considering the environmental aspects in which police operate avilés sacoto et al 11 used dea to evaluate the environmental performance of 32 states in mexico flegl et al 12 applied dea to observe the production and investment efficiency in the mexican food industry linh le et al 13 investigated the environmental efficiency of the agricultural sector in east asian countries for the period from 2002 to 2010 vikas and bansal 14 evaluated efficiency of 22 indian oil and gas sector during 2013 2017 period among others data envelopment analysis has also been widely used to evaluate the technical efficiency in the water and sewerage or sanitization sector the efficiency in water resource management is understood as a balance between water use and supply so that water resources are not threatened by excessive extraction in the future 15 in this case the dea analyses operated with diverse objectives first many analyses focus on water and sewerage companies efficiency for example barbosa et al 16 analyzed 12 private and 30 mixed capital water and sewerage companies in brazil using a balanced panel data from 2005 to 2013 the objective of the analysis was to investigate the efficiency of water and sewerage companies and explain the governance ownership and regulation effect molinos senante et al 17 assessed the production efficiency of the chilean full private and concessionary water companies from 2007 to 2015 using the malmquist index maziotis et al 18 calculated the productivity of 22 english and welsh water companies providing drinking water services from 2001 to 2008 walker et al 19 used a double bootstrap dea model to evaluate the economic and environmental efficiency of 13 water and sewage companies in the uk and ireland second the dea analyses investigate the efficiency from a regional point of view for example chopra and ramachandran 20 used a set of 20 multidimensional factors to develop a multidimensional index to quantify the water sector performance in 11 states in india hu et al 21 applied dea to analyze water use and wastewater treatment in 10 cities located on the minjiang river in china jie et al 22 evaluated the industrial environmental efficiency in 30 chinese provinces using a two stage dea analysis liu and fukushige 23 measured the efficiency of the water supply and sewerage sector in japan to investigate the relationship between efficiency and price setting pan et al 24 analyzed the water use efficiency in 17 cities in shandong province in china between 2006 and 2015 applying the super efficiency dea method tourinho et al 25 assessed water supply and sanitation services performance in 448 brazilian municipalities to explore regional differences and the impact of the used governance models and yang et al 26 measured the efficiencies of 30 regional industrial water systems in china during 2008 2014 using dynamic interactive network model in mexico few dea applications can be found ablanedo rosas et al 27 estimated the operational efficiency of 36 major organizations responsible for supplying potable water in the country salazar adams 28 studied the efficiency of 359 mexican water utilities to value the effect of management and reform policies andwandter and ozuna 29 applied dea to measure the operational efficiency of water utilities to assess the link between private ownership and efficiency 2 2 water resource management performance variables the selection of the variables depends primarily on the objective of each analysis the majority of the studies included variables related to the management resources such as invested capital 18 23 24 operational expenditures 18 19 22 chemical treatment 22 personnel 22 30 access to safe drinking water and sanitization 20 21 24 or the water system size 17 19 25 on the other hand the outputs commonly referred to billing incomes 16 water quality 20 water production 17 18 30 and used chemicals and water treatment 19 21 22 among others table 3 summarizes the dea applications for the efficiency analyses in water resource management 2 3 governance governance refers to the administrative political and institutional rules processes and practices necessary for decision making and implementation 31 due to its characteristics and according to the world water council water is a resource sensitive to governance therefore effective governance represents a prerequisite for sustainable and integrated management of water resources 32 in her nobel prize winning work elinor ostrom demonstrated that adaptive governance of natural resources water in this study is more effective in achieving beneficial change where decentralized self organizing institutions are rich in information and empowered to make decisions on collective action through dialogue and deliberation 33 for the mexican case the regional and natural water system administration limits are incompatible and it is vital to consider the inter and multisectoral coordination of those involved mexico could create its water governance model and promote the adoption and implementation of innovative water governance practices among responsible authorities 34 regulatory authorities play a crucial role in governance by supervising providers and ensuring services sustainability to foster sectors efficiency 25 35 for this water efficiency measurements should be implemented to enhance the service level provided to customers consequently improving water efficiency leads to a reduction in operating costs and a lower necessity to develop new supplies and expand water infrastructure 36 however water governance in the country is inefficient because of corruption and the lack of transparency in water policies in addition the resistance to change in how the resource is managed among the responsible authorities is an obstacle to the adoption and implementation of new practices 37 that expand and strengthen the capacities to establish clear and effective regulations and implement sound policies 38 cetrulo marques and malheiros 39 link this problem to the institutional weakness in mexico due to the limited regulatory capacities and limited fiscal efficiencies considering the lack of transparency of water policies and the resistance to change regarding the resources management and adoption of new policies in mexico the objective of the article is to analyze the efficiency of the public water system management in 32 mexican states the rest of the document is structured as follows section 2 presents the model structure used data and the method section 3 summarizes the obtained results with a detailed evaluation of the research questions and section 4 discusses the implications and limitations of the analysis while section 5 provides the final remarks 3 materials and methods 3 1 data envelopment analysis data envelopment analysis evaluates decision making units dmus regarding their multiple inputs and multiple outputs 40 each dmu has different m inputs to produce s different outputs the ccr model developed by charnes et al 41 can be used if the model assumes constant returns to scale the ccr input oriented model for d m u o is formulated as follows e max r 1 s u r y r o subjected to 1 r 1 s u r y r o i 1 m v i x i j 0 i 1 m v i x i j 1 v i ε i 1 2 m u r ε r 1 2 s where x i j is the quantity of the input i of the d m u j y r j is the amount of the output r of the d m u j u r and v i are the weights of the inputs and outputs i 1 2 m j 1 2 n r 1 2 s and ε is the non archimedean element dmu is 100 efficient if e 1 i e whereas dmu is inefficient if e 1 3 2 two stage data envelopment analysis in many cases the single stage process described in 1 may not be suitable to characterize production processes that can be divided into several sub processes in this case some products are outputs of a sub process on the one hand and the inputs of another sub process on the other hand fig 2 considering the notions presented by kao and hwang 42 we assume that each d m u j j 1 2 n has m inputs x i j i 1 2 m to the first stage and d outputs z d j d 1 2 d from that stage then these d outputs become the inputs to the second stage and are referred to as intermediate measures the outputs from the second stage are y r j r 1 2 s in this case the intermediate measures are the only inputs to the second stage of the process and there are no additional independent inputs to the second stage the efficiency in the first stage is denoted as e j 1 and in the second stage as e j 2 for each d m u j using the ccr dea model defined by charnes et al 41 we then define 2 e j 1 d 1 d w d z d j i 1 m v i x i j a n d e j 2 r 1 s u r y r j d 1 d w d z d j where v i w d w d and u r are unknown non negative weights and w d can be equal to w d the overall efficiency of the two stage process is the product of the efficiencies of the two sub processes as e e j 1 e j 2 if we consider a cooperative centralized approach as defined by kao and hwang 42 or liang et al 43 by letting w d w d in 2 the two stage model jointly determines the set of optimal weights on the intermediate factors to maximize the efficiency scores 1 1 the cooperative approach is suitable for the analysis as both stages of the two stage dea model evaluate processes of the same dmu the noncooperative approach is characterized by the leader follower stackelberg model see for example huang and li 44 where the efficiency of the second stage is determined subject to the requirements that the efficiency of the first stage is to stay fixed 28 the efficiency scores of both stages are optimized simultaneously the linear model can be defined as 3 e o max r 1 s u r y r o subjected to r 1 s u r y r j d 1 d w d z d j 0 j 1 2 n d 1 d w d z d j i 1 m v i x i j 0 j 1 2 n i 1 m v i x i o 1 w d ε d 1 2 d v i ε i 1 2 m u r ε r 1 2 s model 3 gives the overall efficiency after the overall efficiency is obtained the divisional efficiency for each stage can be calculated via the efficiency decomposition 40 we denote the optimal value to model 3 as e 0 then e 0 e 0 1 e 0 2 the maximum achievable value for e 0 1 can be determined as 4 e o 1 max d 1 d w d z d o subjected to r 1 s u r y r 0 e 0 d 1 d w d z d j i 1 m v i x i j 0 j 1 2 n r 1 s u r y r j d 1 d w d z d j 0 j 1 2 n i 1 m v i x i o 1 w d ε d 1 2 d v i ε i 1 2 m u r ε r 1 2 s it then follows the minimum of e 0 2 is given by e 0 2 e 0 e 0 1 the maximum of e 0 2 can be calculated using the following linear model as 5 e o 2 max r 1 s u r y r o subjected to r 1 s u r y r 0 e 0 i 1 m v i x i j 0 r 1 s u r y r j d 1 d w d z d j 0 j 1 2 n d 1 d w d z d j i 1 m v i x i j 0 j 1 2 n d 1 d w d z d o 1 w d ε d 1 2 d v i ε i 1 2 m u r ε r 1 2 s the minimum of e 0 1 is then calculated as e k 1 e 0 e 0 2 3 3 model structure and hypothesis if the analysis considers a two stage process evaluation these two processes usually focus on water use efficiency and wastewater treatment 21 26 the research presented in this article considers a two stage process but differs in the second stage stage 1 evaluates the water system management and stage 2 evaluates the water system improvements in each state fig 2 the objective of stage 1 is to evaluate how well each state administrates its public water system network in this case the total expenditures te and total personnel are considered as the inputs in stage 1 while water intakes wi and total revenues tr are the intermediates that enter stage 2 the objective of stage 2 is to assess the capability of each state to improve the public water system network to overtake the increasing water demand this improvement is linked to the water network extension wne pluvial drainage network extension pdne and lifting of the installed extraction capacity iec the analysis aims to investigate the following hypotheses h1 there is a direct relationship between water system management efficiency and water system improvement efficiency in this case two research questions are created r1 is there a relation between the efficiency of the water system management and the efficiency of the water system improvements or rather r2 does a low efficiency of the water system management create higher needs to improve the water system h2 the efficiency of the water system management reflects the size of the population and the availability of renewable water in each state in this case r3 does the population in each state affects the water system management efficiency r4 does the availability of renewable water in each state affects the adopted governance policies 3 4 data the analysis uses data from the national census of municipal governments and territorial demarcations of mexico city in 2019 census 45 which includes statistical and geographic information on the management and performance of the institutions that make up the public administration of each municipality with respect to the functions of government public security municipal justice drinking water and sanitation urban solid waste and the environment the methodology of the census includes information for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 where some questions are linked to the year of application 2019 and others from the year prior to the coverage 2017 however most of the data represent the year 2018 the information is related to the drinking water and sanitation data i e drinking water service from the public network water collection for public supply drinking water plants and administration the total expenditures te indicate the monetary value of the goods and services consumed in the provision of drinking water and sanitation service during the year2018 2 2 the operator of potable water drainage sewerage wastewater treatment and water reuse services of mexico city is sacmex sistema de aguas de la ciudad de méxico which operates under the authority of the country s environment ministry semarnat secretariat of environment and natural resources in mexico that is why the census does not include the information about the total expenditures and total incomes for mexico city however the published information by sacmex include similar expenditure and income chapters this variable includes consumption of electrical energy in pumping equipment in intake works for water collection consumption of chlorine chlorine gas or similar reagent used for the disinfection of water in intake works electrical energy consumption in distribution systems electricity consumption in water treatment plants physical chemical agents reagents and similar supplies used in purification plants electrical energy consumption in municipal wastewater treatment plants or sites physical chemical agents reagents and similar inputs used in municipal wastewater treatment sites or plants salaries paid rights of exploitation use or exploitation of water rights of use of receiving bodies of wastewater discharges total depreciation and other expenditures total personnel tp include the workforce employed by the public network water service in this case this variable covers managers and directors administrative and accounting employees and technical and operational employees the total number of water intakes wi summarizes the connections subject to billing under a metered service scheme this variable represents the supplied volume in m3 under a metered service scheme of household industrial commercial public and mixed water intakes 3 3 in the case of mexico city the supplied volume was extrapolated due to the missing data for this we used the information about the number of water intakes under a metered service scheme in mexico city compared to the number of water intakes and supplied volume in m3 under the same scheme in estado de méxico with respect to the total population and connected population to the water system in both states such calculation can be considered valid as mexico city and estado de méxico occupy the metropolitan zone of mexico city and are registered in the same hydrological administrative regions of waters of the valley of mexico aguas del valle de méxico table 1 total revenues tr refer to the income for the supply of drinking water and sanitation services this variable includes income from drinking water supply sale of treated water sanitation connection and sewerage rights sale of sludge water distribution through pipes other income from supply of goods and services federal state and municipal subsidies fines and surcharges and other incomes the water network extension wne refers to the extension and rehabilitation in kilometers of the water distribution network in each state similarly the pluvial drainage network extension pdne refers to the extension and rehabilitation of the pluvial drainage network in kilometers finally the installed extraction capacity iec is linked to the newly installed water treatment capacity in potability plants in each state in this case the iec variable refers to water extraction from the exploitation of underground sources such as wells and filtering galleries or surface such as rivers dams or springs for the public supply 45 data in the model were recalculated per 100 000 inhabitants therefore all the obtained results are considered per capita table 4 summarizes the variables used in the model and their descriptive statistics and table 7 presents the complete data used in the analysis finally the selected model structure satisfies the discrimination ability required for the dea models 46 4 results for all the calculations the maxdea 7 ultra software was used the model uses constant returns to scale crs as no competition between the states is considered i e each state operates with its specific resources further the output oriented model was chosen as it is desirable in stage 1 to focus on a greater supplied volume and revenues rather than cut expenses in water treatment which may affect its quality similarly stage 2 focuses on extending and enhancing the water system rather than lowering the supplied volume this also goes along with the recommendations proposed by cetrulo et al 39 for water system management evaluation in developing countries 4 1 water resources management efficiency the average efficiency in stage 1 of the analysis was 0 690 with a standard deviation of 0 235 in general stage 1 reveals a very high efficiency of the water system management in mexico table 5 more in detail chiapas chihuahua mexico city guanajuato querétaro and yucatán reached an efficiency of 1 000 whereas the lowest efficiency can be observed in tabasco 0 096 campeche 0 302 tlaxcala 0 365 and guerrero 0 378 as fig 3 shows no specific pattern regarding the water system management efficiency distribution across the country can be identified regarding stage 2 of the model the results indicate a quite different efficiency level in this case the average efficiency was 0 196 with a standard deviation of 0 348 this indicates a shallow orientation towards the improvements of the water resource management systems in mexico fig 4 displays a group of states with very high efficiency hidalgo estado de méxico san luis potosí tlaxcala and veracruz compared to the rest of the country the highly efficient states are located next to each other in the center east of the country putting the results together the average overall efficiency of the two stage model was 0 123 with a standard deviation of 0 236 this shows a very low water resource management efficiency in mexico the best evaluated states were estado de méxico 0 866 veracruz 0 757 san luis potosí 0 613 hidalgo 0 577 and tlaxcala 0 337 alarming 21 out of 31 states 65 6 reported an overall efficiency lower than 0 025 and 25 out of 32 states 78 1 were lower than 0 1 4 2 analysis of the results in this section the obtained results are analyzed with respect to the constructed hypotheses and research questions h1 there is a direct relationship between water system management efficiency and water system improvement efficiency r1 is there a relation between the efficiency of the water system management and the efficiency of the water system improvements the results obtained in stages 1 and 2 gave evidence of high variability in the efficiency both regarding the states and the stages there is no relation between stage 1 and stage 2 as the correlation is weak at 0 155 and not statistically significant fig 5 summarizes the relation between both stages of the model r2 does a low efficiency of the water system management create higher needs to improve the water system we can classify the efficiency of the water system management into four quadrants q as shown in fig 6 q1 symbolizes the country s highest efficiency in water system management the best performing state is estado de méxico with an efficiency of 0 907 in stage 1 and 0 955 in stage 2 veracruz san luis potosí and hidalgo obtained a lower efficiency in stage 1 but were 1 000 efficient in stage 2 the q2 constitutes states with very low water system efficiency but a high orientation towards the improvements in this case this quadrant consists of only one state tlaxcala whose efficiency is 0 365 in stage 1 and 0 923 in stage 2 the q3 represents states with very low efficiency in both stages more in detail we can identify two types of states in this quadrant 1 states with higher efficiency in stage 1 but efficiency close to zero in stage 2 guerrero morelos nayarit and 2 states with very low efficiency in stage 1 but higher efficiency in stage 2 tabasco finally q4 includes states with very high efficiency of the water system management stage 1 but with a lower orientation towards the improvements of the water system stage 2 the highest orientation towards the system improvements is observed in tamaulipas 0 298 and oaxaca 0 221 as seen in fig 6 the rest of the states in q4 perform below 0 120 in stage 2 and across the whole range for stage 1 from 0 540 for michoacán de ocampo to 1 000 for chiapas chihuahua mexico city guanajuato querétaro and yucatán as a result the h1 is rejected as no direct relationship was observed between water system management efficiency and water system improvement efficiency h2 the efficiency of the water system management reflects the size of the population and the availability of renewable water in each state r3 does the population in each state affects the water system management efficiency a question arises what are the drivers factors of such differences between the states regarding their water system management fig 6 shows the relationship between each state s efficiency and population first the correlation between the efficiency in stage 1 and population is 0 425 significant at the 0 05 level 2 tailed p 0 015 whereas the correlation is 0 313 considering stage 2 and population i e the correlation can be considered as moderate nevertheless the less populated states are mainly located in q2 and q3 i e in the low water system management efficiency quadrant the most populated states are in q4 and q1 with higher water system efficiency the result of estado de méxico may be surprising as it is the most populated state 17 6 million people and the best evaluated in both stages r4 does renewable water availability in each state affect the adopted governance policies further water availability in each water system management plays a crucial role as lower access to water resources may encourage the states to focus more on the improvement part of the management fig 7 shows the link between the availability of renewable water 4 4 renewable water represents the maximum amount of water that is feasible to exploit annually in a region state without altering the ecosystem and that is renewed by means of rain in this case the amount is measured as m³ habitant year in each state and the efficiencies in the water management system the average amount of renewable water in mexico is 3620 m3 habitant year but with high differences between the states see table 1 it can be observed that most of the states with the highest level of renewable water are in q3 and q4 which can explain their lower tendency toward improvements in water system management for example chiapas with 20 854 m3 and the efficiency of 0 029 in stage 2 oaxaca 13 685 m3 0 221 tabasco 13 014 m3 0 221 and yucatán 9917 m3 0 037 however these quadrants also include many states with meager availability of renewable water such as aguascalientes 401 m3 0 029 baja california 838 m3 0 014 and guanajuato 653 m3 0 014 another important case is mexico city which has the lowest availability of renewable water in the country 73 m3 and obtained one of the lowest efficiencies regarding water system improvements this contrasts with estado de méxico which reports the second lowest availability of renewable water 272 m3 but its water management works perfectly in both dea stages it is surprising as both states are in the metropolitan zone of mexico city and are registered in the same hydrological administrative regions of waters of the valley of mexico finally tlaxcala the only state in q2 reports only 652 m3 of renewable water in its territory far below the average in the country which may explain its high efficiency in stage 2 as a result a weak correlation is observed between stage 1 and the availability of renewable water 0 125 as well as considering stage 2 0 034 in both cases not statistically significant as a result h2 can be rejected as moderate and weak relation between the water system management and population as well as the availability of renewable water 5 discussion water management in a country like mexico where each state has its hydrological and managerial characteristics shows a broad efficiency range this research was designed to study by using a two stage dea model the water system management and the system improvements to i identify if there is a relationship between the two and ii to identify if the efficiency of the water system management reflects the size of the population and the availability of renewable water in each state the analysis revealed significant differences between the efficiency of the water system management stage 1 and water system improvements stage 2 first although differences between states can be observed the average efficiency in stage 1 0 690 can be considered satisfactory improvements in the water system management especially in tabasco 0 096 campeche 0 302 tlaxcala 0 365 and guerrero 0 378 are still needed though second the efficiency in stage 2 exposed a lack of improvements across the entire country resulting in a very low average efficiency of 0 196 more in detail only five states estado de méxico hidalgo san luis potosí tlaxcala and veracruz out of 32 states reported dea efficiency close to 1 000 third no clear relation between stage 1 and stage 2 results was identified nor was the relation with population and water availability in each state such observations create many areas of opportunities for improvements in the water system management in mexico which is crucial considering recent water problems although in general there is a disbelief that quantitative studies can lead to improvements in the water system s performance in developing countries 39 several recommendations for water policies can be proposed to overcome the severe problems with the availability of drinkable water in mexico the following subsections describe each dea stage results in further detail 5 1 water system management with respect to water system management providing safe drinking water is one of the most pressing challenges that mexico must overcome to meet the 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted by all united nations member states in 2015 47 he et al 48 mention that potential solutions for urban water scarcity involve increasing water availability and reducing water demand approaches to increasing water availability usually include groundwater exploitation seawater desalination reservoir construction and interbasin water transfer to reduce water demand it is necessary to improve water use efficiency water recycling and domestic and industrial water use intensity the water and sewerage industry is highly capital intensive 49 which calls for resource reductions and quality improvements stage 1 results imply a possible average reduction of 31 on the input part of the model i e a reduction in expenditures and personnel maintaining the same level of outputs moreover the possible space for the reduction is much higher for the q3 states fig 5 where the average efficiency is 0 371 potential improvements of 62 9 more precisely the water management system in q3 states reports 15 76 of expenditures compared to the country s average but 17 82 more employees what is more on the output part these states gain 43 31 in revenues and provide 56 98 of water intake on the one side the input reductions can be easier for larger water companies due to the evidence of the increasing returns to scale suggesting that larger water companies can reduce their costs through scale effects 17 however on the other side such changes may be complex due to the resistance to change in how the resources are managed among the responsible authorities and limited regulatory capacities 37 39 therefore it will require long term planning and timely capital investments to close the efficiency gap 5 2 water system improvements the results further show a very low tendency for water system improvements which may look surprising considering the reported water problems in mexico however a similar trend was also observed by flegl et al 12 in the mexican food industry so the low efficiency may clearly illustrate infrastructure investment practices in mexico as cefp 50 observed public investment in mexico has been extremely volatile in the last three decades indicating no adequate planning in public budgets regarding investment in 2018 mexico invested only 2 82 of gdp into infrastructure 1 7 compared to 2013 one of the lowest percentages in latin america and caribbean what is more only 0 08 out of 2 82 corresponded to water infrastructure investments above that water infrastructure together with hydrocarbons and urban development and housing belonged within the three types of infrastructure with the largest net decreases of investments during 2013 2018 period 50 strengthening the management system and science and technology investments are the ways to improve water resource management the necessity for more investments was also stressed by pan et al 24 who recommend more r d personnel to improve the technical efficiency in water management similarly to expand the water resources supply sun et al 51 pointed out that techniques to improve the utilization of water resources must be explored or the existing water supply structure must be expanded to improve the water supply in this case li et al 52 suggest that a certain level of supervision is also recommended in areas with relatively high water resource efficiency to ensure the continued efficient use of water resources higher efficiency of companies should lead to more technological investments 49 this may be understood as a synergy effect between higher service quality and better productivity 18 23 the possible resource reduction optimization in water system management stage 1 may create a space to allocate resources more efficiently by making savings on capital and other inputs it was assumed that the investment in the water system might be linked to the water availability in each state however the analysis did not confirm such assumption see research question 4 as some states with a shallow volume of renewable water such as aguascalientes baja california coahuila nuevo león and quintana roo have very low efficiency in stage 2 more precisely these states gain 86 90 more in revenues and provide 74 32 more water intakes compared to the country s average but on the other hand register 99 56 less water network extension 93 31 less pluvial drainage network extension and 80 23 less new installed extraction capacity this contrasts with tlaxcala which demonstrates very low efficiency in stage 1 0 365 and operates with only 652 m3 hab year of renewable water 4th lowest nevertheless its efficiency in stage 2 is 0 923 5th biggest as tlaxacala reports 215 36 more pluvial drainage network extension compared to the other states no new installed extraction capacity and only 7 21 more water network extension similarly special attention should be paid to mexico city mexico city has only 73 m3 hab year of renewable water the lowest volume in the country table 6 and the city is located in the aguas del valle de méxico hydrological administrative region which reports a very high level of water degree stress table 2 considering this mexico city is supplied by the cutzamala system one of the world s largest water supply systems 3 in the analysis mexico city obtained a water system management efficiency of 1 000 but a water system improvement efficiency of only 0 012 5th worst with respect to the improvements mexico city registered 99 97 water network extension 99 86 pluvial drainage network extension and 94 95 newly installed extraction capacity compared to the country s average in this case the population density may affect the result which commonly has a positive relationship with water system efficiency 53 54 this relationship is known as the economy of densities as there is less network to install and maintain per population and customers resulting in fewer resource inputs per service output 19 49 55 however due to the city s water scarcity it should be reasonable to invest more in water system improvement to increase the water supply finally from the other point of view should the states with a high volume of renewable water take action on water system improvements the results indicate that the states with the most considerable amount of renewable water are located in q3 see fig 7 campeche guerrero nayarit and tabasco and q4 chiapas durango oaxaca and yuacatán i e very low efficiency in water system improvements the high inefficiency in stage 2 may be linked to the prevailing resistance to adopting and implementing new practices 37 but also to their local socio economic characteristics for example oaxaca guerrero chiapas tabasco and campeche are among mexico s ten poorest states with a decentralized government in local rural communities 56 in this case water governance may face challenges of insufficient data sharing between government offices lack of monitoring and enforcement of water quality laws unclear federal policies for water quality surveillance and administrative and technical management of the water services 57 common for rural communities this may cause the low improvement orientation of the water system resulting in inadequate water quality management 56 58 although andwandter and ozuna 29 and salazar adams 28 observed that neither decentralization to the municipal level nor the establishment of an autonomous regulator had a positive impact on the efficiency in mexico 6 conclusion this paper performed a state level two stage dea analysis to study the water system management and water system improvements to understand the current situation and identify the best performers to foster water policy and water practices between the states in mexico this research shows that water system management on average performs better than water system improvements 0 690 vs 0 196 the quadrant analysis of the two stage dea results helped to analyze the water practices of each state and to identify those doing better in q1 than the other states the investigation has shown that water system management improvements are possible by increasing water availability techniques and by reducing water demand which is possible through long term planning and capital investment it also shows that water system improvements have more room for improvement for the mexican states these improvements are not necessarily linked to each state s water availability which is usually assumed these inefficiencies may be linked to the prevailing resistance to adopting and implementing new practices and technologies and to their socio economic characteristics nevertheless caution should be taken when translating dea efficiency scores into policy recommendations since each state has its demographics geographic characteristics and cultural and political practices these are described in the next section 6 1 limitations of the analysis and future works one of the limitations of the analysis is that the results are related to only one period 2018 and the results can be affected by external factors or events 19 to eliminate this limitation the analysis can incorporate the data from the census for 2011 2013 2015 2017 and 2021 not yet published to validate the obtained results moreover including more periods would enable to combine the two stage model with dynamic models such as the window dea malmquist index and network dea 24 40 52 59 further similarly to the previous point the state level can create misleading conclusions in some cases as significant differences exist regarding development within states rurality urbanity for example puebla state includes 217 municipalities where the capital puebla has 1 692 181 people but many municipalities have less than 5000 people which results in socio economic differences considering the economy of density the more rurality exists the more spending of the water companies as a larger number of smaller size treatment plants are distributed across more rural areas such distribution causes inefficiencies in water system management 19 in this case the analysis could eliminate this limitation by applying the analysis to the municipal level or a regional level 21 26 6 2 study s implications these findings have significant implications for understanding how the states perform their water system management practices and water system efficiency practices dea studies have the goodness of identifying the state peers who perform better and for those who are not dea guides each state on how they can become the best performers this study can help the state policy makers to identify how they are performing and to design plans to manage the water better for example water managers should share historical best and worst projects and policy practices at their meetings which are not necessarily occurring at the national governor s conference 5 5 national governor s conference conferencia nacional de gobernadores in spanish conago by its acronym in spanish conago s environment water resources and climate change committee for example has not had meetings in the last three years 60 although water stress in the country has been increasing its importance

8734,in the manufacturing sector water has been often considered too cheap to conserve such thinking relies on water valuations that limit the value of water to the price paid using such simple methods the share of water cost to total manufacturing cost is significantly small 3 as a result conserving water and enabling technology uptake is difficult to justify economically and slow to advance hindering progress toward sustainable water use however the value of water to a manufacturer is far greater than the price paid valuations such as the true cost of water consider the additional in plant treatment and energy costs and have been gaining greater traction in the manufacturing sector however true cost alone still undervalues water by not accounting for economic and social costs related to scarcity and environmental externalities this paper makes the case and presents a framework for valuing manufacturing water beyond the price paid and the true cost the proposed fuller valuation of manufacturing water takes into account the internal and opportunity costs associated with the realization of water risks the paper follows with a review of a wide range of water valuation metrics both at the specific industry level and regional economy wide level the use of various valuation metrics incorporating the relationship between the change in value with change in water use such as marginal value of water shadow price and elasticity at the specific industry level has been limited in the u s manufacturing sector further a limited number of studies exist on data intensive subjective evaluation techniques such as computable general equilibrium modeling and input output modeling for regional water valuation after reviewing water value metrics several recent case studies from manufacturers from the literature are presented to illustrate both the promise and challenges of a fuller valuation of water as proposed here some large multinational corporations have moved toward assessing the value of water via supply chain sustainability initiatives environmental profit and loss accounting estimating risk adjusted values of water hydro economic modeling natural capital asset valuation and developing value chain indices this paper provides policymakers and technology developers a framework for monetizing water value beyond its true cost and current metrics if adopted such fuller water valuations can help make the business case for the development and deployment of cost effective water conserving technologies thereby improving the sustainability of the manufacturing sector with respect to water keywords water valuation metrics manufacturing use economics sustainability technology infrastructure data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is a critical component for many manufacturing processes aside from its use in manufacturing process operations water in the manufacturing sector can also be used for other purposes like cooling power generation sanitation and fire protection often these uses are essential to operations for example without water for cooling and an alternate heat sink process equipment can overheat fail and cause a plant to shut down consequently water demand and its subsequent value become an important issue when faced with managing or mitigating water related risk events or shocks e g price availability quality these water shocks could occur due to a lack of reliable water supply which could result in higher temporary regional water prices unlike other commercial commodities the price paid for water does not fully reflect the value it provides to the consumer as a result this underpriced resource the uninterrupted supply of which is essential to many manufacturing operations is not optimally utilized and large operational inefficiencies occur the mismatch between price and value inhibits the development and deployment of water saving technologies as the return on investment is calculated using the price and not the value further the low price of water often means that capital improvements to increase the utilization efficiency of other resources with higher operational costs e g electricity are higher priority to manufacturers 1 3 to advance the state of water saving technologies and realize sustainability objectives a reframing of water price to better incorporate value is needed water cost and price e g utility tariff are the two commonly used metrics to understand the economic impacts of either industrial self supply water withdrawals or utility water use in economic terms cost represents the expenditures incurred to produce a certain good while price is defined as the rate at which one exchanges money for a good market prices demonstrate the relation between supply what is produced and at what cost and demand the value to buyers and appropriate pricing mediates between the full costs of production and the demand for the resource however water prices often do not even cover direct costs of supply let alone the full value of water including opportunity and externality costs precluding the efficient and sustainable use of water 4 5 the share of water cost relative to total manufacturing cost is significantly small 3 6 7 driven mainly by low utility tariffs and self supplied sourcing i e no volumetric water or connection costs without consideration of additional necessary in plant costs u s industrial water tariffs vary widely over space and time in the range of 1 to 3 kgal per month 8 9 moreover three quarters of u s manufacturing water intake stems from self supplied sources 10 water is a highly location specific resource meaning that localized water stress is a risk factor for manufacturing operations nearby 5 to date abundant domestic water supply has caused only limited supply risk impacts in specific regions such as california and the southwest further property taxes and local bonds often make up the difference of utility tariffs between the utility cost and the tariff paid by consumers when utilities are still unable to cover their costs delayed maintenance and investments have resulted in failing water infrastructure with negative effects on water quality and reliability of supply for example disruptions to water service in 2019 represented economic losses of 51 billion for the 11 industries most reliant on water including manufacturing 11 because current tools to assess water risks do not fully account for the economic value of water to individual businesses or other stakeholders manufacturers are likely to misunderstand or undervalue water risks particularly in highly developed river basins 12 however water supply disruptions are projected to increase with industrialization environmental water discharge regulations and more drought and extreme weather due to climate change impacts the full value of water to manufacturers should encompass the risks of water shortages or poor water quality that could lead to the disruption of production appropriate water valuation is important to quantify these external and indirect water supply disruption impacts and critical for assessing the potential of cost effective industrial water conservation technology opportunities in addition water valuation would enable individual manufacturers to better understand tradeoffs related to water use when inputs and outputs are stated in financial e g dollar terms water valuation would also be beneficial to local utilities with respect to the efficient allocation of water resources more comprehensive economic evaluation methods specific to the manufacturing region are necessary to facilitate the development and deployment of water savings technologies in industry this paper seeks to establish a framework for improving the valuation of water in order to support decision making processes impacting the sustainable use of water in the manufacturing sector based on findings from the literature this paper identifies and recommends the considerations necessary to appropriately value water as a resource focusing on upstream and downstream impacts to the facility and the ecosystem within which it operates next metrics used in the literature for understanding the value of water are compiled and reviewed finally the paper concludes with summarizing findings from case studies of industrial facilities using a more comprehensive valuation of water 2 water valuation concepts concept of cost price and value the price of a typical commodity is conditioned on its quantity water is a nonstandard commodity meaning it possesses special attributes beyond quantity with no market pricing impacts 13 special water attributes include the following water is mobile flows instead of stocks but challenging and expensive to transport across large distances elevations making it difficult to establish property rights and to dispatch it where needed freshwater availability varies across space and time due to weather climate water quality matters for specific applications it performs multiple social functions calling for regulated pricing it has associated externalities due to high interdependencies among users there is a natural monopoly where cost is mainly driven by amount and type of supply source it can have high demand variability and having numerous decision makers at various levels causes difficulties in public regulation 9 14 in some regions innovations to price these attributes have taken place for example farmers hedge funds and municipalities alike are now able to hedge against or bet on future water availability in california the biggest u s agriculture market and world s fifth largest economy cme group inc s january 2021 contract linked to california s 1 1 billion spot water market last traded at 496 index points equal to 496 per acre foot 15 ideally for sustainable use of water price and value should balance each other 16 price and allocation of water is mostly regulated by government authorities because of the many critical social functions that water performs the price will depend on the set utility tariff in that given region from the utility perspective efficient price signals would help promote water conservation justify expenditures on water saving technologies and help collect sufficient revenue for daily operation and maintenance of the water delivery system and future infrastructure investments 9 17 while for utilities water prices often do not even recover the costs of supplying that water manufacturers generally think of water cost and price as synonymous the amount to be paid to utilities for its use similar to obtaining or use of any product resources however the cost and price will be dependent on whether or not the manufacturing facility purchases or self supplies its water leading to different costs and prices for each manufacturing facilities that purchase water from utilities are charged a certain price based generally on the quantity of water purchased these facilities tend to directly equate this price with the cost of water at their facility in contrast self supplied industrial facilities in most cases need not pay anything for their raw water input 18 if any costs exist their effective price could be the sum of the miscellaneous costs involved such as abstraction licenses infrastructure and technology costs 19 in either case additional direct costs are incurred to use the water direct costs are expenditures directly associated with the establishment and maintenance of the manufacturing facility s water supply infrastructure e g circulating pumps chemicals for treatment in simple terms they relate to costs associated with capital investment and o m or even investing in water conserving technologies as illustrated in fig 1 the price of water is a fundamental type of cost involved in industrial water use today but is a small part of the overall value of water price does not capture all the cost elements involved in industrial water use this is where the concept of true cost must be introduced as shown as the second innermost concentric circle in fig 1 in addition to the price true cost also takes into account direct user ancillary costs like those related to energy chemicals and permits true cost is significantly higher than conventional direct cost utility price but it does not include either the costs associated with managing disruptions or the social costs related to scarcity and environmental externalities commonly referred to as indirect or opportunity costs other alternate costs include the costs associated with ensuring an adequate supply of water to meet production demands this could involve securing an alternate supply of water or re tooling equipment to use water of different quality indirect opportunity costs represent the loss of potential benefits due to misallocation of a resource externalities are the economic or environmental costs imposed on third parties due to an activity over which these parties do not exert any control and which are not reflected in the cost of the goods or services involved for example water pollution due to an industrial establishment could result in increased cost of wastewater treatment for downstream users economic externality or negative impacts to the ecosystem environmental externality 17 social costs for industrial water use may be due to re settlements resulting from water infrastructure expansion and scarcity of water or social conflicts like loss of income or employment opportunities from a lack of water resources currently the full value of the services water provides remains externalized and thus unaccounted for in the manufacturing sector as well as others however fig 1 shows a framework in which the full value of manufacturing water includes all costs depicted as expressed in equation 1 equation 1 f u l l v a l u e o f w a t e r p r i c e t r u e c o s t o t h e r i n t e r n a l c o s t s i n d i r e c t o p p o r t u n i t y c o s t s fig 1 aligns with the work done by rogers et al 2002 4 where the full supply cost contains o m cost and capital charges the full economic cost includes the full supply cost in addition to opportunity cost and economic externalities and the full cost encompasses the full economic cost in addition to environmental externalities ideally the full cost as defined by rogers et al should be equal to the value which includes the value to water users net benefits from return flow net benefits from indirect uses adjustment for societal objectives and the intrinsic value of water appropriate valuation of resources is important in accurately evaluating various tradeoffs that come into play when working to achieve sustainable resource use 20 2 1 monetizing water beyond true cost the concept of the true cost of water is beginning to make inroads in corporate financial frameworks 21 however the other internal costs and indirect opportunity costs shown in fig 1 are not often incorporated various types of risks caused by shocks perturbations and cross sector competition to the industrial water supply can impact manufacturing operations even in the case of self supply water withdrawals water availability could be impacted and the indirect opportunity costs indicated in fig 1 will go up with drastic changes in climatic conditions on a global scale adverse events affecting manufacturing water supplies that are acute short events like droughts and floods and chronic events that unfold slowly like changes in agricultural growing seasons and large shifts in populations needing access to clean water could negatively impact manufacturing water supplies the acute events could create shocks and perturbations throughout the year leading to periods of water unavailability and the chronic events could exacerbate cross sector competition for water supplies this highlights the urgency for industries to better monetize the potential impacts of future water risks on their manufacturing capabilities and thereby the value of water beyond cost price considered today and more aligned with the framing in fig 1 water associated risks can be broadly classified into several types physical regulatory and reputational that lead to economic impacts for manufacturers 22 23 physical risks are associated with restricted access to adequate and reliable water supply causing impacts on its price irrespective of any uncertainties due to future water supply impacts causes of restricted water supply include droughts or floods damaging the water supply infrastructure in addition to loss of water system capacity simply due to aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance changes in water availability e g changes in snowmelt and timing of runoff and the aforementioned cross sector competition regulatory risks are associated with sudden changes in laws or regulations that alter a facility s access to water supplies services and discharges this risk type may affect the water cost associated with the discharge risks from harmful production activities perceived to have negative water related impacts are reputational and these may subsequently cause damage to the ecosystem and decrease brand value or consumer loyalty the value of water to the ecosystem is mostly characterized by these risk types which are not being considered by the industry today the type and nature of these risks depend on several factors such as geographic location or even water use patterns that are unique to each industrial sector and have been quantified both qualitatively and quantitatively with a variety of metrics as discussed in the following section 3 review of water valuation methods metrics limited attempts have been made to quantify the value of manufacturing water use with anticipated growth in the domestic manufacturing sector the effects of manufacturing water use will be localized localization and agglomeration of facilities in specific regions could aggravate regional water scarcity within the manufacturing sector the use of indicators in conjunction with water price can help to identify blind spots associated with the sustainability of its water use in turn this can lead to the identification of water uses that significantly affect production if a particular water use is found to have an enormous impact on production then the facility may decide to take actions towards improving the reliability of the water supply for that use in particular metrics that support the ability to measure the value of water and quantify trends shifts are needed such a class of metrics herein referred to as water valuation metrics can help identify where technologies are needed and evaluate their impacts 3 1 methodology to accomplish the objectives of this study it was essential first to establish the type of metrics that would most appropriately capture the valuation of water use in the manufacturing sector an initial online search through google scholar and scopus conducted in 2019 revealed a limited number of studies available on a global scale that attempted to quantify water use in the manufacturing sector studies focusing on cost and price of water use were excluded while the emphasis was given to studies that focused specifically on the valuation of water use in the manufacturing sector typically from the economic valuation discipline a search strategy was formulated to systematically target books and journal articles that would discuss water use valuation based on the type of metrics identified below e g willingness to pay value of marginal product and elasticity limited available studies specifically for the manufacturing sector were mostly addressed in the economics literature and for mostly developing countries in africa and east asia where water scarcity has been a major economic issue for decades the search and subsequent filtering process resulted in finding a total of 20 relevant technical literary sources the primary criteria for identifying these shortlisted studies were discussion of single or multiple water valuation metrics and their applications within specific industrial manufacturing sectors such as food paper plastics and rubber products leather steel and metal etc available estimates of metrics were tabulated by the metrics type manufacturing sector and countries regions including the aggregate estimates this approach facilitated an understanding of the application of these valuation metrics and their variation across different countries on both regional and global scales the next section will summarize various water valuation metrics specifically it will examine willingness to pay value of marginal product and elasticity 3 2 summary of various water valuation metrics with potential risks due to climate change and the resultant possibility of water scarcity it is important for industries to assess their willingness to pay wtp beyond the cost price paid today for their water needs the wtp metric considers water risk types in terms of the maximum price at or below which a consumer will definitely buy one unit of a product water wtp valuation techniques can be classified into two major categories namely inductive and deductive techniques 23 depending on the type and data level used for industrial value estimation the former technique is applicable mostly at the specific facility industry level and is based on real world data to establish general relationships using a range of methodologies such as econometric contingent valuation and damage cost on the other hand deductive techniques such as value added computable general equilibrium cge and alternative cost models are less data intensive but more logical and analytically applicable for macro level regional or country wide estimation 24 some other commonly used metrics to quantify the value of water are value of marginal product vmp also known as marginal value of water average water productivity shadow price and elasticity coefficients vmp represents the increase in output value per unit increase in water intake while average water productivity is the total output divided by water input both are expressed in terms of m3 the shadow price of water represents the intangible social opportunity cost of water e g the value of a good that can be produced by the marginal unit water used given the quantity of the other inputs such a labor and raw materials also expressed in terms of m3 elasticity is another frequently used water valuation metric employed to understand the degree of responsiveness of industrial water demand and output to variation in various parameters accordingly two types of water demand elasticity metrics have been analyzed through studies 1 price elasticity of water demand which depicts the change in demand of water with respect to change in price or cost of water and 2 water elasticity of output which depicts the change in output per unit change in water input subsequent sections will discuss the various studies that have applied these techniques and metrics to analyze and quantify the value of water by means of cross industrial sector analysis including a few at a regional scale 3 3 facility industry water valuation metrics methods many industrial water valuation estimates as shown in table 1 rely upon econometric methods these methods use an industry representation as a production process where the manufacturing output is a function of capital labor energy materials and water further econometric methods have been employed at the level of different manufacturing subsectors represented by the north american industry classification system naics code range of 31 33 which are further characterized by a total of 21 subsectors of 3 digit naics codes some examples of commonly used production functions include the cobb douglas function and the translog function model regression techniques are then used to determine the coefficients associated with each independent variable standard statistical validations e g r2 value and f statistics are applied to validate the model the production function approach is generally used to estimate the vmp of water water average productivity and the price and output elasticity of water demand table 1 shows several published water value estimates at the 3 digit naics manufacturing subsector level across different countries the vmp is the most commonly used the total number of published estimates for the vmp is higher than the other two commonly used metrics water average productivity and the shadow price of water two sets of value estimates based on two types of production functions i e cobb douglas and translog functions have been used by the ku and yoo study 2012 25 as shown in table 1 estimates by köseoğlu 2018 26 are the average of estimates from eight primary published studies the estimates in table 1 were initially converted to us dollars for the same year using the currency exchange rate 27 and finally to 2021 u s dollars using the appropriate country gdp deflator 28 the leading industrial sectors represented in table 1 are food manufacturing naics 311 petroleum and coal products manufacturing naics 324 chemical manufacturing naics 325 paper manufacturing naics 322 electrical equipment appliance and component manufacturing naics 335 textile mills naics 313 314 and transportation equipment manufacturing naics 336 geographical location was observed as one of the key factors for the variation in these estimates across different studies e g köseoğlu 2018 26 fujii et al 2012 32 and wang and lall 1999 30 the marginal values in water scarce north china are about twice the values in south china based on the 1996 2006 period analyzed in the fujii et al 2012 32 study industrial water use efficiency improved over the years during this period while provinces in the northern region were more efficient in reducing freshwater use for the same reasons of high water scarcity and risk the vmp of water in south africa 29 was estimated to be several orders of magnitude higher compared to other developed countries all published estimates are for non u s countries but the two estimates for developed western countries i e canada and united kingdom may provide some insights for u s water use valuation aside from marginal or average water valuation metrics elasticity is another popular concept evaluated by most studies to date like water value estimates industrial water demand elasticity is generally derived from a production function most of the studies mentioned in table 1 have also estimated price elasticity or the output elasticity of water demand at the industry level as shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively industrial water demand price elasticity estimates for the overall manufacturing sector as shown in table 2 were mostly found to be negative and between 0 and 1 in u s canada mexico u k and india indicating that the water demand is relatively inelastic signaling that price increases would not necessarily be mitigated by or cause a reduction in water demand the manufacturing water demand in water scarce south africa was found to be the most sensitive to its prices or cost with its price elasticities significantly greater than 1 in the study by nahman and de lange 2012 29 a review of price elasticity estimates across 26 studies by köseoğlu 2018 26 shows some pattern in elasticity based on industry type industries using water as a raw material such as food and beverage manufacturing and chemical manufacturing show relatively inelastic demand in comparison with relatively elastic demand for industries using water as a process input like textiles and apparel paper petroleum and electrical equipment for a few regional u s industrial sectors elasticities are estimated to be positive although babin et al 35 state that standard errors in the cases of naics codes of 333 334 and 335 were large enough that these elasticities may not significantly differ from zero some of the studies also estimated the cross price elasticity of demand between water and other production inputs the cross price elasticity of water provides insights on its relationship to other production inputs cross price elasticity of demand i j is the percentage change in quantity of ith input resulting from unit percent change in price of jth input the value of cross elasticity helps in determining whether the inputs are substitutes i e a unit increase in the price of one input will lead to an increase in demand for the other inputs or complements i e a unit increase in the price of one input will lead to a decrease in demand for the other inputs in the production process positive cross price elasticity means the inputs are substitutes while negative cross price elasticity means the inputs are complements cross price elasticity of demand is zero if two inputs are not related estimates from rojas 2005 6 for cross price elasticity of water with other inputs show that water is a substitute for both labor and material kumar 2006 33 found water to be a substitute for capital but a complement to materials and labor for all industries while vásquez lavín et al 2020 31 found water to be a substitute for capital labor and material but a complement to energy in their study on water use for canadian industries dupont and renzetti 2000 34 included two variables in the production function for water use water intake and water recirculation as expected water intake and recirculation are substitutes and the former parameter is a substitute for capital labor and energy output elasticity of water demand is an alternative elasticity metric denoted as positive values to estimate the output impacts of returns to scale from changing the water intake limited estimates of various industrial sectors from two studies are shown in table 3 a range of estimates from the ku and yoo study 2012 25 corresponds to the two types of production functions used cobb douglas and trans log output elasticity of water is significantly small and less than 1 implying an increase in water use does not lead to an increase in final product output quantity water availability has not been found to be one of the major factors of the final manufacturing output for these two countries 3 4 regional economy water valuation metrics shifting the focus from facility level valuations to regional valuations enables better policy around industrial water use to advance technology uptake water valuation metrics used at the regional or economy wide level are based on the analysis of macro level regional data for the estimation of regional scale water related economic impacts the number of studies that have used metrics in this area is comparatively limited with estimates from such studies shown in table 4 average and median water value estimates of frederick et al 1996 36 were based on a wide variety of methods such as average and marginal metrics using the production function approach and contingent valuation techniques for nonmarketed services from 41 different studies the most commonly recurring goal among the studies discussed in table 4 was evaluating existing water usage policies within a given geographical region to understand the obstacles hindering sustainable water supply use and resultant economic growth some of the studies employed quantitative analysis to estimate the intangible avoided cost not considered by conventional metrics such as shadow price m3 or other economic parameters like potential loss of jobs or economic output table 4 also includes studies that conducted qualitative analysis to identify the potential risks associated with these obstacles and the resultant economic impacts 38 39 the obstacles were quantified via scores ranging from 0 to 5 to display the degree of risk associated with water scarcity these metrics were estimated using deductive techniques some common examples of which are methods like cge models or input output model techniques cge models use actual economic data to estimate how an economy might respond when stimulated by changes in policy or other external factors the feng et al 2005 41 study is a classic example of such a study using the cge model to determine if additional water supply from a large scale water transfer project would help overcome potential obstacles due to regional water resource vulnerability another unique modelling approach observed was the meta frontier model analysis technique adopted by li and ma 40 which attempted to identify required policy changes to address the issue of low industrial water use efficiencies in industrial firms located across 30 different chinese provinces the analysis also quantitatively established that the estimated average shadow price was 12 times higher than the actual average price of industrial water across the eastern central and western regions of mainland china 40 input output models have also been applied to quantitatively analyze regional level data to understand any change in production output due to change in industrial water supply a study conducted in athens clarke county ga usa used this approach to quantify the risk of drought occurrence in terms of potential industrial jobs lost and loss of economic output 37 in the absence of any water conservation measures using the county level data for 536 economic sectors adverse economic impacts were estimated in terms of reduction in the gross regional product grp of 244 million and the loss of 4171 jobs even at a small level of risk of drought occurrence of 5 37 most of these studies are focused on valuation efforts for specific geographic locations within a country a complete country level analysis is inappropriate due to a wide variation in both spatial and temporal water use requiring a vast range of data and parameters for complete analysis 4 case studies of water valuation by manufacturers the millennium ecosystem assessment estimates that in the last half of the twentieth century urbanization industries agriculture forestry and fisheries have driven the decline of 60 of all ecosystem services e g carbon sequestration freshwater provision air and water quality regulation storm protection disease control and habitat provision in large part because the benefits of these public goods are generally not priced so markets rarely mirror the full social and environmental cost of production 42 another estimate signifying enormous pressures on the ecosystems on which economies rely is that global production systems externalize 4 7 trillion annually in environmental costs 43 the effective development of payment for ecosystem services pes mechanisms and physical indicators of ecosystem health are examples of the types of better incentives data and decision support tools that will be critical for companies to quantify and manage environmental impacts and business disruption risks across the production life cycle 42 43 further incorporation of pes into internal corporate water management practices can lead to wider adoption of water saving technologies the appropriate valuation of water in the manufacturing sector is nascent but several multinational corporations have made strides in the last decade within the apparel industry supply chain sustainability initiatives concerning the water use of production include the better cotton initiative the sustainable apparel coalition higg index puma environmental profit loss levi s e valuate and water less nike colordry and flyknit zero discharge of hazardous chemicals and levi s wellthread 43 in 2011 the footwear and apparel company puma published an environmental profit and loss ep l account encompassing the cradle to gate impact of its products on ecosystems appraising the cost to society of water used in puma s supply chain as 47 million per year on par with greenhouse gas emission costs 44 this estimate was modeled by pwc and trucost using a relationship between water scarcity and value derived from a wide literature search in order to evaluate in economic terms the drop in the direct use value of water to third parties as a consequence of puma s water consumption as a result of the ep l accounting puma is now focusing on its supply chain specifically water to grow chemical and make leather rather than on its own operations to reduce its water impacts another large multinational that has investigated water valuation is unilever a consumer goods company with more than 250 manufacturing sites worldwide the unilever sustainable living plan has identified water shortages and poor water quality as risks to continuous business operations with recent droughts in taiwan brazil and poland potentially threatening to disrupt production 5 working with unilever mit researchers used the wri aqueduct tool to identify numerous business disruption scenarios related to water estimated their likelihood and consequences and determined available mitigation options to create a risk adjusted value of water aggregated across all event scenarios table 5 demonstrates the substantial differences between the true value and the purchase price of water for four modeled unilever plants the variation in each site s value at risk or business disruption cost would help unilever incentivize water efficiency and basin based stewardship initiatives where and when most crucial improving the resiliency of its manufacturing operations via more optimal water use in texas the dow chemical company partnered with the nature conservancy to better understand water risks for its freeport facility on the brazos river one effort involved hydro economic modeling to characterize future water availability in the brazos river basin and project the scale of economic losses from future water shortages 12 a conservative approximation of loss due to water shortages affecting this single facility was estimated at 900 million 30 year npv more broadly this study underlines that the benefits of water markets and potential implications of cross sector competition in which agricultural users sell their water to municipal and industrial users are lessened in the context of industrialized or water stressed river basins and presents a methodology for businesses to inform strategic planning processes via evaluating basin scale water risks this resulted in the facility pursuing tracking of indicators of water supply shortages convey risks associated with industrial and municipal dominated basins and explore options outside of water trading the same researchers extended their analysis by using natural capital asset valuation to calculate the changing value of all industrial water rights in the brazos river basin under varying water demand and climate change scenarios 45 employing multi criteria analysis for water scarcity solutions using private public and biodiversity related costs and benefits revealed that three scenarios are competitive on cost with the business as usual solution of increased reservoir storage however because these scenarios provide collective benefits to other water users and ecosystems in the basin while individual stakeholders bear the costs more widespread payment for ecosystem services or water funds are necessary to correctly align incentives finally the apparel company patagonia calls for the widespread adoption of value chain indices vci to bring the previously externalized environmental and social costs of production inside individual firms balance sheets 46 a value chain index quantifies ecosystem services e g for water land use and carbon in dollar terms on the basis of cradle to grave production impacts and should ideally be developed jointly by various competitors in a sector and draw on objective life cycle analysis databases achieving true cost accounting would enable manufacturers to find improvements all throughout their value chains while powerful market forces would be put in the service of sustainability s goals 46 5 conclusions the importance of water valuation in support of the use of water as a scarce natural resource has been limited to date in addition to the true cost the value of water must also include the indirect social costs associated with industrial water use a fuller monetization of water that incorporates ecosystem impacts from its use and costs associated with the realization of various water risks will create a more fertile environment for the development of water saving technologies and implementation of conservation efforts until then technology development and conservation efforts will be saddled with the common refrain that water is too cheap this paper reviewed the economic valuation literature to summarize what is known about and understand general trends regarding the valuation of water used in manufacturing it highlights the need to incorporate the true cost of water indirect opportunity costs and other costs associated with the realization of water risks into the value of water indirect opportunity costs include considerations for the loss of revenue from reduced production associated with lost or curtailed water supplies as well as the environmental impacts associated with water use and wastewater disposal costs associated with water risk realization include costs of finding and utilizing alternate water sources and retooling a plant for using water alternatives risks that could trigger such costs can be categorized into three types physical regulatory and reputational with the versatile role water plays in the daily functioning of manufacturing operations the value of water for the industrial or manufacturing sector is close to surpassing that of other sectors like agriculture domestic use power generation and mining most studies indicate the marginal value of manufacturing water use is mostly higher than the price or cost of water supply thereby indicating the need for manufacturers to use value estimates rather than cost estimates for water risk evaluation available water valuation estimates based on a range of different metrics both at the industrial and regional scale in terms of a change or value per unit of water use indicate a wide variability not only across different manufacturing sectors and locations within a study but also across various studies for a manufacturing sector valuation metrics in terms of change in value with change in water use amount such as vmp shadow price and elasticity are appropriate for the evaluation of economic competitiveness of water conservation technologies elasticity is one of the metrics used for an understanding of the responsiveness of water demand to price and process output sectors using water as process inputs like paper textile electrical industries have relatively elastic price demand compared to sectors that use water as a direct input to production like food and beverage industries implying that the effect of pricing on water conservation is expected to be higher for the former sectors alternative econometric valuation estimation methods used are historically data intensive and the limited availability of such manufacturing data make their implementation difficult to predict future valuation accurately the appropriate water valuation metric will be case specific with a consideration of both regional and temporal risks industrial sectoral level valuation analysis is critical to the overall regional water valuation using some of the macro evaluation techniques e g computable general equilibrium modeling and input output modeling for the estimation of indirect local economic impacts from reductions in water availability for the manufacturing sector such as job and gross regional product losses finally several recent case studies of manufacturers provide examples for others while illustrating both the promise and challenges of water valuation while the environmental and social costs of manufacturing water use are still externalized some large multinational corporations have moved toward assessing the value of water via supply chain sustainability initiatives environmental profit and loss accounting estimating risk adjusted values of water hydro economic modeling natural capital asset valuation and developing value chain indices future work in this area could involve employing the information summarized in this review article to develop guidance or a specific methodology for the valuation of water used in manufacturing that encompasses the full extent of associated economic and environmental impacts of such use the emergent linkages between economic valuation and virtual water or water footprint 47 48 could be examined in the manufacturing context to understand more about how valuation metrics of virtual water inputs e g raw material inputs would assist manufacturers in evaluating the reliability of their suppliers in addition researchers collaborating with industry to develop and disseminate case studies on the implementation of water valuation metrics may help make the case for more widespread adoption of such approaches manufacturers that integrate the full value of water into decision making are better able to achieve sustainability goals by justifying expenditures on water conservation technologies planning for water related risks incentivizing water efficiency and stewardship enhancing their

8734,in the manufacturing sector water has been often considered too cheap to conserve such thinking relies on water valuations that limit the value of water to the price paid using such simple methods the share of water cost to total manufacturing cost is significantly small 3 as a result conserving water and enabling technology uptake is difficult to justify economically and slow to advance hindering progress toward sustainable water use however the value of water to a manufacturer is far greater than the price paid valuations such as the true cost of water consider the additional in plant treatment and energy costs and have been gaining greater traction in the manufacturing sector however true cost alone still undervalues water by not accounting for economic and social costs related to scarcity and environmental externalities this paper makes the case and presents a framework for valuing manufacturing water beyond the price paid and the true cost the proposed fuller valuation of manufacturing water takes into account the internal and opportunity costs associated with the realization of water risks the paper follows with a review of a wide range of water valuation metrics both at the specific industry level and regional economy wide level the use of various valuation metrics incorporating the relationship between the change in value with change in water use such as marginal value of water shadow price and elasticity at the specific industry level has been limited in the u s manufacturing sector further a limited number of studies exist on data intensive subjective evaluation techniques such as computable general equilibrium modeling and input output modeling for regional water valuation after reviewing water value metrics several recent case studies from manufacturers from the literature are presented to illustrate both the promise and challenges of a fuller valuation of water as proposed here some large multinational corporations have moved toward assessing the value of water via supply chain sustainability initiatives environmental profit and loss accounting estimating risk adjusted values of water hydro economic modeling natural capital asset valuation and developing value chain indices this paper provides policymakers and technology developers a framework for monetizing water value beyond its true cost and current metrics if adopted such fuller water valuations can help make the business case for the development and deployment of cost effective water conserving technologies thereby improving the sustainability of the manufacturing sector with respect to water keywords water valuation metrics manufacturing use economics sustainability technology infrastructure data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is a critical component for many manufacturing processes aside from its use in manufacturing process operations water in the manufacturing sector can also be used for other purposes like cooling power generation sanitation and fire protection often these uses are essential to operations for example without water for cooling and an alternate heat sink process equipment can overheat fail and cause a plant to shut down consequently water demand and its subsequent value become an important issue when faced with managing or mitigating water related risk events or shocks e g price availability quality these water shocks could occur due to a lack of reliable water supply which could result in higher temporary regional water prices unlike other commercial commodities the price paid for water does not fully reflect the value it provides to the consumer as a result this underpriced resource the uninterrupted supply of which is essential to many manufacturing operations is not optimally utilized and large operational inefficiencies occur the mismatch between price and value inhibits the development and deployment of water saving technologies as the return on investment is calculated using the price and not the value further the low price of water often means that capital improvements to increase the utilization efficiency of other resources with higher operational costs e g electricity are higher priority to manufacturers 1 3 to advance the state of water saving technologies and realize sustainability objectives a reframing of water price to better incorporate value is needed water cost and price e g utility tariff are the two commonly used metrics to understand the economic impacts of either industrial self supply water withdrawals or utility water use in economic terms cost represents the expenditures incurred to produce a certain good while price is defined as the rate at which one exchanges money for a good market prices demonstrate the relation between supply what is produced and at what cost and demand the value to buyers and appropriate pricing mediates between the full costs of production and the demand for the resource however water prices often do not even cover direct costs of supply let alone the full value of water including opportunity and externality costs precluding the efficient and sustainable use of water 4 5 the share of water cost relative to total manufacturing cost is significantly small 3 6 7 driven mainly by low utility tariffs and self supplied sourcing i e no volumetric water or connection costs without consideration of additional necessary in plant costs u s industrial water tariffs vary widely over space and time in the range of 1 to 3 kgal per month 8 9 moreover three quarters of u s manufacturing water intake stems from self supplied sources 10 water is a highly location specific resource meaning that localized water stress is a risk factor for manufacturing operations nearby 5 to date abundant domestic water supply has caused only limited supply risk impacts in specific regions such as california and the southwest further property taxes and local bonds often make up the difference of utility tariffs between the utility cost and the tariff paid by consumers when utilities are still unable to cover their costs delayed maintenance and investments have resulted in failing water infrastructure with negative effects on water quality and reliability of supply for example disruptions to water service in 2019 represented economic losses of 51 billion for the 11 industries most reliant on water including manufacturing 11 because current tools to assess water risks do not fully account for the economic value of water to individual businesses or other stakeholders manufacturers are likely to misunderstand or undervalue water risks particularly in highly developed river basins 12 however water supply disruptions are projected to increase with industrialization environmental water discharge regulations and more drought and extreme weather due to climate change impacts the full value of water to manufacturers should encompass the risks of water shortages or poor water quality that could lead to the disruption of production appropriate water valuation is important to quantify these external and indirect water supply disruption impacts and critical for assessing the potential of cost effective industrial water conservation technology opportunities in addition water valuation would enable individual manufacturers to better understand tradeoffs related to water use when inputs and outputs are stated in financial e g dollar terms water valuation would also be beneficial to local utilities with respect to the efficient allocation of water resources more comprehensive economic evaluation methods specific to the manufacturing region are necessary to facilitate the development and deployment of water savings technologies in industry this paper seeks to establish a framework for improving the valuation of water in order to support decision making processes impacting the sustainable use of water in the manufacturing sector based on findings from the literature this paper identifies and recommends the considerations necessary to appropriately value water as a resource focusing on upstream and downstream impacts to the facility and the ecosystem within which it operates next metrics used in the literature for understanding the value of water are compiled and reviewed finally the paper concludes with summarizing findings from case studies of industrial facilities using a more comprehensive valuation of water 2 water valuation concepts concept of cost price and value the price of a typical commodity is conditioned on its quantity water is a nonstandard commodity meaning it possesses special attributes beyond quantity with no market pricing impacts 13 special water attributes include the following water is mobile flows instead of stocks but challenging and expensive to transport across large distances elevations making it difficult to establish property rights and to dispatch it where needed freshwater availability varies across space and time due to weather climate water quality matters for specific applications it performs multiple social functions calling for regulated pricing it has associated externalities due to high interdependencies among users there is a natural monopoly where cost is mainly driven by amount and type of supply source it can have high demand variability and having numerous decision makers at various levels causes difficulties in public regulation 9 14 in some regions innovations to price these attributes have taken place for example farmers hedge funds and municipalities alike are now able to hedge against or bet on future water availability in california the biggest u s agriculture market and world s fifth largest economy cme group inc s january 2021 contract linked to california s 1 1 billion spot water market last traded at 496 index points equal to 496 per acre foot 15 ideally for sustainable use of water price and value should balance each other 16 price and allocation of water is mostly regulated by government authorities because of the many critical social functions that water performs the price will depend on the set utility tariff in that given region from the utility perspective efficient price signals would help promote water conservation justify expenditures on water saving technologies and help collect sufficient revenue for daily operation and maintenance of the water delivery system and future infrastructure investments 9 17 while for utilities water prices often do not even recover the costs of supplying that water manufacturers generally think of water cost and price as synonymous the amount to be paid to utilities for its use similar to obtaining or use of any product resources however the cost and price will be dependent on whether or not the manufacturing facility purchases or self supplies its water leading to different costs and prices for each manufacturing facilities that purchase water from utilities are charged a certain price based generally on the quantity of water purchased these facilities tend to directly equate this price with the cost of water at their facility in contrast self supplied industrial facilities in most cases need not pay anything for their raw water input 18 if any costs exist their effective price could be the sum of the miscellaneous costs involved such as abstraction licenses infrastructure and technology costs 19 in either case additional direct costs are incurred to use the water direct costs are expenditures directly associated with the establishment and maintenance of the manufacturing facility s water supply infrastructure e g circulating pumps chemicals for treatment in simple terms they relate to costs associated with capital investment and o m or even investing in water conserving technologies as illustrated in fig 1 the price of water is a fundamental type of cost involved in industrial water use today but is a small part of the overall value of water price does not capture all the cost elements involved in industrial water use this is where the concept of true cost must be introduced as shown as the second innermost concentric circle in fig 1 in addition to the price true cost also takes into account direct user ancillary costs like those related to energy chemicals and permits true cost is significantly higher than conventional direct cost utility price but it does not include either the costs associated with managing disruptions or the social costs related to scarcity and environmental externalities commonly referred to as indirect or opportunity costs other alternate costs include the costs associated with ensuring an adequate supply of water to meet production demands this could involve securing an alternate supply of water or re tooling equipment to use water of different quality indirect opportunity costs represent the loss of potential benefits due to misallocation of a resource externalities are the economic or environmental costs imposed on third parties due to an activity over which these parties do not exert any control and which are not reflected in the cost of the goods or services involved for example water pollution due to an industrial establishment could result in increased cost of wastewater treatment for downstream users economic externality or negative impacts to the ecosystem environmental externality 17 social costs for industrial water use may be due to re settlements resulting from water infrastructure expansion and scarcity of water or social conflicts like loss of income or employment opportunities from a lack of water resources currently the full value of the services water provides remains externalized and thus unaccounted for in the manufacturing sector as well as others however fig 1 shows a framework in which the full value of manufacturing water includes all costs depicted as expressed in equation 1 equation 1 f u l l v a l u e o f w a t e r p r i c e t r u e c o s t o t h e r i n t e r n a l c o s t s i n d i r e c t o p p o r t u n i t y c o s t s fig 1 aligns with the work done by rogers et al 2002 4 where the full supply cost contains o m cost and capital charges the full economic cost includes the full supply cost in addition to opportunity cost and economic externalities and the full cost encompasses the full economic cost in addition to environmental externalities ideally the full cost as defined by rogers et al should be equal to the value which includes the value to water users net benefits from return flow net benefits from indirect uses adjustment for societal objectives and the intrinsic value of water appropriate valuation of resources is important in accurately evaluating various tradeoffs that come into play when working to achieve sustainable resource use 20 2 1 monetizing water beyond true cost the concept of the true cost of water is beginning to make inroads in corporate financial frameworks 21 however the other internal costs and indirect opportunity costs shown in fig 1 are not often incorporated various types of risks caused by shocks perturbations and cross sector competition to the industrial water supply can impact manufacturing operations even in the case of self supply water withdrawals water availability could be impacted and the indirect opportunity costs indicated in fig 1 will go up with drastic changes in climatic conditions on a global scale adverse events affecting manufacturing water supplies that are acute short events like droughts and floods and chronic events that unfold slowly like changes in agricultural growing seasons and large shifts in populations needing access to clean water could negatively impact manufacturing water supplies the acute events could create shocks and perturbations throughout the year leading to periods of water unavailability and the chronic events could exacerbate cross sector competition for water supplies this highlights the urgency for industries to better monetize the potential impacts of future water risks on their manufacturing capabilities and thereby the value of water beyond cost price considered today and more aligned with the framing in fig 1 water associated risks can be broadly classified into several types physical regulatory and reputational that lead to economic impacts for manufacturers 22 23 physical risks are associated with restricted access to adequate and reliable water supply causing impacts on its price irrespective of any uncertainties due to future water supply impacts causes of restricted water supply include droughts or floods damaging the water supply infrastructure in addition to loss of water system capacity simply due to aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance changes in water availability e g changes in snowmelt and timing of runoff and the aforementioned cross sector competition regulatory risks are associated with sudden changes in laws or regulations that alter a facility s access to water supplies services and discharges this risk type may affect the water cost associated with the discharge risks from harmful production activities perceived to have negative water related impacts are reputational and these may subsequently cause damage to the ecosystem and decrease brand value or consumer loyalty the value of water to the ecosystem is mostly characterized by these risk types which are not being considered by the industry today the type and nature of these risks depend on several factors such as geographic location or even water use patterns that are unique to each industrial sector and have been quantified both qualitatively and quantitatively with a variety of metrics as discussed in the following section 3 review of water valuation methods metrics limited attempts have been made to quantify the value of manufacturing water use with anticipated growth in the domestic manufacturing sector the effects of manufacturing water use will be localized localization and agglomeration of facilities in specific regions could aggravate regional water scarcity within the manufacturing sector the use of indicators in conjunction with water price can help to identify blind spots associated with the sustainability of its water use in turn this can lead to the identification of water uses that significantly affect production if a particular water use is found to have an enormous impact on production then the facility may decide to take actions towards improving the reliability of the water supply for that use in particular metrics that support the ability to measure the value of water and quantify trends shifts are needed such a class of metrics herein referred to as water valuation metrics can help identify where technologies are needed and evaluate their impacts 3 1 methodology to accomplish the objectives of this study it was essential first to establish the type of metrics that would most appropriately capture the valuation of water use in the manufacturing sector an initial online search through google scholar and scopus conducted in 2019 revealed a limited number of studies available on a global scale that attempted to quantify water use in the manufacturing sector studies focusing on cost and price of water use were excluded while the emphasis was given to studies that focused specifically on the valuation of water use in the manufacturing sector typically from the economic valuation discipline a search strategy was formulated to systematically target books and journal articles that would discuss water use valuation based on the type of metrics identified below e g willingness to pay value of marginal product and elasticity limited available studies specifically for the manufacturing sector were mostly addressed in the economics literature and for mostly developing countries in africa and east asia where water scarcity has been a major economic issue for decades the search and subsequent filtering process resulted in finding a total of 20 relevant technical literary sources the primary criteria for identifying these shortlisted studies were discussion of single or multiple water valuation metrics and their applications within specific industrial manufacturing sectors such as food paper plastics and rubber products leather steel and metal etc available estimates of metrics were tabulated by the metrics type manufacturing sector and countries regions including the aggregate estimates this approach facilitated an understanding of the application of these valuation metrics and their variation across different countries on both regional and global scales the next section will summarize various water valuation metrics specifically it will examine willingness to pay value of marginal product and elasticity 3 2 summary of various water valuation metrics with potential risks due to climate change and the resultant possibility of water scarcity it is important for industries to assess their willingness to pay wtp beyond the cost price paid today for their water needs the wtp metric considers water risk types in terms of the maximum price at or below which a consumer will definitely buy one unit of a product water wtp valuation techniques can be classified into two major categories namely inductive and deductive techniques 23 depending on the type and data level used for industrial value estimation the former technique is applicable mostly at the specific facility industry level and is based on real world data to establish general relationships using a range of methodologies such as econometric contingent valuation and damage cost on the other hand deductive techniques such as value added computable general equilibrium cge and alternative cost models are less data intensive but more logical and analytically applicable for macro level regional or country wide estimation 24 some other commonly used metrics to quantify the value of water are value of marginal product vmp also known as marginal value of water average water productivity shadow price and elasticity coefficients vmp represents the increase in output value per unit increase in water intake while average water productivity is the total output divided by water input both are expressed in terms of m3 the shadow price of water represents the intangible social opportunity cost of water e g the value of a good that can be produced by the marginal unit water used given the quantity of the other inputs such a labor and raw materials also expressed in terms of m3 elasticity is another frequently used water valuation metric employed to understand the degree of responsiveness of industrial water demand and output to variation in various parameters accordingly two types of water demand elasticity metrics have been analyzed through studies 1 price elasticity of water demand which depicts the change in demand of water with respect to change in price or cost of water and 2 water elasticity of output which depicts the change in output per unit change in water input subsequent sections will discuss the various studies that have applied these techniques and metrics to analyze and quantify the value of water by means of cross industrial sector analysis including a few at a regional scale 3 3 facility industry water valuation metrics methods many industrial water valuation estimates as shown in table 1 rely upon econometric methods these methods use an industry representation as a production process where the manufacturing output is a function of capital labor energy materials and water further econometric methods have been employed at the level of different manufacturing subsectors represented by the north american industry classification system naics code range of 31 33 which are further characterized by a total of 21 subsectors of 3 digit naics codes some examples of commonly used production functions include the cobb douglas function and the translog function model regression techniques are then used to determine the coefficients associated with each independent variable standard statistical validations e g r2 value and f statistics are applied to validate the model the production function approach is generally used to estimate the vmp of water water average productivity and the price and output elasticity of water demand table 1 shows several published water value estimates at the 3 digit naics manufacturing subsector level across different countries the vmp is the most commonly used the total number of published estimates for the vmp is higher than the other two commonly used metrics water average productivity and the shadow price of water two sets of value estimates based on two types of production functions i e cobb douglas and translog functions have been used by the ku and yoo study 2012 25 as shown in table 1 estimates by köseoğlu 2018 26 are the average of estimates from eight primary published studies the estimates in table 1 were initially converted to us dollars for the same year using the currency exchange rate 27 and finally to 2021 u s dollars using the appropriate country gdp deflator 28 the leading industrial sectors represented in table 1 are food manufacturing naics 311 petroleum and coal products manufacturing naics 324 chemical manufacturing naics 325 paper manufacturing naics 322 electrical equipment appliance and component manufacturing naics 335 textile mills naics 313 314 and transportation equipment manufacturing naics 336 geographical location was observed as one of the key factors for the variation in these estimates across different studies e g köseoğlu 2018 26 fujii et al 2012 32 and wang and lall 1999 30 the marginal values in water scarce north china are about twice the values in south china based on the 1996 2006 period analyzed in the fujii et al 2012 32 study industrial water use efficiency improved over the years during this period while provinces in the northern region were more efficient in reducing freshwater use for the same reasons of high water scarcity and risk the vmp of water in south africa 29 was estimated to be several orders of magnitude higher compared to other developed countries all published estimates are for non u s countries but the two estimates for developed western countries i e canada and united kingdom may provide some insights for u s water use valuation aside from marginal or average water valuation metrics elasticity is another popular concept evaluated by most studies to date like water value estimates industrial water demand elasticity is generally derived from a production function most of the studies mentioned in table 1 have also estimated price elasticity or the output elasticity of water demand at the industry level as shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively industrial water demand price elasticity estimates for the overall manufacturing sector as shown in table 2 were mostly found to be negative and between 0 and 1 in u s canada mexico u k and india indicating that the water demand is relatively inelastic signaling that price increases would not necessarily be mitigated by or cause a reduction in water demand the manufacturing water demand in water scarce south africa was found to be the most sensitive to its prices or cost with its price elasticities significantly greater than 1 in the study by nahman and de lange 2012 29 a review of price elasticity estimates across 26 studies by köseoğlu 2018 26 shows some pattern in elasticity based on industry type industries using water as a raw material such as food and beverage manufacturing and chemical manufacturing show relatively inelastic demand in comparison with relatively elastic demand for industries using water as a process input like textiles and apparel paper petroleum and electrical equipment for a few regional u s industrial sectors elasticities are estimated to be positive although babin et al 35 state that standard errors in the cases of naics codes of 333 334 and 335 were large enough that these elasticities may not significantly differ from zero some of the studies also estimated the cross price elasticity of demand between water and other production inputs the cross price elasticity of water provides insights on its relationship to other production inputs cross price elasticity of demand i j is the percentage change in quantity of ith input resulting from unit percent change in price of jth input the value of cross elasticity helps in determining whether the inputs are substitutes i e a unit increase in the price of one input will lead to an increase in demand for the other inputs or complements i e a unit increase in the price of one input will lead to a decrease in demand for the other inputs in the production process positive cross price elasticity means the inputs are substitutes while negative cross price elasticity means the inputs are complements cross price elasticity of demand is zero if two inputs are not related estimates from rojas 2005 6 for cross price elasticity of water with other inputs show that water is a substitute for both labor and material kumar 2006 33 found water to be a substitute for capital but a complement to materials and labor for all industries while vásquez lavín et al 2020 31 found water to be a substitute for capital labor and material but a complement to energy in their study on water use for canadian industries dupont and renzetti 2000 34 included two variables in the production function for water use water intake and water recirculation as expected water intake and recirculation are substitutes and the former parameter is a substitute for capital labor and energy output elasticity of water demand is an alternative elasticity metric denoted as positive values to estimate the output impacts of returns to scale from changing the water intake limited estimates of various industrial sectors from two studies are shown in table 3 a range of estimates from the ku and yoo study 2012 25 corresponds to the two types of production functions used cobb douglas and trans log output elasticity of water is significantly small and less than 1 implying an increase in water use does not lead to an increase in final product output quantity water availability has not been found to be one of the major factors of the final manufacturing output for these two countries 3 4 regional economy water valuation metrics shifting the focus from facility level valuations to regional valuations enables better policy around industrial water use to advance technology uptake water valuation metrics used at the regional or economy wide level are based on the analysis of macro level regional data for the estimation of regional scale water related economic impacts the number of studies that have used metrics in this area is comparatively limited with estimates from such studies shown in table 4 average and median water value estimates of frederick et al 1996 36 were based on a wide variety of methods such as average and marginal metrics using the production function approach and contingent valuation techniques for nonmarketed services from 41 different studies the most commonly recurring goal among the studies discussed in table 4 was evaluating existing water usage policies within a given geographical region to understand the obstacles hindering sustainable water supply use and resultant economic growth some of the studies employed quantitative analysis to estimate the intangible avoided cost not considered by conventional metrics such as shadow price m3 or other economic parameters like potential loss of jobs or economic output table 4 also includes studies that conducted qualitative analysis to identify the potential risks associated with these obstacles and the resultant economic impacts 38 39 the obstacles were quantified via scores ranging from 0 to 5 to display the degree of risk associated with water scarcity these metrics were estimated using deductive techniques some common examples of which are methods like cge models or input output model techniques cge models use actual economic data to estimate how an economy might respond when stimulated by changes in policy or other external factors the feng et al 2005 41 study is a classic example of such a study using the cge model to determine if additional water supply from a large scale water transfer project would help overcome potential obstacles due to regional water resource vulnerability another unique modelling approach observed was the meta frontier model analysis technique adopted by li and ma 40 which attempted to identify required policy changes to address the issue of low industrial water use efficiencies in industrial firms located across 30 different chinese provinces the analysis also quantitatively established that the estimated average shadow price was 12 times higher than the actual average price of industrial water across the eastern central and western regions of mainland china 40 input output models have also been applied to quantitatively analyze regional level data to understand any change in production output due to change in industrial water supply a study conducted in athens clarke county ga usa used this approach to quantify the risk of drought occurrence in terms of potential industrial jobs lost and loss of economic output 37 in the absence of any water conservation measures using the county level data for 536 economic sectors adverse economic impacts were estimated in terms of reduction in the gross regional product grp of 244 million and the loss of 4171 jobs even at a small level of risk of drought occurrence of 5 37 most of these studies are focused on valuation efforts for specific geographic locations within a country a complete country level analysis is inappropriate due to a wide variation in both spatial and temporal water use requiring a vast range of data and parameters for complete analysis 4 case studies of water valuation by manufacturers the millennium ecosystem assessment estimates that in the last half of the twentieth century urbanization industries agriculture forestry and fisheries have driven the decline of 60 of all ecosystem services e g carbon sequestration freshwater provision air and water quality regulation storm protection disease control and habitat provision in large part because the benefits of these public goods are generally not priced so markets rarely mirror the full social and environmental cost of production 42 another estimate signifying enormous pressures on the ecosystems on which economies rely is that global production systems externalize 4 7 trillion annually in environmental costs 43 the effective development of payment for ecosystem services pes mechanisms and physical indicators of ecosystem health are examples of the types of better incentives data and decision support tools that will be critical for companies to quantify and manage environmental impacts and business disruption risks across the production life cycle 42 43 further incorporation of pes into internal corporate water management practices can lead to wider adoption of water saving technologies the appropriate valuation of water in the manufacturing sector is nascent but several multinational corporations have made strides in the last decade within the apparel industry supply chain sustainability initiatives concerning the water use of production include the better cotton initiative the sustainable apparel coalition higg index puma environmental profit loss levi s e valuate and water less nike colordry and flyknit zero discharge of hazardous chemicals and levi s wellthread 43 in 2011 the footwear and apparel company puma published an environmental profit and loss ep l account encompassing the cradle to gate impact of its products on ecosystems appraising the cost to society of water used in puma s supply chain as 47 million per year on par with greenhouse gas emission costs 44 this estimate was modeled by pwc and trucost using a relationship between water scarcity and value derived from a wide literature search in order to evaluate in economic terms the drop in the direct use value of water to third parties as a consequence of puma s water consumption as a result of the ep l accounting puma is now focusing on its supply chain specifically water to grow chemical and make leather rather than on its own operations to reduce its water impacts another large multinational that has investigated water valuation is unilever a consumer goods company with more than 250 manufacturing sites worldwide the unilever sustainable living plan has identified water shortages and poor water quality as risks to continuous business operations with recent droughts in taiwan brazil and poland potentially threatening to disrupt production 5 working with unilever mit researchers used the wri aqueduct tool to identify numerous business disruption scenarios related to water estimated their likelihood and consequences and determined available mitigation options to create a risk adjusted value of water aggregated across all event scenarios table 5 demonstrates the substantial differences between the true value and the purchase price of water for four modeled unilever plants the variation in each site s value at risk or business disruption cost would help unilever incentivize water efficiency and basin based stewardship initiatives where and when most crucial improving the resiliency of its manufacturing operations via more optimal water use in texas the dow chemical company partnered with the nature conservancy to better understand water risks for its freeport facility on the brazos river one effort involved hydro economic modeling to characterize future water availability in the brazos river basin and project the scale of economic losses from future water shortages 12 a conservative approximation of loss due to water shortages affecting this single facility was estimated at 900 million 30 year npv more broadly this study underlines that the benefits of water markets and potential implications of cross sector competition in which agricultural users sell their water to municipal and industrial users are lessened in the context of industrialized or water stressed river basins and presents a methodology for businesses to inform strategic planning processes via evaluating basin scale water risks this resulted in the facility pursuing tracking of indicators of water supply shortages convey risks associated with industrial and municipal dominated basins and explore options outside of water trading the same researchers extended their analysis by using natural capital asset valuation to calculate the changing value of all industrial water rights in the brazos river basin under varying water demand and climate change scenarios 45 employing multi criteria analysis for water scarcity solutions using private public and biodiversity related costs and benefits revealed that three scenarios are competitive on cost with the business as usual solution of increased reservoir storage however because these scenarios provide collective benefits to other water users and ecosystems in the basin while individual stakeholders bear the costs more widespread payment for ecosystem services or water funds are necessary to correctly align incentives finally the apparel company patagonia calls for the widespread adoption of value chain indices vci to bring the previously externalized environmental and social costs of production inside individual firms balance sheets 46 a value chain index quantifies ecosystem services e g for water land use and carbon in dollar terms on the basis of cradle to grave production impacts and should ideally be developed jointly by various competitors in a sector and draw on objective life cycle analysis databases achieving true cost accounting would enable manufacturers to find improvements all throughout their value chains while powerful market forces would be put in the service of sustainability s goals 46 5 conclusions the importance of water valuation in support of the use of water as a scarce natural resource has been limited to date in addition to the true cost the value of water must also include the indirect social costs associated with industrial water use a fuller monetization of water that incorporates ecosystem impacts from its use and costs associated with the realization of various water risks will create a more fertile environment for the development of water saving technologies and implementation of conservation efforts until then technology development and conservation efforts will be saddled with the common refrain that water is too cheap this paper reviewed the economic valuation literature to summarize what is known about and understand general trends regarding the valuation of water used in manufacturing it highlights the need to incorporate the true cost of water indirect opportunity costs and other costs associated with the realization of water risks into the value of water indirect opportunity costs include considerations for the loss of revenue from reduced production associated with lost or curtailed water supplies as well as the environmental impacts associated with water use and wastewater disposal costs associated with water risk realization include costs of finding and utilizing alternate water sources and retooling a plant for using water alternatives risks that could trigger such costs can be categorized into three types physical regulatory and reputational with the versatile role water plays in the daily functioning of manufacturing operations the value of water for the industrial or manufacturing sector is close to surpassing that of other sectors like agriculture domestic use power generation and mining most studies indicate the marginal value of manufacturing water use is mostly higher than the price or cost of water supply thereby indicating the need for manufacturers to use value estimates rather than cost estimates for water risk evaluation available water valuation estimates based on a range of different metrics both at the industrial and regional scale in terms of a change or value per unit of water use indicate a wide variability not only across different manufacturing sectors and locations within a study but also across various studies for a manufacturing sector valuation metrics in terms of change in value with change in water use amount such as vmp shadow price and elasticity are appropriate for the evaluation of economic competitiveness of water conservation technologies elasticity is one of the metrics used for an understanding of the responsiveness of water demand to price and process output sectors using water as process inputs like paper textile electrical industries have relatively elastic price demand compared to sectors that use water as a direct input to production like food and beverage industries implying that the effect of pricing on water conservation is expected to be higher for the former sectors alternative econometric valuation estimation methods used are historically data intensive and the limited availability of such manufacturing data make their implementation difficult to predict future valuation accurately the appropriate water valuation metric will be case specific with a consideration of both regional and temporal risks industrial sectoral level valuation analysis is critical to the overall regional water valuation using some of the macro evaluation techniques e g computable general equilibrium modeling and input output modeling for the estimation of indirect local economic impacts from reductions in water availability for the manufacturing sector such as job and gross regional product losses finally several recent case studies of manufacturers provide examples for others while illustrating both the promise and challenges of water valuation while the environmental and social costs of manufacturing water use are still externalized some large multinational corporations have moved toward assessing the value of water via supply chain sustainability initiatives environmental profit and loss accounting estimating risk adjusted values of water hydro economic modeling natural capital asset valuation and developing value chain indices future work in this area could involve employing the information summarized in this review article to develop guidance or a specific methodology for the valuation of water used in manufacturing that encompasses the full extent of associated economic and environmental impacts of such use the emergent linkages between economic valuation and virtual water or water footprint 47 48 could be examined in the manufacturing context to understand more about how valuation metrics of virtual water inputs e g raw material inputs would assist manufacturers in evaluating the reliability of their suppliers in addition researchers collaborating with industry to develop and disseminate case studies on the implementation of water valuation metrics may help make the case for more widespread adoption of such approaches manufacturers that integrate the full value of water into decision making are better able to achieve sustainability goals by justifying expenditures on water conservation technologies planning for water related risks incentivizing water efficiency and stewardship enhancing their
