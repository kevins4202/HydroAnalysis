6785,this paper compares the hydrological responses at the local scale of two models using different degrees of refinement to represent physical processes in sparsely instrumented mountainous himalayan catchments this work presents the novelty of applying at a small spatio temporal scale and under the same forcing conditions a fully distributed surface scheme based on mass and energy balance equations isba surface scheme and a semi distributed calibrated model j2000 hydrological model a new conceptual module coupled to the isba surface scheme for flow routing is presented two small catchments located in mid and high mountain environments were chosen to represent the very different climatic and physiographic characteristics of the central himalayas in the everest region of eastern nepal the results show that both models globally represent the dynamic of the processes for evaporation quick runoff and discharge in a similar way the differences in the model structures and results mainly concern the snow processes and the soil processes in particular for the high mountain catchment the snow pack simulation is shown to be the main driver of the discrepancy between the two models the sub daily variations of snow processes are shown to significantly influence the estimation of the snow melt contribution to discharge keywords central himalayas isba surface scheme j2000 model water budget at the local scale structural uncertainty 1 introduction modelling hydro climatic systems for a himalayan catchments is particularly challenging because of the double edged situation of highly heterogeneous and sparsely instrumented catchments on the one hand sharp topographic variations in this region result in extreme climatic heterogeneities barros et al 2004 anders et al 2006 and on the other hand the high altitude areas have limited hydro meterological monitoring devices a combination of these issues critically limits the representation of hydrological responses at regional scales in the himalayan region the central part of the hindu kush himalaya region ranges from the terai agricultural plain in the south to the highest peaks in the world to the north fig 1 the two main driving climatic processes are the summer indian monsoon which contributes approximately 80 of the total annual precipitation over the central himalayan range bookhagen and burbank 2006 dhar and rakhecha 1981 and winter precipitation arising from westerlies lang and barros 2004 limited access and physical constraints stemming from the region s steep topography explain that the density of meteorological stations is particularly low in the himalayan region recorded time series are more often short in duration and associated with significant uncertainties salerno et al 2015 moreover most of the stations are located in river valleys which may not represent the spatial variation of precipitation in nearby mountain ranges the gridded climate products from regional and global data sets provide a good deal of uncertainty due to interpolation approaches and a trade off between resolution and availability of observed data li et al 2017 various hydrological modelling approaches have been set up for several basins of the central himalayas at different spatio temporal scales from physically oriented representations of processes such as tokapi by pellicciotti et al 2012 or swat by bharati et al 2016 to more conceptual ones such as srm by immerzeel et al 2010 gr4j by andermann et al 2012 and pokhrel et al 2014 gr4jsg by nepal et al 2017a sphy by lutz et al 2014 hdsm by savéan et al 2015 and j2000 by nepal et al 2014 nepal et al 2017b however large discrepancies remain in the representation of hydrological processes among several studies at a regional scale stemming from the variation in modelling applications input data and the processes taken into account for instance for the dudh koshi river basin annual actual evapotranspiration is estimated at 14 20 and 52 respectively of annual precipitation by andermann et al 2012 nepal et al 2014 and savéan et al 2015 estimations of the snow melt contribution to annual stream flow at the outlet of the dudh koshi river basin range from 6 andermann et al 2012 to 27 nepal et al 2014 estimations of the glaciar melt contribution to annual stream flow range from 4 andermann et al 2012 to 19 lutz et al 2014 moreover estimations of the contribution of underground water to surface flow are still very divergent because of the variation in methodological approaches the contribution of groundwater flows to annual stream flows is estimated at about 60 20 and 12 respectively by andermann et al 2012 nepal et al 2014 and lutz et al 2014 the variation is mainly due to the conceptualization of groundwater processes in different models for example j2000 represents two compartments for groundwater storage whereas sphy has one and gr4j has a conceptual representation of groundwater taking into account this difficult context the aim of this paper is to initiate a model inter comparison work by comparing two approaches that have been previously applied to sparsely instrumented catchments in the himalayas namely the work of eeckman 2017 that uses the isba interaction sol biosphere atmosphere surface and the work of nepal et al 2014 that uses the j2000 distributed hydrological model the isba surface scheme noilhan and planton 1989 noilhan and mahfouf 1996 allows to simulate the interaction between the hydrosphere the biosphere and the atmosphere taking into account both the mass and the energy balance at the surface and its propagration into the soil in this study an additional conceptual module is coupled to isba to represent the flow routing which was not originally included in the surface scheme the j2000 model applies a process based approach through calibration parameters and is distributed based on hydrological response units hrus the j2000 model has been applied in himalayan catchments at meso scale catchments such as the dudh koshi and tamor river basin nepal et al 2017b two small catchments were chosen to represent different climatic and physiographic characteristics of the central himalayas the kharikhola 18 2 km 2 and the tauche catchment 4 6 km 2 which represent middle mountains and headwaters of high mountains respectively of the nepalese himalayas input uncertainties associated with both climatic variables and static spatial parametrization for topography soil and vegetation were minimized as much as possible using data sets that have been locally validated based on in situ measurements of both meteorological variables and surface properties the same data sets are used in both models not only for the meteorological forcing but also for the soil and surface descriptions the novelty of the study is to apply in this sparsely instrumented region at a small spatio temporal scale and under the same forcing conditions two models that deeply differs in their degrees of conceptualization on the one side a fully distributed surface scheme based on mass and energy balance equations and d on the other side a semi distributed calibrated model 2 study area the kharikhola and tauche sub catchments are part of the dudh koshi river basin in eastern nepal this basin has a steep topography and high mountain peaks including mt everest 8848 m a s l dominated by a sub tropical climate in lower areas and an alpine climate in high altitude areas see fig 1 these two sub catchments present different climatic and physiographic characteristics the elevation of the kharikhola catchment varies from 1980 m a s l to 4660 m a s l with an area of 18 20 km 2 this catchment is covered by extensive agricultural areas below 2500 m a s l forests between 2500 m a s l and 3500 m a s l and sparce vegetation areas above 3500 m a s l the glaciar coverage on the kharikhola catchment is nil the elevation of the tauche catchment varies from 3980 m a s l to 6110 m a s l with an area of 4 6 km 2 this catchment is sparsely vegetated mainly covered by shrublands or alpine steppes on the tauche catchment the tauche peak glacier is suspended upstream of the catchment and accounts for about 0 37 of the basin s total area according to racoviteanu et al 2013 up to date glaciar inventory the glacial contribution to the flow for the tauche catchment is therefore considered to be negligible and is not included in the modelling applications the main morphological characteristics of the two catchments studied are summarized in table 1 3 modelling approaches the implementation choices are summarized for both models in table 2 3 1 the isba surface scheme and the hdsm routing module the isba interaction soil biosphere atmosphere surface scheme noilhan and planton 1989 noilhan and mahfouf 1996 is implemented in the surfex platform masson et al 2013 to represent the nature land tile the latest version 8 of surfex is used for this work the isba surface scheme simulates vertical fluxes between the soil vegetation and the atmosphere at a sub hourly time step svat model different implementations of soil transfers vegetation sub grid hydrology and snow processes are available in surfex implementations of isba functions described in table 2 are used in this study the explicit multilayer version of isba isba dif uses a diffusive approach boone et al 2000 decharme et al 2011 surface and soil water fluxes are propagated from the surface through the soil column transport equations for mass and energy are solved using a multilayer vertical discretization of the soil the explicit snow scheme in isba isba es boone and etchevers 2001 decharme et al 2016 uses a twelve layer vertical discretization of snow pack and provides a mass and energy balance for each layer snow melt and snow sublimation are taken into account in balance equations the dunnes flow dunne 1983 and hortons flow horton 1933 are separately modelized in isba the dunnes flow is the saturation excess runoff i e the fraction of the precipitation that flows at the surface when the soil is saturated the hortons flow is the infiltration excess runoff i e the fraction of precipitation that flows at the surface when the intensity of the precipitation is greater than the soil capacity of infiltration the horton s and dunne s flow mechanisms are modeled using a sub grid parameterization described in habets et al 1999 the dunne runoff for each grid cell depends on the fraction of the cell that is saturated the fraction of the cell that is saturated depends on the total soil water content within the cell considering the different physiography of the two studied catchments the shape parameter β for the relation between soil water content and fraction of saturated area of the cell is 2 0 for the kharikhola catchment and 0 3 for the tauche catchment isba is set up for the tauche and kharikhola catchments on a regular grid at a 400 m spatial resolution and with an hourly time step since the dependency between mesh cells is not initially implemented in the surfex platform an additional routing module was implemented and coupled to isba offline simulations this module is adapted from the hdsm hydrological distributed snow model model and it has been implemented and used by savéan et al 2015 on the dudh koshi river bassin the advantage of using the isba hdsm coupling is to use both a non calibrated surface scheme for production function and a routing module that has been previously applied on the same area the structure of the module is extensively described in savéan 2014 for each cell surface runoff given by the sum of dunne runoff and horton runoff and the drainage at the bottom of the soil column are directed toward two simple linear reservoirs r s and r d respectively residence times in r s and r d respectively t s and t d are calibrated as uniform parameters over the catchment the sum of the output flows of r s and r d is then directed toward the transfer reservoir which allows propagating the flows according to terrain orography the residence time in the transfer reservoir is defined for each mesh point as the ratio between the flow velocity and the distance from the centre of the mesh point to the centre of the previous upstream mesh point the flow velocity is calculated as the ratio of the mesh point slope and a reference slope taken equal to the catchment median slope this ratio is weighted by a c vel transfer coefficient c vel is calibrated as a uniform parameter the main driving equations of this routing module and its calibration are reported in appendix a the code for this routing module is implemented in fortran90 language and available at www papredata org 3 2 j2000 modelling system the j2000 hydrological model is a process oriented hydrological model krause 2001 the model is implemented in the jena adaptable modelling system jams framework kralisch and krause 2006 kralisch et al 2007 which is a software framework for component based development and application of environmental models the j2000 model includes the main hydrological processes of high mountain catchments a short description of the main processes has been provided in table 2 a more detailed description is provided by krause 2001 and nepal 2012 the j2000 model has already been applied to himalayan catchments nepal et al 2014 nepal et al 2017a to optimize the j2000 model parameters for the kharikhola and tauche catchments we used the base parameter set from a previous study by nepal et al 2014 which was defined for the dudh koshi river basin at the rabuwabazaar gauging station 3712 km2 similarly nepal et al 2017a also used the same parameter sets for nearby tamor sub catchment 4005 km2 to argue that spatial transferability of the j2000 model parameters is possible in neighbouring catchments with physical and climatic similarities out of 30 parameters six parameters were optimized further to match the catchment responses in the kharikhola and tauche catchments the groundwater recession coefficient for baseflow gwrg2fact the coefficient for the distribution of water between the upper and lower zone of groundwater gwrg1rg2dist the recession coefficient for rd1 and rd2 soilconcrd1 and soilconcrd2 maximum percolation soilmaxperc and snowmelt threshold basetemp and the parameter to distribute precipitation into rainfall and snow trs the recession coefficient for floods from nepal et al 2014 is not applied here because of the local scale catchments because of the basin size and climatic variability within the catchment and related scale issues optimization of parameters is suggested the description of these parameters along with their dimensions are available in nepal et al 2017a 3 3 spatial discretization methods the spot dem gardelle et al 2012 as well as soil and land cover maps are provided for both catchments at the 40 m resolution in isba the catchments are discretized over a regular grid at the 400 m resolution sixty nine grid cells are defined for the kharikhola catchment and 28 grid cells are defined for the tauche catchment in j2000 the catchments are discretized into 346 and 132 hrus respectively the minimum size of hrus is forced to be larger than 5 dem pixels i e 0 008 km 2 table 3 summarizes the results of the spatial discretization for both modelling applications fig 2 shows the hypsometric information of the land surface area in different elevation zones although the overall pattern of hypsometry is similar in both models they tend to show fairly opposite area coverage above and below about 3000 m a s l for kharekhola and 5000 m a s l for tauche 3 4 soils and vegetation patterns in order to enhance the local accuracy of soil and vegetation descriptions that are currenlty available a classification of surfaces into nine categories is defined based on field observations and soil characteritics measurements this classification is spatially extrapolated using a semi supervised classification of two sentinel 2 images drusch et al 2012 at a 10 m resolution for the two catchments studied the values for soil depth and texture root depth vegetation type and vegetation fraction for each of the nine classes are shown on table 4 in addition other parameters needed for the parametrization of the models e g leaf area index surface albedo and surface emissivity are taken from the ecoclimap1 classification masson et al 2003 for the representative ecosystems presented on table 4 this parametrization of soil and vegetation is used in both models the classification method and the characteritics of each class are described in detail by eeckman et al 2017 the surface classification established at the 10 m resolution is aggregated at the resolution of each model the classification maps used to parameterize soil and vegetation in both models for both the kharikhola and tauche catchments are presented in fig 3 the overall location of each class is consistent in both models although the two different spatial aggregation methods necessarily induce local differences in these maps 3 5 climatic input temperature and total precipitation are measured at 11 weather stations installed within the dudh koshi basin see fig 1 reliable measurements for short and long wave radiation atmospheric pressure relative air humidity and wind speed are available at the pyramid station located at 5035 m a s l whithin the sagarmatha national park khumbu region nepal and managed by the association ev k2 cnr bergamo italy see fig 1 hourly measurements for these variables are available at the pyramid station from october 2002 to december 2004 at www evk2 isac cnr it hourly time series are computed from measurements over the three hydrological years 2013 2012 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the hydrological year is considered to start on april 1 as decided by the department of hydrology and meteorology of the nepalese government and in general use savéan et al 2015 two seasons are defined the summer season from april 1 to october 30 that includes the monsoon and pre monsoon periods and the winter season from november 1 to march 31 climatic variables are spatially interpolated according to the methods and values detailed in eeckman et al 2017 air temperature measurements are spatially interpolated using a multi linear method weigthed by the inverse distance idw method coupled with a seasonal altitudinal lapse rate the altitudinal lapse rate is computed from the observation 5 87 c km 1 for winter and 5 64 c km 1 for summer total precipitation is interpolated using the method proposed by valery et al 2010 the idw method is coupled to a multiplicative altitudinal factor β the altitudinal factor β is represented as a piecewise linear function of altitude altitudinal thresholds and lapse rates are optimized to provide optimal bias on annual discharge for both the kharikhola and tauche catchments during the summer season precipitation is considered to increase up to an altitudinal threshold of 3470 m a s l 3113 m a s l during winter at a rate of 0 032 km 1 1 917 km 1 during winter then to decrease at a rate of 1 382 km 1 1 83 km 1 during winter up to 3709 m a s l 4943 m a s l during winter for higher altitudes precipitation is considered to decrease at a rate of 0 283 km 1 0 191 km 1 during winter long wave radiation atmospheric pressure and specific air humidity measurements at the pyramid station are spatialized as a function of altitude using the method proposed by cosgrove et al 2003 the hourly temperature is used to interpolate the atmospheric pressure based on the ideal gases law the specific air humidity is deduced from the relative air humidity by combining the wexler law and the definition of the saturating vapor pressure the long wave radiation emitted is computed based on the air temperature using the stefans law since short wave radiation and wind speed have a quite low sensivity in the models in comparison with the other variables these two variables are not spatially interpolated and are considered to be equal to the measurements at the pyramid station for the two catchments studied this interpolation method for precipitation provides optimal precipitation fields for both the kharikhola and tauche catchments for the two hydrological years 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 according to the discharges however the interannual variability is hardly represented in this interpolated data set indeed these 2 years are very different for the kharikhola catchment observed discharge at the outlet reached 48 3 mm day in july 2014 whereas it did not exceed 24 5 mm day in 2015 2016 see fig 4 for the tauche catchment the rainfall runoff ratio was 53 in 2014 2015 and 82 in 2015 2016 considering interpolated precipitation and observed discharge table 5 these variations can be due to the combined effects of i the effective interannual variability of climatic variables ii errors in precipitation measurements in particular concerning snowfall underestimation sevruk et al 2009 iii errors in water level measurements or in the interpolation of discharge based on the rating curve in particular high discharge peaks might be overestimated when interpolated from the rating curve because only a few gauging points are available for high water levels however since the aim of this paper is to compare the hydrological responses of two models when using the same input data set the choice was made not to consider uncertainties in hydro climatic input data but to focus on comparing the simulated responses of the two models 3 6 discharges hourly discharge time series are available at the hydrometric stations located at the kharikhola outlet and at the tauche outlet from 2014 05 03 to 2016 05 20 and from 2014 05 07 to 2016 05 09 respectively see table 1 two hydrometric stations were equipped with campell hydrometric sensors the rate curves for the two stations have been defined using 25 measurements in kharikhola from 0 020 to 7 48 m 3 s and 19 measurements in tauche from 0 003 to 0 202 m 3 s the time series at kharikhola station contains 34 missing data in 2014 2015 due to a high monsoon flood which damaged the sensor the time series at tauche station contains no missing data but additional observations made by a local observer indicated that the river was frozen from 2015 01 22 to 2015 02 28 and from 2016 01 08 to 2016 02 23 discharge is considered as null during the frozen periods a particular attention has to be paid to the discharge peak happenning in june 2015 for the tauche bassin indeed the observed hydrograph increased from 0 06 m 3 s on 22 june to 0 3 m 3 s on 26 june the highest peak of 2015 the precipitation is below 7 mm and remains throughout the period the discharge event may not be due to precipitation events the maximum temperature increased from 7 c to 8 c from 22 to 24 june and then decreased to 5 5 c in 25 june the discharge event may then be due to either snow melt fluxes or instrument error 3 7 snow cover area the mod10a2 product hall et al 2002 provides the maximum snow cover extent over a 500 m resolution grid at an 8 day time scale since 2000 02 26 to present mod10a2 is derived from the modis terra snow cover daily product mod10a1 to compute the mod10a2 maximum snow cover extent from mod10a1 snow cover the following condition is applied if a pixel if considered as covered by snow at least once within each 8 day time lapse in the mod10a1 product this pixel is considered as covered by snow for the corresponding 8 day period in mod10a2 mod10a2 is commonly used in glaciological and hydrological studies in the western himalayas shrestha et al 2011 panday et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2014 savéan et al 2015 nepal et al 2017a moreover the accuracy of this product was assessed in mountainous areas by various studies jain et al 2008 in particular chelamallu et al 2014 concluded that the modis products were more accurate in regions with substantial snow cover than in regions with low snow cover 3 8 modelling strategies observed discharges were available for only 1 complete hydrological year 2015 2016 at the kharikhola catchment and for 2 hydrological years at the tauche catchment 2014 2016 the isba and j2000 simulations over these catchments were run separately from 2013 01 01 to 2016 03 31 the 2013 2014 year was used as a spin up period and the results were observed for the 2014 2016 hydrological years the isba was run at an hourly time scale and hourly model outputs were aggregated to the daily level the isba routing module was calibrated over the whole period of available discharge observations no independent validation period was then considered here due to the short period of observed data the choice has been made to apply the j2000 model at a daily time step in order to be consistent with the work of nepal et al 2011 see section 3 2 indeed the calibrations of j2000 provided by nepal et al 2014 might not be valid at the hourly time step considering the very short period of availability of the water level measurements for the two studied catchments a new calibration of j2000 in this work would not be feasable for this reason the choice has be made to keep using a daily time step to run j2000 model performance was assessed against observed discharge data using the four efficiency criteria coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nse for the square root of discharges nse sqrt and relative bias bias r computed at the daily time scale the nse sqrt has the property of flattening flow peaks and therefore it is used to assess performance for low flow periods zhang et al 2007 to assess performance for high flow the nse criteria is also computed separately for the high flow periods i e from june 1 to september 30 this criterion is noted nse high 4 results and discussion table 5 presents annual volumes for total precipitation solid precipitation evapotranspiration discharge and snow melt contribution in annual average over each of the two catchments studied figs 4 and 5 present the dynamics of simulated variables in both models respectively for the kharikhola and tauche catchments this section aims to investigate in detail the differences and the similarities between the two modelling approaches in order to better describe the uncertainties associated with model structure in the estimation for the annual water budgets provided in the litterature 4 1 evaluation against observed discharge figs 4 and 5 show the simulated and observed hydrographs in the kharikhola and tauche catchments respectively table 5 presents the performance of both models for four different efficiency criteria computed at the daily time scale annual relative bias on discharge for the kharikhola catchment is satisfactory for 2015 2016 for both models 9 7 for isba and 0 04 for j2000 but the discharge at the kharikhola outlet is strongly under estimated for 2014 2015 for both models bias r is 45 7 for isba and 37 1 for j2000 on the tauche catchment the observed discharges are under estimated for both years for both models with average bias r values of 15 6 for isba and 20 90 for j2000 these under estimations are due to the under estimation of total precipitation for the corresponding years as presented section 3 5 for the two hydrological years the dynamics of the observed discharges is accurately represented by the two models for the two catchments with the annual average of r 2 greater than 0 72 and nse values greater than 0 70 during the summer season the discharge dynamics is driven by precipitation with a quick response of the surface runoff for both catchments these quick flow variations are satisfactorily represented by both models low flows including rising and recession periods are accurately captured for both years by both models for the kharikhola catchment on average over the 2 years nse sqrt is 0 77 for ibsa and 0 82 for j2000 for the tauche catchment low flows are clearly represented for 2014 2015 nse sqrt is 0 78 for isba and 0 76 for j2000 the representation of high flow peaks in the summer season is very satisfactory for the kharikhola catchment in 2015 2016 and for the tauche catchment in 2014 2015 nse high values greater than 0 66 an interesting period of discordance between the two models occurs between march 2015 and june 2015 pre monsoon period on the tauche catchment during this period the isba model simulates a fast responding discharge whereas the seasonal inscreasing of the discharge simulated with the j2000 model is slower despite boths models under estimate the observed discharge the discharge simulated with isba during this pre monsoon period are greater than the discharge simulated with j2000 in order to better understand this period of discrepancies between the two models each of the components of the water budget are described in the following section and in particular their behavior during this pre monsoon 2015 period 4 2 components of annual water budgets 4 2 1 precipitation slight differences exist for total precipitation between the j2000 and isba models although the same precipitation input is provided for both models these differences stem from the spatial discretization methods used in both models for precipitation spatial interpolation see section 3 3 indeed even though the input grid data provided for precipitation are the same for both models precipitation is further interpolated by j2000 from the grid scale to the hru scale using the inverse distance weighting method however for both catchments the difference in total precipitation between the two models represents less than 1 of the annual volume 0 98 for the kharikhola catchment and 0 45 for the tauche catchment the difference between both models for total precipitation can then be considered as negligible regarding the solid precipitation the annual volumes considered in the two models also differ for the kharikhola catchment this difference is about 7 mm representing 1 1 of annual average solid precipitation and can then be considered as negligible but for the tauche catchment the average solid precipitation is 219 mm higher for isba than for j2000 this difference represents about 40 of the annual volumes of solid precipitation this significant difference is mainly due to the difference in the time step used for precipitation phase distribution in both models indeed despite both total precipitation and temperature fields are provided for both models at the hourly time step the precipitation phase in j2000 is computed at the daily time step whereas it is computed at the hourly time step in isba however as specified in section 3 8 the purpose of this work is to stay consistent with the previous studies that uses these models the infra daily variations of solid precipitation is then missed in j2000 see section 4 3 for further analysis this point shows that the time step used for the partition of precipitation phase strongly influences the simulation results the propagation of this difference toward the simulated water budgets in the two models is futher investigated 4 2 2 discharge components in isba the surface overland flow is considered as the sum of the simulated dunnes flow and hortons flow see section 3 1 in j2000 the dunne and horton flows mechanisms are not separated and the simulated surface runoff comprises both saturation and infiltration excess runoff the drainage flow at the bottom of the soil column in isba is comparable to the sum of the three flows in the soil in j2000 rd 2 rg 1 and rg 2 the following comparison is given on average over the two hydrological years studied for isba the hortonian runoff represents less than 1 of discharge on the tauche catchment and about 5 of discharge on the kharikhola catchment while in isba this means than the surface flows occur mainly on the kharikhola catchment or almost only on the tauche catchment by the saturation of soil reservoirs rather than by excess infiltration capacity for the kharikhola catchment the annual volume of drainage i e sub surface flow represents 77 of the discharge at the outlet for isba drainage flow at the bottom of the soil column and 87 for j2000 sum of the rd2 rg1 and rg2 flows for the tauche catchment this volume is 70 for isba and 85 for j2000 of the annual discharge the annual overland flow represent 30 of the annual discharge for isba and 13 for j2000 on the kharikhola catchment for the tauche catchment this volume is 23 for isba and 15 for j2000 these figures highlight the significant contribution of soil water to discharge for both middle and high mountain catchments therefore this model intercomparison reveals that most discharge at the outlet is provided by drainage this result is consistent with the description of soils for the two catchments sandy soils allow fast infiltration resulting in a larger fraction if the flow occurring in the soils than on the surface however the definition of drainage strongly differs between the two models indeed in isba the drainage represents the vertical flow at the bottom of the soil column without routing nor delays whereas in j2000 it represents the sum of the outflows from the soil water module 4 2 3 soil water content the conceptualizations of the soil water storage in both models are very different see table 2 considering these structural discrepancies the total water content of the soil column simulated in isba can be compared to the sum of the volumes stored in mps and lps reservoirs in j2000 during the high flow periods between june and october the dynamic of the soil water content simulated with both models appear to be fast responding to precipitation the timing of the simulated soil water content also matches well between both models however on the kharikhola catchment the soil water content simulated with isba is lower than with j2000 during low flow period but this behavior is reversed during high flow period with greater soil water content simulated in j2000 than in isba on the tauche catchment the soil water content is permanently higher in j2000 than in isba this behavior can be explained by the fact that in isba the simulated soil water content is limited by the soil humidity at saturation w sat in mm w sat values are calculated according to clapp and hornberger 1978 as a function of soil texture in j2000 the volume stored in each reservoir mps and lps is limited by maximum volumes maxmps and maxlps respectively maxmps and maxlps are computed according to soil texture for each hru the table 6 presents the average values of w sat maxmps and maxlps for the kharikhola and tauche catchment provided value for w sat is greater than the sum maxmps maxlps for the kharikhola catchment but it is lower for the tauche catchment this parametrization can explain that the soil water content is globally higher in isba than in j2000 for the kharikhola catchment but lower in isba than in j2000 the tauche catchment this point illustrates the fact that the representation of soil water content significantly varies between these two models as well as in other studies see introduction 4 2 4 evapotranspiration on average over the 2 hydrological years the estimation of annual actual evapotranspiration actet on the kharikhola catchment was 22 6 of total annual precipitation with isba and 19 8 with j2000 on the tauche catchment it was 34 4 with isba and 50 6 with j2000 of the total annual precipitation these values include bare soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and snow sublimation actet for the two models in both catchments correlated acceptably at the daily time scale with r 2 0 48 for the kharikhola catchment and r 2 0 38 for the tauche catchment however a major difference can be seen in the pre monsoon period march june in the tauche catchment where simulated actet is higher in j2000 up to 2 mm day than in isba less than 0 5 mm day this delay in the increasing of actet in isba is due to late simulated snow melt in isba indeed the simulated snow pack that limits the evaporation simulated over bare ground remains in isba until june 2015 whereas it melts from march 2015 in j2000 this point indicates that the simulation of the snow melt contribution significantly influences the simulation of both the discharge at the outlet and the evapotranspiration 4 2 5 snow melt contribution for both models the contribution of snow melt to discharge is less than 1 5 for the kharikhola catchment this point can then be considered as a robust result and it allows to enhance the actual understanding of the hydrological cycle for a middle mountain catchment for the tauche catchment the contribution of snow melt accounts for 45 3 of the annual simulated discharge in isba results and 33 2 of the annual simulated discharge in j2000 results for the tauche catchment see fig 5 both models provide the majority 73 in isba and 82 in j2000 of snow melt during the summer season the timing of snow melt between july and november monsoon and post monsoon periods are similar in both models however the dynamic of the simulated snow melt occurring between march and july 2015 significantly differs between the two models on march 2nd a snow precipitation 25 mm in one day leads to a sharp increasing of the snow pack water equivalent in both models however in j2000 the snow pack starts melting after this studden snow fall with snow melt variations concomitant with snow falls on the contrary the snow pack simulated with isba keeps accumulating the subsequent snow falls until may 20th these different dynamics of the simulated snow pack in the two models explain the discrepancy not only of the simulated discharge but also of the simulated evapotranspiration between both models during this period in order to further criticize these simulated snow pack the mod10a2 maximum snow extent product is compared to the simulation results see section 4 4 note that occasionally isba simulates snow melt for air temperatures below freezing but only during winter when the temperatures are low but also the cumulated snow packs are thin this arises for essentially two reasons i solar radiation transmitted through the snowpack when it is fairly thin and radiation is fairly high over 800 w m 2 for the melting events in question can reach the soil below thereby heating it sometimes substantially and to values above freezing thereby causing melt from below and ii when the snow is shallow the snow fraction tends to be low therefore the non snow covered fraction of the grid cell warms considerably owing to the large solar radiation well above freezing this leads to an over estimation of the soil temperature that provokes snow melt at the bottom of the snow pack the second effect can be argued to be not very physically realistic but the goal of this study is not to develop a new physic parameterization but to use the model as is this reveals one the limitations of the sub grid parameterization of the snow pack in isba when snow is concomitant with very high solar radiation at very high altitudes since isba s snow fraction parameterization is quite standard among large scale models this study underscores that improvements should be made for the specific geographic context in this study moreover for isba the infra daily variations of the air temperature significantly influence snow melt see section 4 3 4 3 sub daily variation of snow processes in order to better understand the difference between the two models for snow processes representation the sub daily variations of snow processes are investigated for the tauche catchment the fig 6 presents the hourly dynamics of input variables of the isba and j2000 models total precipitation solid precipitation and air temperature and the simulated snow melt in both models for the two seasons it can be observed that at the hourly time step the dynamics of solid precipitation reproduce the dynamics of total precipitation for both seasons however the typical sub daily dynamics for total and solid precipitation and for snow melt significantly differ between the two seasons during the summer season solid precipitation is maximum at around 5 am usually before sunrise and minimal in the afternoon this can be explained by the fact that during the monsoon period the air humidity is permanently close to saturation the limiting factor for water condensation is then the air temperature consequently precipitation happens when the air temperature is low enough for the dew point to be reached in winter solid precipitation is more important between 18 pm and 3 am than during the day as during the monsoon period total precipitation increases around 18 pm when the air temperature starts decreasing however the air humidity being globally low during winter the air get quickly too dry for condensation to happens consequenly total and solid precipitation remain low during the day the daily dynamic of solid precipitation during winter is then not particularly significant the hourly dynamic of the snow melting is a resultant of both the solid precipitation dynamic and the air temperature dynamic during the summer season the snow melting is driven by both the increasing of the air temperature in the afternoon and the increasing of solid precipitation during the night this leads to a bimodal hourly dynamic for the snow melting simulated in isba however since these snow melt peaks are not compensated by a decreasing during the night the daily average of the snow melting simulated with isba is greater than with j2000 during the winter season the hourly dynamics of the snow melting is mainly driven by the air temperature the snow pack mainly melts during the afternoon and it is refilled by snow melt happenning during the night this leads to a daily average of the snow melting simulated with isba greater than with j2000 during the winter season this analysis of the sub daily dynamics of the snow pack simulated at the hourly time step in isba explains the difference between both models for the simulation of the snow processes and in particular the fact that the snow melt contribution is more important in isba than in j2000 this kind of analysis based on hourly simulation is actually pretty rare in the litterature in particular the analysis of the sub daily variation of the air temperature in a high elevation himalayan catchment presented by heynen et al 2016 is consistent with the behavior presented here 4 4 comparison with mod10a2 maximum snow extent the simuled snow cover area sca is computed by applying a threshold condition on the simulated snow depth in isba and on the simulated snow water equivalent in j2000 for each time step hourly time step in isba daily time step in j2000 each unit of the model grid cell for isba hru for j2000 is considered as covered by snow if the snow depth is greater than 60 mm in isba or if the snow water equivalent is greater than 40 mm for j2000 these values are consistent with values used by biskop et al 2016 on the tibetan plateau and by gascoin 2015 in the pyrenees daily simulated sca and mod10a2 maximum snow extent is compared in fig 7 on spatial average over the tauche catchment for the 2 hydrological years 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the overall timing of the mod10a2 sca is well reproduced by both models with a significant snow period occurred between december 2014 and june 2015 and no significant snow pack was simulated or observed between july 2015 and march 2016 the maximum value of sca 66 is reached for both model on march 2nd 2015 this value and timing is also consistant with the mod10a2 values moreover this comparison leads to two main analyzes first the short duration peaks of swa are better represented with isba than with j2000 despite they remain underestimated by about one third compared to the mod10a2 values this point highlights the fact that using a hourly time step allows to better represent infra daily processes this processes are further described in section 4 3 second snow melt occurring during the pre monsoon period between march 2015 and may 2015 was faster in j2000 than in isba in particular the sca simulated with isba is bound around 0 5 over 2 months the snow pack parametrization in j2000 being calibrated according to the mod10a2 sca and the six snow parameters being particularly adapted for the tauche catchment the simulated sca is forced to reproduced the mod10a2 values in j2000 however the snow pack accumulation simulated with isba appears to over estimate the mod10a2 values during this period this over estimation could in particular be explained by the fact that the land aspect is not parametrized in isba despite it can significantly influence the snow pack simulation for such contrasted relief 5 conclusion this paper aims to assess the impact of using a different degree of refinement to model hydrological processes at the local scale in sparsely instrumented mountainous catchments the methods and results of two approaches that have been previously applied in this region are compared namely the work of eeckman 2017 that uses the isba interaction sol biosphere atmosphere surface and the work of nepal et al 2014 that uses the j2000 distributed hydrological model the isba and j2000 models are applied to two small catchments located in mid and high mountain environment within the everest region in this framework several points should be underlined 1 since conceptual models rely more on calibration data the reliability of a calibrated approach was tested by comparing it to an approach based on energy balance solving in an environment where data quality and quantity is relatively low one of the main results of this study is that both models overally represent the dynamics of the processes for evaporation quick runoff and discharge in a similar way estimations of annual volumes for these components of the water budget are provided and they can be considered as a contribution to the current knowledge of the hydro systems in this region 2 an interesting period of discrepancy between the two models is found for the high mountain catchment at the beginning of the monsoon 2015 in this case the snow pack simulation is shown to be the main driver of the discrepancy between the two models this work also analyses in details the sub daily variation of snow processes the time step used in the model daily or hourly time step is shown to strongly influence the precipitation phase partition and consequently the snow melt contribution to discharge in particular during the summer season this work leads then to suggest for upcoming researches that modelling approaches should be set up at a sub daily time step in order to represent the significant sub daily variations of snow melt processes 3 the contribution of drainage in the soil are shown to be more important than the runoff contribution to discharges for both models and for the two catchments this result is consistent with the physical descriptions of soils based on in situ measurements that describe fast infiltrating mostly sandy soils however this work exposes that the structural hypotheses made in the two models significantly influence the simulation of water storages and flows in the soil in particular for the high mountain catchment this point illustrates the fact that since the conceptualization of the soil processes differs in the different studies in the literature the estimations of these processes are attached with important uncertainties due to the model structure 4 finally this model comparison work performed at a local scale allows to analyse the local accuracy of the distributed modelling approach proposed by nepal et al 2011 that is available at a larger scale over the dudh koshi basin this work applies then the idea that in a context where a very few data is available for the estimation of the performances of the simulations model inter comparison can then be used as an alternative way to estimate simulation robustness based on this research both models present equivalent results for discharge and evapotranspiration simulation in middle and high mountain environments they could be used for operational purposes in two complementary ways i the assessment of water availability considering new scenarios of climate forcing or land use and land cover change and ii the sizing of hydraulic installations

hydrological model delclaux et al 2008 the transfer function of hdsm is derived from the thmb model coe 2000 the hdsm model has already been applied for various studies but this study is the first application of the routing module coupled to the isba surface scheme the hdsm model has been applied by savean 2015 on the dudh koshi basin and showed good performances for discharge and snow cover area modelling for each cell surface runoff r s given by the sum of dunne runoff and horton runoff and the drainage at the bottom of the soil column r d are directed toward two simple linear reservoirs w s and w d respectively w s and w d are characterized by a residence time t s and t d s resp and a volume v s and v d m 3 resp w s and w d are governed by eq a 1 a 1 d v s d t r s v s t s

initial ranges of parameter values for calibration are taken from savéan 2014 considering the few available discharge measurements the entire observation period is used for calibration the calibration

sqrt 0 77 residence times t s and t d are shorter for the tauche basin than for the kharikhola basin residence times calibrated by savéan et al 2015 for the dudh koshi basin are shorter than for the two sub basins in addition the cvel transfer coefficient is significantly higher for the dudh koshi basin than for the two sub basins more physical interpretations for these calibrated values can be found in eeckman 2017 
6785,this paper compares the hydrological responses at the local scale of two models using different degrees of refinement to represent physical processes in sparsely instrumented mountainous himalayan catchments this work presents the novelty of applying at a small spatio temporal scale and under the same forcing conditions a fully distributed surface scheme based on mass and energy balance equations isba surface scheme and a semi distributed calibrated model j2000 hydrological model a new conceptual module coupled to the isba surface scheme for flow routing is presented two small catchments located in mid and high mountain environments were chosen to represent the very different climatic and physiographic characteristics of the central himalayas in the everest region of eastern nepal the results show that both models globally represent the dynamic of the processes for evaporation quick runoff and discharge in a similar way the differences in the model structures and results mainly concern the snow processes and the soil processes in particular for the high mountain catchment the snow pack simulation is shown to be the main driver of the discrepancy between the two models the sub daily variations of snow processes are shown to significantly influence the estimation of the snow melt contribution to discharge keywords central himalayas isba surface scheme j2000 model water budget at the local scale structural uncertainty 1 introduction modelling hydro climatic systems for a himalayan catchments is particularly challenging because of the double edged situation of highly heterogeneous and sparsely instrumented catchments on the one hand sharp topographic variations in this region result in extreme climatic heterogeneities barros et al 2004 anders et al 2006 and on the other hand the high altitude areas have limited hydro meterological monitoring devices a combination of these issues critically limits the representation of hydrological responses at regional scales in the himalayan region the central part of the hindu kush himalaya region ranges from the terai agricultural plain in the south to the highest peaks in the world to the north fig 1 the two main driving climatic processes are the summer indian monsoon which contributes approximately 80 of the total annual precipitation over the central himalayan range bookhagen and burbank 2006 dhar and rakhecha 1981 and winter precipitation arising from westerlies lang and barros 2004 limited access and physical constraints stemming from the region s steep topography explain that the density of meteorological stations is particularly low in the himalayan region recorded time series are more often short in duration and associated with significant uncertainties salerno et al 2015 moreover most of the stations are located in river valleys which may not represent the spatial variation of precipitation in nearby mountain ranges the gridded climate products from regional and global data sets provide a good deal of uncertainty due to interpolation approaches and a trade off between resolution and availability of observed data li et al 2017 various hydrological modelling approaches have been set up for several basins of the central himalayas at different spatio temporal scales from physically oriented representations of processes such as tokapi by pellicciotti et al 2012 or swat by bharati et al 2016 to more conceptual ones such as srm by immerzeel et al 2010 gr4j by andermann et al 2012 and pokhrel et al 2014 gr4jsg by nepal et al 2017a sphy by lutz et al 2014 hdsm by savéan et al 2015 and j2000 by nepal et al 2014 nepal et al 2017b however large discrepancies remain in the representation of hydrological processes among several studies at a regional scale stemming from the variation in modelling applications input data and the processes taken into account for instance for the dudh koshi river basin annual actual evapotranspiration is estimated at 14 20 and 52 respectively of annual precipitation by andermann et al 2012 nepal et al 2014 and savéan et al 2015 estimations of the snow melt contribution to annual stream flow at the outlet of the dudh koshi river basin range from 6 andermann et al 2012 to 27 nepal et al 2014 estimations of the glaciar melt contribution to annual stream flow range from 4 andermann et al 2012 to 19 lutz et al 2014 moreover estimations of the contribution of underground water to surface flow are still very divergent because of the variation in methodological approaches the contribution of groundwater flows to annual stream flows is estimated at about 60 20 and 12 respectively by andermann et al 2012 nepal et al 2014 and lutz et al 2014 the variation is mainly due to the conceptualization of groundwater processes in different models for example j2000 represents two compartments for groundwater storage whereas sphy has one and gr4j has a conceptual representation of groundwater taking into account this difficult context the aim of this paper is to initiate a model inter comparison work by comparing two approaches that have been previously applied to sparsely instrumented catchments in the himalayas namely the work of eeckman 2017 that uses the isba interaction sol biosphere atmosphere surface and the work of nepal et al 2014 that uses the j2000 distributed hydrological model the isba surface scheme noilhan and planton 1989 noilhan and mahfouf 1996 allows to simulate the interaction between the hydrosphere the biosphere and the atmosphere taking into account both the mass and the energy balance at the surface and its propagration into the soil in this study an additional conceptual module is coupled to isba to represent the flow routing which was not originally included in the surface scheme the j2000 model applies a process based approach through calibration parameters and is distributed based on hydrological response units hrus the j2000 model has been applied in himalayan catchments at meso scale catchments such as the dudh koshi and tamor river basin nepal et al 2017b two small catchments were chosen to represent different climatic and physiographic characteristics of the central himalayas the kharikhola 18 2 km 2 and the tauche catchment 4 6 km 2 which represent middle mountains and headwaters of high mountains respectively of the nepalese himalayas input uncertainties associated with both climatic variables and static spatial parametrization for topography soil and vegetation were minimized as much as possible using data sets that have been locally validated based on in situ measurements of both meteorological variables and surface properties the same data sets are used in both models not only for the meteorological forcing but also for the soil and surface descriptions the novelty of the study is to apply in this sparsely instrumented region at a small spatio temporal scale and under the same forcing conditions two models that deeply differs in their degrees of conceptualization on the one side a fully distributed surface scheme based on mass and energy balance equations and d on the other side a semi distributed calibrated model 2 study area the kharikhola and tauche sub catchments are part of the dudh koshi river basin in eastern nepal this basin has a steep topography and high mountain peaks including mt everest 8848 m a s l dominated by a sub tropical climate in lower areas and an alpine climate in high altitude areas see fig 1 these two sub catchments present different climatic and physiographic characteristics the elevation of the kharikhola catchment varies from 1980 m a s l to 4660 m a s l with an area of 18 20 km 2 this catchment is covered by extensive agricultural areas below 2500 m a s l forests between 2500 m a s l and 3500 m a s l and sparce vegetation areas above 3500 m a s l the glaciar coverage on the kharikhola catchment is nil the elevation of the tauche catchment varies from 3980 m a s l to 6110 m a s l with an area of 4 6 km 2 this catchment is sparsely vegetated mainly covered by shrublands or alpine steppes on the tauche catchment the tauche peak glacier is suspended upstream of the catchment and accounts for about 0 37 of the basin s total area according to racoviteanu et al 2013 up to date glaciar inventory the glacial contribution to the flow for the tauche catchment is therefore considered to be negligible and is not included in the modelling applications the main morphological characteristics of the two catchments studied are summarized in table 1 3 modelling approaches the implementation choices are summarized for both models in table 2 3 1 the isba surface scheme and the hdsm routing module the isba interaction soil biosphere atmosphere surface scheme noilhan and planton 1989 noilhan and mahfouf 1996 is implemented in the surfex platform masson et al 2013 to represent the nature land tile the latest version 8 of surfex is used for this work the isba surface scheme simulates vertical fluxes between the soil vegetation and the atmosphere at a sub hourly time step svat model different implementations of soil transfers vegetation sub grid hydrology and snow processes are available in surfex implementations of isba functions described in table 2 are used in this study the explicit multilayer version of isba isba dif uses a diffusive approach boone et al 2000 decharme et al 2011 surface and soil water fluxes are propagated from the surface through the soil column transport equations for mass and energy are solved using a multilayer vertical discretization of the soil the explicit snow scheme in isba isba es boone and etchevers 2001 decharme et al 2016 uses a twelve layer vertical discretization of snow pack and provides a mass and energy balance for each layer snow melt and snow sublimation are taken into account in balance equations the dunnes flow dunne 1983 and hortons flow horton 1933 are separately modelized in isba the dunnes flow is the saturation excess runoff i e the fraction of the precipitation that flows at the surface when the soil is saturated the hortons flow is the infiltration excess runoff i e the fraction of precipitation that flows at the surface when the intensity of the precipitation is greater than the soil capacity of infiltration the horton s and dunne s flow mechanisms are modeled using a sub grid parameterization described in habets et al 1999 the dunne runoff for each grid cell depends on the fraction of the cell that is saturated the fraction of the cell that is saturated depends on the total soil water content within the cell considering the different physiography of the two studied catchments the shape parameter β for the relation between soil water content and fraction of saturated area of the cell is 2 0 for the kharikhola catchment and 0 3 for the tauche catchment isba is set up for the tauche and kharikhola catchments on a regular grid at a 400 m spatial resolution and with an hourly time step since the dependency between mesh cells is not initially implemented in the surfex platform an additional routing module was implemented and coupled to isba offline simulations this module is adapted from the hdsm hydrological distributed snow model model and it has been implemented and used by savéan et al 2015 on the dudh koshi river bassin the advantage of using the isba hdsm coupling is to use both a non calibrated surface scheme for production function and a routing module that has been previously applied on the same area the structure of the module is extensively described in savéan 2014 for each cell surface runoff given by the sum of dunne runoff and horton runoff and the drainage at the bottom of the soil column are directed toward two simple linear reservoirs r s and r d respectively residence times in r s and r d respectively t s and t d are calibrated as uniform parameters over the catchment the sum of the output flows of r s and r d is then directed toward the transfer reservoir which allows propagating the flows according to terrain orography the residence time in the transfer reservoir is defined for each mesh point as the ratio between the flow velocity and the distance from the centre of the mesh point to the centre of the previous upstream mesh point the flow velocity is calculated as the ratio of the mesh point slope and a reference slope taken equal to the catchment median slope this ratio is weighted by a c vel transfer coefficient c vel is calibrated as a uniform parameter the main driving equations of this routing module and its calibration are reported in appendix a the code for this routing module is implemented in fortran90 language and available at www papredata org 3 2 j2000 modelling system the j2000 hydrological model is a process oriented hydrological model krause 2001 the model is implemented in the jena adaptable modelling system jams framework kralisch and krause 2006 kralisch et al 2007 which is a software framework for component based development and application of environmental models the j2000 model includes the main hydrological processes of high mountain catchments a short description of the main processes has been provided in table 2 a more detailed description is provided by krause 2001 and nepal 2012 the j2000 model has already been applied to himalayan catchments nepal et al 2014 nepal et al 2017a to optimize the j2000 model parameters for the kharikhola and tauche catchments we used the base parameter set from a previous study by nepal et al 2014 which was defined for the dudh koshi river basin at the rabuwabazaar gauging station 3712 km2 similarly nepal et al 2017a also used the same parameter sets for nearby tamor sub catchment 4005 km2 to argue that spatial transferability of the j2000 model parameters is possible in neighbouring catchments with physical and climatic similarities out of 30 parameters six parameters were optimized further to match the catchment responses in the kharikhola and tauche catchments the groundwater recession coefficient for baseflow gwrg2fact the coefficient for the distribution of water between the upper and lower zone of groundwater gwrg1rg2dist the recession coefficient for rd1 and rd2 soilconcrd1 and soilconcrd2 maximum percolation soilmaxperc and snowmelt threshold basetemp and the parameter to distribute precipitation into rainfall and snow trs the recession coefficient for floods from nepal et al 2014 is not applied here because of the local scale catchments because of the basin size and climatic variability within the catchment and related scale issues optimization of parameters is suggested the description of these parameters along with their dimensions are available in nepal et al 2017a 3 3 spatial discretization methods the spot dem gardelle et al 2012 as well as soil and land cover maps are provided for both catchments at the 40 m resolution in isba the catchments are discretized over a regular grid at the 400 m resolution sixty nine grid cells are defined for the kharikhola catchment and 28 grid cells are defined for the tauche catchment in j2000 the catchments are discretized into 346 and 132 hrus respectively the minimum size of hrus is forced to be larger than 5 dem pixels i e 0 008 km 2 table 3 summarizes the results of the spatial discretization for both modelling applications fig 2 shows the hypsometric information of the land surface area in different elevation zones although the overall pattern of hypsometry is similar in both models they tend to show fairly opposite area coverage above and below about 3000 m a s l for kharekhola and 5000 m a s l for tauche 3 4 soils and vegetation patterns in order to enhance the local accuracy of soil and vegetation descriptions that are currenlty available a classification of surfaces into nine categories is defined based on field observations and soil characteritics measurements this classification is spatially extrapolated using a semi supervised classification of two sentinel 2 images drusch et al 2012 at a 10 m resolution for the two catchments studied the values for soil depth and texture root depth vegetation type and vegetation fraction for each of the nine classes are shown on table 4 in addition other parameters needed for the parametrization of the models e g leaf area index surface albedo and surface emissivity are taken from the ecoclimap1 classification masson et al 2003 for the representative ecosystems presented on table 4 this parametrization of soil and vegetation is used in both models the classification method and the characteritics of each class are described in detail by eeckman et al 2017 the surface classification established at the 10 m resolution is aggregated at the resolution of each model the classification maps used to parameterize soil and vegetation in both models for both the kharikhola and tauche catchments are presented in fig 3 the overall location of each class is consistent in both models although the two different spatial aggregation methods necessarily induce local differences in these maps 3 5 climatic input temperature and total precipitation are measured at 11 weather stations installed within the dudh koshi basin see fig 1 reliable measurements for short and long wave radiation atmospheric pressure relative air humidity and wind speed are available at the pyramid station located at 5035 m a s l whithin the sagarmatha national park khumbu region nepal and managed by the association ev k2 cnr bergamo italy see fig 1 hourly measurements for these variables are available at the pyramid station from october 2002 to december 2004 at www evk2 isac cnr it hourly time series are computed from measurements over the three hydrological years 2013 2012 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the hydrological year is considered to start on april 1 as decided by the department of hydrology and meteorology of the nepalese government and in general use savéan et al 2015 two seasons are defined the summer season from april 1 to october 30 that includes the monsoon and pre monsoon periods and the winter season from november 1 to march 31 climatic variables are spatially interpolated according to the methods and values detailed in eeckman et al 2017 air temperature measurements are spatially interpolated using a multi linear method weigthed by the inverse distance idw method coupled with a seasonal altitudinal lapse rate the altitudinal lapse rate is computed from the observation 5 87 c km 1 for winter and 5 64 c km 1 for summer total precipitation is interpolated using the method proposed by valery et al 2010 the idw method is coupled to a multiplicative altitudinal factor β the altitudinal factor β is represented as a piecewise linear function of altitude altitudinal thresholds and lapse rates are optimized to provide optimal bias on annual discharge for both the kharikhola and tauche catchments during the summer season precipitation is considered to increase up to an altitudinal threshold of 3470 m a s l 3113 m a s l during winter at a rate of 0 032 km 1 1 917 km 1 during winter then to decrease at a rate of 1 382 km 1 1 83 km 1 during winter up to 3709 m a s l 4943 m a s l during winter for higher altitudes precipitation is considered to decrease at a rate of 0 283 km 1 0 191 km 1 during winter long wave radiation atmospheric pressure and specific air humidity measurements at the pyramid station are spatialized as a function of altitude using the method proposed by cosgrove et al 2003 the hourly temperature is used to interpolate the atmospheric pressure based on the ideal gases law the specific air humidity is deduced from the relative air humidity by combining the wexler law and the definition of the saturating vapor pressure the long wave radiation emitted is computed based on the air temperature using the stefans law since short wave radiation and wind speed have a quite low sensivity in the models in comparison with the other variables these two variables are not spatially interpolated and are considered to be equal to the measurements at the pyramid station for the two catchments studied this interpolation method for precipitation provides optimal precipitation fields for both the kharikhola and tauche catchments for the two hydrological years 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 according to the discharges however the interannual variability is hardly represented in this interpolated data set indeed these 2 years are very different for the kharikhola catchment observed discharge at the outlet reached 48 3 mm day in july 2014 whereas it did not exceed 24 5 mm day in 2015 2016 see fig 4 for the tauche catchment the rainfall runoff ratio was 53 in 2014 2015 and 82 in 2015 2016 considering interpolated precipitation and observed discharge table 5 these variations can be due to the combined effects of i the effective interannual variability of climatic variables ii errors in precipitation measurements in particular concerning snowfall underestimation sevruk et al 2009 iii errors in water level measurements or in the interpolation of discharge based on the rating curve in particular high discharge peaks might be overestimated when interpolated from the rating curve because only a few gauging points are available for high water levels however since the aim of this paper is to compare the hydrological responses of two models when using the same input data set the choice was made not to consider uncertainties in hydro climatic input data but to focus on comparing the simulated responses of the two models 3 6 discharges hourly discharge time series are available at the hydrometric stations located at the kharikhola outlet and at the tauche outlet from 2014 05 03 to 2016 05 20 and from 2014 05 07 to 2016 05 09 respectively see table 1 two hydrometric stations were equipped with campell hydrometric sensors the rate curves for the two stations have been defined using 25 measurements in kharikhola from 0 020 to 7 48 m 3 s and 19 measurements in tauche from 0 003 to 0 202 m 3 s the time series at kharikhola station contains 34 missing data in 2014 2015 due to a high monsoon flood which damaged the sensor the time series at tauche station contains no missing data but additional observations made by a local observer indicated that the river was frozen from 2015 01 22 to 2015 02 28 and from 2016 01 08 to 2016 02 23 discharge is considered as null during the frozen periods a particular attention has to be paid to the discharge peak happenning in june 2015 for the tauche bassin indeed the observed hydrograph increased from 0 06 m 3 s on 22 june to 0 3 m 3 s on 26 june the highest peak of 2015 the precipitation is below 7 mm and remains throughout the period the discharge event may not be due to precipitation events the maximum temperature increased from 7 c to 8 c from 22 to 24 june and then decreased to 5 5 c in 25 june the discharge event may then be due to either snow melt fluxes or instrument error 3 7 snow cover area the mod10a2 product hall et al 2002 provides the maximum snow cover extent over a 500 m resolution grid at an 8 day time scale since 2000 02 26 to present mod10a2 is derived from the modis terra snow cover daily product mod10a1 to compute the mod10a2 maximum snow cover extent from mod10a1 snow cover the following condition is applied if a pixel if considered as covered by snow at least once within each 8 day time lapse in the mod10a1 product this pixel is considered as covered by snow for the corresponding 8 day period in mod10a2 mod10a2 is commonly used in glaciological and hydrological studies in the western himalayas shrestha et al 2011 panday et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2014 savéan et al 2015 nepal et al 2017a moreover the accuracy of this product was assessed in mountainous areas by various studies jain et al 2008 in particular chelamallu et al 2014 concluded that the modis products were more accurate in regions with substantial snow cover than in regions with low snow cover 3 8 modelling strategies observed discharges were available for only 1 complete hydrological year 2015 2016 at the kharikhola catchment and for 2 hydrological years at the tauche catchment 2014 2016 the isba and j2000 simulations over these catchments were run separately from 2013 01 01 to 2016 03 31 the 2013 2014 year was used as a spin up period and the results were observed for the 2014 2016 hydrological years the isba was run at an hourly time scale and hourly model outputs were aggregated to the daily level the isba routing module was calibrated over the whole period of available discharge observations no independent validation period was then considered here due to the short period of observed data the choice has been made to apply the j2000 model at a daily time step in order to be consistent with the work of nepal et al 2011 see section 3 2 indeed the calibrations of j2000 provided by nepal et al 2014 might not be valid at the hourly time step considering the very short period of availability of the water level measurements for the two studied catchments a new calibration of j2000 in this work would not be feasable for this reason the choice has be made to keep using a daily time step to run j2000 model performance was assessed against observed discharge data using the four efficiency criteria coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nse for the square root of discharges nse sqrt and relative bias bias r computed at the daily time scale the nse sqrt has the property of flattening flow peaks and therefore it is used to assess performance for low flow periods zhang et al 2007 to assess performance for high flow the nse criteria is also computed separately for the high flow periods i e from june 1 to september 30 this criterion is noted nse high 4 results and discussion table 5 presents annual volumes for total precipitation solid precipitation evapotranspiration discharge and snow melt contribution in annual average over each of the two catchments studied figs 4 and 5 present the dynamics of simulated variables in both models respectively for the kharikhola and tauche catchments this section aims to investigate in detail the differences and the similarities between the two modelling approaches in order to better describe the uncertainties associated with model structure in the estimation for the annual water budgets provided in the litterature 4 1 evaluation against observed discharge figs 4 and 5 show the simulated and observed hydrographs in the kharikhola and tauche catchments respectively table 5 presents the performance of both models for four different efficiency criteria computed at the daily time scale annual relative bias on discharge for the kharikhola catchment is satisfactory for 2015 2016 for both models 9 7 for isba and 0 04 for j2000 but the discharge at the kharikhola outlet is strongly under estimated for 2014 2015 for both models bias r is 45 7 for isba and 37 1 for j2000 on the tauche catchment the observed discharges are under estimated for both years for both models with average bias r values of 15 6 for isba and 20 90 for j2000 these under estimations are due to the under estimation of total precipitation for the corresponding years as presented section 3 5 for the two hydrological years the dynamics of the observed discharges is accurately represented by the two models for the two catchments with the annual average of r 2 greater than 0 72 and nse values greater than 0 70 during the summer season the discharge dynamics is driven by precipitation with a quick response of the surface runoff for both catchments these quick flow variations are satisfactorily represented by both models low flows including rising and recession periods are accurately captured for both years by both models for the kharikhola catchment on average over the 2 years nse sqrt is 0 77 for ibsa and 0 82 for j2000 for the tauche catchment low flows are clearly represented for 2014 2015 nse sqrt is 0 78 for isba and 0 76 for j2000 the representation of high flow peaks in the summer season is very satisfactory for the kharikhola catchment in 2015 2016 and for the tauche catchment in 2014 2015 nse high values greater than 0 66 an interesting period of discordance between the two models occurs between march 2015 and june 2015 pre monsoon period on the tauche catchment during this period the isba model simulates a fast responding discharge whereas the seasonal inscreasing of the discharge simulated with the j2000 model is slower despite boths models under estimate the observed discharge the discharge simulated with isba during this pre monsoon period are greater than the discharge simulated with j2000 in order to better understand this period of discrepancies between the two models each of the components of the water budget are described in the following section and in particular their behavior during this pre monsoon 2015 period 4 2 components of annual water budgets 4 2 1 precipitation slight differences exist for total precipitation between the j2000 and isba models although the same precipitation input is provided for both models these differences stem from the spatial discretization methods used in both models for precipitation spatial interpolation see section 3 3 indeed even though the input grid data provided for precipitation are the same for both models precipitation is further interpolated by j2000 from the grid scale to the hru scale using the inverse distance weighting method however for both catchments the difference in total precipitation between the two models represents less than 1 of the annual volume 0 98 for the kharikhola catchment and 0 45 for the tauche catchment the difference between both models for total precipitation can then be considered as negligible regarding the solid precipitation the annual volumes considered in the two models also differ for the kharikhola catchment this difference is about 7 mm representing 1 1 of annual average solid precipitation and can then be considered as negligible but for the tauche catchment the average solid precipitation is 219 mm higher for isba than for j2000 this difference represents about 40 of the annual volumes of solid precipitation this significant difference is mainly due to the difference in the time step used for precipitation phase distribution in both models indeed despite both total precipitation and temperature fields are provided for both models at the hourly time step the precipitation phase in j2000 is computed at the daily time step whereas it is computed at the hourly time step in isba however as specified in section 3 8 the purpose of this work is to stay consistent with the previous studies that uses these models the infra daily variations of solid precipitation is then missed in j2000 see section 4 3 for further analysis this point shows that the time step used for the partition of precipitation phase strongly influences the simulation results the propagation of this difference toward the simulated water budgets in the two models is futher investigated 4 2 2 discharge components in isba the surface overland flow is considered as the sum of the simulated dunnes flow and hortons flow see section 3 1 in j2000 the dunne and horton flows mechanisms are not separated and the simulated surface runoff comprises both saturation and infiltration excess runoff the drainage flow at the bottom of the soil column in isba is comparable to the sum of the three flows in the soil in j2000 rd 2 rg 1 and rg 2 the following comparison is given on average over the two hydrological years studied for isba the hortonian runoff represents less than 1 of discharge on the tauche catchment and about 5 of discharge on the kharikhola catchment while in isba this means than the surface flows occur mainly on the kharikhola catchment or almost only on the tauche catchment by the saturation of soil reservoirs rather than by excess infiltration capacity for the kharikhola catchment the annual volume of drainage i e sub surface flow represents 77 of the discharge at the outlet for isba drainage flow at the bottom of the soil column and 87 for j2000 sum of the rd2 rg1 and rg2 flows for the tauche catchment this volume is 70 for isba and 85 for j2000 of the annual discharge the annual overland flow represent 30 of the annual discharge for isba and 13 for j2000 on the kharikhola catchment for the tauche catchment this volume is 23 for isba and 15 for j2000 these figures highlight the significant contribution of soil water to discharge for both middle and high mountain catchments therefore this model intercomparison reveals that most discharge at the outlet is provided by drainage this result is consistent with the description of soils for the two catchments sandy soils allow fast infiltration resulting in a larger fraction if the flow occurring in the soils than on the surface however the definition of drainage strongly differs between the two models indeed in isba the drainage represents the vertical flow at the bottom of the soil column without routing nor delays whereas in j2000 it represents the sum of the outflows from the soil water module 4 2 3 soil water content the conceptualizations of the soil water storage in both models are very different see table 2 considering these structural discrepancies the total water content of the soil column simulated in isba can be compared to the sum of the volumes stored in mps and lps reservoirs in j2000 during the high flow periods between june and october the dynamic of the soil water content simulated with both models appear to be fast responding to precipitation the timing of the simulated soil water content also matches well between both models however on the kharikhola catchment the soil water content simulated with isba is lower than with j2000 during low flow period but this behavior is reversed during high flow period with greater soil water content simulated in j2000 than in isba on the tauche catchment the soil water content is permanently higher in j2000 than in isba this behavior can be explained by the fact that in isba the simulated soil water content is limited by the soil humidity at saturation w sat in mm w sat values are calculated according to clapp and hornberger 1978 as a function of soil texture in j2000 the volume stored in each reservoir mps and lps is limited by maximum volumes maxmps and maxlps respectively maxmps and maxlps are computed according to soil texture for each hru the table 6 presents the average values of w sat maxmps and maxlps for the kharikhola and tauche catchment provided value for w sat is greater than the sum maxmps maxlps for the kharikhola catchment but it is lower for the tauche catchment this parametrization can explain that the soil water content is globally higher in isba than in j2000 for the kharikhola catchment but lower in isba than in j2000 the tauche catchment this point illustrates the fact that the representation of soil water content significantly varies between these two models as well as in other studies see introduction 4 2 4 evapotranspiration on average over the 2 hydrological years the estimation of annual actual evapotranspiration actet on the kharikhola catchment was 22 6 of total annual precipitation with isba and 19 8 with j2000 on the tauche catchment it was 34 4 with isba and 50 6 with j2000 of the total annual precipitation these values include bare soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and snow sublimation actet for the two models in both catchments correlated acceptably at the daily time scale with r 2 0 48 for the kharikhola catchment and r 2 0 38 for the tauche catchment however a major difference can be seen in the pre monsoon period march june in the tauche catchment where simulated actet is higher in j2000 up to 2 mm day than in isba less than 0 5 mm day this delay in the increasing of actet in isba is due to late simulated snow melt in isba indeed the simulated snow pack that limits the evaporation simulated over bare ground remains in isba until june 2015 whereas it melts from march 2015 in j2000 this point indicates that the simulation of the snow melt contribution significantly influences the simulation of both the discharge at the outlet and the evapotranspiration 4 2 5 snow melt contribution for both models the contribution of snow melt to discharge is less than 1 5 for the kharikhola catchment this point can then be considered as a robust result and it allows to enhance the actual understanding of the hydrological cycle for a middle mountain catchment for the tauche catchment the contribution of snow melt accounts for 45 3 of the annual simulated discharge in isba results and 33 2 of the annual simulated discharge in j2000 results for the tauche catchment see fig 5 both models provide the majority 73 in isba and 82 in j2000 of snow melt during the summer season the timing of snow melt between july and november monsoon and post monsoon periods are similar in both models however the dynamic of the simulated snow melt occurring between march and july 2015 significantly differs between the two models on march 2nd a snow precipitation 25 mm in one day leads to a sharp increasing of the snow pack water equivalent in both models however in j2000 the snow pack starts melting after this studden snow fall with snow melt variations concomitant with snow falls on the contrary the snow pack simulated with isba keeps accumulating the subsequent snow falls until may 20th these different dynamics of the simulated snow pack in the two models explain the discrepancy not only of the simulated discharge but also of the simulated evapotranspiration between both models during this period in order to further criticize these simulated snow pack the mod10a2 maximum snow extent product is compared to the simulation results see section 4 4 note that occasionally isba simulates snow melt for air temperatures below freezing but only during winter when the temperatures are low but also the cumulated snow packs are thin this arises for essentially two reasons i solar radiation transmitted through the snowpack when it is fairly thin and radiation is fairly high over 800 w m 2 for the melting events in question can reach the soil below thereby heating it sometimes substantially and to values above freezing thereby causing melt from below and ii when the snow is shallow the snow fraction tends to be low therefore the non snow covered fraction of the grid cell warms considerably owing to the large solar radiation well above freezing this leads to an over estimation of the soil temperature that provokes snow melt at the bottom of the snow pack the second effect can be argued to be not very physically realistic but the goal of this study is not to develop a new physic parameterization but to use the model as is this reveals one the limitations of the sub grid parameterization of the snow pack in isba when snow is concomitant with very high solar radiation at very high altitudes since isba s snow fraction parameterization is quite standard among large scale models this study underscores that improvements should be made for the specific geographic context in this study moreover for isba the infra daily variations of the air temperature significantly influence snow melt see section 4 3 4 3 sub daily variation of snow processes in order to better understand the difference between the two models for snow processes representation the sub daily variations of snow processes are investigated for the tauche catchment the fig 6 presents the hourly dynamics of input variables of the isba and j2000 models total precipitation solid precipitation and air temperature and the simulated snow melt in both models for the two seasons it can be observed that at the hourly time step the dynamics of solid precipitation reproduce the dynamics of total precipitation for both seasons however the typical sub daily dynamics for total and solid precipitation and for snow melt significantly differ between the two seasons during the summer season solid precipitation is maximum at around 5 am usually before sunrise and minimal in the afternoon this can be explained by the fact that during the monsoon period the air humidity is permanently close to saturation the limiting factor for water condensation is then the air temperature consequently precipitation happens when the air temperature is low enough for the dew point to be reached in winter solid precipitation is more important between 18 pm and 3 am than during the day as during the monsoon period total precipitation increases around 18 pm when the air temperature starts decreasing however the air humidity being globally low during winter the air get quickly too dry for condensation to happens consequenly total and solid precipitation remain low during the day the daily dynamic of solid precipitation during winter is then not particularly significant the hourly dynamic of the snow melting is a resultant of both the solid precipitation dynamic and the air temperature dynamic during the summer season the snow melting is driven by both the increasing of the air temperature in the afternoon and the increasing of solid precipitation during the night this leads to a bimodal hourly dynamic for the snow melting simulated in isba however since these snow melt peaks are not compensated by a decreasing during the night the daily average of the snow melting simulated with isba is greater than with j2000 during the winter season the hourly dynamics of the snow melting is mainly driven by the air temperature the snow pack mainly melts during the afternoon and it is refilled by snow melt happenning during the night this leads to a daily average of the snow melting simulated with isba greater than with j2000 during the winter season this analysis of the sub daily dynamics of the snow pack simulated at the hourly time step in isba explains the difference between both models for the simulation of the snow processes and in particular the fact that the snow melt contribution is more important in isba than in j2000 this kind of analysis based on hourly simulation is actually pretty rare in the litterature in particular the analysis of the sub daily variation of the air temperature in a high elevation himalayan catchment presented by heynen et al 2016 is consistent with the behavior presented here 4 4 comparison with mod10a2 maximum snow extent the simuled snow cover area sca is computed by applying a threshold condition on the simulated snow depth in isba and on the simulated snow water equivalent in j2000 for each time step hourly time step in isba daily time step in j2000 each unit of the model grid cell for isba hru for j2000 is considered as covered by snow if the snow depth is greater than 60 mm in isba or if the snow water equivalent is greater than 40 mm for j2000 these values are consistent with values used by biskop et al 2016 on the tibetan plateau and by gascoin 2015 in the pyrenees daily simulated sca and mod10a2 maximum snow extent is compared in fig 7 on spatial average over the tauche catchment for the 2 hydrological years 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the overall timing of the mod10a2 sca is well reproduced by both models with a significant snow period occurred between december 2014 and june 2015 and no significant snow pack was simulated or observed between july 2015 and march 2016 the maximum value of sca 66 is reached for both model on march 2nd 2015 this value and timing is also consistant with the mod10a2 values moreover this comparison leads to two main analyzes first the short duration peaks of swa are better represented with isba than with j2000 despite they remain underestimated by about one third compared to the mod10a2 values this point highlights the fact that using a hourly time step allows to better represent infra daily processes this processes are further described in section 4 3 second snow melt occurring during the pre monsoon period between march 2015 and may 2015 was faster in j2000 than in isba in particular the sca simulated with isba is bound around 0 5 over 2 months the snow pack parametrization in j2000 being calibrated according to the mod10a2 sca and the six snow parameters being particularly adapted for the tauche catchment the simulated sca is forced to reproduced the mod10a2 values in j2000 however the snow pack accumulation simulated with isba appears to over estimate the mod10a2 values during this period this over estimation could in particular be explained by the fact that the land aspect is not parametrized in isba despite it can significantly influence the snow pack simulation for such contrasted relief 5 conclusion this paper aims to assess the impact of using a different degree of refinement to model hydrological processes at the local scale in sparsely instrumented mountainous catchments the methods and results of two approaches that have been previously applied in this region are compared namely the work of eeckman 2017 that uses the isba interaction sol biosphere atmosphere surface and the work of nepal et al 2014 that uses the j2000 distributed hydrological model the isba and j2000 models are applied to two small catchments located in mid and high mountain environment within the everest region in this framework several points should be underlined 1 since conceptual models rely more on calibration data the reliability of a calibrated approach was tested by comparing it to an approach based on energy balance solving in an environment where data quality and quantity is relatively low one of the main results of this study is that both models overally represent the dynamics of the processes for evaporation quick runoff and discharge in a similar way estimations of annual volumes for these components of the water budget are provided and they can be considered as a contribution to the current knowledge of the hydro systems in this region 2 an interesting period of discrepancy between the two models is found for the high mountain catchment at the beginning of the monsoon 2015 in this case the snow pack simulation is shown to be the main driver of the discrepancy between the two models this work also analyses in details the sub daily variation of snow processes the time step used in the model daily or hourly time step is shown to strongly influence the precipitation phase partition and consequently the snow melt contribution to discharge in particular during the summer season this work leads then to suggest for upcoming researches that modelling approaches should be set up at a sub daily time step in order to represent the significant sub daily variations of snow melt processes 3 the contribution of drainage in the soil are shown to be more important than the runoff contribution to discharges for both models and for the two catchments this result is consistent with the physical descriptions of soils based on in situ measurements that describe fast infiltrating mostly sandy soils however this work exposes that the structural hypotheses made in the two models significantly influence the simulation of water storages and flows in the soil in particular for the high mountain catchment this point illustrates the fact that since the conceptualization of the soil processes differs in the different studies in the literature the estimations of these processes are attached with important uncertainties due to the model structure 4 finally this model comparison work performed at a local scale allows to analyse the local accuracy of the distributed modelling approach proposed by nepal et al 2011 that is available at a larger scale over the dudh koshi basin this work applies then the idea that in a context where a very few data is available for the estimation of the performances of the simulations model inter comparison can then be used as an alternative way to estimate simulation robustness based on this research both models present equivalent results for discharge and evapotranspiration simulation in middle and high mountain environments they could be used for operational purposes in two complementary ways i the assessment of water availability considering new scenarios of climate forcing or land use and land cover change and ii the sizing of hydraulic installations

two sub basins in addition the cvel transfer coefficient is significantly higher for the dudh koshi basin than for the two sub basins more physical interpretations for these calibrated values can be found in eeckman 2017 
6786,the combination of remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems gis to measure water quality allows researchers to monitor changes in various water quality parameters over temporal and spatial scales that are not always readily apparent from in situ measurements this study involves using landsat images and in situ data within gis to map urban expansion and its resulting influences on water quality in the pontchartrain basin over the last three decades the pontchartrain basin is located in southeast louisiana and covers an area of 25 000 km2 that encompasses sixteen parishes east of the mississippi river and four mississippi counties a landsat thematic mapper tm image from 1985 and a landsat operational land imager oli image from 2015 were processed using the spectral angle mapper sam algorithm to map urban expansion in order to estimate how water quality has changed in the pontchartrain basin between 1985 and 2015 in situ water quality data from the louisiana department of environmental quality was interpolated using empirical bayesian kriging ebk comparing urban expansion produced from sam classification with urban indices impervious surfaces were better identified and distinguished from other land cover features the results of this study demonstrated that high levels of fecal coliform were consistent with increased urbanization in water bodies in the pontchartrain basin phosphorous levels were higher in 2015 compared to 1985 and were at levels high enough to lead to eutrophic conditions dissolved oxygen levels were lower near the mouth of the mississippi river in 2015 than in 1985 the results indicated that urbanization has negative impact on water quality the geospatial model is recommended to effectively manage and reduce the processing time of large water quality datasets keywords spatio temporal geospatial landsat gis water quality pontchartrain basin louisiana 1 introduction any environment in close proximity to industrial and urban activities faces serious challenges in regards to water pollution population growth and urbanization in the pontchartrain basin has increased substantially over the past five decades causing significant impacts on the water quality and ecosystem health a variety of agencies including the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq the lake pontchartrain basin foundation lpbf and u s geological survey usgs have been monitoring the basin in order to understand how humans have affected its water quality and ecological processes despite these activities there remains a lack of comprehensive land use and land cover change data and analysis for the basin the need to map water quality and identify potential sources of pollution is key to restoring the pontchartrain basin this study utilizes satellite imagery analysis and historical water quality datasets from the ldeq to assess the impacts of land use and land cover changes throughout the pontchartrain basin spectral angle mapper sam classification algorithm was utilized to identify buildings and impervious surfaces in landsat imagery key water quality parameters that were examined are

coliform indicates the presence of fecal matter from humans or other animals in the water fecal coliform is often abundant in areas with substantial sewage contamination empirical bayesian kriging ebk was used to map nitrogen phosphorous dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform over the entire extent of the basin in order to create prediction maps of surface water quality and to analyze seasonal trends in surface water quality we hypothesized that changes in the extent of urban growth as well as increases in agricultural activities have resulted in significant impacts on the ecosystem and water quality over time this research provides a cost effective method for monitoring urbanization and water quality in the pontchartrain basin using remote sensing and gis spatial analysis 1 1 review of urban activities and water quality there is a significant amount of research documenting the effects of land use and land cover changes on water quality around the world mallin et al 2000 brett et al 2005 amer et al 2012a b while numerous studies have examined water quality in the pontchartrain basin information about the relationship between urbanization and water quality in the basin is severely lacking one study in particular by turner et al 2002 analyzed the sources of nitrogen loading into the lake pontchartrain estuary the results revealed that the majority of nitrogen loading into lake pontchartrain during the period of this study came predominately from rivers other less significant sources mentioned in this study included leakage from the bonnet carré spillway atmospheric nitrogen urban runoff and nitrogen fixation turner et al 2002 also states that the nitrogen loading rate in the lake pontchartrain watershed around the year 2000 was approximately ten times greater than what it would have been prior to agricultural exploitation and urbanization a majority of the studies in the area focus on short term water quality trends as a result of some significant event i e hurricanes opening of the bonnet carré spillway and river diversions roblin 2008 mize and demcheck 2009 adebayo and amer 2017 adebayo and amer 2017 demonstrated that opening of the bonnet carré spillway reduced fecal coliform levels in lake pontchartrain in 2008 2011 2016 and that spikes in fecal coliform concentrations were generally correlated with periods of high precipitation opening the bonnet carré spillway can also be associated with spikes in nitrate and specific conductance in lake pontchartrain mize and demcheck 2009 bourgeois calvin et al 2004 analyzed the effect of urban sprawl on waterways in st tammany parish st tammany parish is one of the fastest growing parishes in the southeastern united states u s bureau of census 2000 the report found that land development in the parish increased by 218 from 1982 to 2000 resulting in a loss of over 48 000 acres of habitat it was also noted that fecal coliform concentrations in the lake can be traced back to faulty home sewage systems and commercial waste water treatment plants while urban sprawl does contribute to fecal coliform concentrations in waterbodies it also leads to increased stormwater runoff since impervious cover prevents rainfall from draining into the soil runoff is ultimately generated and collects various pollutants and chemicals before entering rivers lakes and streams within the basin major sources of pollution in the pontchartrain basin include agricultural activities urban growth landfill sites sewage treatment plants and oil and gas refineries it is evident that water quality within certain portions of the basin is severely degraded for example the 2014 louisiana water quality integrated report revealed that 35 of rivers and 12 of lakes were not supported for primary contact recreation swimming and 69 of rivers and 2 of lakes were being impaired for wildlife and fishing a large percentage of the reported pollution sources of impairment are related to storm water runoff from land such as agricultural fields forestry areas construction sites and urban areas ldeq 2014 1 2 review of geospatial urban indices the presence of impervious cover is one of the most distinguishing characteristics of an urbanized landscape because of this the ability to detect impervious surfaces in satellite imagery is essential to understanding the relationship between urbanization and the subsequent environmental challenges a study by wang et al 2015 proposed a new index ndii normalized difference impervious index that is applied to landsat tm images which uses the visible and thermal bands impervious surfaces generally have higher surface reflectance and temperature compared to surrounding landcover types lu and weng 2006 because of this the use of thermal band facilitates surface extraction ndii is defined in eq 1 1 ndii vis t i r vis t i r in the equation above vis is a visible band like tm bands 1 3 and 4 and tir is a thermal infrared band a linear spectral mixture analysis lsma method was also applied to the landsat image in order to compare the accuracy of ndii to traditional methods like lsma lsma is one of the most common methods used to classify and extract impervious surfaces it works under the assumption that the spectrum for each pixel in an image is a linear combination of all components in that pixel wu 2004 a spectral curve can then be produced by calculating the average spectral value of vegetation and then the end members of high and low albedo wang et al 2015 the results of this study concluded that ndii had an overall accuracy of 91 4 when using bands 3 6 and lsma had an overall accuracy of 86 6 while this new index does have increased accuracy over lsma there are still several caveats to ndii one issue in particular is that soil was not easily distinguished from impervious areas in their study area since there was not a significant amount of bare soil present in their study area it did not present any substantial issues however our study area of the pontchartrain basin has plenty of areas with bare soil indicating that ndii would not be a viable method in our case for extracting impervious surfaces similarly as syakur et al 2012 developed an index for mapping built up and bare land in an urban area the index is called the enhanced built up and bareness index ebbi previous indices like ndbi are not able to distinguish between built up and bare land the ebbi applies wavelengths of 0 83 μm near infrared 1 65 μm shortwave infrared and 11 45 μm thermal infrared to landsat etm images built up areas generally have higher reflectance values due to the longer sensor wavelength herold et al 2004 the ebbi uses a root function to cluster numbers based on different reflectance values and is calculated using the following formula ebbi band 5 b a n d 4 10 band 5 b a n d 6 where bands 4 5 and 6 are near infrared mid infrared and thermal infrared respectively the results of the study showed that the ebbi had an average accuracy of 66 24 which is higher than ndbi the authors conclude that limitations of the ebbi are that it needs to be applied to relatively homogenous landscapes and that it is exclusive to landsat etm bands however there are still several reasons why extracting impervious surfaces from satellite imagery is often a challenge first the effects of shadowing of any large feature on the landscape such as mountains trees or large buildings in satellite images affect extraction accuracy there is also significant variation within the same type of land cover class wang et al 2015 in this study the spectral angle mapper sam based classifier was employed to identify urban areas from landsat tm and landsat oli imagery since previous methods using ndbi normalized difference building index and other new indices are not always reliable the application of a sam classifier in this study was advantageous over other indices because it compares each pixel in an image to the signature of a given training site that is representative of urban areas or impervious cover 2 study area the pontchartrain basin is bordered to the north by the louisiana mississippi border to the south by the breton and chandeleur sounds and chandeleur islands to the east by the pearl river and to the west by artificial levees lining the mississippi river fig 1 the boundary of the pontchartrain basin in this report is defined by the usgs environmental atlas of the lake pontchartrain basin in reference to this study the pontchartrain basin is bordered to the north by the louisiana mississippi border to the south by the breton and chandeleur sounds and chandeleur islands to the east by the pearl river and to the west by artificial levees lining the mississippi river fig 1 lake pontchartrain is located in the center of the basin and is connected to lake maurepas to the northwest and lake borgne to the southeast saltwater from the gulf of mexico is exchanged with the system through two natural inlets the chef menteur and rigolets passes and through the mississippi river gulf outlet freshwater from the mississippi river enters lake pontchartrain only during the opening of the bonnet carre spillway built in the 1930s the spillway was designed to redirect water from the mississippi river to lake pontchartrain during times of overflow in the river lane et al 2001 3 data remote sensing is a useful tool in analyzing the effects of land use and land cover lulc on various environmental factors including hydrology biodiversity and even climate change satellites are capable of covering large areas and a variety of features while allowing for repetitive coverage which provides change analysis for various land covers like water and agriculture landsat thematic mapper tm and landsat operational land imager oli imagery were used in this project to detect lulc change in the pontchartrain basin developed in the 1970s by the u s geological survey usgs and nasa landsat is the world s longest continuous collection of space based land remote sensing data usgs 2016 a landsat tm image taken in october 1985 and a landsat oli image taken in october 2015 were obtained from the usgs earth explorer the landsat tm sensor was active on landsat 4 and 5 from 1982 to 2012 usgs 2016 landsat tm has improved levels of spectral radiometric temporal and spatial resolution over the previous landsat mss ozesmi and bauer 2002 tm images have six spectral bands bands 1 5 and 7 with a spatial resolution of 30 m and one thermal band band 6 with a spatial resolution of 120 m the improved spatial resolution of tm data makes it ideal for delineating various land covers the oli sensor became active on landsat 8 in 2014 and is still currently active landsat oli imagery consists of nine spectral bands bands 1 7 and 9 with a spatial resolution of 30 m and two thermal bands bands 10 and 11 with a spatial resolution of 100 m the oli sensor contains two new spectral bands a deep blue visible channel band 1 and a new infrared channel band 9 usgs 2016 band 1 was designed explicitly for water resources and analysis of coastal zones while band 9 detects cirrus clouds barsi et al 2014 water quality data of nitrogen phosphorous fecal coliform and dissolved oxygen from 1980 and 2015 was obtained from the ldeq the ldeq maintains a statewide water quality database that compiles water quality data from over 600 monitoring locations across the state of louisiana and 100 monitoring stations in the pontchartrain basin alone since this database extends as far back as the 1960s it is an ideal source for gathering historical water quality data for our project the lpbf in collaboration with the us environmental protection agency epa began thorough water quality monitoring in august 2000 in order to potentially retract swimming advisories along the lake pontchartrain shoreline since then the agency has expanded its monitoring sites to other bodies of water throughout the basin housing and population data from 1985 and 2015 was downloaded from the united states census bureau website this information was used to compare and verify the results of landsat satellite image analysis for mapping land use and urbanization changes 4 methods 4 1 spectral analysis satellite images of landsat tm and landsat oli were used for identifying areas showing urbanization from 1985 to 2015 spectral angle mapper sam classification was applied to each landsat image in order to identify urban areas sam is a supervised classification technique that calculates the spectral angle between spectral signatures of image pixels and training spectral signatures kruse et al 1993 small angles between two spectrums indicate a high similarity and high angles indicate low similarity petropoulos et al 2013 sam algorithm is an efficient method for identifying spectral similarities between an image spectra and reference spectra amer et al 2012a b 2016 another advantage is that it limits the influence of shading effects in an image that could potentially alter reflectance information de carvalho and meneses 2000 in this study sam classification was applied to a landsat tm image from 1985 and a landsat oli image from 2015 a change detection was applied to both images to quantify how urban land cover has changed between 1985 and 2015 4 2 mapping water quality empirical bayesian kriging ebk was used to map four water quality parameters across the extent of the pontchartrain basin ebk is advantageous over traditional kriging methods because it accounts for the errors of the estimated semivariogram krivoruchko 2012 ebk estimates several semivariograms for each subset of data where as traditional kriging methods only utilize one semivariogram in ebk the input data is divided into overlapping subsets a semivariogram is then estimated from the data in each subset using that semivariogram as a model new data is then simulated at each of the input points in that specific subset a new semivariogram is then estimated from that simulated data this process is repeated until all of the subsets are accounted for krivoruchko 2012 a python script was created using the arcpy module for arcgis software esri in order to automate the ebk process and create interpolated surface water quality maps for dissolved oxygen fecal coliform nitrogen and phosphorous for several months in 1985 and 2015 the need for an automated model of ebk was essential in order to examine monthly and seasonal trends of water quality for our given study period supplementary fig 1 change detection maps were produced in arcgis to display if each water quality parameter had increased or decreased between 1985 and 2015 this was accomplished by converting each prediction map into raster format and applying the raster calculator to see a pixel over pixel comparison of a specific water quality parameter in a given month in 1985 and 2015 after the raster calculator was applied new maps for each parameter were produced that demonstrated how concentrations of that parameter have changed between 1985 and 2015 these maps were then reclassified to show areas of increases and decreases rather than a numerical value 5 results 5 1 urban expansion the results of the spectral angle mapper sam classification on the landsat tm and landsat oli images showed that areas on the north shore of lake pontchartrain experienced urban expansion as well as some areas surrounding baton rouge fig 2 table 1 the change detection analysis revealed that urbanization increased by roughly 0 8 from 290 3 km2 in 1985 to 324 5 km2 in 2015 fig 3 table 2 the results of the change detection analysis also demonstrated that areas surrounding new orleans essentially lost urban areas this is depicted by the blue color areas shown in fig 3 this loss of infrastructure and urban areas was likely due to population decreases after hurricane katrina in 2004 according to a report by the united states department of housing and urban development 2006 the population of new orleans decreased from 484 675 before katrina to an estimated 230 172 after katrina with damage to over 134 000 housing units many residents in new orleans moved to st tammany parish on the north shore of lake pontchartrain after the hurricane since this area was less susceptible to major flooding at the time zoomed in images of sam classification and change detection are available in the supplementary material figs 2 4 the results of the spectral angle mapper are consistent with the u s census housing and population table 3 in 1985 approximately 1 715 156 people lived within the boundaries of the pontchartrain basin and there were roughly 712 909 housing units in 2015 the population increased to 1 911 431 and the number of housing units increased to 831 633 resulting in a 10 3 increase in population and a 14 3 increase in the number of housing units u s bureau of census 1985 2015 in order to validate the accuracy of the urban maps above the results of the spectral angle mapper change detection were overlaid on top of a map produced in arcgis showing the change in population in the pontchartrian basin per census tract fig 4 5 2 water quality mapping 5 2 1 fecal coliform empirical bayesian kriging ebk was used to produce monthly water quality maps in 1985 and 2015 months were chosen based on whether or not water quality data from the ldeq was available for a given month table 4 fecal coliform maps were produced for january march april may june july august and september of 1985 and 2015 fig 5 shows the concentration of fecal coliform based on the epa s ambient water quality criteria for bacteria and the distribution of urban areas from landsat sam analysis according to epa s 1986 ambient water quality criteria for bacteria water with low fecal coliform levels 0 200 mpn are safe for body contact recreation water with moderate fecal coliform levels 200 1000 mpn are safe for fishing and boating but not for body contact recreation water with high 1000 2000 mpn and extreme 2000 mpn fecal coliform levels are not safe for any recreational activities and water in extreme areas cannot be treated for domestic water supply the results demonstrated that the highest concentrations of fecal coliform in 1985 and 2015 were present in the western portion of the basin near baton rouge in 2015 waterbodies near baton rouge had extreme levels of fecal coliform 2000 mpn in january march and april 2015 the northern shore of lake pontchartrain experienced fecal concentrations ranging from 200 to 1000 mpn fig 6 shows the sam landsat change detection overlying monthly change detection maps for fecal coliform these results reveal that fecal coliform concentrations were greater in 2015 compared to 1985 throughout the majority of the basin in january march and april increases in fecal coliform are seen in st tammany parish on the north shore of lake pontchartrain in january march april and june there is a strong correlation between urbanization and fecal coliform concentrations in st tammany parish fecal coliform also increased in the southern portion of the basin for every month measured except may while there is minimal urbanization in this area of the basin it can be hypothesized that fecal coliform is entering this part of the basin via the mississippi river and non point sources such as stormwater runoff 5 2 2 nitrogen and phosphorous drainage of crop and pasture lands north of the pontchartrain basin are responsible for abundant concentrations of organic nutrients chemical fertilizers and pesticides entering the basin s watershed lopez 2004 nitrogen maps for january through september were produced from ebk fig 7 in 1985 nitrogen concentrations were highest neat st james parish in the western portion of the basin nitrogen concentrations were also extremely high 1 mg l in southern portion of the basin in february april may june and august 1985 table 4 the state of louisiana has yet to establish numerical criteria for nutrients in surface water however natural levels of nitrogen in similar ecosystems are generally less than 0 75 ppm epa 1986 it is evident that nitrogen concentrations are much lower in 2015 and fall between 0 and 0 5 ppm which is indicative of a healthy environment overlying analysis of the sam landsat change detection and monthly change detection maps for nitrogen revealed that nitrogen generally decreased throughout the basin between 1985 and 2015 fig 8 an exception to this was in july where nitrogen increased in areas east of lake pontchartrain fig 9 displays phosphorous maps for january through september high levels of phosphorous 0 25 0 5 ppm were apparent in lake pontchartrain in february march may and july of 2015 table 4 these maps also reveal that there is not a correlation between nitrogen and phosphorous during these two time periods the change detection maps of phosphorus show that phosphorous concentrations have generally increased throughout the basin between 1985 and 2015 fig 10 when comparing phosphorous concentrations to urban areas in the pontchartrain basin it appears that high phosphorous concentrations are consistent with densely urbanized areas on the north shore of lake pontchartrain 5 2 3 dissolved oxygen low dissolved oxygen levels in water can produce a significant amount of stress for fish in that environment dissolved oxygen maps were created for january through september of 1985 and 2015 fig 11 in general dissolved oxygen levels throughout the majority of the basin for 1985 and 2015 were greater than 5 mg l which is the epa standard for marine life however dissolved oxygen levels during may june july and august of 2015 were low on the north shore of lake pontchartrain table 4 it is worth noting that dissolved oxygen is highly dependent on temperature and cold water can generally hold more dissolved oxygen compared to warm water u s epa 2013 based on this information it is expected to see lower dissolved oxygen levels in the summer months but in certain areas dissolved oxygen levels were as low as 1 mg l in fig 11 it is evident that dissolved oxygen in the northern portion of lake pontchartrain was much lower in june 2015 than in june 1985 overlying monthly change detection maps for dissolved oxygen and the sam landsat change detection revealed that dissolved oxygen decreased throughout most of the basin in january february april may june july and august fig 12 the southern portion of the basin experienced a decrease in dissolved oxygen for every month measured decreases in dissolved oyxgen seem to be consistent with urban expansion throughout the pontchartrain basin possible contributors of low dissolved oxygen related to anthropogenic sources 6 discussion using the spectral angle mapper sam based classifier with landsat tm oli images is an effective method for detecting urban areas compared to the published normalized difference building index and normalized difference impervious index a major caveat of ndbi and ndii is their ability to distinguish between urban areas impervious cover and large features such as mountains trees or large buildings wang et al 2015 moreover ndbi and ndii demonstrated that soil was not easily distinguished from impervious areas comparing urban expansion produced from sam classification with urban indices impervious surfaces were better identified and distinguished from other land cover features accuracy assessment of sam change detection using the u s census data demonstrated that sam classification can be used to extract urban areas with reasonable accuracy the results of change detection analysis of landsat images in 1985 and 2015 showed that areas on the north shore of lake pontchartrain in st tammany parish experienced urbanization as well as some areas surrounding baton rouge this is consistent with u s census housing and population data u s bureau of census 1985 2015 in reference to bourgeois calvin et al 2004 land development in st tammany parish has increased by 218 from 1982 to 2000 resulting in a loss of over 48 000 acres of habitat according to the u s census bureau the population of st tammany parish increased from 136 594 in 1985 to 250 088 in 2015 u s bureau of census 1985 2015 comparing the urbanization data to the fecal coliform maps in fig 5 shows that fecal coliform concentrations are generally higher in urban areas this is important because fecal coliform is a strong indicator of human waste and activity and has several harmful health risks fecal coliform in surface water can generally be traced back to storm water and wastewater runoff higginbotham et al 1991 mccorquodale et al 2009 adebayo and amer 2017 the presence of fecal coliform in water suggests that the water is likely contaminated with fecal matter from humans or other animals diseases and illnesses that can contracted from coming in contact with water with high fecal coliform counts include hepatitis typhoid fever gastroenteritis and other less severe infections u s dept of health 2016 in fig 5 the highest concentrations of fecal coliform were present near baton rouge and areas showing moderate high and extreme levels of fecal coliform are consistent with urban expansion an exception to this is new orleans this is likely due to the fact that storm water and wastewater runoff from new orleans is traveling south and not entering lake pontchartrain fecal coliform has a strong relationship to precipitation generally months with higher rainfall produce more urban stormwater runoff which results in higher fecal coliform concentrations in a body of water it is likely that there was higher rainfall in these months in 1985 than compared to 2015 however an in depth analysis of monthly precipitation patterns would have to be done to validate this historical monthly precipitation data is not currently easily accessible from noaa at this time another factor could be related to home wastewater treatment systems over time these systems have become less faulty and the technology has improved resulting in more effective bacteria removal from wastewater and an increase in overall water quality an excess of nitrogen and phosphorous in marine systems can result in prevalent algal blooms leading to seagrass habitat loss and widespread fish kills algal blooms occur when nutrient rich waters stimulate primary production in plant like photosynthetic algae or growth in animal like protozoans in some instances these blooms become toxic or harmful algal blooms habs turner et al 1999 some algal blooms produce toxins or harmful metabolites while others harm local organisms by consuming most of the oxygen in the water column as they decay creating hypoxic conditions paerl and whitall 1999 algal blooms are becoming more common and more harmful in coastal areas due to eutrophication or nutrient enrichment of ecosystems experimental and field observations demonstrate that nitrogen is a growth limiting nutrient for phytoplankton communities in lake pontchartrain turner et al 1999 there are also a growing number of public health concerns related to high concentrations of nitrogen in surface waters for example increased nitrate levels in drinking water can result in fatal oxygen levels in infants and even cancer nolan et al 2002 in this study it appears that phosphorous concentrations have increased throughout the pontchartrain basin between 1985 and 2015 while nitrogen concentrations have generally decreased one reason for this could be that phosphorous is retained more efficiently in aquatic systems compared to nitrogen correll 1999 in 2015 nitrogen concentrations throughout the basin generally fell below 0 5 mg l however in 1985 nitrogen concentrations in southern part of the basin were greater than 1 mg l for several months according to a study by cao et al 2018 nitrogen fertilizer consumption increased significantly between 1960 and 1980 throughout the united states after 1980 the rate of increase declined according to this study trends in nitrogen fertilizer consumption are generally related to dominant crop types at the time since certain crops require more intensive fertilizer use based on this it can be inferred that crops requiring less intensive fertilizer use were dominant in 2015 in addition to the establishment of the mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force in 1997 could also be responsible for decreasing nitrogen concentrations in the basin the task force supports nitrogen management activities from all sources and restores habitats to trap and assimilate nutrients in 2015 phosphorous concentrations in the basin were predominately greater than 0 1 mg l when the amount of total phosphorous exceeds 1 mg l in a stream or 0 5 mg l in a lake eutrophication is likely to occur epa 1986 according to correll 1999 excessive concentrations of phosphorous is the most common cause of eutrophication in freshwater lakes reservoirs streams and in estuarine systems in order to control nutrient pollution in the pontchartrain basin the state of louisiana needs to set a statewide nutrient criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous according to the epa a nutrient criteria would enable effective monitoring of waterbodies and the opportunity to restore waters to their designated uses another management strategy to reduce nutrient pollution involves using no phosphorous fertilizer or planting buffer strips of deep rooted plants between agricultural areas and streams or lakes to absorb and filter runoff deficient dissolved oxygen do concentrations can have potentially detrimental effects on fish and aquatic plant communities in marine and estuarine waters factors that can affect dissolved oxygen levels in a given system include nutrient loading temperature tidal energy and stratification engle et al 1999 the results of this study demonstrated that do levels experienced minimal changes in 1985 and 2015 from january to april in 1985 and 2015 do levels were generally greater than 5 mg l which is suitable for marine estuarine ecosystems do levels were lowest in june and july of 2015 in st tammany parish this is likely due to sampling in smaller bodies of water which have less energy input and mixing resulting in stagnant water with low dissolved oxygen low dissolved oxygen was also present near the mouth of the mississippi river there is also a strong relationship between dissolved oxygen and phosphorous in this area in may june and july 2015 where we examined high phosphorous concentrations 0 1 0 5 mg l and low dissolved oxygen concentrations 3 mg l this is consistent with the dead zone that is documented annually in this area the presence of low dissolved oxygen and high concentrations of phosphorous near the mouth of the mississippi river in 2015 is indicative of urban and agricultural expansion in areas north of this region it is evident in the sam classification change detection that urbanization has occurred throughout the entire extent of the basin between 1985 and 2015 as a result increasing anthropogenic impacts such as wastewater discharge and nutrient runoff enter the mississippi river and cause eutrophication and low dissolved oxygen at the mouth of the mississippi river in the gulf of mexico statistical analysis was implemented to compare water quality with the number of housing units per parish in the pontchartrain basin in 1985 and 2015 in the figures below a water quality value was extracted from the centroid of parishes in the basin from the interpolation maps above and plotted against the total number of housing units in that parish for 1985 and 2015 supplementary figs 5 8 the correlation coefficient is given on each plot to determine the strength of the relationship between water quality and the number of housing units per parish these results reveal that there is generally an insignificant relationship between these two factors this could be due to housing development not being a strong indicator of urbanization as a whole adding population impervious cover non residential development to this analysis would have likely show stronger similarities with water quality to determine the conditions of future water quality in the pontchartrain basin a rate for each parameter was established according to the results dissolved oxygen in the basin decreased at a rate of 0 035 mg l per year between 1985 and 2015 at this rate average dissolved oxygen would reach around 5 44 mg l by 2045 phosphorous has increased at a rate of roughly 0 21 mg l per year between 1985 and 2015 at this rate average phosphorous levels in the basin would increase to almost 0 3 mg l by 2045 nitrogen has decreased at a rate of 0 02 mg l in the basin resulting in low and environmentally safe predicted values of nitrogen by 2045 referring to table 2 it is evident that fecal coliform in 1985 had averages that were much greater compared to 2015 this skewed the results when calculating a rate of change between 1985 and 2015 however according to the averages fecal coliform has decreased at a rate of 51 7 mpn 100 ml per year between 1985 and 2015 resulting in a low predicted value of fecal coliform in 2045 7 conclusion the primary objective of this study was to identify the correlation between various water quality parameters and urbanization in the pontchartrain basin using gis spatial analysis and remote sensing techniques by utilizing spectral angle mapper sam classification techniques urban areas with defined spectral signatures were successfully extracted from landsat images this information provided insight on how land use has changed in the basin from 1985 to 2015 surface water quality prediction maps were produced using empirical bayesian kriging to demonstrate estimations of fecal coliform nitrogen phosphorous and dissolved concentrations over the entire extent of the pontchartrain basin urban areas from the change detection image was overlaid on each water quality prediction map in order to examine the correlation between water quality and urbanization the results demonstrated that fecal coliform had significantly increased around baton rouge between 1985 and 2015 and was consistent with the results of change detection for urban expansion nitrogen had decreased between 1985 and 2015 throughout the basin while phosphorous had increased moderately high levels of phosphorous 0 1 ppm could potentially have contributed to eutrophic conditions in many systems in the basin dissolved oxygen levels were suitable for aquatic plant and fish life for january through april in 1985 and 2015 low dissolved oxygen levels were identified in st tammany parish and near the mouth of the mississippi river in may june and july of 2015 after analyzing predicted trends of future water quality in the basin it is evident that dissolved oxygen is likely to decrease and phosphorous is likely to increase in the next 45 years these parameters are directly related to each other and increases in urban and agricultural activity in the basin in order to combat these challenges the state of louisiana needs to establish nutrient criteria for phosphorous in order to ensure healthy ecosystems throughout the basin in conclusion this research revealed that urban expansion increased anthropogenic activities such as wastewater discharge and nutrient runoff that ultimately led to impaired water quality in the pontchartrain basin acknowledgements this research was partially

6786,the combination of remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems gis to measure water quality allows researchers to monitor changes in various water quality parameters over temporal and spatial scales that are not always readily apparent from in situ measurements this study involves using landsat images and in situ data within gis to map urban expansion and its resulting influences on water quality in the pontchartrain basin over the last three decades the pontchartrain basin is located in southeast louisiana and covers an area of 25 000 km2 that encompasses sixteen parishes east of the mississippi river and four mississippi counties a landsat thematic mapper tm image from 1985 and a landsat operational land imager oli image from 2015 were processed using the spectral angle mapper sam algorithm to map urban expansion in order to estimate how water quality has changed in the pontchartrain basin between 1985 and 2015 in situ water quality data from the louisiana department of environmental quality was interpolated using empirical bayesian kriging ebk comparing urban expansion produced from sam classification with urban indices impervious surfaces were better identified and distinguished from other land cover features the results of this study demonstrated that high levels of fecal coliform were consistent with increased urbanization in water bodies in the pontchartrain basin phosphorous levels were higher in 2015 compared to 1985 and were at levels high enough to lead to eutrophic conditions dissolved oxygen levels were lower near the mouth of the mississippi river in 2015 than in 1985 the results indicated that urbanization has negative impact on water quality the geospatial model is recommended to effectively manage and reduce the processing time of large water quality datasets keywords spatio temporal geospatial landsat gis water quality pontchartrain basin louisiana 1 introduction any environment in close proximity to industrial and urban activities faces serious challenges in regards to water pollution population growth and urbanization in the pontchartrain basin has increased substantially over the past five decades causing significant impacts on the water quality and ecosystem health a variety of agencies including the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq the lake pontchartrain basin foundation lpbf and u s geological survey usgs have been monitoring the basin in order to understand how humans have affected its water quality and ecological processes despite these activities there remains a lack of comprehensive land use and land cover change data and analysis for the basin the need to map water quality and identify potential sources of pollution is key to restoring the pontchartrain basin this study utilizes satellite imagery analysis and historical water quality datasets from the ldeq to assess the impacts of land use and land cover changes throughout the pontchartrain basin spectral angle mapper sam classification algorithm was utilized to identify buildings and impervious surfaces in landsat imagery key water quality parameters that were examined are nitrogen phosphorous fecal coliform and dissolved oxygen nitrogen and phosphorous in water bodies indicate the presence of nutrients which are likely originating from agricultural runoff while fecal coliform indicates the presence of fecal matter from humans or other animals in the water fecal coliform is often abundant in areas with substantial sewage contamination empirical bayesian kriging ebk was used to map nitrogen phosphorous dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform over the entire extent of the basin in order to create prediction maps of surface water quality and to analyze seasonal trends in surface water quality we hypothesized that changes in the extent of urban growth as well as increases in agricultural activities have resulted in significant impacts on the ecosystem and water quality over time this research provides a cost effective method for monitoring urbanization and water quality in the pontchartrain basin using remote sensing and gis spatial analysis 1 1 review of urban activities and water quality there is a significant amount of research documenting the effects of land use and land cover changes on water quality around the world mallin et al 2000 brett et al 2005 amer et al 2012a b while numerous studies have examined water quality in the pontchartrain basin information about the relationship between urbanization and water quality in the basin is severely lacking one study in particular by turner et al 2002 analyzed the sources of nitrogen loading into the lake pontchartrain estuary the results revealed that the majority of nitrogen loading into lake pontchartrain during the period of this study came predominately from rivers other less significant sources mentioned in this study included leakage from the bonnet carré spillway atmospheric nitrogen urban runoff and nitrogen fixation turner et al 2002 also states that the nitrogen loading rate in the lake pontchartrain watershed around the year 2000 was approximately ten times greater than what it would have been prior to agricultural exploitation and urbanization a majority of the studies in the area focus on short term water quality trends as a result of some significant event i e hurricanes opening of the bonnet carré spillway and river diversions roblin 2008 mize and demcheck 2009 adebayo and amer 2017 adebayo and amer 2017 demonstrated that opening of the bonnet carré spillway reduced fecal coliform levels in lake pontchartrain in 2008 2011 2016 and that spikes in fecal coliform concentrations were generally correlated with periods of high precipitation opening the bonnet carré spillway can also be associated with spikes in nitrate and specific conductance in lake pontchartrain mize and demcheck 2009 bourgeois calvin et al 2004 analyzed the effect of urban sprawl on waterways in st tammany parish st tammany parish is one of the fastest growing parishes in the southeastern united states u s bureau of census 2000 the report found that land development in the parish increased by 218 from 1982 to 2000 resulting in a loss of over 48 000 acres of habitat it was also noted that fecal coliform concentrations in the lake can be traced back to faulty home sewage systems and commercial waste water treatment plants while urban sprawl does contribute to fecal coliform concentrations in waterbodies it also leads to increased stormwater runoff since impervious cover prevents rainfall from draining into the soil runoff is ultimately generated and collects various pollutants and chemicals before entering rivers lakes and streams within the basin major sources of pollution in the pontchartrain basin include agricultural activities urban growth landfill sites sewage treatment plants and oil and gas refineries it is evident that water quality within certain portions of the basin is severely degraded for example the 2014 louisiana water quality integrated report revealed that 35 of rivers and 12 of lakes were not supported for primary contact recreation swimming and 69 of rivers and 2 of lakes were being impaired for wildlife and fishing a large percentage of the reported pollution sources of impairment are related to storm water runoff from land such as agricultural fields forestry areas construction sites and urban areas ldeq 2014 1 2 review of geospatial urban indices the presence of impervious cover is one of the most distinguishing characteristics of an urbanized landscape because of this the ability to detect impervious surfaces in satellite imagery is essential to understanding the relationship between urbanization and the subsequent environmental challenges a study by wang et al 2015 proposed a new index ndii normalized difference impervious index that is applied to landsat tm images which uses the visible and thermal bands impervious surfaces generally have higher surface reflectance and temperature compared to surrounding landcover types lu and weng 2006 because of this the use of thermal band facilitates surface extraction ndii is defined in eq 1 1 ndii vis t i r vis t i r in the equation above vis is a visible band like tm bands 1 3 and 4 and tir is a thermal infrared band a linear spectral mixture analysis lsma method was also applied to the landsat image in order to compare the accuracy of ndii to traditional methods like lsma lsma is one of the most common methods used to classify and extract impervious surfaces it works under the assumption that the spectrum for each pixel in an image is a linear combination of all components in that pixel wu 2004 a spectral curve can then be produced by calculating the average spectral value of vegetation and then the end members of high and low albedo wang et al 2015 the results of this study concluded that ndii had an overall accuracy of 91 4 when using bands 3 6 and lsma had an overall accuracy of 86 6 while this new index does have increased accuracy over lsma there are still several caveats to ndii one issue in particular is that soil was not easily distinguished from impervious areas in their study area since there was not a significant amount of bare soil present in their study area it did not present any substantial issues however our study area of the pontchartrain basin has plenty of areas with bare soil indicating that ndii would not be a viable method in our case for extracting impervious surfaces similarly as syakur et al 2012 developed an index for mapping built up and bare land in an urban area the index is called the enhanced built up and bareness index ebbi previous indices like ndbi are not able to distinguish between built up and bare land the ebbi applies wavelengths of 0 83 μm near infrared 1 65 μm shortwave infrared and 11 45 μm thermal infrared to landsat etm images built up areas generally have higher reflectance values due to the longer sensor wavelength herold et al 2004 the ebbi uses a root function to cluster numbers based on different reflectance values and is calculated using the following formula ebbi band 5 b a n d 4 10 band 5 b a n d 6 where bands 4 5 and 6 are near infrared mid infrared and thermal infrared respectively the results of the study showed that the ebbi had an average accuracy of 66 24 which is higher than ndbi the authors conclude that limitations of the ebbi are that it needs to be applied to relatively homogenous landscapes and that it is exclusive to landsat etm bands however there are still several reasons why extracting impervious surfaces from satellite imagery is often a challenge first the effects of shadowing of any large feature on the landscape such as mountains trees or large buildings in satellite images affect extraction accuracy there is also significant variation within the same type of land cover class wang et al 2015 in this study the spectral angle mapper sam based classifier was employed to identify urban areas from landsat tm and landsat oli imagery since previous methods using ndbi normalized difference building index and other new indices are not always reliable the application of a sam classifier in this study was advantageous over other indices because it compares each pixel in an image to the signature of a given training site that is representative of urban areas or impervious cover 2 study area the pontchartrain basin is bordered to the north by the louisiana mississippi border to the south by the breton and chandeleur sounds and chandeleur islands to the east by the pearl river and to the west by artificial levees lining the mississippi river fig 1 the boundary of the pontchartrain basin in this report is defined by the usgs environmental atlas of the lake pontchartrain basin in reference to this study the pontchartrain basin is bordered to the north by the louisiana mississippi border to the south by the breton and chandeleur sounds and chandeleur islands to the east by the pearl river and to the west by artificial levees lining the mississippi river fig 1 lake pontchartrain is located in the center of the basin and is connected to lake maurepas to the northwest and lake borgne to the southeast saltwater from the gulf of mexico is exchanged with the system through two natural inlets the chef menteur and rigolets passes and through the mississippi river gulf outlet freshwater from the mississippi river enters lake pontchartrain only during the opening of the bonnet carre spillway built in the 1930s the spillway was designed to redirect water from the mississippi river to lake pontchartrain during times of overflow in the river lane et al 2001 3 data remote sensing is a useful tool in analyzing the effects of land use and land cover lulc on various environmental factors including hydrology biodiversity and even climate change satellites are capable of covering large areas and a variety of features while allowing for repetitive coverage which provides change analysis for various land covers like water and agriculture landsat thematic mapper tm and landsat operational land imager oli imagery were used in this project to detect lulc change in the pontchartrain basin developed in the 1970s by the u s geological survey usgs and nasa landsat is the world s longest continuous collection of space based land remote sensing data usgs 2016 a landsat tm image taken in october 1985 and a landsat oli image taken in october 2015 were obtained from the usgs earth explorer the landsat tm sensor was active on landsat 4 and 5 from 1982 to 2012 usgs 2016 landsat tm has improved levels of spectral radiometric temporal and spatial resolution over the previous landsat mss ozesmi and bauer 2002 tm images have six spectral bands bands 1 5 and 7 with a spatial resolution of 30 m and one thermal band band 6 with a spatial resolution of 120 m the improved spatial resolution of tm data makes it ideal for delineating various land covers the oli sensor became active on landsat 8 in 2014 and is still currently active landsat oli imagery consists of nine spectral bands bands 1 7 and 9 with a spatial resolution of 30 m and two thermal bands bands 10 and 11 with a spatial resolution of 100 m the oli sensor contains two new spectral bands a deep blue visible channel band 1 and a new infrared channel band 9 usgs 2016 band 1 was designed explicitly for water resources and analysis of coastal zones while band 9 detects cirrus clouds barsi et al 2014 water quality data of nitrogen phosphorous fecal coliform and dissolved oxygen from 1980 and 2015 was obtained from the ldeq the ldeq maintains a statewide water quality database that compiles water quality data from over 600 monitoring locations across the state of louisiana and 100 monitoring stations in the pontchartrain basin alone since this database extends as far back as the 1960s it is an ideal source for gathering historical water quality data for our project the lpbf in collaboration with the us environmental protection agency epa began thorough water quality monitoring in august 2000 in order to potentially retract swimming advisories along the lake pontchartrain shoreline since then the agency has expanded its monitoring sites to other bodies of water throughout the basin housing and population data from 1985 and 2015 was downloaded from the united states census bureau website this information was used to compare and verify the results of landsat satellite image analysis for mapping land use and urbanization changes 4 methods 4 1 spectral analysis satellite images of landsat tm and landsat oli were used for identifying areas showing urbanization from 1985 to 2015 spectral angle mapper sam classification was applied to each landsat image in order to identify urban areas sam is a supervised classification technique that calculates the spectral angle between spectral signatures of image pixels and training spectral signatures kruse et al 1993 small angles between two spectrums indicate a high similarity and high angles indicate low similarity petropoulos et al 2013 sam algorithm is an efficient method for identifying spectral similarities between an image spectra and reference spectra amer et al 2012a b 2016 another advantage is that it limits the influence of shading effects in an image that could potentially alter reflectance information de carvalho and meneses 2000 in this study sam classification was applied to a landsat tm image from 1985 and a landsat oli image from 2015 a change detection was applied to both images to quantify how urban land cover has changed between 1985 and 2015 4 2 mapping water quality empirical bayesian kriging ebk was used to map four water quality parameters across the extent of the pontchartrain basin ebk is advantageous over traditional kriging methods because it accounts for the errors of the estimated semivariogram krivoruchko 2012 ebk estimates several semivariograms for each subset of data where as traditional kriging methods only utilize one semivariogram in ebk the input data is divided into overlapping subsets a semivariogram is then estimated from the data in each subset using that semivariogram as a model new data is then simulated at each of the input points in that specific subset a new semivariogram is then estimated from that simulated data this process is repeated until all of the subsets are accounted for krivoruchko 2012 a python script was created using the arcpy module for arcgis software esri in order to automate the ebk process and create interpolated surface water quality maps for dissolved oxygen fecal coliform nitrogen and phosphorous for several months in 1985 and 2015 the need for an automated model of ebk was essential in order to examine monthly and seasonal trends of water quality for our given study period supplementary fig 1 change detection maps were produced in arcgis to display if each water quality parameter had increased or decreased between 1985 and 2015 this was accomplished by converting each prediction map into raster format and applying the raster calculator to see a pixel over pixel comparison of a specific water quality parameter in a given month in 1985 and 2015 after the raster calculator was applied new maps for each parameter were produced that demonstrated how concentrations of that parameter have changed between 1985 and 2015 these maps were then reclassified to show areas of increases and decreases rather than a numerical value 5 results 5 1 urban expansion the results of the spectral angle mapper sam classification on the landsat tm and landsat oli images showed that areas on the north shore of lake pontchartrain experienced urban expansion as well as some areas surrounding baton rouge fig 2 table 1 the change detection analysis revealed that urbanization increased by roughly 0 8 from 290 3 km2 in 1985 to 324 5 km2 in 2015 fig 3 table 2 the results of the change detection analysis also demonstrated that areas surrounding new orleans essentially lost urban areas this is depicted by the blue color areas shown in fig 3 this loss of infrastructure and urban areas was likely due to population decreases after hurricane katrina in 2004 according to a report by the united states department of housing and urban development 2006 the population of new orleans decreased from 484 675 before katrina to an estimated 230 172 after katrina with damage to over 134 000 housing units many residents in new orleans moved to st tammany parish on the north shore of lake pontchartrain after the hurricane since this area was less susceptible to major flooding at the time zoomed in images of sam classification and change detection are available in the supplementary material figs 2 4 the results of the spectral angle mapper are consistent with the u s census housing and population table 3 in 1985 approximately 1 715 156 people lived within the boundaries of the pontchartrain basin and there were roughly 712 909 housing units in 2015 the population increased to 1 911 431 and the number of housing units increased to 831 633 resulting in a 10 3 increase in population and a 14 3 increase in the number of housing units u s bureau of census 1985 2015 in order to validate the accuracy of the urban maps above the results of the spectral angle mapper change detection were overlaid on top of a map produced in arcgis showing the change in population in the pontchartrian basin per census tract fig 4 5 2 water quality mapping 5 2 1 fecal coliform empirical bayesian kriging ebk was used to produce monthly water quality maps in 1985 and 2015 months were chosen based on whether or not water quality data from the ldeq was available for a given month table 4 fecal coliform maps were produced for january march april may june july august and september of 1985 and 2015 fig 5 shows the concentration of fecal coliform based on the epa s ambient water quality criteria for bacteria and the distribution of urban areas from landsat sam analysis according to epa s 1986 ambient water quality criteria for bacteria water with low fecal coliform levels 0 200 mpn are safe for body contact recreation water with moderate fecal coliform levels 200 1000 mpn are safe for fishing and boating but not for body contact recreation water with high 1000 2000 mpn and extreme 2000 mpn fecal coliform levels are not safe for any recreational activities and water in extreme areas cannot be treated for domestic water supply the results demonstrated that the highest concentrations of fecal coliform in 1985 and 2015 were present in the western portion of the basin near baton rouge in 2015 waterbodies near baton rouge had extreme levels of fecal coliform 2000 mpn in january march and april 2015 the northern shore of lake pontchartrain experienced fecal concentrations ranging from 200 to 1000 mpn fig 6 shows the sam landsat change detection overlying monthly change detection maps for fecal coliform these results reveal that fecal coliform concentrations were greater in 2015 compared to 1985 throughout the majority of the basin in january march and april increases in fecal coliform are seen in st tammany parish on the north shore of lake pontchartrain in january march april and june there is a strong correlation between urbanization and fecal coliform concentrations in st tammany parish fecal coliform also increased in the southern portion of the basin for every month measured except may while there is minimal urbanization in this area of the basin it can be hypothesized that fecal coliform is entering this part of the basin via the mississippi river and non point sources such as stormwater runoff 5 2 2 nitrogen and phosphorous drainage of crop and pasture lands north of the pontchartrain basin are responsible for abundant concentrations of organic nutrients chemical fertilizers and pesticides entering the basin s watershed lopez 2004 nitrogen maps for january through september were produced from ebk fig 7 in 1985 nitrogen concentrations were highest neat st james parish in the western portion of the basin nitrogen concentrations were also extremely high 1 mg l in southern portion of the basin in february april may june and august 1985 table 4 the state of louisiana has yet to establish numerical criteria for nutrients in surface water however natural levels of nitrogen in similar ecosystems are generally less than 0 75 ppm epa 1986 it is evident that nitrogen concentrations are much lower in 2015 and fall between 0 and 0 5 ppm which is indicative of a healthy environment overlying analysis of the sam landsat change detection and monthly change detection maps for nitrogen revealed that nitrogen generally decreased throughout the basin between 1985 and 2015 fig 8 an exception to this was in july where nitrogen increased in areas east of lake pontchartrain fig 9 displays phosphorous maps for january through september high levels of phosphorous 0 25 0 5 ppm were apparent in lake pontchartrain in february march may and july of 2015 table 4 these maps also reveal that there is not a correlation between nitrogen and phosphorous during these two time periods the change detection maps of phosphorus show that phosphorous concentrations have generally increased throughout the basin between 1985 and 2015 fig 10 when comparing phosphorous concentrations to urban areas in the pontchartrain basin it appears that high phosphorous concentrations are consistent with densely urbanized areas on the north shore of lake pontchartrain 5 2 3 dissolved oxygen low dissolved oxygen levels in water can produce a significant amount of stress for fish in that environment dissolved oxygen maps were created for january through september of 1985 and 2015 fig 11 in general dissolved oxygen levels throughout the majority of the basin for 1985 and 2015 were greater than 5 mg l which is the epa standard for marine life however dissolved oxygen levels during may june july and august of 2015 were low on the north shore of lake pontchartrain table 4 it is worth noting that dissolved oxygen is highly dependent on temperature and cold water can generally hold more dissolved oxygen compared to warm water u s epa 2013 based on this information it is expected to see lower dissolved oxygen levels in the summer months but in certain areas dissolved oxygen levels were as low as 1 mg l in fig 11 it is evident that dissolved oxygen in the northern portion of lake pontchartrain was much lower in june 2015 than in june 1985 overlying monthly change detection maps for dissolved oxygen and the sam landsat change detection revealed that dissolved oxygen decreased throughout most of the basin in january february april may june july and august fig 12 the southern portion of the basin experienced a decrease in dissolved oxygen for every month measured decreases in dissolved oyxgen seem to be consistent with urban expansion throughout the pontchartrain basin possible contributors of low dissolved oxygen related to anthropogenic sources 6 discussion using the spectral angle mapper sam based classifier with landsat tm oli images is an effective method for detecting urban areas compared to the published normalized difference building index and normalized difference impervious index a major caveat of ndbi and ndii is their ability to distinguish between urban areas impervious cover and large features such as mountains trees or large buildings wang et al 2015 moreover ndbi and ndii demonstrated that soil was not easily distinguished from impervious areas comparing urban expansion produced from sam classification with urban indices impervious surfaces were better identified and distinguished from other land cover features accuracy assessment of sam change detection using the u s census data demonstrated that sam classification can be used to extract urban areas with reasonable accuracy the results of change detection analysis of landsat images in 1985 and 2015 showed that areas on the north shore of lake pontchartrain in st tammany parish experienced urbanization as well as some areas surrounding baton rouge this is consistent with u s census housing and population data u s bureau of census 1985 2015 in reference to bourgeois calvin et al 2004 land development in st tammany parish has increased by 218 from 1982 to 2000 resulting in a loss of over 48 000 acres of habitat according to the u s census bureau the population of st tammany parish increased from 136 594 in 1985 to 250 088 in 2015 u s bureau of census 1985 2015 comparing the urbanization data to the fecal coliform maps in fig 5 shows that fecal coliform concentrations are generally higher in urban areas this is important because fecal coliform is a strong indicator of human waste and activity and has several harmful health risks fecal coliform in surface water can generally be traced back to storm water and wastewater runoff higginbotham et al 1991 mccorquodale et al 2009 adebayo and amer 2017 the presence of fecal coliform in water suggests that the water is likely contaminated with fecal matter from humans or other animals diseases and illnesses that can contracted from coming in contact with water with high fecal coliform counts include hepatitis typhoid fever gastroenteritis and other less severe infections u s dept of health 2016 in fig 5 the highest concentrations of fecal coliform were present near baton rouge and areas showing moderate high and extreme levels of fecal coliform are consistent with urban expansion an exception to this is new orleans this is likely due to the fact that storm water and wastewater runoff from new orleans is traveling south and not entering lake pontchartrain fecal coliform has a strong relationship to precipitation generally months with higher rainfall produce more urban stormwater runoff which results in higher fecal coliform concentrations in a body of water it is likely that there was higher rainfall in these months in 1985 than compared to 2015 however an in depth analysis of monthly precipitation patterns would have to be done to validate this historical monthly precipitation data is not currently easily accessible from noaa at this time another factor could be related to home wastewater treatment systems over time these systems have become less faulty and the technology has improved resulting in more effective bacteria removal from wastewater and an increase in overall water quality an excess of nitrogen and phosphorous in marine systems can result in prevalent algal blooms leading to seagrass habitat loss and widespread fish kills algal blooms occur when nutrient rich waters stimulate primary production in plant like photosynthetic algae or growth in animal like protozoans in some instances these blooms become toxic or harmful algal blooms habs turner et al 1999 some algal blooms produce toxins or harmful metabolites while others harm local organisms by consuming most of the oxygen in the water column as they decay creating hypoxic conditions paerl and whitall 1999 algal blooms are becoming more common and more harmful in coastal areas due to eutrophication or nutrient enrichment of ecosystems experimental and field observations demonstrate that nitrogen is a growth limiting nutrient for phytoplankton communities in lake pontchartrain turner et al 1999 there are also a growing number of public health concerns related to high concentrations of nitrogen in surface waters for example increased nitrate levels in drinking water can result in fatal oxygen levels in infants and even cancer nolan et al 2002 in this study it appears that phosphorous concentrations have increased throughout the pontchartrain basin between 1985 and 2015 while nitrogen concentrations have generally decreased one reason for this could be that phosphorous is retained more efficiently in aquatic systems compared to nitrogen correll 1999 in 2015 nitrogen concentrations throughout the basin generally fell below 0 5 mg l however in 1985 nitrogen concentrations in southern part of the basin were greater than 1 mg l for several months according to a study by cao et al 2018 nitrogen fertilizer consumption increased significantly between 1960 and 1980 throughout the united states after 1980 the rate of increase declined according to this study trends in nitrogen fertilizer consumption are generally related to dominant crop types at the time since certain crops require more intensive fertilizer use based on this it can be inferred that crops requiring less intensive fertilizer use were dominant in 2015 in addition to the establishment of the mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force in 1997 could also be responsible for decreasing nitrogen concentrations in the basin the task force supports nitrogen management activities from all sources and restores habitats to trap and assimilate nutrients in 2015 phosphorous concentrations in the basin were predominately greater than 0 1 mg l when the amount of total phosphorous exceeds 1 mg l in a stream or 0 5 mg l in a lake eutrophication is likely to occur epa 1986 according to correll 1999 excessive concentrations of phosphorous is the most common cause of eutrophication in freshwater lakes reservoirs streams and in estuarine systems in order to control nutrient pollution in the pontchartrain basin the state of louisiana needs to set a statewide nutrient criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous according to the epa a nutrient criteria would enable effective monitoring of waterbodies and the opportunity to restore waters to their designated uses another management strategy to reduce nutrient pollution involves using no phosphorous fertilizer or planting buffer strips of deep rooted plants between agricultural areas and streams or lakes to absorb and filter runoff deficient dissolved oxygen do concentrations can have potentially detrimental effects on fish and aquatic plant communities in marine and estuarine waters factors that can affect dissolved oxygen levels in a given system include nutrient loading temperature tidal energy and stratification engle et al 1999 the results of this study demonstrated that do levels experienced minimal changes in 1985 and 2015 from january to april in 1985 and 2015 do levels were generally greater than 5 mg l which is suitable for marine estuarine ecosystems do levels were lowest in june and july of 2015 in st tammany parish this is likely due to sampling in smaller bodies of water which have less energy input and mixing resulting in stagnant water with low dissolved oxygen low dissolved oxygen was also present near the mouth of the mississippi river there is also a strong relationship between dissolved oxygen and phosphorous in this area in may june and july 2015 where we examined high phosphorous concentrations 0 1 0 5 mg l and low dissolved oxygen concentrations 3 mg l this is consistent with the dead zone that is documented annually in this area the presence of low dissolved oxygen and high concentrations of phosphorous near the mouth of the mississippi river in 2015 is indicative of urban and agricultural expansion in areas north of this region it is evident in the sam classification change detection that urbanization has occurred throughout the entire extent of the basin between 1985 and 2015 as a result increasing anthropogenic impacts such as wastewater discharge and nutrient runoff enter the mississippi river and cause eutrophication and low dissolved oxygen at the mouth of the mississippi river in the gulf of mexico statistical analysis was implemented to compare water quality with the number of housing units per parish in the pontchartrain basin in 1985 and 2015 in the figures below a water quality value was extracted from the centroid of parishes in the basin from the interpolation maps above and plotted against the total number of housing units in that parish for 1985 and 2015 supplementary figs 5 8 the correlation coefficient is given on each plot to determine the strength of the relationship between water quality and the number of housing units per parish these results reveal that there is generally an insignificant relationship between these two factors this could be due to housing development not being a strong indicator of urbanization as a whole adding population impervious cover non residential development to this analysis would have likely show stronger similarities with water quality to determine the conditions of future water quality in the pontchartrain basin a rate for each parameter was established according to the results dissolved oxygen in the basin decreased at a rate of 0 035 mg l per year between 1985 and 2015 at this rate average dissolved oxygen would reach around 5 44 mg l by 2045 phosphorous has increased at a rate of roughly 0 21 mg l per year between 1985 and 2015 at this rate average phosphorous levels in the basin would increase to almost 0 3 mg l by 2045 nitrogen has decreased at a rate of 0 02 mg l in the basin resulting in low and environmentally safe predicted values of nitrogen by 2045 referring to table 2 it is evident that fecal coliform in 1985 had averages that were much greater compared to 2015 this skewed the results when calculating a rate of change between 1985 and 2015 however according to the averages fecal coliform has decreased at a rate of 51 7 mpn 100 ml per year between 1985 and 2015 resulting in a low predicted value of fecal coliform in 2045 7 conclusion the primary objective of this study was to identify the correlation between various water quality parameters and urbanization in the pontchartrain basin using gis spatial analysis and remote sensing techniques by utilizing spectral angle mapper sam classification techniques urban areas with defined spectral signatures were successfully extracted from landsat images this information provided insight on how land use has changed in the basin from 1985 to 2015 surface water quality prediction maps were produced using empirical bayesian kriging to demonstrate estimations of fecal coliform nitrogen phosphorous and dissolved concentrations over the entire extent of the pontchartrain basin urban areas from the change detection image was overlaid on each water quality prediction map in order to examine the correlation between water quality and urbanization the results demonstrated that fecal coliform had significantly increased around baton rouge between 1985 and 2015 and was consistent with the results of change detection for urban expansion nitrogen had decreased between 1985 and 2015 throughout the basin while phosphorous had increased moderately high levels of phosphorous 0 1 ppm could potentially have contributed to eutrophic conditions in many systems in the basin dissolved oxygen levels were suitable for aquatic plant and fish life for january through april in 1985 and 2015 low dissolved oxygen levels were identified in st tammany parish and near the mouth of the mississippi river in may june and july of 2015 after analyzing predicted trends of future water quality in the basin it is evident that dissolved oxygen is likely to decrease and phosphorous is likely to increase in the next 45 years these parameters are directly related to each other and increases in urban and agricultural activity in the basin in order to combat these challenges the state of louisiana needs to establish nutrient criteria for phosphorous in order to ensure healthy ecosystems throughout the basin in conclusion this research revealed that urban expansion increased

the crystalline and mesozoic sedimentary rocks the environmental tracer studies conducted in a double sampling cycle during changing conditions of groundwater inflow can significantly facilitate the understanding of hydrogeological conditions in areas of the complicated geological structure therefore in order to identify the hydrogeological conditions of study area measurements of geogenic and anthropogenic gases he ne ar cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 determinations of isotopic composition of groundwater δ18o δ2h and 3h and the hydrogeochemical data including selected rees thorium and uranium were used the research which was conducted both in natural groundwater flow conditions and in conditions of flow disturbed by the continuous exploitation of the groundwater enabled among other things a direct determination of the rate of maximum decomposition of cfc 11 and cfc 12 at depths of 50 450 m in the clastic rocks it ranges from 189 to 315 10 12 g l 1 yr 1 for cfc 11 and from 110 to 198 10 12 g l 1 yr 1 for cfc 12 the research conducted also indicates that in the study area the vertical or nearly vertical groundwater flow may have significance comparable to the lateral groundwater flow this results in an intense mixing of groundwater which leads to the local occurrence of groundwater containing the ions and gases in concentrations characteristic of the deep aquifers in the studied area with the simultaneous occurrence of ions and gases of anthropogenic origin the results of measurements on cfcs sf6 and noble gases indicate a significant inflow of young groundwater to the whole freshwater zone an occurrence of a geogenic sf6 source which is most probably associated with volcanic rocks was also found calculated the groundwater ages indicate that the research area is dominated by groundwater of age less than 1 ka and mainly in the range of 0 05 0 25 ka the results of modeling of the influence of the variability of u and th concentrations on the he in situ production within the aquifer phe indicate that for groundwater with he concentrations of 10 6 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 i e modern groundwater the he in situ production within the aquifer is actually negligible so it may be omitted in the calculation of their age considering the fact that in the study area which is terrain with elevated uranium concentration there is no significant effect of phe on groundwater dating using the helium method it can be concluded that the dating results obtained with this method in such areas can be fully comparable with those obtained for areas with lower concentrations of uranium it was also found that mobile ions of uranium and suspension of thorium compounds occurred in the groundwater are not a significant source of he in situ production within the studied aquifers

groundwater dating ree 1 introduction as a result of human activity many chemical compounds such as sulfur hexafluoride sf6 and chlorofluorocarbons mainly cfc 11 ccl3f and cfc 12 ccl2f2 which can be used as hydrogeological tracers have been introduced into the hydrosphere cfcs are widely used to hydrogeological data interpretation and calculation of groundwater age for groundwaters recharged as early as the 1940s busenberg and plummer 1992 2000 plummer and busenberg 2000 solomon et al 2006 a rapid increase in cfcs concentration in the atmosphere was observed until the 90 s after signing the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer in 1987 the concentration of these compounds began to decrease all the time thus reducing the possibility of dating waters which infiltrated into the aquifer after 1993 sf6 is an anthropogenic tracer that can be used to date young waters infiltrating into the aquifer after 1993 the concentration of this tracer in the atmosphere increases monotonically śliwka and lasa 2000 maiss and brenninkmeijer 1998 a broader description of sources of origin dynamics of changes and behavior of these chemical compounds in the environment and their application in hydrogeological studies was presented by among others zuber et al 1995 busenberg and plummer 2000 2008 vollmer and weiss 2002 and darling et al 2005 sf6 cfc 11 and cfc 12 as gaseous components of the atmosphere penetrate into groundwater mainly as a result of infiltration of waters saturated with these gases through contact with the atmosphere recharging the groundwater system from above in some cases they may also be able to dissolve directly in groundwater this mainly occurs in open aquifer systems found in rocks with double and or triple porosity zuber and motyka 1994 motyka 1998 this situation occurs mainly in pore and fissure aquifers where there are often systems of open cracks at the border of aeration saturation zones unobstructed hydraulically open fissures in the aeration zone are filled with a mixture of soil and atmospheric air which in such cases has much easier contact with groundwater tracer studies of groundwater are also carried out using the helium method the helium method uses the phenomenon of excess concentration of 4he resulting from the radioactive decay of certain elements of the uranium and thorium series in groundwater the determination of 4he concentrations for most hydrogeological studies can be successfully replaced by the measurement of the total he 4he 3he concentration due to the negligible concentration of 3he zuber 2007 zuber et al 2007 kotowski and najman 2015 in most cases the 3he mass fraction in the total he concentration does not exceed 0 00001 and this is significantly less than the unreliability of total he concentration measurements using chromatographic methods groundwater enrichment in he is most often the result of subsurface production of this gas or its migration from deeper parts of the earth s crust or mantle in other words he diffuses into the aquifer from below other gases dissolved in groundwater of which the concentrations have been studied in the research area are ne and ar the ne and ar analyses are used to determine the temperature in the groundwater recharge area ngt using the dependence on temperature of the gas solubility at the surface of the water concentrations of ne and ar are also used to determine the volume of the excess air the knowledge of which is required to date the groundwater by the helium method the excess air results from the dissolution of more air into the groundwater than the amount directly resulting from the thermodynamic equilibrium on the contact between the atmosphere and the groundwater table in the recharge area this is the result of fluctuations in the water table and the capture of air bubbles retained on the surface of the solid phase excess air is determined from the ne concentration which is almost independent of temperature both the ngt and volume of excess air represent the conditions existing on the water table during the groundwater recharge ballentine and burnard 2002 and ballentine et al 2002 presented a detailed description of the formation release and migration within the earth s crust of noble gases examples of the measurement of the concentrations of noble gases in hydrogeological research and of applications related to these were presented in more detail by among others mazor 1972 solomon et al 1996 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 cook and herczeg 2000 and porcelli et al 2002 in hydrogeological studies the methods based on analyzing the composition of the stable isotopes oxygen and hydrogen δ18o δ2h in groundwaters are widely used for example the stable isotope composition of the precipitation depends on the temperature prevailing where the precipitation infiltrates into the aquifer this creates an opportunity to determine the altitude effect i e the variation of the composition of the above mentioned isotopes with altitude which enables the location of the groundwater recharge area in mountainous terrain to be determined examples of the application of isotopic studies in the hydrogeological research were presented inter alia by różański and duliński 1988 mook and de vries 2001 aggarwal et al 2005 and zuber et al 2008 another important environmental tracer used for groundwater research is radioactive tritium 3h the rapid increase and next the systematic decrease of tritium activity in precipitation have been recording since about the half of the 60s which enable the use of this isotope as a useful tracer for determining the transition time of groundwater a wide description of the behaviour of this tracer in the environment examples of seasonal and spatial differentiation of its activity and its application to the groundwater dating are presented among others by rozanski et al 1991 geyh et al 2001 zuber et al 2005 kazemi et al 2006 and mook 2006 the central sudetes is an area of the very complex geological structure and at the same time the hydrogeological conditions are here less understood than in others parts of sudetes especially compared to better understood groundwater systems within the crystalline rocks or mesozoic sediments in particular the weaker understanding applies to the carboniferous and permian aquifers which mostly occur in the research area this is mainly due to the very small number of wells located in this vast area approx 25 wells the remaining aquifers occurring in the sediments of triassic and cretaceous are much better studied however these types of an aquifer in the research area occur only sporadically a broader description of the circulation conditions the isotopic and chemical composition of the groundwater in the multi aquifer systems in the central sudetes as well as neighboring areas of the western and eastern sudetes was presented by ciężkowski et al 1992 zuber et al 1995 staśko and tarka 2001 tarka 2006 dobrzyński 2007 and chudzik and kotowski 2017 the other hydrogeological aspects of the ścinawka river catchment area which concern the groundwater resources or the groundwater protection are presented by szafranek et al 1986 bielecka et al 1992 and poprawski et al 1997 the research area covers the catchment area of the ścinawka river 594 km2 which occupies a vast section of the central sudetes the ścinawka river catchment is an important drainage base for permo carboniferous and mesozoic aquifers the research concerns groundwater of a low tds 1 g l 1 which form the freshwater zone in major part some of the researched wells are used for drinking water supply and constitute the only source of drinking water in the study area the results of physicochemical analyses obtained by using the oes ms and hplc analytical techniques and of investigations of dissolved gases concentrations in groundwater he ar ne ne cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 which were carried out for groundwater samples originating from the permian the triassic and the carboniferous are presented in this paper field studies and sampling were carried out in two measurement rounds in 2014 the studies were supplemented in september 2015 with results of the chemical analysis of uranium thorium and rees ions in the groundwater and the determinations of δ2h δ18o as well as 3h activity the aim of the research was to understand the hydrogeology of the study area in as many aspects as possible the research mainly focused on the conditions of the groundwater circulation and determination of the age of the groundwater samples taken from the fissure porous aquifer system one of the significant components of the description of the groundwater flow in the mountainous area is the altitude of the groundwater recharge area which can be calculated by using the determinations of the isotopic composition of groundwater and or ngt the determination of the variation of concentrations of environmental tracers migrating to the aquifer from both the top and the bottom gives a better understanding of the circulation of groundwater originating from different sources or distinct inflow routes equally important is the use of tracers with different origins to enable the groundwater age to be independently determined since uranium ore and polymetallic deposits occur in the study area a significant issue in understanding the hydrochemistry and consequently the groundwater flow was the estimation of the spatial variation and range of concentration of the u th and rees ions in groundwater in the research area there are zones with elevated concentrations of u and th which necessitated modeling of the influence of the variability of u and th concentration on he in situ production within the aquifer and thus on the age of groundwater taking into account the likelihood of direct contact between the air and the groundwater in the study area the important issue was the investigation of the stability of the cfcs in both the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer system sampling was carried out for two groups of wells the first group consists of the water supply wells which were continuously used and the second group consists of wells which were exploited only sporadically this differentiation was aimed at analyzing the variability of groundwater circulation in natural conditions and in conditions disturbed by groundwater exploitation the groundwater samples were collected in the same wells during the two measuring rounds distant in time sampling was carried out at half yearly intervals in order to trace the short term variability of measured gas concentrations in groundwater this way of sampling in two measurement rounds in different conditions of groundwater flow enabled the degradation rate of the cfcs in the groundwater to be calculated 2 geological conditions the central sudetes are one of the most geologically complex areas of poland and europe the research area was tectonically very strongly transformed and is covered with a dense network of faults of various lengths and discharges e g ihnatowicz et al 2009c d apart from confirmed faults there are numerous photolineaments most probably connected with various types of dislocations the survey area is located within a few large geological and structural units fig 1 the lithology of rocks in the central sudetes is very diverse within the perimeter of the research area there are mainly sedimentary clastic rocks sandstones conglomerates as well as mudstones and clays the clastic rocks often include fragments of volcanic rocks and feldspars chloritised biotite argillaceous siliceous and ferrous cement carbonates gypsum dispersed pyrite and organic matter bossowski 1996 1997 the research area also includes volcanic rocks rhyolites trachyandesites and trachybasalts and metamorphic rocks gneisses granitogneisses and phyllites the total thickness of molasses sedimentary rocks in the study area is up to 11 km a broader description of the types and genesis of rocks occurring in the central sudetes has been presented by e g aleksandrowski et al 2000 aleksandrowski and mazur 2002 and mccann 2008 in the whole area of the sudetes there are numerous polymetallic deposits which are characterized by a variety of forms of occurrence and by multi component and variable mineralization the uranium content in the rocks in the research area is highly variable the higher concentrations of uranium occur in the permian clastic rocks as well as in the volcanic ones in volcanic rocks the average uranium content is 3 18 ppm sylwestrzak 1972 in the świerki region well no 5 at depths of about 880 m uranium concentrations of 5 50 ppm were found in clay sediments miecznik and strzelecki 1979 the largest accumulation of uranium occurs in shale usually forming several levels within the clastic rocks they form locally lean uranium deposits of low concentration such a deposit occurs in the wambierzyce area well no 8 within the walchia shales at a depth from 100 to 350 m where the uranium content was 100 300 ppm nieć 2009 the highest uranium concentration in the research area was observed in ludwikowice kłodzkie where at a depth of approximately 340 m the uranium content in rocks reaches up to 350 ppm miecznik 1983 3 hydrogeological setting the complex geological structure of the central sudetes results in complex hydrogeological conditions in the area of research groundwater occurs within a multi aquifer system the aquifers are predominantly found in the carboniferous and permian clastic rocks mainly sandstones and conglomerates apart from the permian and carboniferous aquifers the cretaceous and triassic aquifers were sporadically found in the study area with some simplification within the studied multi aquifer system two groups of aquifers can be distinguished they can be described as shallow and deep aquifers the shallow aquifers occur in almost the whole of the research area they are usually composed of the regolith layer of variable thickness several to about a dozen meters below which there are cracked solid rocks with many fissures the thickness of the shallow aquifers is variable it is typically around 30 50 m and depends on the depth of a system of hydraulically active fissures a completely different situation occurs in the case of deep aquifers which occur almost only in areas of fault zones with large depths in such areas the hydraulically active network of cracks and fissures reaches a depth down to even a few kilometers typically there is no clear boundary separating shallow aquifers from deep aquifers there is a gradual change from a more cracked shallower zone into a deeper zone characterized by fewer cracks and or by smaller fissures the extent of freshwater zone depth in the research area is diversified according to bielecka et al 1992 during the drilling of some of the wells groundwater samples were taken from various depths for chemical analysis which allows an approximate determination of the freshwater zone depth table 1 the depth range of the freshwater zone can be estimated at approximately 110 450 m below that zone the groundwater with higher mineralization tds 1 g l 1 is found in some cases well no 8 freshwater appears to lie almost directly on mineral waters and there may be a relatively clear boundary between fresh groundwater and mineral waters from a deeper part of the aquifer system as a result of the lithological and tectonic differentiation of the study area the hydrogeological variables differ greatly the potential discharge of the wells ranges from 10 to several dozen m3 h 1 at drawdown from a few to over 50 m the hydraulic conductivity k is in the range from 1 17 10 8 to 7 3 10 3 m s 1 the wide ranges of value of these variables indicate that the research area is very heterogeneous in terms of the groundwater flow aquifers occurring in different age rocks often remain in hydraulic contact with each other which creates favorable conditions for the vertical circulation of groundwater these contacts are largely related to fissure systems in fault zones almost all wells in the research area are located in fault zones where a significant flow rate of groundwater is observed areas with negligible groundwater resources are always found outside the fault zones the observations carried out in the multi aquifer systems indicate that the heights of groundwater table are similar despite the fact they refer aquifers occurring at different depths in general the study area should be treated as a single fissure porous multi aquifers system fig 2 the aquifers are recharged by infiltration of rainwater through cracks and fissure systems permian deposits are rocks with a rare and irregular network of cracks the width of the fissures on the rock outcrops is in the range of 0 01 30 mm of which approximately 50 are cracks up to 3 mm the fissure spacing ranges from 0 3 to 5 m the measurements made allowed the determination of crack continuity index wc which is expressed as the ratio of the length of crack to the length of the measured section liszkowski and stochlak 1976 the calculated values of wc ranged from 0 654 to 1 the fissure hydraulic conductivity calculated from the above values based on the louis formula wittke and louis 1968 modified by liszkowski and stochlak 1976 is in the range from 1 02 10 5 to 3 1 10 9 m s 1 the hydrological cycle has a visible impact on the groundwater recharge in the research area shallow aquifers are characterized by a fast several to dozen days reaction to atmospheric precipitation for deep aquifers the relationships between precipitation and piezometric pressure are complex and may show mutual correlations even at longer multi month intervals staśko et al 2017 according to the above mentioned authors in the area of neighboring western sudetes the reaction of deeper aquifers to extremely hydrologic and meteorological drought may occur with a delay of up to 880 days 4 methods 4 1 sampling of wells the selection of the wells to sampling was dictated primarily by their representativeness for the hydrogeological conditions of the ścinawka river catchment area to the sampling of groundwater from the permian aquifers wells with large depths were chosen evenly distributed in the study area apart from the wells no 1 2 and 7 no other wells were found in the study area which intakes the groundwater of the triassic and carboniferous aquifers the availability of the wells was an additional aspect for choosing wells for sampling in the case of some observation wells which are exploited only sporadically their technical condition did not allow for sampling the groundwater samples to measure dissolved gas concentrations he ne ar sf6 cfc 11 and cfc 12 were collected in two measuring rounds in the same eight wells during each measurement round one sample was taken from each well the first round lasted from 24 to 30 april 2014 while the second one lasted from 4 to 6 november 2014 the samples were taken both from continuously exploited water supply wells sw and from sporadically exploited with a frequency of not more than once every 5 10 years observation wells ow before sampling from the ow wells each well had been previously pumped out approx 5 7 of the volume well the sw wells are exploited daily for water supply and in this case sampling was carried out without prior pumping pumping was also not carried out for the artesian well no 3 due to spontaneous outflow before sampling from this well water was freely flowing from it for 12 h so that a groundwater sample could be obtained directly from the aquifer groundwater samples were collected directly from the wellhead by means of a system that prevented contact of the collected sample with the atmosphere characteristics of the sampling wells and the results of field tests are presented in table 2 the studied wells are screened at different depths in the various parts of the aquifer system at the same time they most likely remain in strong hydraulic contact with each other some of the studied wells have two screens at different depths no 1 and 4 in this case a joint analysis of the concentrations of all the gases tested and the chemical composition of samples allows us to hypothesize that groundwater from shallow aquifers is predominant in the samples from these wells most likely the screens in the upper sections of the well create an efficient route for the inflow of groundwater from shallow aquifers in addition some of the wells which were studied e g wells no 5 and 8 have screen at long intervals respectively 287 and 187 m in all of the above mentioned cases it is probable that the groundwater from two sources or more will be mixed in undetermined different proportions caused by the variability of exploitation or other indefinite factors therefore in many cases it is not possible to indicate precisely from which depth and from which part of the aquifer system samples of the groundwater are derived it should be clearly emphasized that this is a kind of averaging of groundwater from the hydraulically connected parts of the aquifer system in the case of other existing wells in the investigated area their technical condition usually does not allow pumping to be carried out therefore it is not possible to obtain more samples from a precisely defined depth of the aquifer system the initial depth of some wells no 4 5 and 6 was reduced in the 1990s by inserting cement plugs into certain sections the purpose of this activity was to isolate fresh groundwater intended for drinking from groundwater which is more highly mineralized the exact depths of cement plugs and their present technical conditions are not known however it can form the potential route of the groundwater inflow from the deeper part of the aquifer system 4 2 measurements of chemical composition of groundwater groundwater samples for the basic physicochemical analyses were collected in 2014 simultaneously with samples for the determination of dissolved gas concentrations the electrical conductivity ec the concentration of dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured in situ with wtw or elmetron probes samples for chemical analysis were immediately passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter into polyethylene bottles 250 dm3 and kept refrigerated until analyzed samples for the measurement of the concentration of cations were acidified using a few drops of concentrated hno3 the chemical analyses were conducted by the accredited laboratory of the polish geological institute major dissolved elements were analyzed by icp oes optima 8300 the icp ms elan drc ii and the la icp ms elan drc ii lsx 500 were used for the measurement of concentrations of minor and typical trace elements concentrations of anions were determined by hplc alliance hplc system due to the numerous polymetallic deposits occurring in the research area an analysis of the occurrence in groundwater of selected ions from the actinide group and ions of ree was also performed sampling was conducted in september 2015 the samples to uranium and ree ions concentrations measurements were immediately passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter into polyethylene bottles 250 dm3 and kept refrigerated until analyzed the samples for thorium concentration measurement were not filtered because large amounts of th are present often in the suspension which is removed by filtration through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the chemical analyses were conducted by the accredited laboratory of the faculty of geology geophysics and environmental protection of the university of science and technology in cracow the icp ms elan 7500 were used for measurements of uranium thorium and rees ions concentrations the threshold of the icp ms depends on the type of element and varies from a few ppb to several tens of decimal ppms 4 3 measurements of dissolved gases and the isotopic composition of groundwater groundwater samples were collected into 2 9 dm3 steel vessels constructed in a way that enabled extraction of the gases dissolved in water using the head space method the head space method of gas extraction from a sample consists of the analysis of gases from the space above a groundwater sample enclosed in an airtight vessel śliwka and lasa 2000 the gaseous sample is analyzed after previously bringing such a liquid gas system to a state of thermal equilibrium najman and śliwka 2013 2016 the concentrations of gases dissolved in groundwater were determined using the gas chromatography gc method pusz et al 2007 due to the low he concentration in the sample from well no 2 a sample analysis was performed using an additional chromatographic system equipped with a cryogenic sample enrichment system a broader description of construction and applications to the hydrogeological researches of the chromatographic system for simultaneous measurement of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 as well as he ar and ne from one groundwater sample was presented by śliwka et al 2004 mochalski et al 2007 najman and śliwka 2016 additionally the isotope composition of groundwater δ18o and δ2h as well as 3h activity was determined determinations of the isotope composition were conducted in the laboratory of the faculty of physics and applied computer science of the university of science and technology in cracow in 2015 this was done on a finnigan mat 251 ratio mass spectrometer the oxygen isotope composition of water samples δ18o was determined using the co2 equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 sample preparation was performed using an automatic line multiprep coupled with a dual inlet finnigan delta s mass spectrometer the measurements of the hydrogen isotope composition δ2h were carried out on gaseous hydrogen produced in the reaction of water reduction on metallic zinc kendall and coplen 1985 at 550 c granular zinc supplied by the indiana university usa was used results are reported in deviation from the internationally accepted v smow vienna standard mean ocean water standard analytical uncertainties are equal 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h the tritium content was measured using the lsc technique after the electrolytic enrichment of water samples the initial volume of the water sample was 0 5 dm3 the mass reduction factor was equal to 28 measurements were carried out using a tri carb canberra lsc spectrometer model 2500 using ultimagold liquid scintillator results are given in t u tritium units the overall uncertainty including preparation procedure and counting depends on the activity of tritium for activities 5 t u uncertainty is equal 0 3 t u it rises to approximately 1 t u at the activity around 10 t u 4 4 estimations of altitude of recharge area the isotopic composition of groundwater occurring in mountains areas is frequently modified by the so called altitude effect which is dependent on the altitude of the groundwater recharge area using the formulas of 1 and 2 ciężkowski 1990 the altitude h of the groundwater recharge areas was calculated the altitude effect corrected for the continental effect in the kłodzko region is as follows 1 h δ 18 o 595 6 80 1 δ 18 o 5520 843 m 2 h δ 2 h 85 8 18 6 δ 2 h 5405 1335 m in addition the approximate altitude of groundwater recharge areas i e h flow determined on the basis of groundwater flow directions was estimated the altitudes of the groundwater recharge areas for the analyzed wells were estimated on the basis of the 1 50 000 scale polish hydrogeological map mroczkowska 1997 kłonowski and wojtkowiak 2000a b wojtkowiak 2000a b grzegorczyk 2002a b kiełczawa 2002 the 1 50 000 scale detailed geological map of poland cymerman et al 2009 ihnatowicz et al 2009a b c d as well as our own measurements of the fissuring of rocks which was conducted in the study area the nearest springs and other groundwater outflows from which surface waters flowed in accordance with the slope of the land towards the given wells were determined for each well studied the altitude of the occurrence of springs and other groundwater outflows was assumed as the altitude of the occurrence of the phreatic zone in particular cases the recharge area of these waters was determined above the phreatic zone based on the analysis of the occurrence of the fissure outcrops and the fault zones individual areas of groundwater recharge usually have a particular temperature of air depending on the altitude of the location taking this into account the obtained results were indirectly verified by a comparison with the average annual temperatures occurring in the sudetes at certain altitudes these temperatures were calculated according to the relationship found for the sudetes in accordance with formula 3 ciężkowski et al 1992 3 t c 0 00558 h 9 22 this dependence concerns the range of heights from 600 to 1600 m acc kwiatkowski and hołdys 1985 the altitudes of the recharge areas h calculated on the basis of both on the isotope composition and also on the direction of the groundwater flow were used to calculate the average annual temperatures 4 5 estimation of groundwater

its value was adopted from the mathematical model to the major groundwater basin mgb no 342 krawczyk et al 2015 which is an aquifer system designated close to the study area with a very similar geological structure to the study area 4 6 groundwater dating 4 6 1 cfcs and sf6 methods the determination of the age of groundwater using cfcs and sf6 is based on measurements of the content of these tracers in the atmosphere maiss and brenninkmeijer 1998 prinn et al 2000 the listed tracers are the anthropogenic gases soluble in water their concentration in water is determined at a certain temperature by thermodynamic equilibrium precipitations with certain these tracers content infiltrate into the groundwater the determination of the groundwater age consists of the measurement of tracer concentration in the groundwater in reference to the equilibrium concentration of this tracer that occurred during contact with the atmosphere at a defined temperature concentrations of the mentioned gases in surface waters in equilibrium with the atmosphere can be determined from henry s law 5 c lo k lg c p where clo concentration in surface water g cm 3 h2o cp concentration in the

suitable model of the groundwater flow one can estimate the time elapsed since the infiltration of precipitations into groundwater until today i e the age of groundwater the piston flow model of groundwater age pfm was used to calculate the age of groundwater using cfcs and sf6 the methods of dating using cfcs and sf6 are described in detail by among others busenberg and plummer 2000 zuber et al 2007 as well as busenberg and plummer 2008 the application of geogenic and anthropogenic tracers in hydrogeology for dating purposes requires the amount of excess of air to be known this excess of air is a variable indicating the amount of air dissolved in groundwater due to the balance between water and the atmosphere which arises as a result of the dissolving air bubbles attached to the soil and rocks during the infiltration of rainwater heaton and vogel 1981 in mountainous areas where the groundwater recharge area is located much higher than the drainage area it is also necessary to adjust the measured tracer concentration to the ngt najman et al 2012 4 6 2 helium methods for the calculation of the groundwater age using the helium method the total he 4he 3he concentration measurements can be successfully used due to the negligible 3he concentration which is significantly lower than the uncertainty of the he concentration measurement by gc method the following formulas

purpose to reflect the worsened conditions of the groundwater flow at great depths 100 m h aquifer thickness table 4 in some works e g kulongoski et al 2003 2005 instead of h the zo parameter is used zo depth at which he flux enters the aquifer or distance from the middle of the perforations in the well casing to the interface between the aquifer and the basement formation in the research area the age of groundwater calculated in this way is mostly very similar to that calculated using the parameter h the differences do not exceed a few percents jhe the external flux of he basal flux flowing into the aquifer the assumed jhe for the majority of the wells is 3 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 except well no 2 when jhe is 0 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 ρf water density assumed as ρf 1 0 g cm 3 λ the

of the aquifer assumed average concentrations of thorium is cth 14 ppm ρr the density of the rock matrix of the aquifer assumed as 2 65 g cm 3 4 6 3 modeling of influence of the cu and cth variability on groundwater age the aim of the modeling was to determine what impact may be exerted on the age of groundwater by zones with elevated u and th content in which there may be a local increase in he production directly within the aquifer phe referred to as he in situ production the volume of he in situ production depends primarily on the u and th content which in the research area can rapidly change by 2 3 orders of magnitude within the rocks with a thickness of a few to a dozen meters modeling of the impact of variability of cu and cth concentrations on the age of groundwater at varying jhe values as an independent variable was carried out using the function no 10 which describes the dependence of the age of groundwater on the geological and physical parameters in order to simplify modeling the assumption was adopted that for most of the variables in function no 10 i e n h ρf ρr and λ the range of differentiation of their value in the particular wells is relatively small and they are essentially constant with respect to the potential differentiation of the concentrations of u and th in the rock matrix of the aquifer these allow for the adoption of averaged values of the physical and geological parameters of the aquifer and perform of the calculation only for a few variables i e jhe and cu and cth in modeling a constant ratio cu cth 0 25 was also assumed which allows for use to the calculation the cu only the ratio cu cth 0 25 is observed for the whole of the continental crust polański 1988 and this applies to both crystalline and sedimentary rocks therefore for aquifers with a defined thickness table 4 the widest possible range of average uranium concentration values was assumed 5 results the results of the major and minor ions concentrations measurements and hydrochemical type of water are presented in table 3 the results of the uranium thorium and selected rees ions concentrations measurements are presented in table 4 the results of the measurements of the concentrations of the analyzed gases and the isotope composition of the groundwater as well as the tritium activity are presented in table 5 the calculated altitudes of groundwater recharge areas and altitudes of groundwater recharge areas determined on the basis of groundwater flow directions are shown in table 6 the comparison of the temperatures of the recharge areas calculated by different methods and ngt are presented in table 7 the results of groundwater dating by cfcs sf6 and helium methods are presented in tables 8 and 9 the major parameters used to calculate the groundwater ages are also summarized in table 9 6 discussion 6 1 chemistry of groundwater variability in the mineral composition of the rock matrix influences the occurrence of different conditions of groundwater chemical composition formation this is reflected among others in the presence of different hydrochemical types of groundwater the main processes forming the chemical composition of groundwater are the dissolution of minerals and locally ion exchange ca2 na occurring within the clay deposits shales well no 3 and no 8 the inflow of anthropogenic contaminated waters is also noted locally it mainly reflects in the elevated nitrates concentrations in the shallow aquifers table 3 high concentrations of so4 2 ions in groundwater coming from the deep aquifers are probably the result of the inflow of groundwater from outside the freshwater zone broader studies on the chemistry of the groundwater and on the springs in the central sudetes were conducted by chudzik and kotowski 2017 the results of these studies indicate inter alia the lack of significant variability in concentrations of most of the analyzed ions with increasing of the depth of aquifer the aquifer system is largely uniform in terms of groundwater chemical composition which confirms the existence of a strong hydraulic contact between different parts of the aquifer system 6 2 rees ions the groundwater usually demonstrates the ree pattern that closely reflects the ree pattern of the rocks through which these groundwaters flow analysis of the distribution of ree content in groundwater is used to identify the origin of groundwater the study of groundwater mixing to designate the groundwater recharge area and many more in the deeper wells no 4 5 and 6 significantly higher concentrations of some rees eu sm and sc are observed there are high correlations between the content of eu sm and sc ions and the depths of the well r 0 81 0 73 and 0 84 respectively p 0 05 this most probably indicates the inflow of groundwater from the deep parts of the rock mass which is composed among other of igneous and metamorphic rocks the concentrations of other metal ions lrees and hrees i e y la nd ce gd dy er yb pr ho lu tb and tm were also analyzed however in most cases they occurred at concentrations not exceeding the limit of determination lod 0 1 μg l 1 lrees and hrees ions in concentrations slightly exceeding lod concentrations of 0 1 0 2 μg l 1 were observed only in well no 5 świerki the high concentrations of li ions observed in wells no 3 and 8 table 4 indicate the probable inflow of groundwaters enriched with this element as a result of the contact of groundwater with the formations of granites gneisses or pegmatite or due to the effect of ion exchange the high concentration of li ions is accompanied by high concentrations of na ions at significantly reduced concentrations of ca ions thus the very high li na correlation r 0 978 probably may be related to the ion exchange in the area of research higher activities concentrations of u isotopes ions are observed in comparison to the activities concentrations of this element observed in typical groundwater the average activities of the uranium isotopes 238u 235u and 234u in typical groundwater from different areas of poland are 4 5 6 0 mbq l 1 0 19 0 27 mbq l 1 and 5 7 6 9 mbq l 1 respectively pietrzak flis et al 2005 the range of 238u and 234u isotope activity in groundwater from the neighboring area upper silesian coal basin used for drinking is 0 07 14 4 0 02 0 9 mbq l 1 and 0 12 31 4 0 03 1 7 mbq l 1 chmielewska et al 2014 significantly lower concentrations of u ions in groundwater in the range of 0 01 3 72 μg l 1 are also observed in the groundwater with high salinity and low ph values within the shallow aquifers in the coastal regions lauria et al 2004 the concentrations of u ions in groundwater depend on redox conditions eh and ph as well as the content of anions hco3 co3 2 so4 2 and others forming complex compounds with uranium mobile highly soluble u6 ions e g uo2 2 are found in oxidizing conditions under reducing conditions uranium is present in groundwater at very low concentrations as the predominant form of uranium is the easily adsorbable u4 form the exact eh range of the groundwater environment is not known in the study area however it is to be expected that mainly the neutral or reducing environment the oxidizing environment is most likely only in the zone with a depth of up to 50 80 m as indicated by the measurements of cfcs see more in section 6 3 groundwater in the research area is characterized by high ph values 7 77 10 85 under these ph conditions carbonate complexes such as uo2 2 co3 2 2 are the predominant form of uranium in water and uranium concentrations can then reach high values it seems that in the area of research the occurrence of uranium in groundwater is not only related to the conditions of ph and eh but above all to the geological structure and the type of rocks in which the well is occurring the highest u ion concentration 71 μg l 1 is observed in the shallow well no 3 of depth 59 m which is the only studied wells which were drilled in the shale sediments such high concentrations of u ions can only occur if groundwater is in contact with rocks with higher uranium content the view that one of the main factors affecting the concentration of u ions in groundwater is the geological structure of the investigated area was also presented by lee et al 2001 and chau et al 2011 uranium and thorium tend to occur together in the geological formation due to the similarity in their ionic radii dissolved thorium is almost invariably complexed in groundwaters the behavior of thorium is influenced by its speciation and ph conditions in slightly acidic to alkaline ph conditions thorium complexes like th oh 4 0 are strongly absorbed and the mobility of thorium is reduced langmuir and herman 1980 thorium can also be present in complexes such as th hpo4 3 2 and th so4 2 0 or organic complexes the presence of th complexes with sulfate resulted in relatively high thorium concentrations at a low ph range up to app 4 5 ph langmuir and herman 1980 although complexing inorganic and organic increases the solubility of thorium bearing minerals in alkaline conditions at ph values below 8 maximum thorium concentrations in natural waters are probably limited in general by the paucity and slow dissolving rate of these minerals and also by sorption processes rather than by mineral solution equilibria langmuir and herman 1980 thorium occurring naturally apart from uranium ore deposits consists almost exclusively of the isotope 232th with a half life of 14 109 years thorium concentrations observed in groundwater in areas of uranium deposits can be high for example the concentration of thorium probably mainly 230th in water under low ph conditions which may occur from the leaching of uranium tailings may be as high as 3 8 104 μg l 1 moffett and tellier 1978 however it should be emphasized that in groundwater in areas where uranium deposits occur low concentrations of 232th below 0 02 μg l 1 0 005 dpm l 1 and very low concentrations of 230th below 6 10 7 μg l 1 0 0255 dpm l 1 are also observed short 1988 in conditions where the ph is above 6 and even at low toc of 1 mg l 1 the dominant form of thorium occurrence in groundwater is the organic complexes of this element langmuir and herman 1980 high concentrations of the 232th isotope are observed for aquatic environments with high ph values the concentrations of 232th in a highly alkaline ph of about 10 saline lake mono lake in california have been reported to be as high as approx 6 36 μg l 1 0 7 pci l 1 anderson et al 1982 simpson et al 1982 thorium concentrations 0 17 3 75 μg l 1 observed for most wells in the research area are typical for groundwater not found near uranium deposits and do not significantly exceed the values reported by other authors e g 0 5 2 9 μg l 1 harmsen and de haan 1980 the highest thorium concentration 26 2 μg l 1 is observed in the deep water supply well no 5 with simultaneous average uranium concentrations 2 4 μg l 1 there is a high correlation between th concentrations and well depth r 0 79 p 0 05 since similar correlations with the depth r 0 73 0 84 are observed also for ree ions and the chemical properties of thorium are similar to lanthanide this may indicate a common source of these elements most probably this source is the inflow of groundwater from the deepest parts of aquifers enriched with these elements as a result of the dissolution of monazite larger accumulations of monazite are observed in granites and gneisses among others which occurs deep parts of rock mass within the study area however it should be noted that regardless of the increased content of monazite in rocks can also occur significantly lower concentrations of thorium ions in groundwater in the range of 0 04 0 25 μg l 1 lauria et al 2004 most likely important factors affecting the concentration of thorium in the freshwater zone in the research area are not only ph conditions toc values or concentrations of main ions that are relatively similar but above all the possibility of groundwater inflow from deep parts of rock mass 6 3 chlorofluorocarbons in wells nos 1 2 and 4 high concentrations of dissolved oxygen do were found in both measuring rounds taking into account the groundwater temperature 9 13 c the do concentrations of 3 7 mg l 1 are close to the do concentrations founding in surface water and or rainwater such high concentrations of do indicate it is possible that through a system of cracks the mixture of soil gases and atmospheric air is periodically or continuously in contact with groundwater thus there is a possibility at least in part of direct dissolution of cfcs and sf6 at the gas water interface regardless of the measuring round significantly higher concentrations of cfcs are observed for most wells with high do concentrations fig 3 this does not apply to well no 5 where there is probably no significant inflow of groundwater from the shallow aquifers this is also confirmed by the low concentrations of no3 ions observed in this well the origin of high do concentrations in the first measurement round considering the depth of the well no 5 346 m is difficult to determine in this situation in general high concentrations of do and cfcs are observed mainly in the sw wells exploited in a continuous manner and thus forcing the inflow of groundwater mainly from the shallow aquifers a special case is the ow well no 2 which is the shallowest well 55 m in the area of research and naturally takes groundwater from the shallow aquifers taking into account the above observations it was assumed that the do range and the range of cfc concentrations observed for wells nos 1 2 and 4 are representative for shallow aquifers the concentrations of cfcs in groundwater with low do level are generally similar to each other for groundwater with high do level however occur clearly higher cfc 11 concentrations in comparison to those of cfc 12 fig 3 this indicates a different behavior of these compounds in the aquifer system cfcs sorption processes on organic substances are rather unlikely due to the negligible toc values 1 0 mg dm 3 observed in the study area table 2 cfc 11 and cfc 12 are stable under oxidative conditions however they can undergo degradation under reducing conditions with low oxygen content and microbial breakdown in such cases there is a noticeable difference in the rate of decomposition of these compounds in different type s environments and cfc 11 is usually decomposed faster than cfc 12 khalil and rasmussen 1989 oster et al 1996 sebol et al 2007 therefore it is important to analyze the variability of cfcs concentration in the study area in relation to the sampling depth fig 4 it can be observed that to a certain depth about 50 80 m there is an increase in the concentrations of both the analyzed cfcs this indicates there is presumably an oxidizing environment up to this depth which prevents the decomposition of cfcs for some of the ow wells nos 6 7 and 8 there is a noticeable increase in cfc concentrations in the second measurement round fig 3 since wells no 6 7 and 8 have not been in operation during the last 5 10 years the pumping carried out in the first round most probably triggered the inflow of groundwater from the shallow aquifers with higher concentrations of these gases due to the limited pumping time the volume of this inflow is not high 150 350 m3 at the same time the groundwater vertical inflow rate is high approx 1 1 9 2 10 6 m s 1 for k 5 8 10 6 m s 1 acc to krawczyk et al 2015 and the time of depression cone fading can range from several minutes to several hours in order to estimate the rate of cfc degradation in the aquifer it was assumed that the concentration of cfcs in inflowing groundwater does not exceed the values observed in the shallow aquifers on this basis it was calculated the theoretical maximum cfcs degradation rate in the deep aquifers it ranges from 189 to 315 10 12 g l 1 yr 1 for cfc 11 and from 110 to 198 10 12 g l 1 yr 1 for cfc 12 1 37 2 3 and 0 91 1 64 pmol l 1 yr 1 respectively these values are not high in relation to those given by other authors for example oster et al 1996 states that the rate of cfc 11 and cfc 12 degradation under anaerobic conditions is in the range of 0 05 and 3 105 pmol l 1 yr 1 according to the above mentioned work the cfc 12 cfc 11 degradation ratio to be constant over six orders of magnitude with cfc 12 always being less reactive by a factor of about 10 theoretically individual cfc molecules in the research area may undergo complete decay within 1 2 years this is quite a short period of time and given the cfc concentrations observed at large depths 100 m cfcs in the study area are likely to decompose at a much slower rate for example as indicated by horneman et al 2008 in shallow 5 7 26 4 m aquifers under reduction conditions cfc 11 and cfc 12 may undergo practically complete degradation 95 in groundwaters older than 10 years in the majority wells an increase in the concentrations of the cfcs is observed in the second measurement round although in numerous cases the changes in cfc concentrations do not exceed the uncertainty of measurements almost all the directions of the changes in concentrations of these compounds except well no 5 are the same this may indicate that at present the groundwater with increasing cfc concentration is inflowing all the time from the shallow aquifers recharged before the decrease of the concentration of cfcs in the atmosphere therefore the groundwater is most likely to be older than 20 30 years 6 4 sulfur hexafluoride the general trends of variation in sf6 concentrations are similar to that of the cfcs concentrations variation the majority of cases of changes in sf6 concentrations indicates the increase of the concentration of this compound and at the same time is below the uncertainty of its determination fig 5 however the most essential data regarding sf6 were provided by the measurements carried out in well no 3 where the measured sf6 concentrations exceeded the equilibrium concentration for this compound occurring in the atmosphere in 2014 these results indicate that there is an additional geogenic sf6 source in the study area most likely this source is connected with the numerous occurrences of various types of volcanic rocks in the area of research unfortunately it is not possible to distinguish the geogenic sf6 from anthropogenic sf6 and establish their mutual quantitative relations as indicated by numerous authors busenberg and plummer 2008 harnisch and eisenhauer 1998 koh et al 2007 high concentrations of natural sf6 may occur in areas of volcanic rocks and polymetallic deposits what limits application this compound as a tracer to the groundwater dating therefore the results of sf6 studies despite a similar variability pattern to cfcs are burdened with high uncertainty and should be treated with some caution 6 5 noble gases the differences in concentrations of he ne and ar between the first and second measuring rounds are either within the range of measurement uncertainty or slightly outside it fig 6 despite the short observation period this indicates stable conditions of migration of the noble gases examined in the aquifer in the case of he this also indicates its stable production in situ and or stable inflow of the helium flux jhe from deeper parts of the rock mass the magnitudes and directions of the changes in the concentrations of these gases do not show any correlation between the type of gas tested the depth of wells or how they were used also the occurrence of elevated o2 concentrations associated with the inflow of groundwater from the shallow aquifers does not show any relation to the concentrations of ar ne and he the significantly higher he concentration observed in well no 8 is likely related to the deposits of uranium ore found in this area this issue is discussed further in the following section of the present work see 7 3 section on the basis of ne and ar concentrations the temperatures existing in the past on the groundwater table in the recharge area ngt were estimated table 7 the ngt results obtained for the deeper wells no 5 6 7 and 8 indicate that the deep aquifers could have been partly recharged in a cooler period than the present one or at a higher altitude fig 7 the significant ngt changes concern the wells nos 1 6 and 7 and are caused by changes in the concentrations u of both ne and ar however they are not observed for changes in concentrations u of both gases at the same time the origin of the changes of ne and ar concentrations is difficult to explain by the mixing of the groundwaters of different concentrations of these gases because the variability of the concentrations of ne and ar does not show mutual correlation it should also be remembered that the concentrations of these gases can be influenced by some physical processes e g large scale dispersion stute and schlosser 2000 or diffusion małoszewski and zuber 1993 regardless of the causes of the fluctuations in the concentrations of ne and ar it can be seen that even minor changes in the concentrations of these gases have a significant influence on the ngt value therefore ngt determinations require caution in interpretation especially during one off measurements 6 6 altitude of recharge area for the study area no scientific paper on the isotopic research has been published so far the only existing the δ18o δ2h and 3h study results are presented in unpublished documentation on the uranium deposits grabczak and zuber 1989 and they are broadly consistent with our results the isotopic composition of the groundwater table 5 is in most cases characteristic for waters recharging the aquifer system in the contemporary period the lighter isotopic composition the samples from wells no 1 5 and 8 indicates that for these wells the aquifer system could be in some part recharged in a cooler period than the present one it is also possible that the observed change in isotopic composition is associated with the occurrence of an altitude effect resulting from the groundwater recharge at a higher altitude 800 1000 m the ngt values for wells 5 and 8 also indicate the infiltration of water either in the colder period or the higher altitude of the recharge area in the case of well no 1 only ngt values do not confirm this observation in general the variation in the isotopic composition of the groundwater does not show any relation to the depth of the wells or their type of use the results of calculations of the altitudes of the groundwater recharge areas are ambiguous the obtained results show partial compliance of the altitudes of the recharge areas and the altitudes determined on the basis of the groundwater flow directions only for wells no 1 and 2 see table 6 in other cases there are inconsistencies which may result from the mixing processes of groundwater recharged at different altitudes and the uncertainty of groundwater recharged areas determination on the basis of the groundwater flow directions the estimated altitudes of groundwater recharge areas were also compared with the average annual temperatures occurring in the sudetes at certain altitudes and the ngt results table 7 the results are also ambiguous but in some cases they can be considered compatible if differences of 1 1 5 c are taken as acceptable in the case of ow wells the results from the first measurement round were considered more reliable the results obtained indicate that for some wells no 1 2 and 4 the ngt values may be unreliable regardless of the time of measurement and the altitudes of the recharge area determined on the basis of groundwater flow directions should be treated as approximates wells no 4 5 6 and 8 7 groundwater ages 7 1 tritium data for well no 4 two measurements of tritium activity from different years 1989 and 2015 are known by applying the dm and epm models allow determining the age of groundwater for each model as 37 and 47 years the parameters of these models describing the part of tritium free water β are 0 65 and 0 44 respectively while the model parameters σ are 0 18 and 0 02 respectively however due to only two tritium measurements the obtained ages should be treated as tentative 7 2 cfcs data taking into account the observations concerning the hydrogeological conditions and the construction of the tested wells with the restrictions described in section 4 1 a simple piston flow model pfm was applied to determine the groundwater age by means of the known concentrations cfcs and sf6 the results obtained are shown in table 8 the age of groundwater determined in this way should be regarded as approximate in the case of wells covering the shallow aquifers no 1 2 3 and 7 for wells covering the deep aquifers no 4 5 6 and 8 the obtained ages are too low which is related to the cfcs degradation at greater depths see 6 3 sections therefore these ages should be considered unreliable 7 3 helium data the key factor for calculating age with the helium method is the value of jhe basal flux i e the he flux flowing from a deeper part of the rock mass to the aquifer the other calculation parameters n h ρf ρr etc are usually set with uncertainties from the considerable variability of these parameters in at different places depths in the rock mass this results in the necessity of averaging these parameters and entails an approximation error with usually an undetermined value however the impact on the groundwater dating result of typical errors in the determination of n and ρ is much lower than for jhe where often it is possible to change the value by an order of magnitude which causes a 10 fold decrease increase of the calculated age of groundwater the influence of the accuracy of the determination of the concentrations of u and th on groundwater age will be discussed later in the next part of this study the jhe value is often indirectly determined by using the helium method based on the results obtained through the use of other methods of groundwater dating however in this case the results obtained by the helium method are directly dependent on the correctness of the other determinations hence in order to obtain the more correct results of dating using the helium method it is worthwhile to perform the additional determinations using one or more the independent groundwater dating methods jhe values may differ by several orders of magnitude even within a one hydrogeological structural unit e g morongo basin 0 003 30 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 kulongoski et al 2005 different measurements of this variable have been made for central europe these are sometimes significantly different for the same area for example for the great hungarian plain the following ranges of jhe are given 0 067 0 54 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 according to stute et al 1992 or 9 41 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 according to martel et al 1989 taking the above remarks concerning the jhe and observed ranges of this parameter into account when calculating the groundwater age a value for jhe of 3 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 was assumed in the majority of cases except for well no 2 where jhe is 0 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 this value is close to the value jhe given for the earth s crust 3 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 acc to o nions and oxburgh 1983 although other values are also given e g 1 0 0 4 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 torgersen 1989 or even 8 2 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 ozima and podosek 1983 mamyrin and tolstikhin 1984 the concentrations of heexc the calculated ages of groundwater and other variables used in its calculation are shown in table 9 the heexc concentrations observed in the area of research are small in comparison to those in the other areas of the sudetes where within the crystalline rocks of depth up to 750 m concentrations of he were observed in the range of 7 251 10 6 cm3 stp g 1 zuber et al 1995 the 3he 4he coefficient value 5 5 33 2 10 8 determined by the above mentioned authors indicates that the earth s crust is the main source of the he flux migrating into the aquifer in order to determine the impact that zones with elevated u and th concentrations in the research area may exert on the calculation of groundwater age modeling of this phenomenon has been carried out the aquifers in the research area are mainly composed of clastic rocks average uranium concentrations in this type of rock usually amount to several ppms polański 1988 plewa plewa 1992 in the research area average concentrations of u 100 ppm occur usually in shale layers of small thicknesses ca 1 3 m situated at various depths usually 300 800 m there are usually only a few 2 4 layers with increased uranium content since the concentrations of u and th occurring locally are quite differentiated a modeling of the impact of the variability of u and th concentration on the he production in situ within the aquifer was carried out individually for each well depending on different jhe values in modeling a constant coefficient cu cth 0 25 was assumed the adoption of a different arbitrary relationship between u and th concentrations i e a change in the cu cth value in the 0 1 range results in a change in he in situ production and thus a groundwater age change of less than 1 of the age calculated for cu cth 0 25 in most cases this difference does not exceed the uncertainty of he measurement extreme cases i e the lowest and highest observed concentrations of he wells no 2 and 8 are discussed below as the most representative examples of modeling the individual cases have been discussed separately the results of the modeling obtained for well no 2 are shown in fig 8 the he concentrations 6 7 6 8 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 are very low and close to the value 4 64 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 i e the concentration of helium in surface water in equilibrium with an atmosphere at sea level at a water temperature of 10 c taking into account that the probable age of groundwater in well no 2 due to the tritium content and observed the cfcs concentration does not exceed 50 years the used to modeling assumed value of jhe is 0 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 the modeling results for well no 2 indicate that only at average concentrations of u 135 ppm and th 540 ppm fig 9 in the 55 m thick layer the he production in situ begins to exceed the uncertainty of he measurement and may therefore affect decreasing the calculated age of groundwater the occurrence of 55 m thick rock layers with such high average concentrations of u and th is completely impossible in the research area taking into account the research done there to date therefore the concentration of u and th in the aquifer and thus the amount of he produced in situ does not have a significant effect on heexc and the groundwater age it can be assumed that the jhe 0 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 represents an area without high concentrations of u and th which is separated from the inflow of larger quantities of he produced in situ in areas with high concentration of u and th the results of the modeling obtained for well no 8 are shown in fig 9 the concentrations of he 301 3 308 7 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 are the highest in the area of research as the actual age of groundwater in well no 8 is unknown the age obtained with cfcs and sf6 methods was considered unreliable a value of jhe 3 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 was assumed for modeling and calculations of age in the sudetes area in crystalline rocks jhe may change within the range 3 5 32 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 zuber et al 1995 the higher value is associated with the presence of uranium deposits in the recharge areas of groundwater where such high values of jhe are observed ciężkowski et al 1992 for well no 8 the in situ he production begins to exceed the he measurement uncertainty for average concentrations of u 21 ppm and th 84 ppm fig 9 these values although they are lower than for the areas of uranium deposits are obtained for a model assuming the

with the presence of in cfcs in this well to sum up in this case also the results obtained exclude any significant influence of he produced in situ within the aquifer on the age of groundwater similar modeling results were also obtained for the remaining wells tested there are of course differences were observed in the limit of the ranges of the concentrations of u and th at which begins the potential impact of the he in situ productions on the groundwater dating results however taking into account geological and hydrogeological conditions of the study area there is a high probability that the production of he in situ within the aquifer does not have a significant impact on the groundwater age this is the opposite of the situation described by some authors e g torgersen and clarke 1985 kulongoski et al 2008 who pointed out that for relatively young waters 50 ka the greatest influence on heexc value and thus on the age of groundwater is he in situ production these conclusions are put forward by the above mentioned authors on the basis of groundwater research of the great artesian basin australia in the work of torgersen and clarke 1985 the authors focus on determining the rate of accumulation of 4he and the in situ production of 4he for the aquifer systems where groundwater with significantly different ages are observed 50 ka and older than 100 ka the authors also indicate that over long times the 4he accumulation rate in groundwater aquifers may be controlled by the whole crust flux of 4he while in the work of kulongoski et al 2008 the authors present a comparison of the use of three different research methods to determine the groundwater age i e 14c 36cl cl and 4he the authors also pointed out that despite the presence of major tectonic faults diffusion may be the dominant transport mechanism for he in the crust 8 conclusions the summary of the results of all studies leads to the conclusion that in the study area the vertical groundwater flows have significant importance in the groundwater circulation system these flows are mainly associated with a network of cracks and fissures with a vertical or near vertical spatial orientation which creates conditions for a strong hydraulic contact between the various parts of the aquifer located at different depths this results in an intense mixing of groundwater and the occurrence of groundwater containing the ions and or gases in concentrations characteristic of the deep aquifers with the simultaneous occurrence of ions and gases of anthropogenic origin at the same time there are local zones where vertical flows are additionally intensified by the exploitation of groundwater and as a result some the components of groundwater characteristic for shallow aquifers can occur at large depths these observations indicate that in the research area the flow of groundwater with vertical directions may have significance comparable to that of lateral flow the calculated groundwater ages should be treated as approximate due to both the uncertainty of the computational parameters which have been presented and the hydrogeological conditions of the research area the groundwater ages calculated using the helium method for shallower wells are in large part consistent and comparable to the results obtained by the cfcs sf6 method for deeper wells results obtained by the helium method are more reliable than cfcs sf6 results in particular in the context of hydrogeochemical data ree and the phenomenon of cfcs degradation the measurements of concentrations of cfcs sf6 and noble gases which were carried out at the two measurement rounds at different conditions of groundwater inflow irrespective of their use for determining groundwater age and other hydrogeological applications bring important information on the groundwater circulation system in the studied area even as raw data the results of the modeling of the influence of variability of u and th concentrations on the quantity of he in situ production indicate that this impact is actually negligible taking into account that the studies were conducted in an area with elevated u and th content in the rock environment the results obtained can be fully generalized for areas with medium or low concentrations of these elements in compared to those of the central sudetes therefore it can be assumed that for the majority of groundwater with he concentrations of 10 6 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 i e modern groundwater the he in situ production within the aquifer is insignificant hence the volume of he in situ production may be omitted in the calculation of groundwater age in most cases this simplifies the calculation of groundwater age using the helium method because it is not necessary to term the concentrations of u and th within the rock matrix of an aquifer the studied area is characterized by elevated concentrations of u and th in rocks compared to other areas in poland however only small amounts of these elements are usually observed in groundwater high concentrations of u and th in the groundwater comparable to concentrations in poor uranium ore deposits occur only locally taking into account the physical parameters of aquifers in the study area mainly the porosity and fissuring it indicates that mobile ions of uranium and suspension of thorium compounds are not a significant source of he in situ production within the aquifer the spatial variability of he concentrations in the study area indicates that there is hardly any dissipation of the he flux migrating from deep parts of the rock mass but the inflow of he is of a mosaic nature mainly related to the systems of major fissures and tectonic faults the variability of the he concentrations seems to be stable over the short term

6787,in the central sudetes the areas of sedimentary permian and carboniferous rocks are characterized by small resources of groundwater and are much less understood than aquifer systems occurring in the crystalline and mesozoic sedimentary rocks the environmental tracer studies conducted in a double sampling cycle during changing conditions of groundwater inflow can significantly facilitate the understanding of hydrogeological conditions in areas of the complicated geological structure therefore in order to identify the hydrogeological conditions of study area measurements of geogenic and anthropogenic gases he ne ar cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 determinations of isotopic composition of groundwater δ18o δ2h and 3h and the hydrogeochemical data including selected rees thorium and uranium were used the research which was conducted both in natural groundwater flow conditions and in conditions of flow disturbed by the continuous exploitation of the groundwater enabled among other things a direct determination of the rate of maximum decomposition of cfc 11 and cfc 12 at depths of 50 450 m in the clastic rocks it ranges from 189 to 315 10 12 g l 1 yr 1 for cfc 11 and from 110 to 198 10 12 g l 1 yr 1 for cfc 12 the research conducted also indicates that in the study area the vertical or nearly vertical groundwater flow may have significance comparable to the lateral groundwater flow this results in an intense mixing of groundwater which leads to the local occurrence of groundwater containing the ions and gases in concentrations characteristic of the deep aquifers in the studied area with the simultaneous occurrence of ions and gases of anthropogenic origin the results of measurements on cfcs sf6 and noble gases indicate a significant inflow of young groundwater to the whole freshwater zone an occurrence of a geogenic sf6 source which is most probably associated with volcanic rocks was also found calculated the groundwater ages indicate that the research area is dominated by groundwater of age less than 1 ka and mainly in the range of 0 05 0 25 ka the results of modeling of the influence of the variability of u and th concentrations on the he in situ production within the aquifer phe indicate that for groundwater with he concentrations of 10 6 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 i e modern groundwater the he in situ production within the aquifer is actually negligible so it may be omitted in the calculation of their age considering the fact that in the study area which is terrain with elevated uranium concentration there is no significant effect of phe on groundwater dating using the helium method it can be concluded that the dating results obtained with this method in such areas can be fully comparable with those obtained for areas with lower concentrations of uranium it was also found that mobile ions of uranium and suspension of thorium compounds occurred in the groundwater are not a significant source of he in situ production within the studied aquifers

groundwater dating ree 1 introduction as a result of human activity many chemical compounds such as sulfur hexafluoride sf6 and chlorofluorocarbons mainly cfc 11 ccl3f and cfc 12 ccl2f2 which can be used as hydrogeological tracers have been introduced into the hydrosphere cfcs are widely used to hydrogeological data interpretation and calculation of groundwater age for groundwaters recharged as early as the 1940s busenberg and plummer 1992 2000 plummer and busenberg 2000 solomon et al 2006 a rapid increase in cfcs concentration in the atmosphere was observed until the 90 s after signing the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer in 1987 the concentration of these compounds began to decrease all the time thus reducing the possibility of dating waters which infiltrated into the aquifer after 1993 sf6 is an anthropogenic tracer that can be used to date young waters infiltrating into the aquifer after 1993 the concentration of this tracer in the atmosphere increases monotonically śliwka and lasa 2000 maiss and brenninkmeijer 1998 a broader description of sources of origin dynamics of changes and behavior of these chemical compounds in the environment and their application in hydrogeological studies was presented by among others zuber et al 1995 busenberg and plummer 2000 2008 vollmer and weiss 2002 and darling et al 2005 sf6 cfc 11 and cfc 12 as gaseous components of the atmosphere penetrate into groundwater mainly as a result of infiltration of waters saturated with these gases through contact with the atmosphere recharging the groundwater system from above in some cases they may also be able to dissolve directly in groundwater this mainly occurs in open aquifer systems found in rocks with double and or triple porosity zuber and motyka 1994 motyka 1998 this situation occurs mainly in pore and fissure aquifers where there are often systems of open cracks at the border of aeration saturation zones unobstructed hydraulically open fissures in the aeration zone are filled with a mixture of soil and atmospheric air which in such cases has much easier contact with groundwater tracer studies of groundwater are also carried out using the helium method the helium method uses the phenomenon of excess concentration of 4he resulting from the radioactive decay of certain elements of the uranium and thorium series in groundwater the determination of 4he concentrations for most hydrogeological studies can be successfully replaced by the measurement of the total he 4he 3he concentration due to the negligible concentration of 3he zuber 2007 zuber et al 2007 kotowski and najman 2015 in most cases the 3he mass fraction in the total he concentration does not exceed 0 00001 and this is significantly less than the unreliability of total he concentration measurements using chromatographic methods groundwater enrichment in he is most often the result of subsurface production of this gas or its migration from deeper parts of the earth s crust or mantle in other words he diffuses into the aquifer from below other gases dissolved in groundwater of which the concentrations have been studied in the research area are ne and ar the ne and ar analyses are used to determine the temperature in the groundwater recharge area ngt using the dependence on temperature of the gas solubility at the surface of the water concentrations of ne and ar are also used to determine the volume of the excess air the knowledge of which is required to date the groundwater by the helium method the excess air results from the dissolution of more air into the groundwater than the amount directly resulting from the thermodynamic equilibrium on the contact between the atmosphere and the groundwater table in the recharge area this is the result of fluctuations in the water table and the capture of air bubbles retained on the surface of the solid phase excess air is determined from the ne concentration which is almost independent of temperature both the ngt and volume of excess air represent the conditions existing on the water table during the groundwater recharge ballentine and burnard 2002 and ballentine et al 2002 presented a detailed description of the formation release and migration within the earth s crust of noble gases examples of the measurement of the concentrations of noble gases in hydrogeological research and of applications related to these were presented in more detail by among others mazor 1972 solomon et al 1996 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 cook and herczeg 2000 and porcelli et al 2002 in hydrogeological studies the methods based on analyzing the composition of the stable isotopes oxygen and hydrogen δ18o δ2h in groundwaters are widely used for example the stable isotope composition of the precipitation depends on the temperature prevailing where the precipitation infiltrates into the aquifer this creates an opportunity to determine the altitude effect i e the variation of the composition of the above mentioned isotopes with altitude which enables the location of the groundwater recharge area in mountainous terrain to be determined examples of the application of isotopic studies in the hydrogeological research were presented inter alia by różański and duliński 1988 mook and de vries 2001 aggarwal et al 2005 and zuber et al 2008 another important environmental tracer used for groundwater research is radioactive tritium 3h the rapid increase and next the systematic decrease of tritium activity in precipitation have been recording since about the half of the 60s which enable the use of this isotope as a useful tracer for determining the transition time of groundwater a wide description of the behaviour of this tracer in the environment examples of seasonal and spatial differentiation of its activity and its application to the groundwater dating are presented among others by rozanski et al 1991 geyh et al 2001 zuber et al 2005 kazemi et al 2006 and mook 2006 the central sudetes is an area of the very complex geological structure and at the same time the hydrogeological conditions are here less understood than in others parts of sudetes especially compared to better understood groundwater systems within the crystalline rocks or mesozoic sediments in particular the weaker understanding applies to the carboniferous and permian aquifers which mostly occur in the research area this is mainly due to the very small number of wells located in this vast area approx 25 wells the remaining aquifers occurring in the sediments of triassic and cretaceous are much better studied however these types of an aquifer in the research area occur only sporadically a broader description of the circulation conditions the isotopic and chemical composition of the groundwater in the multi aquifer systems in the central sudetes as well as neighboring areas of the western and eastern sudetes was presented by ciężkowski et al 1992 zuber et al 1995 staśko and tarka 2001 tarka 2006 dobrzyński 2007 and chudzik and kotowski 2017 the other hydrogeological aspects of the ścinawka river catchment area which concern the groundwater resources or the groundwater protection are presented by szafranek et al 1986 bielecka et al 1992 and poprawski et al 1997 the research area covers the catchment area of the ścinawka river 594 km2 which occupies a vast section of the central sudetes the ścinawka river catchment is an important drainage base for permo carboniferous and mesozoic aquifers the research concerns groundwater of a low tds 1 g l 1 which form the freshwater zone in major part some of the researched wells are used for drinking water supply and constitute the only source of drinking water in the study area the results of physicochemical analyses obtained by using the oes ms and hplc analytical techniques and of investigations of dissolved gases concentrations in groundwater he ar ne ne cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 which were carried out for groundwater samples originating from the permian the triassic and the carboniferous are presented in this paper field studies and sampling were carried out in two measurement rounds in 2014 the studies were supplemented in september 2015 with results of the chemical analysis of uranium thorium and rees ions in the groundwater and the determinations of δ2h δ18o as well as 3h activity the aim of the research was to understand the hydrogeology of the study area in as many aspects as possible the research mainly focused on the conditions of the groundwater circulation and determination of the age of the groundwater samples taken from the fissure porous aquifer system one of the significant components of the description of the groundwater flow in the mountainous area is the altitude of the groundwater recharge area which can be calculated by using the determinations of the isotopic composition of groundwater and or ngt the determination of the variation of concentrations of environmental tracers migrating to the aquifer from both the top and the bottom gives a better understanding of the circulation of groundwater originating from different sources or distinct inflow routes equally important is the use of tracers with different origins to enable the groundwater age to be independently determined since uranium ore and polymetallic deposits occur in the study area a significant issue in understanding the hydrochemistry and consequently the groundwater flow was the estimation of the spatial variation and range of concentration of the u th and rees ions in groundwater in the research area there are zones with elevated concentrations of u and th which necessitated modeling of the influence of the variability of u and th concentration on he in situ production within the aquifer and thus on the age of groundwater taking into account the likelihood of direct contact between the air and the groundwater in the study area the important issue was the investigation of the stability of the cfcs in both the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer system sampling was carried out for two groups of wells the first group consists of the water supply wells which were continuously used and the second group consists of wells which were exploited only sporadically this differentiation was aimed at analyzing the variability of groundwater circulation in natural conditions and in conditions disturbed by groundwater exploitation the groundwater samples were collected in the same wells during the two measuring rounds distant in time sampling was carried out at half yearly intervals in order to trace the short term variability of measured gas concentrations in groundwater this way of sampling in two measurement rounds in different conditions of groundwater flow enabled the degradation rate of the cfcs in the groundwater to be calculated 2 geological conditions the central sudetes are one of the most geologically complex areas of poland and europe the research area was tectonically very strongly transformed and is covered with a dense network of faults of various lengths and discharges e g ihnatowicz et al 2009c d apart from confirmed faults there are numerous photolineaments most probably connected with various types of dislocations the survey area is located within a few large geological and structural units fig 1 the lithology of rocks in the central sudetes is very diverse within the perimeter of the research area there are mainly sedimentary clastic rocks sandstones conglomerates as well as mudstones and clays the clastic rocks often include fragments of volcanic rocks and feldspars chloritised biotite argillaceous siliceous and ferrous cement carbonates gypsum dispersed pyrite and organic matter bossowski 1996 1997 the research area also includes volcanic rocks rhyolites trachyandesites and trachybasalts and metamorphic rocks gneisses granitogneisses and phyllites the total thickness of molasses sedimentary rocks in the study area is up to 11 km a broader description of the types and genesis of rocks occurring in the central sudetes has been presented by e g aleksandrowski et al 2000 aleksandrowski and mazur 2002 and mccann 2008 in the whole area of the sudetes there are numerous polymetallic deposits which are characterized by a variety of forms of occurrence and by multi component and variable mineralization the uranium content in the rocks in the research area is highly variable the higher concentrations of uranium occur in the permian clastic rocks as well as in the volcanic ones in volcanic rocks the average uranium content is 3 18 ppm sylwestrzak 1972 in the świerki region well no 5 at depths of about 880 m uranium concentrations of 5 50 ppm were found in clay sediments miecznik and strzelecki 1979 the largest accumulation of uranium occurs in shale usually forming several levels within the clastic rocks they form locally lean uranium deposits of low concentration such a deposit occurs in the wambierzyce area well no 8 within the walchia shales at a depth from 100 to 350 m where the uranium content was 100 300 ppm nieć 2009 the highest uranium concentration in the research area was observed in ludwikowice kłodzkie where at a depth of approximately 340 m the uranium content in rocks reaches up to 350 ppm miecznik 1983 3 hydrogeological setting the complex geological structure of the central sudetes results in complex hydrogeological conditions in the area of research groundwater occurs within a multi aquifer system the aquifers are predominantly found in the carboniferous and permian clastic rocks mainly sandstones and conglomerates apart from the permian and carboniferous aquifers the cretaceous and triassic aquifers were sporadically found in the study area with some simplification within the studied multi aquifer system two groups of aquifers can be distinguished they can be described as shallow and deep aquifers the shallow aquifers occur in almost the whole of the research area they are usually composed of the regolith layer of variable thickness several to about a dozen meters below which there are cracked solid rocks with many fissures the thickness of the shallow aquifers is variable it is typically around 30 50 m and depends on the depth of a system of hydraulically active fissures a completely different situation occurs in the case of deep aquifers which occur almost only in areas of fault zones with large depths in such areas the hydraulically active network of cracks and fissures reaches a depth down to even a few kilometers typically there is no clear boundary separating shallow aquifers from deep aquifers there is a gradual change from a more cracked shallower zone into a deeper zone characterized by fewer cracks and or by smaller fissures the extent of freshwater zone depth in the research area is diversified according to bielecka et al 1992 during the drilling of some of the wells groundwater samples were taken from various depths for chemical analysis which allows an approximate determination of the freshwater zone depth table 1 the depth range of the freshwater zone can be estimated at approximately 110 450 m below that zone the groundwater with higher mineralization tds 1 g l 1 is found in some cases well no 8 freshwater appears to lie almost directly on mineral waters and there may be a relatively clear boundary between fresh groundwater and mineral waters from a deeper part of the aquifer system as a result of the lithological and tectonic differentiation of the study area the hydrogeological variables differ greatly the potential discharge of the wells ranges from 10 to several dozen m3 h 1 at drawdown from a few to over 50 m the hydraulic conductivity k is in the range from 1 17 10 8 to 7 3 10 3 m s 1 the wide ranges of value of these variables indicate that the research area is very heterogeneous in terms of the groundwater flow aquifers occurring in different age rocks often remain in hydraulic contact with each other which creates favorable conditions for the vertical circulation of groundwater these contacts are largely related to fissure systems in fault zones almost all wells in the research area are located in fault zones where a significant flow rate of groundwater is observed areas with negligible groundwater resources are always found outside the fault zones the observations carried out in the multi aquifer systems indicate that the heights of groundwater table are similar despite the fact they refer aquifers occurring at different depths in general the study area should be treated as a single fissure porous multi aquifers system fig 2 the aquifers are recharged by infiltration of rainwater through cracks and fissure systems permian deposits are rocks with a rare and irregular network of cracks the width of the fissures on the rock outcrops is in the range of 0 01 30 mm of which approximately 50 are cracks up to 3 mm the fissure spacing ranges from 0 3 to 5 m the measurements made allowed the determination of crack continuity index wc which is expressed as the ratio of the length of crack to the length of the measured section liszkowski and stochlak 1976 the calculated values of wc ranged from 0 654 to 1 the fissure hydraulic conductivity calculated from the above values based on the louis formula wittke and louis 1968 modified by liszkowski and stochlak 1976 is in the range from 1 02 10 5 to 3 1 10 9 m s 1 the hydrological cycle has a visible impact on the groundwater recharge in the research area shallow aquifers are characterized by a fast several to dozen days reaction to atmospheric precipitation for deep aquifers the relationships between precipitation and piezometric pressure are complex and may show mutual correlations even at longer multi month intervals staśko et al 2017 according to the above mentioned authors in the area of neighboring western sudetes the reaction of deeper aquifers to extremely hydrologic and meteorological drought may occur with a delay of up to 880 days 4 methods 4 1 sampling of wells the selection of the wells to sampling was dictated primarily by their representativeness for the hydrogeological conditions of the ścinawka river catchment area to the sampling of groundwater from the permian aquifers wells with large depths were chosen evenly distributed in the study area apart from the wells no 1 2 and 7 no other wells were found in the study area which intakes the groundwater of the triassic and carboniferous aquifers the availability of the wells was an additional aspect for choosing wells for sampling in the case of some observation wells which are exploited only sporadically their technical condition did not allow for sampling the groundwater samples to measure dissolved gas concentrations he ne ar sf6 cfc 11 and cfc 12 were collected in two measuring rounds in the same eight wells during each measurement round one sample was taken from each well the first round lasted from 24 to 30 april 2014 while the second one lasted from 4 to 6 november 2014 the samples were taken both from continuously exploited water supply wells sw and from sporadically exploited with a frequency of not more than once every 5 10 years observation wells ow before sampling from the ow wells each well had been previously pumped out approx 5 7 of the volume well the sw wells are exploited daily for water supply and in this case sampling was carried out without prior pumping pumping was also not carried out for the artesian well no 3 due to spontaneous outflow before sampling from this well water was freely flowing from it for 12 h so that a groundwater sample could be obtained directly from the aquifer groundwater samples were collected directly from the wellhead by means of a system that prevented contact of the collected sample with the atmosphere characteristics of the sampling wells and the results of field tests are presented in table 2 the studied wells are screened at different depths in the various parts of the aquifer system at the same time they most likely remain in strong hydraulic contact with each other some of the studied wells have two screens at different depths no 1 and 4 in this case a joint analysis of the concentrations of all the gases tested and the chemical composition of samples allows us to hypothesize that groundwater from shallow aquifers is predominant in the samples from these wells most likely the screens in the upper sections of the well create an efficient route for the inflow of groundwater from shallow aquifers in addition some of the wells which were studied e g wells no 5 and 8 have screen at long intervals respectively 287 and 187 m in all of the above mentioned cases it is probable that the groundwater from two sources or more will be mixed in undetermined different proportions caused by the variability of exploitation or other indefinite factors therefore in many cases it is not possible to indicate precisely from which depth and from which part of the aquifer system samples of the groundwater are derived it should be clearly emphasized that this is a kind of averaging of groundwater from the hydraulically connected parts of the aquifer system in the case of other existing wells in the investigated area their technical condition usually does not allow pumping to be carried out therefore it is not possible to obtain more samples from a precisely defined depth of the aquifer system the initial depth of some wells no 4 5 and 6 was reduced in the 1990s by inserting cement plugs into certain sections the purpose of this activity was to isolate fresh groundwater intended for drinking from groundwater which is more highly mineralized the exact depths of cement plugs and their present technical conditions are not known however it can form the potential route of the groundwater inflow from the deeper part of the aquifer system 4 2 measurements of chemical composition of groundwater groundwater samples for the basic physicochemical analyses were collected in 2014 simultaneously with samples for the determination of dissolved gas concentrations the electrical conductivity ec the concentration of dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured in situ with wtw or elmetron probes samples for chemical analysis were immediately passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter into polyethylene bottles 250 dm3 and kept refrigerated until analyzed samples for the measurement of the concentration of cations were acidified using a few drops of concentrated hno3 the chemical analyses were conducted by the accredited laboratory of the polish geological institute major dissolved elements were analyzed by icp oes optima 8300 the icp ms elan drc ii and the la icp ms elan drc ii lsx 500 were used for the measurement of concentrations of minor and typical trace elements concentrations of anions were determined by hplc alliance hplc system due to the numerous polymetallic deposits occurring in the research area an analysis of the occurrence in groundwater of selected ions from the actinide group and ions of ree was also performed sampling was conducted in september 2015 the samples to uranium and ree ions concentrations measurements were immediately passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter into polyethylene bottles 250 dm3 and kept refrigerated until analyzed the samples for thorium concentration measurement were not filtered because large amounts of th are present often in the suspension which is removed by filtration through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the chemical analyses were conducted by the accredited laboratory of the faculty of geology geophysics and environmental protection of the university of science and technology in cracow the icp ms elan 7500 were used for measurements of uranium thorium and rees ions concentrations the threshold of the icp ms depends on the type of element and varies from a few ppb to several tens of decimal ppms 4 3 measurements of dissolved gases and the isotopic composition of groundwater groundwater samples were collected into 2 9 dm3 steel vessels constructed in a way that enabled extraction of the gases dissolved in water using the head space method the head space method of gas extraction from a sample consists of the analysis of gases from the space above a groundwater sample enclosed in an airtight vessel śliwka and lasa 2000 the gaseous sample is analyzed after previously bringing such a liquid gas system to a state of thermal equilibrium najman and śliwka 2013 2016 the concentrations of gases dissolved in groundwater were determined using the gas chromatography gc method pusz et al 2007 due to the low he concentration in the sample from well no 2 a sample analysis was performed using an additional chromatographic system equipped with a cryogenic sample enrichment system a broader description of construction and applications to the hydrogeological researches of the chromatographic system for simultaneous measurement of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 as well as he ar and ne from one groundwater sample was presented by śliwka et al 2004 mochalski et al 2007 najman and śliwka 2016 additionally the isotope composition of groundwater δ18o and δ2h as well as 3h activity was determined determinations of the isotope composition were conducted in the laboratory of the faculty of physics and applied computer science of the university of science and technology in cracow in 2015 this was done on a finnigan mat 251 ratio mass spectrometer the oxygen isotope composition of water samples δ18o was determined using the co2 equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 sample preparation was performed using an automatic line multiprep coupled with a dual inlet finnigan delta s mass spectrometer the measurements of the hydrogen isotope composition δ2h were

isotopic composition of groundwater occurring in mountains areas is frequently modified by the so called altitude effect which is dependent on the altitude of the groundwater recharge area using the formulas of 1 and 2 ciężkowski 1990 the altitude h of the groundwater recharge areas was calculated the altitude effect corrected for the continental effect in the kłodzko region is as follows 1 h δ 18 o 595 6 80 1 δ 18 o 5520 843 m 2 h δ 2 h 85 8 18 6 δ 2 h 5405 1335 m in addition the approximate altitude of groundwater recharge areas i e h flow determined on the basis of groundwater flow directions was estimated the altitudes of the groundwater recharge areas for the analyzed wells were estimated on the basis of the 1 50 000 scale polish hydrogeological map mroczkowska 1997 kłonowski

measurements of the fissuring of rocks which was conducted in the study area the nearest springs and other groundwater outflows from which surface waters flowed in accordance with the slope of the land towards the given wells were determined for each well studied the altitude of the occurrence of springs and other groundwater outflows was assumed as the altitude of the occurrence of the phreatic zone in particular cases the recharge area of these waters was determined above the phreatic zone based on the analysis of the occurrence of the fissure outcrops and the fault zones individual areas of groundwater recharge usually have a particular temperature of air depending on the altitude of the location taking this into account the obtained results were indirectly verified by a comparison with the average annual temperatures occurring in the sudetes at certain altitudes these temperatures were calculated according to the relationship found for the sudetes in accordance with formula 3 ciężkowski et al 1992 3 t c 0 00558 h 9 22 this dependence concerns the range of heights from 600 to 1600 m acc kwiatkowski and hołdys 1985 the altitudes of the recharge areas h calculated on the basis of both on the isotope composition and also on the direction of the groundwater flow were used to calculate the average annual temperatures 4 5 estimation of groundwater

its value was adopted from the mathematical model to the major groundwater basin mgb no 342 krawczyk et al 2015 which is an aquifer system designated close to the study area with a very similar geological structure to the study area 4 6 groundwater dating 4 6 1 cfcs and sf6 methods the determination of the age of groundwater using cfcs and sf6 is based on measurements of the content of these tracers in the atmosphere maiss and brenninkmeijer 1998 prinn et al 2000 the listed tracers are the anthropogenic gases soluble in water their concentration in water is determined at a certain temperature by thermodynamic equilibrium precipitations with certain these tracers content infiltrate into the groundwater the determination of the groundwater age consists of the measurement of tracer concentration in the groundwater in reference to the equilibrium concentration of this tracer that occurred during contact with the atmosphere at a defined temperature concentrations of the mentioned gases in surface waters in equilibrium with the atmosphere can be determined from henry s law 5 c lo k lg c p where clo concentration in surface water g cm 3 h2o cp concentration in the

suitable model of the groundwater flow one can estimate the time elapsed since the infiltration of precipitations into groundwater until today i e the age of groundwater the piston flow model of groundwater age pfm was used to calculate the age of groundwater using cfcs and sf6 the methods of dating using cfcs and sf6 are described in detail by among others busenberg and plummer 2000 zuber et al 2007 as well as busenberg and plummer 2008 the application of geogenic and anthropogenic tracers in hydrogeology for dating purposes requires the amount of excess of air to be known this excess of air is a variable indicating the amount of air dissolved in groundwater due to the balance between water and the atmosphere which arises as a result of the dissolving air bubbles attached to the soil and rocks during the infiltration of rainwater heaton and vogel 1981 in mountainous areas where the groundwater recharge area is located much higher than the drainage area it is also necessary to adjust the measured tracer concentration to the ngt najman et al 2012 4 6 2 helium methods for the calculation of the groundwater age using the helium method the total he 4he 3he concentration measurements can be successfully used due to the negligible 3he concentration which is significantly lower than the uncertainty of the he concentration measurement by gc method the following formulas

the sum of the fissure and matrix porosities for shallow wells n 0 1 was assumed acc to kaczyński 2017 n 0 05 was assumed by authors for deeper wells with less developed the system of fissures in purpose to reflect the worsened conditions of the groundwater flow at great depths 100 m h aquifer thickness table 4 in some works e g kulongoski et al 2003 2005 instead of h the zo parameter is used zo depth at which he flux enters the aquifer or distance from the middle of the perforations in the well casing to the interface between the aquifer and the basement formation in the research area the age of groundwater calculated in this way is mostly very similar to that calculated using the parameter h the differences do not exceed a few percents jhe the external flux of he basal flux flowing into the aquifer the assumed jhe for the majority of the wells is 3 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 except well no 2 when jhe is 0 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 ρf water density assumed as ρf 1 0 g cm 3 λ the

were made using the 10 dependency cu the uranium concentration in the rock matrix of the aquifer assumed average concentrations of uranium is cu 3 ppm cth the thorium concentration in the rock matrix of the aquifer assumed average concentrations of thorium is cth 14 ppm ρr the density of the rock matrix of the aquifer assumed as 2 65 g cm 3 4 6 3 modeling of influence of the cu and cth variability on groundwater age the aim of the modeling was to determine what impact may be exerted on the age of groundwater by zones with elevated u and th content in which there may be a local increase in he production directly within the aquifer phe referred to as he in situ production the volume of he in situ production depends primarily on the u and th content which in the research area can rapidly change by 2 3 orders of magnitude within the rocks with a thickness of a few to a dozen meters modeling of the impact of variability of cu and cth concentrations on the age of groundwater at varying jhe values as an independent variable was carried out using the function no 10 which describes the dependence of the age of groundwater on the geological and physical parameters in order to simplify modeling the assumption was adopted that for most of the variables in function no 10 i e n h ρf ρr and λ the range of differentiation of their value in the particular wells is relatively small and they are essentially constant with respect to the potential differentiation of the concentrations of u and th in the rock matrix of the aquifer these allow for the adoption of averaged values of the physical and geological parameters of the aquifer and perform of the calculation only for a few variables i e jhe and cu and cth in modeling a constant ratio cu cth 0 25 was also assumed which allows for use to the calculation the cu only the ratio cu cth 0 25 is observed for the whole of the continental crust polański 1988 and this applies to both crystalline and sedimentary rocks therefore for aquifers with a defined thickness table 4 the widest possible range of average uranium concentration values was assumed 5 results the results of the major and minor ions concentrations measurements and hydrochemical type of water are presented in table 3 the results of the uranium thorium and selected rees ions concentrations measurements are presented in table 4 the results of the measurements of the concentrations of the analyzed gases and the isotope composition of the groundwater as well as the tritium activity are presented in table 5 the calculated altitudes of groundwater recharge areas and altitudes of groundwater recharge areas determined on the basis of groundwater flow directions are shown in table 6 the comparison of the temperatures of the recharge areas calculated by different methods and ngt are presented in table 7 the results of groundwater dating by cfcs sf6 and helium methods are presented in tables 8 and 9 the major parameters used to calculate the groundwater ages are also summarized in table 9 6 discussion 6 1 chemistry of groundwater variability in the mineral composition of the rock matrix influences the occurrence of different conditions of groundwater chemical composition formation this is reflected among others in the presence of different hydrochemical types of groundwater the main processes forming the chemical composition of groundwater are the dissolution of minerals and locally ion exchange ca2 na occurring within the clay deposits shales well no 3 and no 8 the inflow of anthropogenic contaminated waters is also noted locally it mainly reflects in the elevated nitrates concentrations in the shallow aquifers table 3 high concentrations of so4 2 ions in groundwater coming from the deep aquifers are probably the result of the inflow of groundwater from outside the freshwater zone broader studies on the chemistry of the groundwater and on the springs in the central sudetes were conducted by chudzik and kotowski 2017 the results of these studies indicate inter alia the lack of significant variability in concentrations of most of the analyzed ions with increasing of the depth of aquifer the aquifer system is largely uniform in terms of groundwater chemical composition which confirms the existence of a strong hydraulic contact between different parts of the aquifer system 6 2 rees ions the groundwater usually demonstrates the ree pattern that closely reflects the ree pattern of the rocks through which these groundwaters flow analysis of the distribution of ree content in groundwater is used to identify the origin of groundwater the study of groundwater mixing to designate the groundwater recharge area and many more in the deeper wells no 4 5 and 6 significantly higher concentrations of some rees eu sm and sc are observed there are high correlations between the content of eu sm and sc ions and the depths of the well r 0 81 0 73 and 0 84 respectively p 0 05 this most probably indicates the inflow of groundwater from the deep parts of the rock mass which is composed among other of igneous and metamorphic rocks the concentrations of other metal ions lrees and hrees i e y la nd ce gd dy er yb pr ho lu tb and tm were also analyzed however in most cases they occurred at concentrations not exceeding the limit of determination lod 0 1 μg l 1 lrees and hrees ions in concentrations slightly exceeding lod concentrations of 0 1 0 2 μg l 1 were observed only in well no 5 świerki the high concentrations of li ions observed in wells no 3 and 8 table 4 indicate the probable inflow of groundwaters enriched with this element as a result of the contact of groundwater with the formations of granites gneisses or pegmatite or due to the effect of ion exchange the high concentration of li ions is accompanied by high concentrations of na ions at significantly reduced concentrations of ca ions thus the very high li na correlation r 0 978 probably may be related to the ion exchange in the area of research higher activities concentrations of u isotopes ions are observed in comparison to the activities concentrations of this element observed in typical groundwater the average activities of the uranium isotopes 238u 235u and 234u in typical groundwater from different areas of poland are 4 5 6 0 mbq l 1 0 19 0 27 mbq l 1 and 5 7 6 9 mbq l 1 respectively pietrzak flis et al 2005 the range of 238u and 234u isotope activity in groundwater from the neighboring area upper silesian coal basin used for drinking is 0 07 14 4 0 02 0 9 mbq l 1 and 0 12 31 4 0 03 1 7 mbq l 1 chmielewska et al 2014 significantly lower concentrations of u ions in groundwater in the range of 0 01 3 72 μg l 1 are also observed in the groundwater with high salinity and low ph values within the shallow aquifers in the coastal regions lauria et al 2004 the concentrations of u ions in groundwater depend on redox conditions eh and ph as well as the content of anions hco3 co3 2 so4 2 and others forming complex compounds with uranium mobile highly soluble u6 ions e g uo2 2 are found in oxidizing conditions under reducing conditions uranium is present in groundwater at very low concentrations as the predominant form of uranium is the easily adsorbable u4 form the exact eh range of the groundwater environment is not known in the study area however it is to be expected that mainly the neutral or reducing environment the oxidizing environment is most likely only in the zone with a depth of up to 50 80 m as indicated by the measurements of cfcs see more in section 6 3 groundwater in the research area is characterized by high ph values 7 77 10 85 under these ph conditions carbonate complexes such as uo2 2 co3 2 2 are the predominant form of uranium in water and uranium concentrations can then reach high values it seems that in the area of research the occurrence of uranium in groundwater is not only related to the conditions of ph and eh but above all to the geological structure and the type of rocks in which the well is occurring the highest u ion concentration 71 μg l 1 is observed in the shallow well no 3 of depth 59 m which is the only studied wells which were drilled in the shale sediments such high concentrations of u ions can only occur if groundwater is in contact with rocks with higher uranium content the view that one of the main factors affecting the concentration of u ions in groundwater is the geological structure of the investigated area was also presented by lee et al 2001 and chau et al 2011 uranium and thorium tend to occur together in the geological formation due to the similarity in their ionic radii dissolved thorium is almost invariably complexed in groundwaters the behavior of thorium is influenced by its speciation and ph conditions in slightly acidic to alkaline ph conditions thorium complexes like th oh 4 0 are strongly absorbed and the mobility of thorium is reduced langmuir and herman 1980 thorium can also be present in complexes such as th hpo4 3 2 and th so4 2 0 or organic complexes the presence of th complexes with sulfate resulted in relatively high thorium concentrations at a low ph range up to app 4 5 ph langmuir and herman 1980 although complexing inorganic and organic increases the solubility of thorium bearing minerals in alkaline conditions at ph values below 8 maximum thorium concentrations in natural waters are probably limited in general by the paucity and slow dissolving rate of these minerals and also by sorption processes rather than by mineral solution equilibria langmuir and herman 1980 thorium occurring naturally apart from uranium ore deposits consists almost exclusively of the isotope 232th with a half life of 14 109 years thorium concentrations observed in groundwater in areas of uranium deposits can be high for example the concentration of thorium probably mainly 230th in water under low ph conditions which may occur from the leaching of uranium tailings may be as high as 3 8 104 μg l 1 moffett and tellier 1978 however it should be emphasized that in groundwater in areas where uranium deposits occur low concentrations of 232th below 0 02 μg l 1 0 005 dpm l 1 and very low concentrations of 230th below 6 10 7 μg l 1 0 0255 dpm l 1 are also observed short 1988 in conditions where the ph is above 6 and even at low toc of 1 mg l 1 the dominant form of thorium occurrence in groundwater is the organic complexes of this element langmuir and herman 1980 high concentrations of the 232th isotope are observed for aquatic environments with high ph values the concentrations of 232th in a highly alkaline ph of about 10 saline lake mono lake in california have been reported to be as high as approx 6 36 μg l 1 0 7 pci l 1 anderson et al 1982 simpson et al 1982 thorium concentrations 0 17 3 75 μg l 1 observed for most wells in the research area are typical for groundwater not found near uranium deposits and do not significantly exceed the values reported by other authors e g 0 5 2 9 μg l 1 harmsen and de haan 1980 the highest thorium concentration 26 2 μg l 1 is observed in the deep water supply well no 5 with simultaneous average uranium concentrations 2 4 μg l 1 there is a high correlation between th concentrations and well depth r 0 79 p 0 05 since similar correlations with the depth r 0 73 0 84 are observed also for ree ions and the chemical properties of thorium are similar to lanthanide this may indicate a common source of these elements most probably this source is the inflow of groundwater from the deepest parts of aquifers enriched with these elements as a result of the dissolution of monazite larger accumulations of monazite are observed in granites and gneisses among others which occurs deep parts of rock mass within the study area however it should be noted that regardless of the increased content of monazite in rocks can also occur significantly lower concentrations of thorium ions in groundwater in the range of 0 04 0 25 μg l 1 lauria et al 2004 most likely important factors affecting the concentration of thorium in the freshwater zone in the research area are not only ph conditions toc values or concentrations of main ions that are relatively similar but above all the possibility of groundwater inflow from deep parts of rock mass 6 3 chlorofluorocarbons in wells nos 1 2 and 4 high concentrations of dissolved oxygen do were found in both measuring rounds taking into account the groundwater temperature 9 13 c the do concentrations of 3 7 mg l 1 are close to the do concentrations founding in surface water and or rainwater such high concentrations of do indicate it is possible that through a system of cracks the mixture of soil gases and atmospheric air is periodically or continuously in contact with groundwater thus there is a possibility at least in part of direct dissolution of cfcs and sf6 at the gas water interface regardless of the measuring round significantly higher concentrations of cfcs are observed for most wells with high do concentrations fig 3 this does not apply to well no 5 where there is probably no significant inflow of groundwater from the shallow aquifers this is also confirmed by the low concentrations of no3 ions observed in this well the origin of high do concentrations in the first measurement round considering the depth of the well no 5 346 m is difficult to determine in this situation in general high concentrations of do and cfcs are observed mainly in the sw wells exploited in a continuous manner and thus forcing the inflow of groundwater mainly from the shallow aquifers a special case is the ow well no 2 which is the shallowest well 55 m in the area of research and naturally takes groundwater from the shallow aquifers taking into account the above observations it was assumed that the do range and the range of cfc concentrations observed for wells nos 1 2 and 4 are representative for shallow aquifers the concentrations of cfcs in groundwater with low do level are generally similar to each other for groundwater with high do level however occur clearly higher cfc 11 concentrations in comparison to those of cfc 12 fig 3 this indicates a different behavior of these compounds in the aquifer system cfcs sorption processes on organic substances are rather unlikely due to the negligible toc values 1 0 mg dm 3 observed in the study area table 2 cfc 11 and cfc 12 are stable under oxidative conditions however they can undergo degradation under reducing conditions with low oxygen content and microbial breakdown in such cases there is a noticeable difference in the rate of decomposition of these compounds in different type s environments and cfc 11 is usually decomposed faster than cfc 12 khalil and rasmussen 1989 oster et al 1996 sebol et al 2007 therefore it is important to analyze the variability of cfcs concentration in the study area in relation to the sampling depth fig 4 it can be observed that to a certain depth about 50 80 m there is an increase in the concentrations of both the analyzed cfcs this indicates there is presumably an oxidizing environment up to this depth which prevents the decomposition of cfcs for some of the ow wells nos 6 7 and 8 there is a noticeable increase in cfc concentrations in the second measurement round fig 3 since wells no 6 7 and 8 have not been in operation during the last 5 10 years the pumping carried out in the first round most probably triggered the inflow of groundwater from the shallow aquifers with higher concentrations of these gases due to the limited pumping time the volume of this inflow is not high 150 350 m3 at the same time the groundwater vertical inflow rate is high approx 1 1 9 2 10 6 m s 1 for k 5 8 10 6 m s 1 acc to krawczyk et al 2015 and the time of depression cone fading can range from several minutes to several hours in order to estimate the rate of cfc degradation in the aquifer it was assumed that the concentration of cfcs in inflowing groundwater does not exceed the values observed in the shallow aquifers on this basis it was calculated the theoretical maximum cfcs degradation rate in the deep aquifers it ranges from 189 to 315 10 12 g l 1 yr 1 for cfc 11 and from 110 to 198 10 12 g l 1 yr 1 for cfc 12 1 37 2 3 and 0 91 1 64 pmol l 1 yr 1 respectively these values are not high in relation to those given by other authors for example oster et al 1996 states that the rate of cfc 11 and cfc 12 degradation under anaerobic conditions is in the range of 0 05 and 3 105 pmol l 1 yr 1 according to the above mentioned work the cfc 12 cfc 11 degradation ratio to be constant over six orders of magnitude with cfc 12 always being less reactive by a factor of about 10 theoretically individual cfc molecules in the research area may undergo complete decay within 1 2 years this is quite a short period of time and given the cfc concentrations observed at large depths 100 m cfcs in the study area are likely to decompose at a much slower rate for example as indicated by horneman et al 2008 in shallow 5 7 26 4 m aquifers under reduction conditions cfc 11 and cfc 12 may undergo practically complete degradation 95 in groundwaters older than 10 years in the majority wells an increase in the concentrations of the cfcs is observed in the second measurement round although in numerous cases the changes in cfc concentrations do not exceed the uncertainty of measurements almost all the directions of the changes in concentrations of these compounds except well no 5 are the same this may indicate that at present the groundwater with increasing cfc concentration is inflowing all the time from the shallow aquifers recharged before the decrease of the concentration of cfcs in the atmosphere therefore the groundwater is most likely to be older than 20 30 years 6 4 sulfur hexafluoride the general trends of variation in sf6 concentrations are similar to that of the cfcs concentrations variation the majority of cases of changes in sf6 concentrations indicates the increase of the concentration of this compound and at the same time is below the uncertainty of its determination fig 5 however the most essential data regarding sf6 were provided by the measurements carried out in well no 3 where the measured sf6 concentrations exceeded the equilibrium concentration for this compound occurring in the atmosphere in 2014 these results indicate that there is an additional geogenic sf6 source in the study area most likely this source is connected with the numerous occurrences of various types of volcanic rocks in the area of research unfortunately it is not possible to distinguish the geogenic sf6 from anthropogenic sf6 and establish their mutual quantitative relations as indicated by numerous authors busenberg and plummer 2008 harnisch and eisenhauer 1998 koh et al 2007 high concentrations of natural sf6 may occur in areas of volcanic rocks and polymetallic deposits what limits application this compound as a tracer to the groundwater dating therefore the results of sf6 studies despite a similar variability pattern to cfcs are burdened with high uncertainty and should be treated with some caution 6 5 noble gases the differences in concentrations of he ne and ar between the first and second measuring rounds are either within the range of measurement uncertainty or slightly outside it fig 6 despite the short observation period this indicates stable conditions of migration of the noble gases examined in the aquifer in the case of he this also indicates its stable production in situ and or stable inflow of the helium flux jhe from deeper parts of the rock mass the magnitudes and directions of the changes in the concentrations of these gases do not show any correlation between the type of gas tested the depth of wells or how they were used also the occurrence of elevated o2 concentrations associated with the inflow of groundwater from the shallow aquifers does not show any relation to the concentrations of ar ne and he the significantly higher he concentration observed in well no 8 is likely related to the deposits of uranium ore found in this area this issue is discussed further in the following section of the present work see 7 3 section on the basis of ne and ar concentrations the temperatures existing in the past on the groundwater table in the recharge area ngt were estimated table 7 the ngt results obtained for the deeper wells no 5 6 7 and 8 indicate that the deep aquifers could have been partly recharged in a cooler period than the present one or at a higher altitude fig 7 the significant ngt changes concern the wells nos 1 6 and 7 and are caused by changes in the concentrations u of both ne and ar however they are not observed for changes in concentrations u of both gases at the same time the origin of the changes of ne and ar concentrations is difficult to explain by the mixing of the groundwaters of different concentrations of these gases because the variability of the concentrations of ne and ar does not show mutual correlation it should also be remembered that the concentrations of these gases can be influenced by some physical processes e g large scale dispersion stute and schlosser 2000 or diffusion małoszewski and zuber 1993 regardless of the causes of the fluctuations in the concentrations of ne and ar it can be seen that even minor changes in the concentrations of these gases have a significant influence on the ngt value therefore ngt determinations require caution in interpretation especially during one off measurements 6 6 altitude of recharge area for the study area no scientific paper on the isotopic research has been published so far the only existing the δ18o δ2h and 3h study results are presented in unpublished documentation on the uranium deposits grabczak and zuber 1989 and they are broadly consistent with our results the isotopic composition of the groundwater table 5 is in most cases characteristic for waters recharging the aquifer system in the contemporary period the lighter isotopic composition the samples from wells no 1 5 and 8 indicates that for these wells the aquifer system could be in some part recharged in a cooler period than the present one it is also possible that the observed change in isotopic composition is associated with the occurrence of an altitude effect resulting from the groundwater recharge at a higher altitude 800 1000 m the ngt values for wells 5 and 8 also indicate the infiltration of water either in the colder period or the higher altitude of the recharge area in the case of well no 1 only ngt values do not confirm this observation in general the variation in the isotopic composition of the groundwater does not show any relation to the depth of the wells or their type of use the results of calculations of the altitudes of the groundwater recharge areas are ambiguous the obtained results show partial compliance of the altitudes of the recharge areas and the altitudes determined on the basis of the groundwater flow directions only for wells no 1 and 2 see table 6 in other cases there are inconsistencies which may result from the mixing processes of groundwater recharged at different altitudes and the uncertainty of groundwater recharged areas determination on the basis of the groundwater flow directions the estimated altitudes of groundwater recharge areas were also compared with the average annual temperatures occurring in the sudetes at certain altitudes and the ngt results table 7 the results are also ambiguous but in some cases they can be considered compatible if differences of 1 1 5 c are taken as acceptable in the case of ow wells the results from the first measurement round were considered more reliable the results obtained indicate that for some wells no 1 2 and 4 the ngt values may be unreliable regardless of the time of measurement and the altitudes of the recharge area determined on the basis of groundwater flow directions should be treated as approximates wells no 4 5 6 and 8 7 groundwater ages 7 1 tritium data for well no 4 two measurements of tritium activity from different years 1989 and 2015 are known by applying the dm and epm models allow determining the age of groundwater for each model as 37 and 47 years the parameters of these models describing the part of tritium free water β are 0 65 and 0 44 respectively while the model parameters σ are 0 18 and 0 02 respectively however due to only two tritium measurements the obtained ages should be treated as tentative 7 2 cfcs data taking into account the observations concerning the hydrogeological conditions and the construction of the tested wells with the restrictions described in section 4 1 a simple piston flow model pfm was applied to determine the groundwater age by means of the known concentrations cfcs and sf6 the results obtained are shown in table 8 the age of groundwater determined in this way should be regarded as approximate in the case of wells covering the shallow aquifers no 1 2 3 and 7 for wells covering the deep aquifers no 4 5 6 and 8 the obtained ages are too low which is related to the cfcs degradation at greater depths see 6 3 sections therefore these ages should be considered unreliable 7 3 helium data the key factor for calculating age with the helium method is the value of jhe basal flux i e the he flux flowing from a deeper part of the rock mass to the aquifer the other calculation parameters n h ρf ρr etc are usually set with uncertainties from the considerable variability of these parameters in at different places depths in the rock mass this results in the necessity of averaging these parameters and entails an approximation error with usually an undetermined value however the impact on the groundwater dating result of typical errors in the determination of n and ρ is much lower than for jhe where often it is possible to change the value by an order of magnitude which causes a 10 fold decrease increase of the calculated age of groundwater the influence of the accuracy of the determination of the concentrations of u and th on groundwater age will be discussed later in the next part of this study the jhe value is often indirectly determined by using the helium method based on the results obtained through the use of other methods of groundwater dating however in this case the results obtained by the helium method are directly dependent on the correctness of the other determinations hence in order to obtain the more correct results of dating using the helium method it is worthwhile to perform the additional determinations using one or more the independent groundwater dating methods jhe values may differ by several orders of magnitude even within a one hydrogeological structural unit e g morongo basin 0 003 30 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 kulongoski et al 2005 different measurements of this variable have been made for central europe these are sometimes significantly different for the same area for example for the great hungarian plain the following ranges of jhe are given 0 067 0 54 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 according to stute et al 1992 or 9 41 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 according to martel et al 1989 taking the above remarks concerning the jhe and observed ranges of this parameter into account when calculating the groundwater age a value for jhe of 3 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 was assumed in the majority of cases except for well no 2 where jhe is 0 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 this value is close to the value jhe given for the earth s crust 3 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 acc to o nions and oxburgh 1983 although other values are also given e g 1 0 0 4 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 torgersen 1989 or even 8 2 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 ozima and podosek 1983 mamyrin and tolstikhin 1984 the concentrations of heexc the calculated ages of groundwater and other variables used in its calculation are shown in table 9 the heexc concentrations observed in the area of research are small in comparison to those in the other areas of the sudetes where within the crystalline rocks of depth up to 750 m concentrations of he were observed in the range of 7 251 10 6 cm3 stp g 1 zuber et al 1995 the 3he 4he coefficient value 5 5 33 2 10 8 determined by the above mentioned authors indicates that the earth s crust is the main source of the he flux migrating into the aquifer in order to determine the impact that zones with elevated u and th concentrations in the research area may exert on the calculation of groundwater age modeling of this phenomenon has been carried out the aquifers in the research area are mainly composed of clastic rocks average uranium concentrations in this type of rock usually amount to several ppms polański 1988 plewa plewa 1992 in the research area average concentrations of u 100 ppm occur usually in shale layers of small thicknesses ca 1 3 m situated at various depths usually 300 800 m there are usually only a few 2 4 layers with increased uranium content since the concentrations of u and th occurring locally are quite differentiated a modeling of the impact of the variability of u and th concentration on the he production in situ within the aquifer was carried out individually for each well depending on different jhe values in modeling a constant coefficient cu cth 0 25 was assumed the adoption of a different arbitrary relationship between u and th concentrations i e a change in the cu cth value in the 0 1 range results in a change in he in situ production and thus a groundwater age change of less than 1 of the age calculated for cu cth 0 25 in most cases this difference does not exceed the uncertainty of he measurement extreme cases i e the lowest and highest observed concentrations of he wells no 2 and 8 are discussed below as the most representative examples of modeling the individual cases have been discussed separately the results of the modeling obtained for well no 2 are shown in fig 8 the he concentrations 6 7 6 8 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 are very low and close to the value 4 64 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 i e the concentration of helium in surface water in equilibrium with an atmosphere at sea level at a water temperature of 10 c taking into account that the probable age of groundwater in well no 2 due to the tritium content and observed the cfcs concentration does not exceed 50 years the used to modeling assumed value of jhe is 0 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 the modeling results for well no 2 indicate that only at average concentrations of u 135 ppm and th 540 ppm fig 9 in the 55 m thick layer the he production in situ begins to exceed the uncertainty of he measurement and may therefore affect decreasing the calculated age of groundwater the occurrence of 55 m thick rock layers with such high average concentrations of u and th is completely impossible in the research area taking into account the research done there to date therefore the concentration of u and th in the aquifer and thus the amount of he produced in situ does not have a significant effect on heexc and the groundwater age it can be assumed that the jhe 0 3 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 represents an area without high concentrations of u and th which is separated from the inflow of larger quantities of he produced in situ in areas with high concentration of u and th the results of the modeling obtained for well no 8 are shown in fig 9 the concentrations of he 301 3 308 7 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 are the highest in the area of research as the actual age of groundwater in well no 8 is unknown the age obtained with cfcs and sf6 methods was considered unreliable a value of jhe 3 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 was assumed for modeling and calculations of age in the sudetes area in crystalline rocks jhe may change within the range 3 5 32 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 zuber et al 1995 the higher value is associated with the presence of uranium deposits in the recharge areas of groundwater where such high values of jhe are observed ciężkowski et al 1992 for well no 8 the in situ he production begins to exceed the he measurement uncertainty for average concentrations of u 21 ppm and th 84 ppm fig 9 these values although they are lower than for the areas of uranium deposits are obtained for a model assuming the occurrence a layer of sedimentary rocks with a thickness of 187 m in the case of assuming for modeling other jhe values which are also observed for the earth s crust e g a lower jhe value 1 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 torgersen 1989 the he production in situ will have a real impact on the groundwater age exceeding the measurement uncertainty at average concentrations u 7 ppm and th 28 ppm rock matrices with such uranium contents are observed in the sudetes in crystalline and clastic rocks e g uranium content is 5 11 ppm for gneisses and schists acc przeniosło 1970 however in the central sudetes region up to a depth of 1000 m an occurrence of the sedimentary rock layer with an average content of u 7 ppm th 28 ppm and a thickness of 187 m is very unlikely considering the results of study that have been conducted so far additionally assume of lower jhe values 1 0 10 6 cm3 stp cm 2 a 1 cause at the same time a significant overestimation of the groundwater age 2 8 ka which is inconsistent with the presence of in cfcs in this well to sum up in this case also the results obtained exclude any significant influence of he produced in situ within the aquifer on the age of groundwater similar modeling results were also obtained for the remaining wells tested there are of course differences were observed in the limit of the ranges of the concentrations of u and th at which begins the potential impact of the he in situ productions on the groundwater dating results however taking into account geological and hydrogeological conditions of the study area there is a high probability that the production of he in situ within the aquifer does not have a significant impact on the groundwater age this is the opposite of the situation described by some authors e g torgersen and clarke 1985 kulongoski et al 2008 who pointed out that for relatively young waters 50 ka the greatest influence on heexc value and thus on the age of groundwater is he in situ production these conclusions are put forward by the above mentioned authors on the basis of groundwater research of the great artesian basin australia in the work of torgersen and clarke 1985 the authors focus on determining the rate of accumulation of 4he and the in situ production of 4he for the aquifer systems where groundwater with significantly different ages are observed 50 ka and older than 100 ka the authors also indicate that over long times the 4he accumulation rate in groundwater aquifers may be controlled by the whole crust flux of 4he while in the work of kulongoski et al 2008 the authors present a comparison of the use of three different research methods to determine the groundwater age i e 14c 36cl cl and 4he the authors also pointed out that despite the presence of major tectonic faults diffusion may be the dominant transport mechanism for he in the crust 8 conclusions the summary of the results of all studies leads to the conclusion that in the study area the vertical groundwater flows have significant importance in the groundwater circulation system these flows are mainly associated with a network of cracks and fissures with a vertical or near vertical spatial orientation which creates conditions for a strong hydraulic contact between the various parts of the aquifer located at different depths this results in an intense mixing of groundwater and the occurrence of groundwater containing the ions and or gases in concentrations characteristic of the deep aquifers with the simultaneous occurrence of ions and gases of anthropogenic origin at the same time there are local zones where vertical flows are additionally intensified by the exploitation of groundwater and as a result some the components of groundwater characteristic for shallow aquifers can occur at large depths these observations indicate that in the research area the flow of groundwater with vertical directions may have significance comparable to that of lateral flow the calculated groundwater ages should be treated as approximate due to both the uncertainty of the computational parameters which have been presented and the hydrogeological conditions of the research area the groundwater ages calculated using the helium method for shallower wells are in large part consistent and comparable to the results obtained by the cfcs sf6 method for deeper wells results obtained by the helium method are more reliable than cfcs sf6 results in particular in the context of hydrogeochemical data ree and the phenomenon of cfcs degradation the measurements of concentrations of cfcs sf6 and noble gases which were carried out at the two measurement rounds at different conditions of groundwater inflow irrespective of their use for determining groundwater age and other hydrogeological applications bring important information on the groundwater circulation system in the studied area even as raw data the results of the modeling of the influence of variability of u and th concentrations on the quantity of he in situ production indicate that this impact is actually negligible taking into account that the studies were conducted in an area with elevated u and th content in the rock environment the results obtained can be fully generalized for areas with medium or low concentrations of these elements in compared to those of the central sudetes therefore it can be assumed that for the majority of groundwater with he concentrations of 10 6 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 i e modern groundwater the he in situ production within the aquifer is insignificant hence the volume of he in situ production may be omitted in the calculation of groundwater age in most cases this simplifies the calculation of groundwater age using the helium method because it is not necessary to term the concentrations of u and th within the rock matrix of an aquifer the studied area is characterized by elevated concentrations of u and th in rocks compared to other areas in poland however only small amounts of these elements are usually observed in groundwater high concentrations of u and th in the groundwater comparable to concentrations in poor uranium ore deposits occur only locally taking into account the physical parameters of aquifers in the study area mainly the porosity and fissuring it indicates that mobile ions of uranium and suspension of thorium compounds are not a significant source of he in situ production within the aquifer the spatial variability of he concentrations in the study area indicates that there is hardly any dissipation of the he flux migrating from deep parts of the rock mass but the inflow of he is of a mosaic nature mainly related to the systems of major fissures and tectonic faults the variability of the he concentrations seems to be stable over the short term

6788,this paper emphasizes the importance of integrating outlet discharge and observed internal variables in the evaluation of distributed hydrological models outputs it proposes a general methodology for a diagnostic evaluation of a complex distributed hydrological model based on discharge data at the outlet and additional distributed information such as water level and surface soil moisture data the proposed methodology is illustrated using the pumma model in the mercier sub catchment 6 6 km2 model parameters are specified according to field data and a previous study performed in a neighbouring catchment jankowfsky et al 2014 without calibration the distributed water level and soil moisture network of sensors were useful in the model evaluation process thus model parameters are specified either using in situ information or results from previous studies a stepwise approach is used for model evaluation it includes standard water balance assessment as well as comparison of observed and simulated outlet discharge whether on annual or event timescales soil moisture sensors are used to assess the ability of the model to simulate seasonal water storage dynamics based on a normalized index the water level sensors network is used on two timescales on a seasonal timescale sensors network is used to assess the model s ability to simulate intermittency whereas on event timescales sensors network is used in determining the model s ability to reproduce observed reaction as well as response times event timescales do also focus on the correlation between hydrological response and either rainfall event or antecedent soil moisture variables results show that the non calibrated model is quite effective at capturing water flow and soil water storage dynamics but it fails to reproduce observed runoff volume during events there is strong indication of a deficiency in the characterization of catchment storage and upstream flowpath description the soil water content and a network of water level sensors provide interesting information about soil moisture and river flow dynamics they however fail to provide quantitative information about catchment storage this study opens interesting perspectives for the evaluation of distributed hydrological models using hydrological signatures furthermore it highlights the requirement of quantitative as well as qualitative signatures for improving such models keywords distributed hydrological modelling object oriented modelling model diagnostic soil moisture water level sensor network hydrological signatures semi rural catchment 1 introduction distributed hydrological models are valuable in our understanding of hydrological processes and watershed behaviour they provide explicit representations of processes and components involved in hydrological balance and are able to integrate the natural variability of soil and sub soil the spatial organisation of landscape and water management practices as such they are powerful hypothesis testing tools as they formalize our assumptions on the main drivers of catchment response and allow for testing their relevance against observed data gupta et al 2008 fenicia et al 2008 clark et al 2011 in this hypothesis testing framework it is now well established that distributed models offer far better results when their outputs are compared not only to the outlet discharge but also to observed internal variables hrachowitz et al 2013 smith et al 2013 this ensures more robust representations of the catchment s internal process dynamics and improved internal models consistency thus providing the right answers for the right reasons klemes 1986 grayson et al 1992 kirchner 2006 several studies show the importance of using internal discharge gauges for model calibration and evaluation e g uhlenbrook and sieber 2005 moussa et al 2007 however the use of additional data sources although called for in many papers hrachowitz et al 2013 is not so widespread a way of using such additional data is to incorporate them in model calibration process using data assimilation techniques as illustrated by pereira cardenal et al 2011 paiva et al 2013 or wanders et al 2014 who used remote sensing data in large catchments another way is to incorporate such data in a diagnostic approach as defined by gupta et al 2008 it consists of comparing the model outputs with alternative indicators known as hydrological signatures these alternative indicators describe the behaviour of the catchment hydrological response hydrological signatures are derived from field data and provide physically interpretable metrics for functional behaviour of catchments mcmillan et al 2011 2014 as opposed to traditional performance criteria nash sutcliffe efficiency typically that are too restrictive to fully describe how well a model represents the different aspects of hydrological response the advantage of hydrological signatures is also that they can point toward the causes of model bad performance and provide elements to improve it gupta et al 2008 in the recent years some authors recommended to perform diagnostic evaluation on an uncalibrated model e g mcmillan et al 2016 they argued that although uncalibrated models have generally lower performance scores than calibrated models they offer several advantages explicit link between the parameter values and the physics no compensations for biases in input forcing data typically rainfall or errors in model structure clark et al 2011 therefore uncalibrated approach seems particularly appropriate for diagnostic evaluation of a model s strengths and weaknesses and to assess the value of qualitative distributed observations for such a diagnostic evaluation the main objective of this study is thus to build a diagnostic evaluation of a complex distributed model based on additional distributed data besides outlet discharge two types of additional data were used surface soil moisture and water level in ephemeral streams all these data had been produced by previous research projects and were reused opportunistically for the present study this main general objective is specified into three sub objectives that are 1 to assess usability of additional data in a model evaluation process and to assess strengths and weaknesses of corresponding hydrological signatures these data cannot be compared directly to model outputs either because their quality is not good enough semi qualitative data or because they do not have adequate spatial temporal resolution so defining appropriate hydrological signatures from this data is a challenging task 2 to evaluate all components of the used model surface runoff infiltration in the soil groundwater flow routing in the stream network or specific catchment zones specific sub catchments given soil type land use 3 to test the model s underlying functioning hypotheses as the last part of the model diagnostic this would allow prioritizing any further developments of the model the case study used in this paper is the mercier catchment 6 6 km2 located near lyon france and the considered model is the distributed peri urban model pumma peri urban model for landscape management jankowfsky et al 2014 pumma was used in this study because its level of detail is well adapted to the size of the mercier catchment and to the resolution of the additional data it also incorporates urban hydrology processes that are of importance on the mercier catchment however the methodology proposed in the paper is quite general and could be used for other case studies and or distributed hydrological models the paper is organised as follows in section 2 study site available data modelling tool and model setup are presented section 3 presents the model evaluation protocol that was built and the signatures derived from the distributed soil moisture and water level data results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 finally conclusions and perspectives are given in section 6 2 case study model description and set up 2 1 mercier catchment and available data the mercier catchment is part of the yzeron basin located in the south west of lyon france fig 1 the yzeron is representative of periurban areas with a highly heterogeneous land use jacqueminet et al 2013 dominated upstream by forests and agriculture and increasing urbanization downstream the mercier semi rural sub catchment has a surface of 6 6 km2 with altitudes ranging from 300 m to 785 m its geology consists mainly of gneiss and granite the soils are quite shallow especially in upslope areas leading overall to low water storage capacity land use is 46 agricultural 40 forests and 14 urban and impervious areas braud et al 2013 the climate is temperate with continental and mediterranean influences the average annual precipitation between 1997 and 2010 was 741 mm with a standard deviation of 156 mm the average response time of the mercier catchment varies between 1 and 3 4 h the catchment is part of the observatoire de terrain en hydrologie urbaine othu and has been monitored since 1997 2 1 1 permanent data consists of rainfall measurements at two gauges one starting in 1997 and the other in 2005 and discharge measurement at the catchment outlet since 1997 these data are available with a variable timestep reference evapotranspiration at a hourly timestep was calculated from the national safran database quintana seguí et al 2008 vidal et al 2010 by braud et al 2013 using the penman monteith equation fao 1998 2 1 2 additional data from the networks of sensors these data come from previous research projects conducted independently from the present study and in limited timeframes we opportunistically reused the existing data without possibility of changing the experimental setup since all sensors were already removed from the field the network of water level sensors was installed for a phd thesis which aimed at documenting the activation of ephemeral streams during events and its links with topography sarrazin 2012 distributed series of water levels are available with a 2 5 min timestep 17 measurement points located in permanent or ephemeral streams sarrazin 2012 see location in fig 1 from 2007 to 2010 sensors were located throughout the mercier catchment with upstream areas ranging from 0 06 km2 to 6 6 km2 and contrasted land uses the main characteristics are presented in table 1 since sensor accuracy 1 6 cm obtained by comparing the sensors and manual field measurements sarrazin 2012 is of the same order of magnitude as the measured water levels continuous series cannot be used directly for model evaluation however simple flow no flow patterns for continuous periods as well as water level variations and response during rainfall runoff events can all be extracted sarrazin 2012 surface soil moisture 0 5 cm depth layer data were installed for a project monitoring surface runoff dehotin et al 2015 during one year data are available at 9 locations with a 2 min timestep from april 2010 to april 2011 this dataset is described in dehotin et al 2015 location of the sensors is shown in fig 1 2 1 3 gis layers they were mainly obtained or purchased through research projects braud et al 2010 a lidar digitial elevation model with a 2 m resolution geology map in the scale 1 50000 digitized by gnouma 2006 and the pedological map of the french donesol program a detailed land use map was obtained by manual digitisation from a 2008 bdortho ign image jacqueminet et al 2013 fig 1 shows the land use map jacqueminet et al 2013 simplified in four main classes the natural and artificial drainage network and the location of the various sensors used in this study 2 2 model description the pumma model that is used in this study was specifically designed for the hydrology of peri urban areas it is presented in detail by jankowfsky et al 2014 in particular it takes into account the potential effect of each landscape object on hydrology especially linear objects river network roads ditches hedgerows thin stripes of alluvial forest etc and urban objects sewer networks roads impervious surfaces that are represented with the same degree of detail and in a unified framework these characteristics make pumma quite unique among the existing distributed hydrological models see jankowfsky et al 2014 pumma has the specificity of representing explicitly the hydrological objects of the landscape that are interconnected thanks to the use of the liquid modelling framework branger et al 2010 each of these objects is represented by a specific module hedge for agricultural and forest areas urbs for urban cadastral units river1d for the natural river network and artificial sewer network tdso for storm water overflow devices sistba for lakes and retention basins additional modules allow the flow transfer between modelling units wti wtri olaf jankowfsky et al 2014 see fig 2 model mesh consists of irregular modelling units that follow the land use patterns the hedge runoff generation module simulates rural areas such as forests and agricultural fields as well as hedges the soil is represented using two interconnected compartments drainable porosity where the water table is computed and micro porosity where infiltration and evapotranspiration take place overland flow can occur when the soil column is fully saturated hortonian runoff is not accounted for in this module the river1d runoff routing module based on the kinematic wave equation and simplified channel geometry trapezes assures routing of water towards the outlet the lateral subsurface flow is simulated by the water table interface wti module it uses the darcy law to calculate the subsurface flow between agricultural fields hedge rows and urban cadastral units the wtri water table river interface is similar to the wti interface it calculates the groundwater exchange between a model unit and a river reach or a lake instead of the darcy equation it uses the miles approach miles 1985 which considers the water table deformation close to the river based on the dupuit forchheimer assumption for built areas the urbs module is the liquid implementation of the urban runoff branching structure model by rodriguez et al 2008 each cadastral unit is divided into natural built and road areas each one having its own water balance the latter is computed using three reservoirs representing respectively the surface the non saturated and saturated zones interception by trees is also taken into account the water table level is computed as the average of the three components and is used to compute rain water drainage by sewer pipes the threshold dependent stormwater overflow module tdso simulates the storm water overflow between sewer network and natural streams the overflow is calculated with a weir or orifice equation based on a water control depth threshold value overland flow from the surface reservoirs of the hedge module and the natural part of the urbs module is calculated with the olaf overland flow interface the flux between two units is computed based on the manning strickler approach finally the sistba simulation of storage basins module simulates retention basins and lakes it represents retention basins or natural lakes with a simple linear reservoir according to the principles of the liquid framework branger et al 2010 the way the pumma model handles timestep is as follows each module manages its own variable timestep according to inner numerical constraints typically variation of state variables within a timestep moreover each module has the ability to interrupt itself and to recalculate a new timestep if required for example if a new value is received by another module this is the way the modules exchange data timesteps for a model like pumma range typically from a few seconds to several hours depending on the module and on the rainfall situation 2 3 model set up the simulation was performed for five years from january 1st 2006 to december 31st 2010 in the continuous simulation year 2006 was considered as the warm up period and model results were only analysed and discussed for the 2007 2010 period 2 3 1 model mesh the object oriented model mesh of the pumma model is composed of a combination of hydrological response units hrus flügel 1995 for rural land use units and urban hydrological elements uhe rodriguez et al 2008 for urban cadastral units including roads in the mercier catchment agricultural and road ditches were mapped using field survey and were incorporated to the natural river network in the small urban area located in the catchment rain water is collected in a separate sewer system which was also incorporated to the natural river network the river network presented in fig 3 incorporates all categories of reaches natural river road and agricultural ditches sewers and forms the basis for the river1d module that simulates flow routing note also that water flow in some reaches is intermittent furthermore ephemeral streams were represented using the river1d module hrus were obtained using gis overlay of available land use geology soil and sub basin maps jankowfsky 2011 using the 2 m lidar dtm rural sub basins were calculated using the flow direction forcing technique kenny and matthews 2005 in order to determine one sub basin for each river and artificial ditch branch jankowfsky et al 2013 the uhes encompass one cadastral unit typically house plus surrounding garden and half of the adjoining street uhes and hrus as well as lakes and retention basins for the sistba module were merged in order to get a non overlapping model mesh the object oriented model mesh consists of irregular vector objects polygons for hrus uhes and lakes retention basins and lines for the drainage network it is shown in fig 3 with the associated pumma process modules note that uhes exclusively composed of roads represent 18 of the urbs modules surface each model elements is characterized by various geometric attributes average altitude slopes etc which were computed using the dtm the wti wtri interfaces are line objects defined by intersection between polygons pre processing methods were also developed to extract the interface geometries and their connections automatically jankowfsky 2011 the automatic preprocessing also provides the flow routing on the irregular model mesh for the olaf module and determines the urban pipe connections the model mesh considered in this study is based on the original land use map of jacqueminet et al 2013 2 3 2 model inputs due to its specific handling structure pumma model is able to take into account input series rain potential evapotranspiration at any timestep relevant for the simulation in this case we used the highest temporal resolution available for input series variable timestep for rainfall at both permanent rain gauges and hourly timestep for reference evapotranspiration rainfall was interpolated to the model mesh using weighting averages of the thiessen polygons reference evapotranspiration was considered homogenous over the whole catchment crop coefficients are used in pumma to modulate et0 according to the vegetation type values proposed by jankowfsky were used 2011 as stated in the introduction an uncalibrated approach was chosen for this study therefore parameters were set according to available data physical considerations of hydrological processes or the literature model parameters were set as in jankowfsky et al 2014 for the neighbouring chaudanne catchment soil parameters were specified for each model unit using the donesol soil data base and in situ measurements gonzalez sosa et al 2010 for the urban uhes built road and natural areas were computed from the detailed land use map of jacqueminet et al 2013 natural and road permeability were assigned values proposed by jankowfsky et al 2014 study which based on a sensitivity study shows that some parameters sets were more consistent with observations their recommendations were used in this study given the proximity between both catchments for interception reservoirs of built areas roads and natural areas the link coefficients representing the fraction of runoff from both built and road areas directly connected to the network were similarly specified to 0 6 and 0 5 respectively jankowfsky et al 2014 recommended the use of a variable soil depth with larger values at lower altitudes a uniform soil depth of 1 m was used in this simulation and the evaluation of the variable soil depth is left for further sensitivity studies table 2 summarizes the main parameters and input data and how they were obtained 2 3 3 the evaluation presented in the remaining of the paper uses the simulation configuration described in this section model outputs pumma is able to produce outputs at a variable timestep and for each modelling unit in order to save computation time most of the variables were set at a fixed timestep of 6 min this is done by interpolating linearly between the actual calculated variable timesteps then comes temporal aggregation daily means for example if required for comparison with field data observed discharge data at the catchment outlet were interpolated linearly to a 6 min timestep for comparison with the model output 3 model evaluation protocol model evaluation protocol is designed following the three specific objectives presented in the introduction 3 1 assessing how additional data can be processed in the model evaluation hydrological signatures computed for model evaluation and the hydrological processes they document are presented here 3 1 1 hydrological signatures derived from soil moisture data soil moisture is quite commonly monitored in field experiments the use of soil moisture data for model evaluation raises several issues among which the issue of scaling point measurements vs integrated modelling units and the issue of representativeness how to compare model values using conceptual storage for soil compartment in this study soil moisture data were available only in natural areas where hydrological processes were simulated using the hedge module although the soil is divided into layers in this module soil moisture output of each layer was not available only total water storage mm of the whole modelling unit was available the observed soil moisture however was a point surface measurement moreover the model was run based on thiessen polygons calculated from a mere 2 rain gauges which means that very local variations of rainfall to which surface soil moisture sensors are sensitive are likely to be lost therefore it was unnecessary to compare observation and model at short event based timesteps as a result model outputs and data were processed at a daily timestep and normalized values were considered for both soil water storage and surface soil moisture as shown in eq 1 where x is the variable value min max and norm respectively for minimum maximum and normalized 1 x norm x x min x max x min such an indicator provides information about seasonal variations of soil moisture 3 1 2 hydrological signatures derived from the water level sensor networks distributed water level network consists of a dense network of sensors located in sometimes ephemeral streams maréchal 2011 these sensors do not necessarily provide accurate numerical values soft pieces of information according to hrachowitz et al 2013 but they can document how water in the streams is distributed spatio temporally in response to rainfall events such piece of information can also be obtained from direct observation of ephemeral streams activation during events maréchal et al 2013 similar experiments with temperature sensors were conducted in ecohydrology for documenting the streamflow patterns of ephemeral streams constantz et al 2001 and snowmelt spatio temporal dynamics lyon et al 2008 in our case quantitative water levels cannot be used directly as they are highly dependent on local stream conditions at the location of the sensor which a model can never reproduce it was also impossible to estimate stable rating curves and convert water levels into discharges no volume water balance indicators could thus be derived from the water level data however we could derive two types of information flow no flow patterns and characteristic times a flow no flow patterns sarrazin 2012 estimated that a threshold of 1 cm is representative of these patterns and distinguished three flow categories that he calculated for fortnight periods if water level remains above the threshold for the whole period it is a flow period if water level remains below the threshold it is a no flow period the last case water level varies above and below the threshold corresponds to an intermittent flow period in terms of hydrological processes these stream intermittency patterns can be linked with the base flow dynamics in the catchment independently from rainfall events the seasonal patterns with drying out of streams in summer and incrementally continuous flow in autumn are good indicators of how this base flow is generated and transferred through the catchment b characteristic times characteristic times used in this study are reaction and response to rainfall events reaction time is the time between the beginning of rain and the beginning of significant increase in water level response time is defined in this paper as the time between the beginning of the rain and the peak flow hdeb and hmax are respectively water depth at the reaction and response times see fig 4 these characteristic times can document fast flow generation processes surface runoff quick subsurface flow especially for the upstream sensors for which the reach routing process can be neglected and appears in bold in table 1 a selection of 32 rainfall events made by sarrazin 2012 was used for this purpose it was found that below a cumulative rainfall of 10 mm and or a rainfall intensity of 2 mm hr 1 no significant water level response was recorded in the downstream stations which were the most reactive in addition for being able to jointly analyse hydrological response at the various locations it was necessary to spatially select homogeneous rainfalls based on available rain gauges only events with rainfall accumulation differences and timing lower than 30 were kept this led to the 32 events sample used subsequently for these events observed between 2007 and 2010 cumulative precipitation volumes range between 4 75 and 73 75 mm and their durations range between 0 2 and 11 5 h sarrazin 2012 also tested several hypotheses in terms of control of the hydrological response by evaluating correlations between hmax and hmax hdeb and various rainfall and antecedent soil moisture characteristics on the other side rainfall events were characterized using the total rainfall amount event duration average intensity and maximum intensity antecedent soil moisture was characterized using an antecedent rainfall index and the cumulative rainfall amount in the last 5 10 or 30 days the correlation between water level values and these rainfall and soil moisture characteristics was computed using the spearman rank correlations to identify possible cofluctuations 3 2 evaluation of the model s components we followed a stepwise approach by using standard criteria such as water balance assessment and comparison of observed and simulated discharge at the outlet then we used previously defined signatures derived from additional data to successively evaluate the soil water balance component base flow component and fast flow component this evaluation was done using both water level data and statistical analysis of the runoff response s main controls 3 2 1 water balance assessment on an annual scale model outputs were analysed in terms of water balance and contribution from various components for each year in the simulation period 2007 2010 rainfall runoff actual evapotranspiration aet and change in soil storage δs were computed in order to assess interaction or correlation between those elements system behaviour under dry or wet conditions was analysed through computation of water balance components which are contributions from surface runoff or sub surface flow and contributions from natural or artificialized areas consistency of these contributions was discussed in light of previous findings or observations 3 2 2 comparing outlet discharge data to simulation results the model was evaluated based on the discharge calculated at the mercier outlet compared to discharge data observed at that location two types of comparison were performed 1 long term continuous based comparison and 2 short term event based comparison for 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the bias pbias were calculated according to eqs a1 and a2 in appendix criteria were calculated for each year from 2007 to 2010 as well as over the entire simulation period january 2007 to december 2010 at hourly and daily timesteps nse was calculated both for discharge and square root of discharge which contrary to nse on discharge gives less weight to high values for the event based analysis 2 simulations were evaluated using differences in peak value and peak time eqs a3 and a4 in appendix nse and volume errors to analyze the capacity to simulate runoff events for this comparison we also added the pearson correlation coefficient r2 and weighted correlation coefficient ωr2 defined by krause et al 2006 see eqs a5 and a5 these criteria were calculated at a 6 min timestep for the selection of 32 events eight of these events were not observed at the outlet gaps in the data and 4 had spurious observed data resulting in 20 events retained for the statistical analysis 3 2 3 evaluation of the soil water balance component using soil moisture data soil water storage also expressed as soil moisture is the main state variable of the hydrological system it is influenced by rainfall evapotranspiration and soil infiltration and drainage properties in pumma the soil infiltration component is the core component of the model comparison with soil moisture data focuses directly on this component the comparison between observation and model was conducted using the pearson and kendall τ correlation coefficients between observed and simulated normalized soil moisture defined by eq 1 in order to assess the ability of the model to reproduce the seasonal dynamics of soil filling and emptying both absolute values of the normalized values and increments from one day to the next were compared in terms of model parameters the soil filling process is controlled mainly by the rainfall and the modelling unit s soil depth and porosity total soil water storage capacity soil emptying is driven by evapotranspiration which is potential evapotranspiration modulated by the vegetation related crop coefficient soil wetness and the lateral conductivity of wti interfaces groundwater lateral flow since in hedge only saturation excess runoff is represented no additional parameter is involved for surface runoff when considering only soil moisture increments i e relative variations soil drainage capacity and lateral conductivity are the main governing parameters 3 2 4 evaluation of the base flow component using water level data the ability of the model to reproduce stream intermittency was tested using the same classification as observed data for the continuous year 2009 which was divided in 24 approximate fortnight periods see section 3 1 2 that year was selected because a maximum of sensors were operating then in addition a few technical sensors issues were resolved so that the 1 cm threshold could be considered as reliable sarrazin 2012 because modelled stream reaches are quite simplified as compared to terrain reality trapeze cross sections uniform width throughout the reach the same 1 cm threshold was deemed irrelevant for the simulated water levels three different thresholds were tested 0 5 cm 0 7 cm and 1 cm assuming the model s actual evapotranspiration calculation performs well model parameters corresponding to base flow generation in pumma are soil depth in hedge it influences the groundwater depth in each modelling unit the lateral conductivity in wti interfaces and topology spatial organisation of the modelling units which control water pathways for the two sensors corresponding to drainage areas with significant residential zone the parameter controlling groundwater drainage in the urbs module by sewer pipes is also important 3 2 5 evaluation of fast flow components using water level data in the pumma model fast flow corresponds to surface runoff on forest or agricultural areas it is generated by the hedge module in hedge surface runoff is produced when the whole soil profile is filled up this surface runoff is routed between modelling units by the olaf module the corresponding parameters are soil depth and porosity and topology of the olaf module whereas for residential areas and roads urbs module is prefered the main drivers for controlling surface runoff are the interception reservoir the surface hydraulic conductivity and link coefficients corresponding to the fraction of surface runoff especially on impervious road and built surfaces directly connected to the drainage network as for the surface runoff collected from road and built surfaces is directly connected to the stream network no specific routing parameters are to be taken into account if the length of the stream reach is small enough the reaction and response times of the basin at different stations of mercier were calculated a comparison is done between the model outputs and the observed values for the 32 events using the pearson correlation coefficient stations 2 5 7 to 11 and 16 are located in small head watersheds and the length of the stream reach in the upstream catchment is 1000 m table 1 for these stations we consider that only surface runoff processes are involved in the model s response for the other stations interpretation is more difficult as the stream routing component of the model cannot be neglected therefore the comparison highlights these upstream stations for which the dominant land uses are respectively forest stations 8 9 10 forest and agriculture stations 2 5 7 and residential agriculture stations 11 and 16 in addition the same correlations as defined in 3 1 2 between water level values hmax or hmax hdeb and rainfall and antecedent soil moisture characteristics were also calculated using the model outputs to verify whether the model was able to reproduce the observed correlations these correlations are interesting as sarrazin 2012 showed for some stations amplitude of the response hmax or hmax hdeb were more correlated to antecedent rainfall and rainfall amounts this means that the hydrological response is more sensitive to catchment wetness other stations on the other hand were more related to rainfall intensity thus meaning that the hydrological response is more sensitive to infiltration capacity and routing towards the outlet 4 results 4 1 water balance assessment table 3 shows components of the annual water balance for the four years and table 4 discharge components table 3 shows that simulated runoff is generally lower when rainfall is lower 2009 but 2010 is an exception the computed runoff is low and underestimated as compared to observation note also the significant simulated change in water storage from one year to the next the catchment stores water during wet years but releases it during dry years such as 2009 where decrease of soil water storage is used to fulfil aet the different behaviour of year 2010 may be explained by a dry winter when aet is low and more rainfall in summer when vegetation is active in terms of runoff components 2010 is also different from other years with more sub surface flow than surface runoff and a larger contribution of urbs table 4 this is mainly related to infiltration in sewer networks which is proportionally higher than other years results from table 4 show that contribution of direct runoff from the natural part of urbs is low 1 but contribution from hedge is large 16 33 of rainfall maps of average ponding see fig 10 in sanzana et al 2018 show that ponding is higher in downstream catchment area with agricultural land use than it is in the forested area in upstream catchment this result is consistent with runoff observations from dehotin et al 2015 and with saturated hydraulic conductivity estimations provided by gonzalez sosa et al 2010 showing higher values in forest than in cultivated areas but this result might also be due to the unique soil depth taken in the model set up which is probably overestimated in the upstream catchment and underestimated downstream 4 2 comparison between observed and simulated discharge at the outlet 4 2 1 continuous long term comparison table 5 shows statistical criteria for each year and the whole period table 5 shows contrasted results from one year to the next in terms of nse with a value of 0 01 for the whole period hourly values and 0 15 for daily values nse is negative for 2007 and 2009 and positive for 2008 and 2010 the year 2008 is particularly well simulated but includes the highest discharge event ever recorded in the catchment november 1 3 event which is well simulated by the model see fig 5 e with a large positive impact on the nse computed for year 2008 nse on the square root of discharge is much larger than nse on discharge with positive values except on daily values for 2010 this means that the model captures fairly well the general hydrological regime and the base flow which has low values in summer and higher values in winter pbias is satisfactory with values of less than 10 in absolute values except for year 2010 where model runoff is underestimated by 43 note however that winter 2009 2010 was affected by snowfalls and frost that perturbed rainfall measurement that may have been underestimated during this period in addition snow processes are not included in the model which may explain model underestimation during the 2009 2010 winter according to moriasi et al 2007 simulation results are satisfactory if nse 50 and pbias 25 based on these thresholds the model can be deemed satisfactory only for the 2008 period s daily timesteps model performance is therefore quite poor according to statistical criteria additionally the model is uncalibrated and captures variations in seasonal discharge quite well it is however generally too reactive to small and moderate events rainfall with a very noisy simulated discharge 4 2 2 short term event based comparison table 6 shows performance criteria statistics at the 6 min timestep for the 20 events mentionned in section 3 2 2 fig 5 illustrates model results for six representative events results show that the model generally captures event dynamics well with relatively low peak flow lag error values this is quite remarkable as no roughness coefficients calibration in the flow routing module was done to better fit peak times performance is not so good in terms of pbias as the model generally overestimates the volume median of about 63 for pbias this consistently leads to very poor values of nse negative median on the other hand r2 and ωr2 show much higher values thus confirming model s ability to reproduce the dynamics volume overestimation is greater under dry conditions table 6 consistently leading to better model performance in wet conditions the shape of the simulated hydrographs shows that the model is generally too reactive with a much peakier behavior than through observation such model over reaction leads to general overestimation of peak discharge 4 3 evaluation of soil water component fig 6 shows comparison between simulated normalized daily soil water storage and observed normalized surface soil moisture top and correlation between daily increments bottom table 7 summarizes coefficients of determination of the pearson regression and the kendall τ for rank correlation between both variables for all the measurement points results show that the model captures seasonal variations of soil water storage well and more precisely when soil water storage is permanently high results are also very good for increments it shows that the model reproduces soil water storage dynamics quite well this is less true for station 7 where surface soil moisture does not show an increase in autumn increase however seen with simulated soil water storage discrepancy may be due to particular features of the soil moisture sensor location for this station the τ kendall for the increments is nevertheless correct note also that the τ kendall is generally higher than the coefficient of determination it means that both observed and modelled variables have similar variations but that this relation is not necessarily linear which is expected for variables that are different in terms of modelled processes and parameters this means that at daily timestep reconstitution of local rainfall using thiessen polygons on the 2 rain gauges is relevant the representation of evapotranspiration processes and emptying of the soil profile through lateral subsurface flow seem to be correct as well 4 4 evaluation of base flow component using water level data the results are presented in fig 7 for each station and each period summary statistics are presented in table 8 observed intermittency patterns are quite balanced with a predominance of continuous flow average 46 over the year in winter 36 of intermittent flow and 15 only of no flow which occurs predominantly in summer the model does not succeed in reproducing these general patterns whatever the threshold intermittent flow is strongly dominant 53 for 0 5 cm threshold to 72 for 1 cm threshold frequency of flow 41 for 0 5 cm and 14 for 1 cm and no flow 6 for 0 5 cm and 14 for 1 cm periods are both underestimated compared to observations the model is more successful in reproducing winter predominance of continuous flow periods although this remains underestimated the more realistic picture seems to be obtained with the 0 7 cm threshold which best reproduces the length of the continuous flow period from january to may and presents a few continuous flow spots at the end of the year the 1 cm threshold generates an overall dry picture whereas the 0 5 cm threshold produces unrealistically long continuous flow periods on the other hand whatever the threshold occurrence of dry periods during summer is missed by the model but this is less problematic since the distinction between intermittent flow and no flow is quite subtle and probably also very uncertain and dependent on local conditions at the sensor s location looking more closely we notice that discrepancies come mainly from stations 2 and 7 to 10 which are all upstream stations dominated by forests on these stations the simulated behaviour is too dry with absence of baseflow during the winter months whatever the threshold in the model this can be mainly due to soil depth and lateral flow conductivity or topology comparison with soil moisture data shows that lateral flow conductivity seemed adequate but this was tested only for agriculture land use where soil moisture sensors were located and not forests in the wooded areas it is possible that we underestimated soil depth and lateral conductivity but the first order factor could be topology indeed pumma is based on irregular modelling units and in the wooded upstream areas units which are very large see fig 3 this can create erroneous flow paths and inaccurate flow transfers between units since the model takes into account only the mean altitude of each unit on the other hand the model behaves much better for stations located in agricultural or residential areas and areas with small upstream and smaller modelling units stations 11 5 16 the stations where the model overestimates baseflow are 14 6 and 13 only 14 for 0 7 cm threshold which are located downstream each other in this order 4 5 evaluation of fast flow component using water level data fig 8 shows comparison between the model output and observed values of reaction and response time as well as of hmax hdeb on the mercier catchment points are colored according to the dominant land use forest forest agriculture and residential agriculture table 9 presents the values of the regression equations ymod b a xobs and square coefficient r2 for different partitions of the data set according to land use upstream downstream location see table 1 event duration threshold of 4 h rainfall depth threshold of 20 mm maximum intensity threshold of 10 mm hr 1 and antecedent rainfall over the last 10 days threshold of 20 mm a low overall correlation between the model and observations can be noticed for reaction time the slope of the regression is 0 05 over the whole sample far enough from the target value of 1 to conclude that the model generally reacts too quickly and underestimates reaction time table 9 shows that reaction is better simulated for long duration events r2 0 33 for d 4 h and low intensities r2 0 15 for imax 10 mm h as reaction can be determined more accurately under these conditions indeed observation shows that values are quite uncertain due to sensor accuracy and fluctuations especially for low values about a few cm so that change in just a few centimetres must be detected to determine that there is a reaction model results are more stable and it is easier to identify the onset of the hydrological reaction this may partly explain reaction times underestimation by the model in terms of processes reaction can provide information on the ability of the model to generate more or less quick surface runoff by infiltration excess or saturation excess reaction is therefore very sensitive to flow paths and model topology for surface runoff the latter is supposed to be less accurate in the wooded part due to larger modelling units this may explain the absence of significant correlation for forested catchments as compared to agricultural ones see table 9 for downstream stations correlation in terms of response is not significant and is very low 0 03 for upstream stations table 9 this may be related to more complex transfer processes in downstream stations not properly simulated by the model the model better simulates response time than reaction time with an overall r2 0 39 the model showed a tendency to satisfactorily simulate reaction time for forested and forested agricultural land use with a general model s underestimation as shown by values of the regression slope of less than 1 none of the factors is well simulated for the residential agriculture land use but the sample size is probably too small to be representative response is better simulated for the upstream stations long duration events low rainfall amount low maximum intensity events and high antecedent rainfall events response is the sum of reaction and of the rising limb on the hydrograph it reflects the velocity with which runoff generated in the sub catchment is transferred to the outlet the modelled response depends on the way water pathways are represented into the model water pathways are shorter in upstream catchments than in downstream ones thus simulation of the response is less prone to errors than downstream amplitude of the response is also globally not well simulated by the model with an overall correlation of 0 16 reaching 0 32 for forest agriculture catchments high correlation is not expected as change in water level is very dependent on local configurations at the sites of observations which are not represented in the model the orders of magnitude of simulated and observed response amplitude are very different with slopes of the regressions generally around 0 3 results are not very sensitive to the type of rainfall or antecedent soil moisture as performance is very similar between the various classes tables 10 and 11 present each station s spearman rank correlation coefficients between hmax and hmax hdeb and variables describing rainfall events and antecedent soil moisture only values with a significant correlation test p 0 1 are reported for both variables observations show high correlation with rainfall volume maximum rainfall intensity or both for half of the stations consistent with observation the model simulates those relationships between amplitude of the hydrological response rainfall amount and maximum intensity but these are stronger and more systematic than observed in addition correlations are not as strong with observed hmax hdeb than with hmax but the model does not detect this difference this may be due to identification of hdeb which is more difficult in observations than in the model see above which could lower the observed correlation for station 11 which corresponds to the most urbanized sub catchment the model does not at all reproduce the significantly high anti correlation with rainfall duration and mean intensity however it shows high correlation with rainfall amount and antecedent rainfall this could point out to a misrepresentation of surface runoff by the urbs runoff the response of which seems to be governed by soil saturation level in the model 5 discussion to introduce the discussion we would like to underline that pumma as every hydrological model was built on specific assumptions functioning hypothesis as mentioned in the introduction section the third specific objective of the present paper is to assess whether these assumptions can be dismissed or strenghtened according to the simulation results structural assumptions are as follows pumma considers only one surface free aquifer created by filling up the soil profile from impervious bedrock with no flow boundary condition at the bottom the aquifer is consequently quite shallow and there is no possibility to simulate temporary water saturation above groundwater level perched water tables this also prevents the simulation of water storage in deep weathered bedrock if it is not considered as part of the soil the only way to generate surface runoff is by soil saturation hortonian surface runoff is not implemented in terms of model parameters other assumptions were also made for the application to the mercier catchment spatial discretization model mesh was based on land use only which leads to significantly larger modelling units in the upstream zones of the catchment pumma is able to perform calculations in such a heterogeneous mesh but one can wonder whether this does not generate distortions in simulated water pathways for simplicity we used a uniform soil depth for the whole catchment in addition pumma is uncalibrated and increasing model performance is not this paper s objective the model is run using parameter values of either the literature or in situ measurements model evaluation is performed on this reference simulation in order to focus on functioning hypotheses testing model evaluation also helps to relate discrepancies between model and observation in order to improve process representation and or parameter specification this discussion focuses on 1 the lessons that can be learned in terms of simulated hydrological processes from comparison of pumma with distributed data sets of soil moisture and water level 2 on the relevance and limits of the computed hydrological signatures 5 1 on the use of discharge data in this study discharge at the catchment outlet was used for model evaluation in a traditional manner using statistical criteria to compare simulation and observation because our interest is in evaluating the model over the whole hydrological regime computing several criteria to highlight model performance for varied ranges seemed compulsory the present example shows that using the nse criterion on discharge alone may be misleading in our case nse values are very poor mainly due to systematic discharge overestimation by the model dynamics however at all temporal scales are captured quite well as shown by the relatively good values of r2 or ωr2 in addition nse is very sensitive to the occurrence of high events as shown by a much better performance for the year 2008 see fig 5e during which the highest flood event of the whole study period occurred in terms of model diagnostic it is difficult to conclude at this stage even if the model has clearly major weaknesses these cannot be directly related to any specific components nevertheless the overall volume estimation is not so bad however values of the dynamics indicators show that the parameters controlling water transfer lateral hydraulic conductivity and reach routing parameters seem reasonable future improvements in the use of statistical performance criteria should probably focus on uncertainty assessment as these criteria are very sensitive to data accuracy in the case of the mercier catchment the stream channel at gauging station is wide and water level is less than 3 cm at low flow leading to low discharge accuracy this point was improved recently by adding a v notch weir to increase sensitivity at low flow uncertainty on the stage discharge relationship was also assessed using the baratin bayesian method le coz et al 2014 and work is in progress to propagate this uncertainty and the stage measurement uncertainty to the hydrological records horner et al 2018 this will allow a more robust appraisal of model performance 5 2 on the accuracy and information brought by soil water content data available soil moisture sensors were only monitoring the surface soil water content at nine locations all located in agricultural land use the data are point measurements whereas model outputs are provided at the scale of a whole modelling unit there was indeed a scale mismatch between observed and simulated values in addition in the model we were mainly interested in assessing soil water storage simulation over the whole soil column depth rather than only the soil moisture behaviour in top soil it is interesting to see that once normalised surface soil moisture provides interesting information about seasonal soil water storage and in particular about the time when soil water storage is sufficiently replenished to get permanent wet conditions in terms of model diagnostic the results give us good confidence in the formulations of input and output flows of the soil water storage in the model however the drawback of normalization is that it does not provide any information on the absolute value of soil water storage and this is not very helpful to assess the relevance of the homogeneous 1 m soil depth hypothesis in order to better constrain soil depth specification studies should be completed with approaches such as the one proposed by vannier et al 2014 in assessing catchment water storage 5 3 on the accuracy and information brought by the water level network at continuous scale intermittency in its present version pumma is not successful at reproducing stream intermittency as defined in our test seasonal variation is approximately reproduced if the flow no flow threshold is reduced to 0 7 cm which is consistent with other results seasonality of discharge at the outlet and soil moisture it is difficult to interpret where discrepancies originate as water level in the stream depends on hydrology of the upstream catchment but also on local hydraulic conditions therefore potentially all components of pumma could be involved we must also underline that this particular test deals with high uncertainty regarding both observations and model the choice of a single threshold applied for all stations is a strong assumption and the chosen value of 1 cm for observations is debatable given sensor accuracy the existence of flow no flow depends also on local conditions at the location of each sensor which were not investigated in detail for simplicity of the application moreover the flow routing component of pumma is a routing model with simplified geometries although calculated the variable water level is not necessarily representative particularly for very low values where numerical considerations can also interfere with the results yet we still can derive a few elements of diagnostic it seems that the model does not simulate enough baseflow in the upstream part of the catchment and too much in the downstream part for the upstream stations it indicates that either soil water storage is not sufficient or topology water pathways for groundwater flow is not correct for downstream stations it is more difficult to conclude model s baseflow overestimation is not observed at the outlet where statistical criteria indicate that the model is able to successfully reproduce seasonal flow variations these contradictory results could be explained by compensation effects overestimation being compensated by underestimation of baseflow further downstream or by erroneous interpretation of sensor measurements due to flow conditions there is no overestimation of baseflow at these locations additional work is thus required to draw more precise conclusions in particular by having a closer look at the water level series and defining more specific signatures 5 4 on the accuracy and information brought by the water level network at the event scale 5 4 1 characteristic times and amplitude of hydrological response although there is quite a high level of uncertainty in the observed data for the determination of reaction and response times we found that the model seems to react rather too quickly since quick surface runoff can only be produced in the model by soil saturation this also clearly indicates that soil water storage is too small this is consistent with results of the comparison of outlet hydrographs this is also consistent with results when comparing observed amplitude of the hydrological response hmax hdeb with the simulated values much larger than observations a uniform value of soil depth as used in this simulation is probably not realistic given the geological context gneiss we could have expected overestimation of soil depth in the upstream catchment and underestimation downstream as tested by jankowfsky et al 2014 but here it seems that soil depth is underestimated everywhere although deeper soil can be probably found downstream a geophysical survey goutaland 2009 showed that the bedrock depth was very irregular with a large thickness about 10 m of a weathered layer in the talwegs the fact that response is better simulated upstream than downstream in the catchment as compared to reaction time which is badly simulated everywhere also indicates that misspecification of water pathways i e model topology might not be a first order factor at least for surface runoff proper use of the water level sensors network also requires good knowledge of the rainfall spatial variability as it may induce much localized responses to overcome this problem the 32 events selected for the present analysis agree with some criteria about rainfall homogeneity on the available rain gauges the use of thiessen polygons using only two rain gauges may also be responsible for discrepancies between model and observation 5 4 2 correlations with rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture the main outcome of this analysis is that representation or parameter specification in the urbs module should be revisited in order to better reproduce the dynamics of the hydrological response in these areas 5 5 conclusions on the model diagnostic although not calibrated pumma seems to present a few strengths among which specification of precipitation at least for seasonal analysis purpose specification and calculation of evapotranspiration and water transfer specification lateral hydraulic conductivity and river routing observed model weaknesses appear to come mainly from soil water storage underestimation all over the catchment specification of water pathways in the upstream catchment should also be improved the last direction towards model improvement could be the inclusion of infiltration excess horton runoff however this is probably a second order factor as compared to soil water storage and water pathways specifications being the dominant module of pumma for the mercier catchment as it represents both agricultural and forest land use these conclusions apply specifically to the hedge module in particular the relevance of the evapotranspiration representation and parameterization and the underestimation of soil water storage however as already pointed out the data set used in this study cannot bring more quantitative elements in addition the soil moisture data were only available in cropped fields this makes distinctions between parameterization of agricultural land or forested land use difficult the relevance of the urbs model to represent processes at the cadastral scale was assessed elsewhere e g rodriguez et al 2008 in our study only one water level gauge was draining a large portion of urbanized area 11 and it showed no significant difference with other sensors as such it can be concluded that no specific malfunctioning of the urbs module could be detected according to the available data the results of the present study can also be compared with previous work using the same model or modules in particular the study by jankowfsky et al 2014 on the neighbouring chaudanne catchment these authors obtained similar results in terms of seasonal variations of discharge at the outlet they could also identify a problem of overestimation of the summer flood peaks that was found to be due to a non adequate parameterization of urbs surface components in our case this problem was not detected either because there are less urbanized zones in the mercier catchment than in the chaudanne or more likely because we used parameter values already optimized for the chaudanne to some extent this study can confirm that periurban catchments like chaudanne or mercier have to be parameterized differently than more urbanized catchments such as those tested by rodriguez et al 2008 in order to improve the pumma model on the mercier catchment a sensitivity analysis to soil depth specification average value distribution in space either randomly or according to altitude see also jankowfsky et al 2014 should be performed to see if more realistic simulations can be obtained in terms of simulated discharge volume it could also be interesting to use discharge recession analysis to infer catchment water storage as proposed for instance by vannier et al 2014 this could provide an independent estimate that can be used to constrain this variable in the model and it would be interesting to perform the same study using the improved mesh proposed by sanzana et al 2017 to check the influence of specification of water pathways 5 6 interest of such additional data for model evaluation the water level network used in this study was initially set up in order to study how the active hydrographic network was changing both seasonally and at event scales in an intermittent catchment sarrazin 2012 the sensors were low cost sensors conceived at institute of fluid mechanics in toulouse they had low accuracy and sometimes delivered quite noisy signals however we could derive from these data indicators insights into interesting patterns of hydrological behaviour intermittency reaction and response times response amplitude correlations with rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture these indicators helped us to identify the weaknesses of our model and gave us directions towards improving it yet given the accuracy of the sensors these indicators are either all related to the dynamics reaction and response time or correspond to qualitative information intermittency response amplitude it appears to us that the main problem in the model was volume overestimation during events the water level sensors network does not provide information that can be used to constrain parameters controlling runoff volume such as soil depth it would be useful to have some measurement sites inside the catchment where discharge estimation would be feasible with sufficient accuracy as to obtain information on discharge and consequently on volumes such data could be used in a calibration process calibration is not relevant with the current water level data indeed observed water level depends on the very local geometric configuration of the channel whereas the model assumes a uniform rectangular channel throughout the river reach as already discussed in 5 3 simulated water level values are not directly comparable to observations in addition such rough water level measurements are most useful when located in headwater subcatchments thus reducing the number of hydrological processes potentially involved on the one hand downstream sensors may be influenced by propagation or compensation effects which cannot be easily interpreted on the other hand downstream sensors can be used to evaluate the model s flow routing component by estimating propagation between two sensors it was not done in this study because the flow routing component was not identified as problematic but it could be added easily in a generic diagnostic protocol soil moisture data also proved to be interesting and showed that the model could reproduce seasonal dynamics quite well in the present case only surface soil moisture was available in order to get information more directly comparable with soil water storage monitoring soil moisture on the whole soil profile would be recommended however this kind of measurement can only monitor the top soil and not the altered bedrock that may play an important role in controlling catchment water storage vannier et al 2014 therefore an integrated estimation of catchment water storage as mentioned above could also be a useful complement in order to better constrain the model 6 conclusions and recommendations the paper proposes a general methodology for a diagnostic evaluation of a complex distributed hydrological model based on discharge data at the outlet and additional distributed information such as water level and surface soil moisture data due to sensor quality issues or representativeness the proposed hydrological signatures are only able to characterize the dynamics of the hydrological response they are however useful to assess the relevance of the simulated hydrological response and the underlying model functioning hypotheses with respect to land use upstream downstream rainfall types preferably when they are located upstream the catchment the results also show that information about the dynamics of the response is not sufficient to correct model discrepancies in simulating observed water volume in the river and that distributed quantitative information about catchment soil water storage and discharge are required to improve the simulated response with this respect the proposed methodology is illustrated using the pumma model in the mercier sub catchment 6 6 km2 model parameters are specified according to field data and a previous study performed in a neighbouring catchment jankowfsky et al 2014 without calibration the distributed water level and soil moisture network of sensors were useful in the model evaluation process they assessed the ability of the model to account for the complexity of the hydrological response according to various factors land use upstream or downstream rainfall type events or antecedent soil moisture these data helped identify parameters and processes that could be improved or for which a sensitivity analysis would be required but in their present form the provided information is only qualitative and cannot be used directly in a calibration process direct estimates of catchment water storage and distributed discharge data would be more useful if calibration was to be performed further work to improve the model according to the diagnostic results will consist first of revising specifications of soil depth in the model and second of assessing results improvement brought by the new model mesh proposed by sanzana et al 2017 in order to avoid polygons that are either non convex or significantly larger the evaluation

6788,this paper emphasizes the importance of integrating outlet discharge and observed internal variables in the evaluation of distributed hydrological models outputs it proposes a general methodology for a diagnostic evaluation of a complex distributed hydrological model based on discharge data at the outlet and additional distributed information such as water level and surface soil moisture data the proposed methodology is illustrated using the pumma model in the mercier sub catchment 6 6 km2 model parameters are specified according to field data and a previous study performed in a neighbouring catchment jankowfsky et al 2014 without calibration the distributed water level and soil moisture network of sensors were useful in the model evaluation process thus model parameters are specified either using in situ information or results from previous studies a stepwise approach is used for model evaluation it includes standard water balance assessment as well as comparison of observed and simulated outlet discharge whether on annual or event timescales soil moisture sensors are used to assess the ability of the model to simulate seasonal water storage dynamics based on a normalized index the water level sensors network is used on two timescales on a seasonal timescale sensors network is used to assess the model s ability to simulate intermittency whereas on event timescales sensors network is used in determining the model s ability to reproduce observed reaction as well as response times event timescales do also focus on the correlation between hydrological response and either rainfall event or antecedent soil moisture variables results show that the non calibrated model is quite effective at capturing water flow and soil water storage dynamics but it fails to reproduce observed runoff volume during events there is strong indication of a deficiency in the characterization of catchment storage and upstream flowpath description the soil water content and a network of water level sensors provide interesting information about soil moisture and river flow dynamics they however fail to provide quantitative information about catchment storage this study opens interesting perspectives for the evaluation of distributed hydrological models using hydrological signatures furthermore it highlights the requirement of quantitative as well as qualitative signatures for improving such models keywords distributed hydrological modelling object oriented modelling model diagnostic soil moisture water level sensor network hydrological signatures semi rural catchment 1 introduction distributed hydrological models are valuable in our understanding of hydrological processes and watershed behaviour they provide explicit representations of processes and components involved in hydrological balance and are able to integrate the natural variability of soil and sub soil the spatial organisation of landscape and water management practices as such they are powerful hypothesis testing tools as they formalize our assumptions on the main drivers of catchment response and allow for testing their relevance against observed data gupta et al 2008 fenicia et al 2008 clark et al 2011 in this hypothesis testing framework it is now well established that distributed models offer far better results when their outputs are compared not only to the outlet discharge but also to observed internal variables hrachowitz et al 2013 smith et al 2013 this ensures more robust representations of the catchment s internal process dynamics and improved internal models consistency thus providing the right answers for the right reasons klemes 1986 grayson et al 1992 kirchner 2006 several studies show the importance of using internal discharge gauges for model calibration and evaluation e g uhlenbrook and sieber 2005 moussa et al 2007 however the use of additional data sources although called for in many papers hrachowitz et al 2013 is not so widespread a way of using such additional data is to incorporate them in model calibration process using data assimilation techniques as illustrated by pereira cardenal et al 2011 paiva et al 2013 or wanders et al 2014 who used remote sensing data in large catchments another way is to incorporate such data in a diagnostic approach as defined by gupta et al 2008 it consists of comparing the model outputs with alternative indicators known as hydrological signatures these alternative indicators describe the behaviour of the catchment hydrological response hydrological signatures are derived from field data and provide physically interpretable metrics for functional behaviour of catchments mcmillan et al 2011 2014 as opposed to traditional performance criteria nash sutcliffe efficiency typically that are too restrictive to fully describe how well a model represents the different aspects of hydrological response the advantage of hydrological signatures is also that they can point toward the causes of model bad performance and provide elements to improve it gupta et al 2008 in the recent years some authors recommended to perform diagnostic evaluation on an uncalibrated model e g mcmillan et al 2016 they argued that although uncalibrated models have generally lower performance scores than calibrated models they offer several advantages explicit link between the parameter values and the physics no compensations for biases in input forcing data typically rainfall or errors in model structure clark et al 2011 therefore uncalibrated approach seems particularly appropriate for diagnostic evaluation of a model s strengths and weaknesses and to assess the value of qualitative distributed observations for such a diagnostic evaluation the main objective of this study is thus to build a diagnostic evaluation of a complex distributed model based on additional distributed data besides outlet discharge two types of additional data were used surface soil moisture and water level in ephemeral streams all these data had been produced by previous research projects and were reused opportunistically for the present study this main general objective is specified into three sub objectives that are 1 to assess usability of additional data in a model evaluation process and to assess strengths and weaknesses of corresponding hydrological signatures these data cannot be compared directly to model outputs either because their quality is not good enough semi qualitative data or because they do not have adequate spatial temporal resolution so defining appropriate hydrological signatures from this data is a challenging task 2 to evaluate all components of the used model surface runoff infiltration in the soil groundwater flow routing in the stream network or specific catchment zones specific sub catchments given soil type land use 3 to test the model s underlying functioning hypotheses as the last part of the model diagnostic this would allow prioritizing any further developments of the model the case study used in this paper is the mercier catchment 6 6 km2 located near lyon france and the considered model is the distributed peri urban model pumma peri urban model for landscape management jankowfsky et al 2014 pumma was used in this study because its level of detail is well adapted to the size of the mercier catchment and to the resolution of the additional data it also incorporates urban hydrology processes that are of importance on the mercier catchment however the methodology proposed in the paper is quite general and could be used for other case studies and or distributed hydrological models the paper is organised as follows in section 2 study site available data modelling tool and model setup are presented section 3 presents the model evaluation protocol that was built and the signatures derived from the distributed soil moisture and water level data results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 finally conclusions and perspectives are given in section 6 2 case study model description and set up 2 1 mercier catchment and available data the mercier catchment is part of the yzeron basin located in the south west of lyon france fig 1 the yzeron is representative of periurban areas with a highly heterogeneous land use jacqueminet et al 2013 dominated upstream by forests and agriculture and increasing urbanization downstream the mercier semi rural sub catchment has a surface of 6 6 km2 with altitudes ranging from 300 m to 785 m its geology consists mainly of gneiss and granite the soils are quite shallow especially in upslope areas leading overall to low water storage capacity land use is 46 agricultural 40 forests and 14 urban and impervious areas braud et al 2013 the climate is temperate with continental and mediterranean influences the average annual precipitation between 1997 and 2010 was 741 mm with a standard deviation of 156 mm the average response time of the mercier catchment varies between 1 and 3 4 h the catchment is part of the observatoire de terrain en hydrologie urbaine othu and has been monitored since 1997 2 1 1 permanent data consists of rainfall measurements at two gauges one starting in 1997 and the other in 2005 and discharge measurement at the catchment outlet since 1997 these data are available with a variable timestep reference evapotranspiration at a hourly timestep was calculated from the national safran database quintana seguí et al 2008 vidal et al 2010 by braud et al 2013 using the penman monteith equation fao 1998 2 1 2 additional data from the networks of sensors these data come from previous research projects conducted independently from the present study and in limited timeframes we opportunistically reused the existing data without possibility of changing the experimental setup since all sensors were already removed from the field the network of water level sensors was installed for a phd thesis which aimed at documenting the activation of ephemeral streams during events and its links with topography sarrazin 2012 distributed series of water levels are available with a 2 5 min timestep 17 measurement points located in permanent or ephemeral streams sarrazin 2012 see location in fig 1 from 2007 to 2010 sensors were located throughout the mercier catchment with upstream areas ranging from 0 06 km2 to 6 6 km2 and contrasted land uses the main characteristics are presented in table 1 since sensor accuracy 1 6 cm obtained by comparing the sensors and manual field measurements sarrazin 2012 is of the same order of magnitude as the measured water levels continuous series cannot be used directly for model evaluation however simple flow no flow patterns for continuous periods as well as water level variations and response during rainfall runoff events can all be extracted sarrazin 2012 surface soil moisture 0 5 cm depth layer data were installed for a project monitoring surface runoff dehotin et al 2015 during one year data are available at 9 locations with a 2 min timestep from april 2010 to april 2011 this dataset is described in dehotin et al 2015 location of the sensors is shown in fig 1 2 1 3 gis layers they were mainly obtained or purchased through research projects braud et al 2010 a lidar digitial elevation model with a 2 m resolution geology map in the scale 1 50000 digitized by gnouma 2006 and the pedological map of the french donesol program a detailed land use map was obtained by manual digitisation from a 2008 bdortho ign image jacqueminet et al 2013 fig 1 shows the land use map jacqueminet et al 2013 simplified in four main classes the natural and artificial drainage network and the location of the various sensors used in this study 2 2 model description the pumma model that is used in this study was specifically designed for the hydrology of peri urban areas it is presented in detail by jankowfsky et al 2014 in particular it takes into account the potential effect of each landscape object on hydrology especially linear objects river network roads ditches hedgerows thin stripes of alluvial forest etc and urban objects sewer networks roads impervious surfaces that are represented with the same degree of detail and in a unified framework these characteristics make pumma quite unique among the existing distributed hydrological models see jankowfsky et al 2014 pumma has the specificity of representing explicitly the hydrological objects of the landscape that are interconnected thanks to the use of the liquid modelling framework branger et al 2010 each of these objects is represented by a specific module hedge for agricultural and forest areas urbs for urban cadastral units river1d for the natural river network and artificial sewer network tdso for storm water overflow devices sistba for lakes and retention basins additional modules allow the flow transfer between modelling units wti wtri olaf jankowfsky et al 2014 see fig 2 model mesh consists of irregular modelling units that follow the land use patterns the hedge runoff generation module simulates rural areas such as forests and agricultural fields as well as hedges the soil is represented using two interconnected compartments drainable porosity where the water table is computed and micro porosity where infiltration and evapotranspiration take place overland flow can occur when the soil column is fully saturated hortonian runoff is not accounted for in this module the river1d runoff routing module based on the kinematic wave equation and simplified channel geometry trapezes assures routing of water towards the outlet the lateral subsurface flow is simulated by the water table interface wti module it uses the darcy law to calculate the subsurface flow between agricultural fields hedge rows and urban cadastral units the wtri water table river interface is similar to the wti interface it calculates the groundwater exchange between a model unit and a river reach or a lake instead of the darcy equation it uses the miles approach miles 1985 which considers the water table deformation close to the river based on the dupuit forchheimer assumption for built areas the urbs module is the liquid implementation of the urban runoff branching structure model by rodriguez et al 2008 each cadastral unit is divided into natural built and road areas each one having its own water balance the latter is computed using three reservoirs representing respectively the surface the non saturated and saturated zones interception by trees is also taken into account the water table level is computed as the average of the three components and is used to compute rain water drainage by sewer pipes the threshold dependent stormwater overflow module tdso simulates the storm water overflow between sewer network and natural streams the overflow is calculated with a weir or orifice equation based on a water control depth threshold value overland flow from the surface reservoirs of the hedge module and the natural part of the urbs module is calculated with the olaf overland flow interface the flux between two units is computed based on the manning strickler approach finally the sistba simulation of storage basins module simulates retention basins and lakes it represents retention basins or natural lakes with a simple linear reservoir according to the principles of the liquid framework branger et al 2010 the way the pumma model handles timestep is as follows each module manages its own variable timestep according to inner numerical constraints typically variation of state variables within a timestep moreover each module has the ability to interrupt itself and to recalculate a new timestep if required for example if a new value is received by another module this is the way the modules exchange data timesteps for a model like pumma range typically from a few seconds to several hours depending on the module and on the rainfall situation 2 3 model set up the simulation was performed for five years from january 1st 2006 to december 31st 2010 in the continuous simulation year 2006 was considered as the warm up period and model results were only analysed and discussed for the 2007 2010 period 2 3 1 model mesh the object oriented model mesh of the pumma model is composed of a combination of hydrological response units hrus flügel 1995 for rural land use units and urban hydrological elements uhe rodriguez et al 2008 for urban cadastral units including roads in the mercier catchment agricultural and road ditches were mapped using field survey and were incorporated to the natural river network in the small urban area located in the catchment rain water is collected in a separate sewer system which was also incorporated to the natural river network the river network presented in fig 3 incorporates all categories of reaches natural river road and agricultural ditches sewers and forms the basis for the river1d module that simulates flow routing note also that water flow in some reaches is intermittent furthermore ephemeral streams were represented using the river1d module hrus were obtained using gis overlay of available land use geology soil and sub basin maps jankowfsky 2011 using the 2 m lidar dtm rural sub basins were calculated using the flow direction forcing technique kenny and matthews 2005 in order to determine one sub basin for each river and artificial ditch branch jankowfsky et al 2013 the uhes encompass one cadastral unit typically house plus surrounding garden and half of the adjoining street uhes and hrus as well as lakes and retention basins for the sistba module were merged in order to get a non overlapping model mesh the object oriented model mesh consists of irregular vector objects polygons for hrus uhes and lakes retention basins and lines for the drainage network it is shown in fig 3 with the associated pumma process modules note that uhes exclusively composed of roads represent 18 of the urbs modules surface each model elements is characterized by various geometric attributes average altitude slopes etc which were computed using the dtm the wti wtri interfaces are line objects defined by intersection between polygons pre processing methods were also developed to extract the interface geometries and their connections automatically jankowfsky 2011 the automatic preprocessing also provides the flow routing on the irregular model mesh for the olaf module and determines the urban pipe connections the model mesh considered in this study is based on the original land use map of jacqueminet et al 2013 2 3 2 model inputs due to its specific handling structure pumma model is able to take into account input series rain potential evapotranspiration at any timestep relevant for the simulation in this case we used the highest temporal resolution available for input series variable timestep for rainfall at both permanent rain gauges and hourly timestep for reference evapotranspiration rainfall was interpolated to the model mesh using weighting averages of the thiessen polygons reference evapotranspiration was considered homogenous over the whole catchment crop coefficients are used in pumma to modulate et0 according to the vegetation type values proposed by jankowfsky were used 2011 as stated in the introduction an uncalibrated approach was chosen for this study therefore parameters were set according to available data physical considerations of hydrological processes or the literature model parameters were set as in jankowfsky et al 2014 for the neighbouring chaudanne catchment soil parameters were specified for each model unit using the donesol soil data base and in situ measurements gonzalez sosa et al 2010 for the urban uhes built road and natural areas were computed from the detailed land use map of jacqueminet et al 2013 natural and road permeability were assigned values proposed by jankowfsky et al 2014 study which based on a sensitivity study shows that some parameters sets were more consistent with observations their recommendations were used in this study given the proximity between both catchments for interception reservoirs of built areas roads and natural areas the link coefficients representing the fraction of runoff from both built and road areas directly connected to the network were similarly specified to 0 6 and 0 5 respectively jankowfsky et al 2014 recommended the use of a variable soil depth with larger values at lower altitudes a uniform soil depth of 1 m was used in this simulation and the evaluation of the variable soil depth is left for further sensitivity studies table 2 summarizes the main parameters and input data and how they were obtained 2 3 3 the evaluation presented in the remaining of the paper uses the simulation configuration described in this section model outputs pumma is able to produce outputs at a variable timestep and for each modelling unit in order to save computation time most of the variables were set at a fixed timestep of 6 min this is done by interpolating linearly between the actual calculated variable timesteps then comes temporal aggregation daily means for example if required for comparison with field data observed discharge data at the catchment outlet were interpolated linearly to a 6 min timestep for comparison with the model output 3 model evaluation protocol model evaluation protocol is designed following the three specific objectives presented in the introduction 3 1 assessing how additional data can be processed in the model evaluation hydrological signatures computed for model evaluation and the hydrological processes they document are presented here 3 1 1 hydrological signatures derived from soil moisture data soil moisture is quite commonly monitored in field experiments the use of soil moisture data for model evaluation raises several issues among which the issue of scaling point measurements vs integrated modelling units and the issue of representativeness how to compare model values using conceptual storage for soil compartment in this study soil moisture data were available only in natural areas where hydrological processes were simulated using the hedge module although the soil is divided into layers in this module soil moisture output of each layer was not available only total water storage mm of the whole modelling unit was available the observed soil moisture however was a point surface measurement moreover the model was run based on thiessen polygons calculated from a mere 2 rain gauges which means that very local variations of rainfall to which surface soil moisture sensors are sensitive are likely to be lost therefore it was unnecessary to compare observation and model at short event based timesteps as a result model outputs and data were processed at a daily timestep and normalized values were considered for both soil water storage and surface soil moisture as shown in eq 1 where x is the variable value min max and norm respectively for minimum maximum and normalized 1 x norm x x min x max x min such an indicator provides information about seasonal variations of soil moisture 3 1 2 hydrological signatures derived from the water level sensor networks distributed water level network consists of a dense network of sensors located in sometimes ephemeral streams maréchal 2011 these sensors do not necessarily provide accurate numerical values soft pieces of information according to hrachowitz et al 2013 but they can document how water in the streams is distributed spatio temporally in response to rainfall events such piece of information can also be obtained from direct observation of ephemeral streams activation during events maréchal et al 2013 similar experiments with temperature sensors were conducted in ecohydrology for documenting the streamflow patterns of ephemeral streams constantz et al 2001 and snowmelt spatio temporal dynamics lyon et al 2008 in our case quantitative water levels cannot be used directly as they are highly dependent on local stream conditions at the location of the sensor which a model can never reproduce it was also impossible to estimate stable rating curves and convert water levels into discharges no volume water balance indicators could thus be derived from the water level data however we could derive two types of information flow no flow patterns and characteristic times a flow no flow patterns sarrazin 2012 estimated that a threshold of 1 cm is representative of these patterns and distinguished three flow categories that he calculated for fortnight periods if water level remains above the threshold for the whole period it is a flow period if water level remains below the threshold it is a no flow period the last case water level varies above and below the threshold corresponds to an intermittent flow period in terms of hydrological processes these stream intermittency patterns can be linked with the base flow dynamics in the catchment independently from rainfall events the seasonal patterns with drying out of streams in summer and incrementally continuous flow in autumn are good indicators of how this base flow is generated and transferred through the catchment b characteristic times characteristic times used in this study are reaction and response to rainfall events reaction time is the time between the beginning of rain and the beginning of significant increase in water level response time is defined in this paper as the time between the beginning of the rain and the peak flow hdeb and hmax are respectively water depth at the reaction and response times see fig 4 these characteristic times can document fast flow generation processes surface runoff quick subsurface flow especially for the upstream sensors for which the reach routing process can be neglected and appears in bold in table 1 a selection of 32 rainfall events made by sarrazin 2012 was used for this purpose it was found that below a cumulative rainfall of 10 mm and or a rainfall intensity of 2 mm hr 1 no significant water level response was recorded in the downstream stations which were the most reactive in addition for being able to jointly analyse hydrological response at the various locations it was necessary to spatially select homogeneous rainfalls based on available rain gauges only events with rainfall accumulation differences and timing lower than 30 were kept this led to the 32 events sample used subsequently for these events observed between 2007 and 2010 cumulative precipitation volumes range between 4 75 and 73 75 mm and their durations range between 0 2 and 11 5 h sarrazin 2012 also tested several hypotheses in terms of control of the hydrological response by evaluating correlations between hmax and hmax hdeb and various rainfall and antecedent soil moisture characteristics on the other side rainfall events were characterized using the total rainfall amount event duration average intensity and maximum intensity antecedent soil moisture was characterized using an antecedent rainfall index and the cumulative rainfall amount in the last 5 10 or 30 days the correlation between water level values and these rainfall and soil moisture characteristics was computed using the spearman rank correlations to identify possible cofluctuations 3 2 evaluation of the model s components we followed a stepwise approach by using standard criteria such as water balance assessment and comparison of observed and simulated discharge at the outlet then we used previously defined signatures derived from additional data to successively evaluate the soil water balance component base flow component and fast flow component this evaluation was done using both water level data and statistical analysis of the runoff response s main controls 3 2 1 water balance assessment on an annual scale model outputs were analysed in terms of water balance and contribution from various components for each year in the simulation period 2007 2010 rainfall runoff actual evapotranspiration aet and change in soil storage δs were computed in order to assess interaction or correlation between those elements system behaviour under dry or wet conditions was analysed through computation of water balance components which are contributions from surface runoff or sub surface flow and contributions from natural or artificialized areas consistency of these contributions was discussed in light of previous findings or observations 3 2 2 comparing outlet discharge data to simulation results the model was evaluated based on the discharge calculated at the mercier outlet compared to discharge data observed at that location two types of comparison were performed 1 long term continuous based comparison and 2 short term event based comparison for 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the bias pbias were calculated according to eqs a1 and a2 in appendix criteria were calculated for each year from 2007 to 2010 as well as over the entire simulation period january 2007 to december 2010 at hourly and daily timesteps nse was calculated both for discharge and square root of discharge which contrary to nse on discharge gives less weight to high values for the event based analysis 2 simulations were evaluated using differences in peak value and peak time eqs a3 and a4 in appendix nse and volume errors to analyze the capacity to simulate runoff events for this comparison we also added the pearson correlation coefficient r2 and weighted correlation coefficient ωr2 defined by krause et al 2006 see eqs a5 and a5 these criteria were calculated at a 6 min timestep for the selection of 32 events eight of these events were not observed at the outlet gaps in the data and 4 had spurious observed data resulting in 20 events retained for the statistical analysis 3 2 3 evaluation of the soil water balance component using soil moisture data soil water storage also expressed as soil moisture is the main state variable of the hydrological system it is influenced by rainfall evapotranspiration and soil infiltration and drainage properties in pumma the soil infiltration component is the core component of the model comparison with soil moisture data focuses directly on this component the comparison between observation and model was conducted using the pearson and kendall τ correlation coefficients between observed and simulated normalized soil moisture defined by eq 1 in order to assess the ability of the model to reproduce the seasonal dynamics of soil filling and emptying both absolute values of the normalized values and increments from one day to the next were compared in terms of model parameters the soil filling process is controlled mainly by the rainfall and the modelling unit s soil depth and porosity total soil water storage capacity soil emptying is driven by evapotranspiration which is potential evapotranspiration modulated by the vegetation related crop coefficient soil wetness and the lateral conductivity of wti interfaces groundwater lateral flow since in hedge only saturation excess runoff is represented no additional parameter is involved for surface runoff when considering only soil moisture increments i e relative variations soil drainage capacity and lateral conductivity are the main governing parameters 3 2 4 evaluation of the base flow component using water level data the ability of the model to reproduce stream intermittency was tested using the same classification as observed data for the continuous year 2009 which was divided in 24 approximate fortnight periods see section 3 1 2 that year was selected because a maximum of sensors were operating then in addition a few technical sensors issues were resolved so that the 1 cm threshold could be considered as reliable sarrazin 2012 because modelled stream reaches are quite simplified as compared to terrain reality trapeze cross sections uniform width throughout the reach the same 1 cm threshold was deemed irrelevant for the simulated water levels three different thresholds were tested 0 5 cm 0 7 cm and 1 cm assuming the model s actual evapotranspiration calculation performs well model parameters corresponding to base flow generation in pumma are soil depth in hedge it influences the groundwater depth in each modelling unit the lateral conductivity in wti interfaces and topology spatial organisation of the modelling units which control water pathways for the two sensors corresponding to drainage areas with significant residential zone the parameter controlling groundwater drainage in the urbs module by sewer pipes is also important 3 2 5 evaluation of fast flow components using water level data in the pumma model fast flow corresponds to surface runoff on forest or agricultural areas it is generated by the hedge module in hedge surface runoff is produced when the whole soil profile is filled up this surface runoff is routed between modelling units by the olaf module the corresponding parameters are soil depth and porosity and topology of the olaf module whereas for residential areas and roads urbs module is prefered the main drivers for controlling surface runoff are the interception reservoir the surface hydraulic conductivity and link coefficients corresponding to the fraction of surface runoff especially on impervious road and built surfaces directly connected to the drainage network as for the surface runoff collected from road and built surfaces is directly connected to the stream network no specific routing parameters are to be taken into account if the length of the stream reach is small enough the reaction and response times of the basin at different stations of mercier were calculated a comparison is done between the model outputs and the observed values for the 32 events using the pearson correlation coefficient stations 2 5 7 to 11 and 16 are located in small head watersheds and the length of the stream reach in the upstream catchment is 1000 m table 1 for these stations we consider that only surface runoff processes are involved in the model s response for the other stations interpretation is more difficult as the stream routing component of the model cannot be neglected therefore the comparison highlights these upstream stations for which the dominant land uses are respectively forest stations 8 9 10 forest and agriculture stations 2 5 7 and residential agriculture stations 11 and 16 in addition the same correlations as defined in 3 1 2 between water level values hmax or hmax hdeb and rainfall and antecedent soil moisture characteristics were also calculated using the model outputs to verify whether the model was able to reproduce the observed correlations these correlations are interesting as sarrazin 2012 showed for some stations amplitude of the response hmax or hmax hdeb were more correlated to antecedent rainfall and rainfall amounts this means that the hydrological response is more sensitive to catchment wetness other stations on the other hand were more related to rainfall intensity thus meaning that the hydrological response is more sensitive to infiltration capacity and routing towards the outlet 4 results 4 1 water balance assessment table 3 shows components of the annual water balance for the four years and table 4 discharge components table 3 shows that simulated runoff is generally lower when rainfall is lower 2009 but 2010 is an exception the computed runoff is low and underestimated as compared to observation note also the significant simulated change in water storage from one year to the next the catchment stores water during wet years but releases it during dry years such as 2009 where decrease of soil water storage is used to fulfil aet the different behaviour of year 2010 may be explained by a dry winter when aet is low and more rainfall in summer when vegetation is active in terms of runoff components 2010 is also different from other years with more sub surface flow than surface runoff and a larger contribution of urbs table 4 this is mainly related to infiltration in sewer networks which is proportionally higher than other years results from table 4 show that contribution of direct runoff from the natural part of urbs is low 1 but contribution from hedge is large 16 33 of rainfall maps of average ponding see fig 10 in sanzana et al 2018 show that ponding is higher in downstream catchment area with agricultural land use than it is in the forested area in upstream catchment this result is consistent with runoff observations from dehotin et al 2015 and with saturated hydraulic conductivity estimations provided by gonzalez sosa et al 2010 showing higher values in forest than in cultivated areas but this result might also be due to the unique soil depth taken in the model set up which is probably overestimated in the upstream catchment and underestimated downstream 4 2 comparison between observed and simulated discharge at the outlet 4 2 1 continuous long term comparison table 5 shows statistical criteria for each year and the whole period table 5 shows contrasted results from one year to the next in terms of nse with a value of 0 01 for the whole period hourly values and 0 15 for daily values nse is negative for 2007 and 2009 and positive for 2008 and 2010 the year 2008 is particularly well simulated but includes the highest discharge event ever recorded in the catchment november 1 3 event which is well simulated by the model see fig 5 e with a large positive impact on the nse computed for year 2008 nse on the square root of discharge is much larger than nse on discharge with positive values except on daily values for 2010 this means that the model captures fairly well the general hydrological regime and the base flow which has low values in summer and higher values in winter pbias is satisfactory with values of less than 10 in absolute values except for year 2010 where model runoff is underestimated by 43 note however that winter 2009 2010 was affected by snowfalls and frost that perturbed rainfall measurement that may have been underestimated during this period in addition snow processes are not included in the model which may explain model underestimation during the 2009 2010 winter according to moriasi et al 2007 simulation results are satisfactory if nse 50 and pbias 25 based on these thresholds the model can be deemed satisfactory only for the 2008 period s daily timesteps model performance is therefore quite poor according to statistical criteria additionally the model is uncalibrated and captures variations in seasonal discharge quite well it is however generally too reactive to small and moderate events rainfall with a very noisy simulated discharge 4 2 2 short term event based comparison table 6 shows performance criteria statistics at the 6 min timestep for the 20 events mentionned in section 3 2 2 fig 5 illustrates model results for six representative events results show that the model generally captures event dynamics well with relatively low peak flow lag error values this is quite remarkable as no roughness coefficients calibration in the flow routing module was done to better fit peak times performance is not so good in terms of pbias as the model generally overestimates the volume median of about 63 for pbias this consistently leads to very poor values of nse negative median on the other hand r2 and ωr2 show much higher values thus confirming model s ability to reproduce the dynamics volume overestimation is greater under dry conditions table 6 consistently leading to better model performance in wet conditions the shape of the simulated hydrographs shows that the model is generally too reactive with a much peakier behavior than through observation such model over reaction leads to general overestimation of peak discharge 4 3 evaluation of soil water component fig 6 shows comparison between simulated normalized daily soil water storage and observed normalized surface soil moisture top and correlation between daily increments bottom table 7 summarizes coefficients of determination of the pearson regression and the kendall τ for rank correlation between both variables for all the measurement points results show that the model captures seasonal variations of soil water storage well and more precisely when soil water storage is permanently high results are also very good for increments it shows that the model reproduces soil water storage dynamics quite well this is less true for station 7 where surface soil moisture does not show an increase in autumn increase however seen with simulated soil water storage discrepancy may be due to particular features of the soil moisture sensor location for this station the τ kendall for the increments is nevertheless correct note also that the τ kendall is generally higher than the coefficient of determination it means that both observed and modelled variables have similar variations but that this relation is not necessarily linear which is expected for variables that are different in terms of modelled processes and parameters this means that at daily timestep reconstitution of local rainfall using thiessen polygons on the 2 rain gauges is relevant the representation of evapotranspiration processes and emptying of the soil profile through lateral subsurface flow seem to be correct as well 4 4 evaluation of base flow component using water level data the results are presented in fig 7 for each station and each period summary statistics are presented in table 8 observed intermittency patterns are quite balanced with a predominance of continuous flow average 46 over the year in winter 36 of intermittent flow and 15 only of no flow which occurs predominantly in summer the model does not succeed in reproducing these general patterns whatever the threshold intermittent flow is strongly dominant 53 for 0 5 cm threshold to 72 for 1 cm threshold frequency of flow 41 for 0 5 cm and 14 for 1 cm and no flow 6 for 0 5 cm and 14 for 1 cm periods are both underestimated compared to observations the model is more successful in reproducing winter predominance of continuous flow periods although this remains underestimated the more realistic picture seems to be obtained with the 0 7 cm threshold which best reproduces the length of the continuous flow period from january to may and presents a few continuous flow spots at the end of the year the 1 cm threshold generates an overall dry picture whereas the 0 5 cm threshold produces unrealistically long continuous flow periods on the other hand whatever the threshold occurrence of dry periods during summer is missed by the model but this is less problematic since the distinction between intermittent flow and no flow is quite subtle and probably also very uncertain and dependent on local conditions at the sensor s location looking more closely we notice that discrepancies come mainly from stations 2 and 7 to 10 which are all upstream stations dominated by forests on these stations the simulated behaviour is too dry with absence of baseflow during the winter months whatever the threshold in the model this can be mainly due to soil depth and lateral flow conductivity or topology comparison with soil moisture data shows that lateral flow conductivity seemed adequate but this was tested only for agriculture land use where soil moisture sensors were located and not forests in the wooded areas it is possible that we underestimated soil depth and lateral conductivity but the first order factor could be topology indeed pumma is based on irregular modelling units and in the wooded upstream areas units which are very large see fig 3 this can create erroneous flow paths and inaccurate flow transfers between units since the model takes into account only the mean altitude of each unit on the other hand the model behaves much better for stations located in agricultural or residential areas and areas with small upstream and smaller modelling units stations 11 5 16 the stations where the model overestimates baseflow are 14 6 and 13 only 14 for 0 7 cm threshold which are located downstream each other in this order 4 5 evaluation of fast flow component using water level data fig 8 shows comparison between the model output and observed values of reaction and response time as well as of hmax hdeb on the mercier catchment points are colored according to the dominant land use forest forest agriculture and residential agriculture table 9 presents the values of the regression equations ymod b a xobs and square coefficient r2 for different partitions of the data set according to land use upstream downstream location see table 1 event duration threshold of 4 h rainfall depth threshold of 20 mm maximum intensity threshold of 10 mm hr 1 and antecedent rainfall over the last 10 days threshold of 20 mm a low overall correlation between the model and observations can be noticed for reaction time the slope of the regression is 0 05 over the whole sample far enough from the target value of 1 to conclude that the model generally reacts too quickly and underestimates reaction time table 9 shows that reaction is better simulated for long duration events r2 0 33 for d 4 h and low intensities r2 0 15 for imax 10 mm h as reaction can be determined more accurately under these conditions indeed observation shows that values are quite uncertain due to sensor accuracy and fluctuations especially for low values about a few cm so that change in just a few centimetres must be detected to determine that there is a reaction model results are more stable and it is easier to identify the onset of the hydrological reaction this may partly explain reaction times underestimation by the model in terms of processes reaction can provide information on the ability of the model to generate more or less quick surface runoff by infiltration excess or saturation excess reaction is therefore very sensitive to flow paths and model topology for surface runoff the latter is supposed to be less accurate in the wooded part due to larger modelling units this may explain the absence of significant correlation for forested catchments as compared to agricultural ones see table 9 for downstream stations correlation in terms of response is not significant and is very low 0 03 for upstream stations table 9 this may be related to more complex transfer processes in downstream stations not properly simulated by the model the model better simulates response time than reaction time with an overall r2 0 39 the model showed a tendency to satisfactorily simulate reaction time for forested and forested agricultural land use with a general model s underestimation as shown by values of the regression slope of less than 1 none of the factors is well simulated for the residential agriculture land use but the sample size is probably too small to be representative response is better simulated for the upstream stations long duration events low rainfall amount low maximum intensity events and high antecedent rainfall events response is the sum of reaction and of the rising limb on the hydrograph it reflects the velocity with which runoff generated in the sub catchment is transferred to the outlet the modelled response depends on the way water pathways are represented into the model water pathways are shorter in upstream catchments than in downstream ones thus simulation of the response is less prone to errors than downstream amplitude of the response is also globally not well simulated by the model with an overall correlation of 0 16 reaching 0 32 for forest agriculture catchments high correlation is not expected as change in water level is very dependent on local configurations at the sites of observations which are not represented in the model the orders of magnitude of simulated and observed response amplitude are very different with slopes of the regressions generally around 0 3 results are not very sensitive to the type of rainfall or antecedent soil moisture as performance is very similar between the various classes tables 10 and 11 present each station s spearman rank correlation coefficients between hmax and hmax hdeb and variables describing rainfall events and antecedent soil moisture only values with a significant correlation test p 0 1 are reported for both variables observations show high correlation with rainfall volume maximum rainfall intensity or both for half of the stations consistent with observation the model simulates those relationships between amplitude of the hydrological response rainfall amount and maximum intensity but these are stronger and more systematic than observed in addition correlations are not as strong with observed hmax hdeb than with hmax but the model does not detect this difference this may be due to identification of hdeb which is more difficult in observations than in the model see above which could lower the observed correlation for station 11 which corresponds to the most urbanized sub catchment the model does not at all reproduce the significantly high anti correlation with rainfall duration and mean intensity however it shows high correlation with rainfall amount and antecedent rainfall this could point out to a misrepresentation of surface runoff by the urbs runoff the response of which seems to be governed by soil saturation level in the model 5 discussion to introduce the discussion we would like to underline that pumma as every hydrological model was built on specific assumptions functioning hypothesis as mentioned in the introduction section the third specific objective of the present paper is to assess whether these assumptions can be dismissed or strenghtened according to the simulation results structural assumptions are as follows pumma considers only one surface free aquifer created by filling up the soil profile from impervious bedrock with no flow boundary condition at the bottom the aquifer is consequently quite shallow and there is no possibility to simulate temporary water saturation above groundwater level perched water tables this also prevents the simulation of water storage in deep weathered bedrock if it is not considered as part of the soil the only way to generate surface runoff is by soil saturation hortonian surface runoff is not implemented in terms of model parameters other assumptions were also made for the application to the mercier catchment spatial discretization model mesh was based on land use only which leads to significantly larger modelling units in the upstream zones of the catchment pumma is able to perform calculations in such a heterogeneous mesh but one can wonder whether this does not generate distortions in simulated water pathways for simplicity we used a uniform soil depth for the whole catchment in addition pumma is uncalibrated and increasing model performance is not this paper s objective the model is run using parameter values of either the literature or in situ measurements model evaluation is performed on this reference simulation in order to focus on functioning hypotheses testing model evaluation also helps to relate discrepancies between model and observation in order to improve process representation and or parameter specification this discussion focuses on 1 the lessons that can be learned in terms of simulated hydrological processes from comparison of pumma with distributed data sets of soil moisture and water level 2 on the relevance and limits of the computed hydrological signatures 5 1 on the use of discharge data in this study discharge at the catchment outlet was used for model evaluation in a traditional manner using statistical criteria to compare simulation and observation because our interest is in evaluating the model over the whole hydrological regime computing several criteria to highlight model performance for varied ranges seemed compulsory the present example shows that using the nse criterion on discharge alone may be misleading in our case nse values are very poor mainly due to systematic discharge overestimation by the model dynamics however at all temporal scales are captured quite well as shown by the relatively good values of r2 or ωr2 in addition nse is very sensitive to the occurrence of high events as shown by a much better performance for the year 2008 see fig 5e during which the highest flood event of the whole study period occurred in terms of model diagnostic it is difficult to conclude at this stage even if the model has clearly major weaknesses these cannot be directly related to any specific components nevertheless the overall volume estimation is not so bad however values of the dynamics indicators show that the parameters controlling water transfer lateral hydraulic conductivity and reach routing parameters seem reasonable future improvements in the use of statistical performance criteria should probably focus on uncertainty assessment as these criteria are very sensitive to data accuracy in the case of the mercier catchment the stream channel at gauging station is wide and water level is less than 3 cm at low flow leading to low discharge accuracy this point was improved recently by adding a v notch weir to increase sensitivity at low flow uncertainty on the stage discharge relationship was also assessed using the baratin bayesian method le coz et al 2014 and work is in progress to propagate this uncertainty and the stage measurement uncertainty to the hydrological records horner et al 2018 this will allow a more robust appraisal of model performance 5 2 on the accuracy and information brought by soil water content data available soil moisture sensors were only monitoring the surface soil water content at nine locations all located in agricultural land use the data are point measurements whereas model outputs are provided at the scale of a whole modelling unit there was indeed a scale mismatch between observed and simulated values in addition in the model we were mainly interested in assessing soil water storage simulation over the whole soil column depth rather than only the soil moisture behaviour in top soil it is interesting to see that once normalised surface soil moisture provides interesting information about seasonal soil water storage and in particular about the time when soil water storage is sufficiently replenished to get permanent wet conditions in terms of model diagnostic the results give us good confidence in the formulations of input and output flows of the soil water storage in the model however the drawback of normalization is that it does not provide any information on the absolute value of soil water storage and this is not very helpful to assess the relevance of the homogeneous 1 m soil depth hypothesis in order to better constrain soil depth specification studies should be completed with approaches such as the one proposed by vannier et al 2014 in assessing catchment water storage 5 3 on the accuracy and information brought by the water level network at continuous scale intermittency in its present version pumma is not successful at reproducing stream intermittency as defined in our test seasonal variation is approximately reproduced if the flow no flow threshold is reduced to 0 7 cm which is consistent with other results seasonality of discharge at the outlet and soil moisture it is difficult to interpret where discrepancies originate as water level in the stream depends on hydrology of the upstream catchment but also on local hydraulic conditions therefore potentially all components of pumma could be involved we must also underline that this particular test deals with high uncertainty regarding both observations and model the choice of a single threshold applied for all stations is a strong assumption and the chosen value of 1 cm for observations is debatable given sensor accuracy the existence of flow no flow depends also on local conditions at the location of each sensor which were not investigated in detail for simplicity of the application moreover the flow routing component of pumma is a routing model with simplified geometries although calculated the variable water level is not necessarily representative particularly for very low values where numerical considerations can also interfere with the results yet we still can derive a few elements of diagnostic it seems that the model does not simulate enough baseflow in the upstream part of the catchment and too much in the downstream part for the upstream stations it indicates that either soil water storage is not sufficient or topology water pathways for groundwater flow is not correct for downstream stations it is more difficult to conclude model s baseflow overestimation is not observed at the outlet where statistical criteria indicate that the model is able to successfully reproduce seasonal flow variations these contradictory results could be explained by compensation effects overestimation being compensated by underestimation of baseflow further downstream or by erroneous interpretation of sensor measurements due to flow conditions there is no overestimation of baseflow at these locations additional work is thus required to draw more precise conclusions in particular by having a closer look at the water level series and defining more specific signatures 5 4 on the accuracy and information brought by the water level network at the event scale 5 4 1 characteristic times and amplitude of hydrological response although there is quite a high level of uncertainty in the observed data for the determination of reaction and response times we found that the model seems to react rather too quickly since quick surface runoff can only be produced in the model by soil saturation this also clearly indicates that soil water storage is too small this is consistent with results of the comparison of outlet hydrographs this is also consistent with results when comparing observed amplitude of the hydrological response hmax hdeb with the simulated values much larger than observations a uniform value of soil depth as used in this simulation is probably not realistic given the geological context gneiss we could have expected overestimation of soil depth in the upstream catchment and underestimation downstream as tested by jankowfsky et al 2014 but here it seems that soil depth is underestimated everywhere although deeper soil can be probably found downstream a geophysical survey goutaland 2009 showed that the bedrock depth was very irregular with a large thickness about 10 m of a weathered layer in the talwegs the fact that response is better simulated upstream than downstream in the catchment as compared to reaction time which is badly simulated everywhere also indicates that misspecification of water pathways i e model topology might not be a first order factor at least for surface runoff proper use of the water level sensors network also requires good knowledge of the rainfall spatial variability as it may induce much localized responses to overcome this problem the 32 events selected for the present analysis agree with some criteria about rainfall homogeneity on the available rain gauges the use of thiessen polygons using only two rain gauges may also be responsible for discrepancies between model and observation 5 4 2 correlations with rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture the main outcome of this analysis is that representation or parameter specification in the urbs module should be revisited in order to better reproduce the dynamics of the hydrological response in these areas 5 5 conclusions on the model diagnostic although not calibrated pumma seems to present a few strengths among which specification of precipitation at least for seasonal analysis purpose specification and calculation of evapotranspiration and water transfer specification lateral hydraulic conductivity and river routing observed model weaknesses appear to come mainly from soil water storage underestimation all over the catchment specification of water pathways in the upstream catchment should also be improved the last direction towards model improvement could be the inclusion of infiltration excess horton runoff however this is probably a second order factor as compared to soil water storage and water pathways specifications being the dominant module of pumma for the mercier catchment as it represents both agricultural and forest land use these conclusions apply specifically to the hedge module in particular the relevance of the evapotranspiration representation and parameterization and the underestimation of soil water storage however as already pointed out the data set used in this study cannot bring more quantitative elements in addition the soil moisture data were only available in cropped fields this makes distinctions between parameterization of agricultural land or forested land use difficult the relevance of the urbs model to represent processes at the cadastral scale was assessed elsewhere e g rodriguez et al 2008 in our study only one water level gauge was draining a large portion of urbanized area 11 and it showed no significant difference with other sensors as such it can be concluded that no specific malfunctioning of the urbs module could be detected according to the available data the results of the present study can also be compared with previous work using the same model or modules in particular the study by jankowfsky et al 2014 on the neighbouring chaudanne catchment these authors obtained similar results in terms of seasonal variations of discharge at the outlet they could also identify a problem of overestimation of the summer flood peaks that was found to be due to a non adequate parameterization of urbs surface components in our case this problem was not detected either because there are less urbanized zones in the mercier catchment than in the chaudanne or more likely because we used parameter values already optimized for the chaudanne to some extent this study can confirm that periurban catchments like chaudanne or mercier have to be parameterized differently than more urbanized catchments such as those tested by rodriguez et al 2008 in order to improve the pumma model on the mercier catchment a sensitivity analysis to soil depth specification average value distribution in space either randomly or according to altitude see also jankowfsky et al 2014 should be performed to see if more realistic simulations can be obtained in terms of simulated discharge volume it could also be interesting to use discharge recession analysis to infer catchment water storage as proposed for instance by vannier et al 2014 this could provide an independent estimate that can be used to constrain this variable in the model and it would be interesting to perform the same study using the improved mesh proposed by sanzana et al 2017 to check the influence of specification of water pathways 5 6 interest of such additional data for model evaluation the water level network used in this study was initially set up in order to study how the active hydrographic network was changing both seasonally and at event scales in an intermittent catchment sarrazin 2012 the sensors were low cost sensors conceived at institute of fluid mechanics in toulouse they had low accuracy and sometimes delivered quite noisy signals however we could derive from these data indicators insights into interesting patterns of hydrological behaviour intermittency reaction and response times response amplitude correlations with rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture these indicators helped us to identify the weaknesses of our model and gave us directions towards improving it yet given the accuracy of the sensors these indicators are either all related to the dynamics reaction and response time or correspond to qualitative information intermittency response amplitude it appears to us that the main problem in the model was volume overestimation during events the water level sensors network does not provide information that can be used to constrain parameters controlling runoff volume such as soil depth it would be useful to have some measurement sites inside the catchment where discharge estimation would be feasible with sufficient accuracy as to obtain information on discharge and consequently on volumes such data could be used in a calibration process calibration is not relevant with the current water level data indeed observed water level depends on the very local geometric configuration of the channel whereas the model assumes a uniform rectangular channel throughout the river reach as already discussed in 5 3 simulated water level values are not directly comparable to observations in addition such rough water level measurements are most useful when located in headwater subcatchments thus reducing the number of hydrological processes potentially involved on the one hand downstream sensors may be influenced by propagation or compensation effects which cannot be easily interpreted on the other hand downstream sensors can be used to evaluate the model s flow routing component by estimating propagation between two sensors it was not done in this study because the flow routing component was not identified as problematic but it could be added easily in a generic diagnostic protocol soil moisture data also proved to be interesting and showed that the model could reproduce seasonal dynamics quite well in the present case only surface soil moisture was available in order to get information more directly comparable with soil water storage monitoring soil moisture on the whole soil profile would be recommended however this kind of measurement can only monitor the top soil and not the altered bedrock that may play an important role in controlling catchment water storage vannier et al 2014 therefore an integrated estimation of catchment water storage as mentioned above could also be a useful complement in order to better constrain the model 6 conclusions and recommendations the paper proposes a general methodology for a diagnostic evaluation of a complex distributed hydrological model based on discharge data at the outlet and additional distributed information such as water level and surface soil moisture data due to sensor quality issues or representativeness the proposed hydrological signatures are only able to characterize the dynamics of the hydrological response they are however useful to assess the relevance of the simulated hydrological response and the underlying model functioning hypotheses with respect to land use upstream downstream rainfall types preferably when they are located upstream the catchment the results also show that information about the dynamics of the response is not sufficient to correct model discrepancies in simulating observed water volume in the river and that distributed quantitative information about catchment soil water storage and discharge are required to improve the simulated response with this respect the proposed methodology is illustrated using the pumma model in the mercier sub catchment 6 6 km2 model parameters are specified according to field data and a previous study performed in a neighbouring catchment jankowfsky et al 2014 without calibration the distributed water level and soil moisture network of sensors were useful in the model evaluation process they assessed the ability of the model to account for the complexity of the hydrological response according to various factors land use upstream or downstream rainfall type events or antecedent soil moisture these data helped identify parameters and processes that could be improved or for which a sensitivity analysis would be required but in their present form the provided information is only qualitative and cannot be used directly in a calibration process direct estimates of catchment water storage and distributed discharge data would be more useful if calibration was to be performed further work to improve the model according to the diagnostic results will consist first of revising specifications of soil depth in the model and second of assessing results improvement brought by the new model mesh proposed by sanzana et al 2017 in order to avoid polygons that are either non convex or significantly larger the evaluation

6789,in this study with the use of a multiple linear regression approach the tree ring chronologies of eight sampling sites in the upper lancang mekong river basin were developed to provide a 449 year ce 1557 2005 reconstruction of the annual runoff thus placing recent changes in annual runoff into a long term context these eight tree ring chronologies have recently been archived in publicly available databases through the international tree ring data bank reconstruction results showed a good correlation coefficient of 0 662 n 39 p value 0 01 between the reconstructed and the observed

decomposition 1 introduction both the frequency and intensity of flood and drought disasters in southeastern asia have been predicted to increase in future ipcc 2014 the annual runoff variations associated with global warming have recently been documented for many regions of the world treydteet al 2006 touchanet al 2008 wang et al 2017 studies vaidyanathan 2011 bolch et al 2012 have shown that the melting of the himalayan glaciers has a specific impact on the runoff variations of the lancang mekong river water resources from mountainous regions are vital for both natural ecosystems and human activities in adjacent lowlands bogra et al 2014 ferrero et al 2015 approximately 80 million people in southeast asia depend on this river for their livelihood mekong river commission 2010 therefore river flow changes in this part of the region can severely affect downstream flow and water supply availability wang et al 2002 while annual runoff variations are random they exhibit a quasi periodic regularity the variations largely depend on the timescale willems 2006 their statistical characteristics may be significantly different for short vs long time series data in a practical sense for the purpose of understanding the current conditions as well as for predicting the rules of annual runoff variations for the future it is necessary to understand the long term variations of the lancang mekong river runoff prowse et al 2006 however the existing instrument based hydrometric data of most rivers in the world cover only a short period of around 50 60 years this period is far from the goal to analyze the annual runoff response to climate variations at timescales of more than a hundred years therefore it is difficult to place the recently observed variations into a longer term perspective hence an urgent need exists to use various proxy data for the reconstruction of annual runoff to expand the length of the data series high resolution proxy records for centuries that include historical documents zhang et al 1997 qian et al 2003 mudelsee et al 2006 pfister et al 2006 tree ring records meko et al 2001 kang et al 2002 cook et al 2004 liu et al 2017 stalagmite deposits xu 2015 and historical flood level marks brázdil et al 2006 can provide a long term historical context that allows to understand the conditions of hydrological systems consequently they have

tree growth is influenced by the same climatic variables that modulate runoff therefore annual variations in discharge may be reconstructed from tree rings based on the strong relationship between tree growth and river runoff researchers from the us were among the first who studied tree rings chronologies and consequently several scientific research results were achieved in that country in the us tree rings have been widely used to extend or update hydrological records as well as for the reconstruction of annual or seasonal streamflow cook and jacoby 1983 meko and graybill 1995 woodhouse 2000 pederson et al 2001 woodhouse 2001 devineni et al 2013 ferrero et al 2015 in asia the first runoff reconstruction was developed by zhou 1984 who extended the irtysh river runoff records back to 1582 using tree ring chronologies from xinjiang china the observation period in the paper of zhou encompasses ce 1928 1981 the mean of the reconstructed annual runoff in the rivers was 9 163 109 m3 while the measured average annual runoff was 9 872 109 m3 subsequently other scholars conducted extensive research in northwest china but the research area mainly remained concentrated in xinjiang see li et al 2000 and references therein the observation period mainly concentrated on ce 1900 2000 the differences of the reconstructed value and the measured value were about 5 qin et al 2004 used sabina tibetica tree rings from the headwater area of the yangtze river to reconstruct the runoff back to ce 1485 the observation period in qin s paper is ce 1957 2001 the mean of the reconstructed annual runoff in the rivers was 1 461 1010 m3 which is more than 5 of the measured average annual runoff gou et al 2007 used juniperus przewalski tree rings from the headwater area of the yellow river to reconstruct the stream flow back to 1409 all of these studies on runoff reconstruction based on tree rings either have shorter reconstruction periods lower elevations in the study area or lack of prominent climate and environment characteristics long term i e hundreds of years hydrological variation reconstructions in cold plateau regions such as the qinghai tibetan plateau are rare due to the paucity of tree ring chronologies and the measured runoff data in these regions consequently the unique geographical location and climatic conditions of the lancang mekong river basin and the increasing water resource problem have led to a more urgent need for this study in the basin to improve our understanding of long term variations in runoff in cold plateau regions especially for the southeastern qinghai tibetan plateau we designed a runoff reconstruction scenario that was based on eight tree ring chronologies from the headwaters of the lancang mekong river to guarantee the reliability of the reconstructed annual runoff a multiple linear regression reconstruction model was calibrated and validated using observed runoff data of 1967 2005 furthermore the reconstructed annual runoff was verified and compared to other precipitation and drought reconstruction results of the southeastern qinghai tibetan plateau based on proxy data such as tree ring or stalagmite the purpose of this study is to enlarge runoff time series for water resources research with sufficient representativeness in the complex area of the alpine region and to provide a theoretical basis for trend forecasts of the water resource development in the lancang mekong river basin 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the sampling sites of this study are located in the upper lancang mekong river basin which is a transboundary basin that covers many countries in southeastern asia the lancang mekong river originates from the qinghai tibetan plateau and the altitude of the river source is 5500 m the studied river has a length of 2161 km covers 190 000 km2 liu et al 2009 wang et al 2018 and is allocated within the range of 93 51 101 50 e and 21 30 33 49 n fig 1 the lancang mekong river basin is shaped like a ribbon running from north to south and the average width of the basin is 80 km after flowing out of the qinghai tibetan plateau the river flows through alpine valley areas where the mountain peaks are more than 3000 m above mean sea level the actual runoff data used in this paper stems from the jiuzhou hydrology station 25 78 n 99 28e fig 1 which is a controlled site of the upper lancang mekong river basin the average annual runoff was 201 108 m3 or 106 mm during 1967 2005 the mean annual precipitation ce 1967 2005 of three meteorological stations in this region is 578 mm upstream nangqian 519 mm midstream cangdu and 697 mm downstream deqin the annual mean temperature ranges from 3 c to 15 c correlation analysis shows that the trend of runoff and rainfall in this area is consistent nikolopoulos et al 2015 braud et al 2016 to ensure that the results of the study are representative the eight sampling sites are distributed at different altitudes slopes and orientations in the upper lancang mekong river basin fig 2 2 2 tree ring chronologies and its correlation with annual runoff with the purpose of identifying long timescale climate runoff signals eight tree ring chronologies were obtained from noaa paleoclimatology program s international tree ring data bank itrdb http www ncdc noaa gov paleo treering html these tree ring chronologies were contributed by cook et al 2010 the reliability of the data can be guaranteed as follows 1 the tree ring samples were preprocessed dried mounted surfaced and cross dated with the standard dendrochronological methods by cook et al 2010 2 cook et al 2010 applied the regional curve standardization to best preserve the low frequency signals and 3 the data was used in the related researches cook et al 2010 shi et al 2017 detailed information of the sampling sites and eight tree ring chronologies are shown in table 1 among them series intercorrelation mean sensitivity number of dated series and percent problem segments are the correlation statistics program cofecha output crossdating quality analysis of the tree ring width measurements from the international tree ring data bank grissino mayer 2001 fritts 1976 holmes 1983 series intercorrelation is a measure of the strength of the signal typically the climate signal common to all sampled trees at the site the highest values are around 0 900 for very drought sensitive conifers and the lowest values for trees that can still be reliably cross dated are around 0 400 higher values of series intercorrelation are generally more desirable however trees of some species and in some regions will have higher values than others series intercorrelation is an important consideration in assessing chronology quality mean sensitivity is a measure of the relative change in ring width from one year to the next in a given series trees with stronger common signals tend to be more sensitive average mean sensitivity varies among species and regional climates from around 0 650 for very drought sensitive conifers to 0 150 for the most complacent trees it is a good measure of the relative ease of cross dating a higher number of series is always more desirable since it increases the robustness of the common signal usually few series span the entire chronology so at any point the sample length is usually less than the number of dated series most chronologies have between 15 and 60 series but some have well over 100 percent problem segments are the number of problem segments as a percentage of the total number of 50 year segments which were flagged by cofecha a problem segment does not necessarily reflect a dating error it can be caused by periods in which a tree is less responsive to the common often climatic signal or by growth anomalies to verify the correlation between the annual runoff and the tree ring data we used the actual annual runoff data from the jiuzhou hydrology station and the eight tree ring chronologies from 1967 to 2005 for analysis with the aim to provide a theoretical basis for runoff reconstruction the correlation coefficients table 2 indicate that the cross correlation of the eight tree ring chronologies and the correlations between the chronologies and the annual runoff data are positive the average autocorrelation coefficient of the eight tree ring chronologies is 0 544 p value 0 01 the two sampling sites with the highest correlations are chn025 and chn028 r 0 77 p value 0 001 furthermore the sampling sites of chn047 and chn065 r 0 25 have the lowest correlation in addition the first column of table 2 and fig 3 show that the eight tree ring chronologies during the period of 1967 2005 are all significantly correlated to the annual runoff data from the jiuzhou hydrology station the average correlation coefficient between the eight tree ring chronologies and the annual runoff is 0 69 p value 0 001 the highest correlation coefficient r 0 82 p value 0 001 was observed at chn025 and the lowest coefficient r 0 52 p value 0 001 was observed at chn065 we observe that correlation of dendrochronologies with runoff is higher than the cross correlation between dendrochronologies indicating that a common climatic forcing but also other local highly variable factors influence tree growth therefore we assume that the eight tree ring chronologies are suitable for the reconstruction of annual runoff 2 3 model development based on the relationship existing between sampling trees and runoff of this region we used the annual runoff data for the period of 1967 2005 and the eight tree ring chronologies of the corresponding years to conduct a multiple regression analysis to establish a runoff reconstruction model the 449 year annual runoff time series is reconstructed through multiple regression between the sampled eight tree ring chronologies and the recorded annual runoff using the following reconstruction equation 1 y t a 0 i 1 k a i x t i where y t represents the estimated annual runoff in year t k represents the number of predictors in the model a 0 a 1 a k represent the estimated regression constant and coefficients and x t i represents the ith predictor the residual chronology in year t meko and graybill 1995 the total length of the modeling data period is 39 years in this paper 2 3 of the total length of the model were selected as the calibration period using the remaining 1 3 as the verification period to enhance model calibration and verification data series were randomly divided into two groups with data of 1967 1992 and 1993 2005 as group i and 1980 2005 and 1967 1979 as group ii used for model calibration and verification respectively several types of statistical measures were employed to evaluate the stability of the calibration model including the pearson s correlation coefficient r the explained variance r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nse is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise as compared to the measured data variance information nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus estimated data fits the 1 1 line mccuen et al 2006 the nse was computed as follows 2 nse 1 0 x i x i 2 x i x v 2 where x i and x i represent the actual and estimated data in year i of the verification period respectively and x v represents the mean of the actual data in the verification period nse has a theoretical range of to 1 when the nse exceed zero the calibration model is more suitable than the mean of the instrumental data from the calibration or verification period respectively 2 4 calibration of the reconstruction model corresponding to the regression equation 1 the regression model has nine parameters one constant term and eight regression coefficients that belonging to different tree ring data the study used data of 1967 1992 group i and 1980 2005 group ii to calibrate the parameters of the reconstruction model two sets of model parameters listed in table 3 were input into the regression model to reconstruct two sets of runoff values respectively among them the correlation coefficient between the reconstructed and observed values of period 1967 1992 group i is 0 752 n 26 p value 0 001 fig 4 the r2 explained 56 6 of the recorded annual runoff variance the correlation coefficient between the reconstructed and observed values of period 1980 2005 group ii is 0 743 n 26 p value 0 001 fig 4 the r2 explained 55 2 of the recorded annual runoff variance the average of the parameters of both groups are the final parameters of the model table 3 2 5 verification of the reconstruction model corresponding to the calibration period of two groups the study used data of 1993 2005 group i and 1967 1979 group ii respectively to verify the reconstruction model runoff reconstruction was conducted for the validation period using two groups of parameters corresponding to the calibration periods respectively the correlation coefficients between reconstructed and observed values were 0 451 group i n 13 p value 0 001 and 0 503 group ii n 13 p value 0 001 fig 4 as shown in table 4 the values of the most rigorous tests of model validation nse are positive positive nse values suggest a robust verification since the nse is generally considered a particularly rigorous indicator of model validity mccuen et al 2006 as shown in fig 5 the reconstructed value of annual runoff of both groups with different calibration and verification periods show some agreement with the observed values the calibration verification tests performed reasonably well at capturing the actual annual runoff which confirms the reliability of the regression model table 5 shows the skill statistics of the final reconstruction model 3 results and discussion 3 1 reconstruction of annual runoff the reconstructed upper lancang meikong river annual runoff extended back to 1557 augmenting the instrumental record by over 400 years the runoff reconstruction contains considerable low frequency variability which is only indicated from the very short instrumental runoff record figs 5 and 6 a since the 1990 s the annual runoff of the lancang meikong river has increased with each passing year which may be closely related to the melting of the glaciers of the tibetan plateau during the last 30 years in response to global warming the present annual runoff reconstruction showed several extreme wet and dry years fig 6b we calculated the mean for the period of observed annual runoff to determine the dryness and wetness periods respectively in addition the lower and upper thresholds were determined based on the percentile distribution the 25th and 75th percentiles were considered as extreme wetness and dryness respectively in the reconstruction the extremely wet years had annual runoff levels above the 25 percentile threshold 206 57 108 m3 and the extremely dry years had annual runoff levels below the 75 percentile threshold 173 72 108 m3 fig 6b and table 6 more years had extreme wetness 37 years compared to those with extreme dryness 23 years and the distributions of extremely wet years were more concentrated during 1724 1731 1569 1578 and 1992 2005 eight or more consecutive wet years were found based on the redfit function which is part of schulz s redfit version 3 8e program and estimates the red noise spectra of a time series in dplr while the dplr the dendrochronology program library in r is a package that enables dendrochronologists to handle data processing and analysis in the package of dplr in r spectral analysis was used to assess the oscillatory domains in the lancang mekong river annual runoff reconstruction over the 1557 2005 period the 99 95 and 90 confidence levels of the spectrum were estimated from a red noise first order markov null continuum based on a lag 1 autocorrelation of the time series the results indicate several inter annual inter decadal and centennial time scales in particular the inter decadal variance and century scale low frequency variance are evidently related to the frequent appearance of multifold inter decadal cycles fig 7 the dominant inter annual variation is 2 5 years the inter decadal and corresponding multifold cycles are significant p value 0 05 for the 12 21 and 59 year peaks while 21 years is the significant period of the reconstruction sequence 3 2 multi scale variation analysis of reconstructed annual runoff to fully understand the multi scale variation of annual runoff the empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1998 1999 was used to analyze the reconstruction sequence the emd provides more scientific information and a better basis for understanding the regularity of wet and dry changes in our study area it is a new method that has been proposed by huang et al 1998 to fully analyze and understand a long sequence of multi scale change features the advantage is that the signal components of different scales can be preserved and extracted which aids the understanding of the multi scale change characteristics and the general trend of the target sequence the emd essentially decomposes the fluctuations or trends of different scales frequencies from the original signal according to the natural oscillation of the signal a series of intrinsic mode function imf components with different scales can be obtained and the sum of all components can also be reverted to the original variable sequence in our paper six different imf components of the annual runoff over the past 449 years ce 1557 2005 have been extracted and are shown in fig 8 each imf corresponds to an annual runoff fluctuation of one band reflecting the change of the period and the amplitude of runoff at this scale over time the lowest frequency component the residue imf represents the trend term of the original signal the trend term represents a linear term in the signal or a slowly changing component with a period exceeding the length of the signal data each imf component change law accords with the non linear change characteristic of the natural signal and the fluctuation has a relatively stable quasi period which is called the main period as shown in fig 8 each component shows the distribution and variation of the main period and the amplitude in the time domain of the annual runoff series at different scales respectively however the influence of different scale signals on the overall characteristics of the original data are different the square of the amplitude of each component can reflect the signal strength and energy of the components of the original data the correlation coefficient reflects the influence of each component on the original sequence change characteristics table 7 the main period of the first imf is 2 3 years which is the strongest component of the signal in the original sequence it reflects the main high frequency oscillation of the reconstruction sequence this may be mainly caused by the quasi biennial oscillation qbo gordon et al 2010 naujokat 1986 as shown in fig 8a and the correlation coefficient between the first imf and qbo reached 0 225 p value 0 05 this indicates that the effect of qbo formed by continuous conversion between the eastern and western winds of the equatorial stratosphere for a period of 26 30 months the maximum amplitude appears around the 1650 s corresponding to an extremely wet year 1653 1654 fig 6b during the reconstruction period the minimum amplitude near the 1890 s corresponds to the extremely dry years of 1873 1883 and 1886 fig 6b the second imf represents the 5 8 years fluctuation of the main cycle which is mainly associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso li et al 2011 allan et al 1996 as shown in fig 8b correlation coefficients of both reached 0 107 p value 0 0236 it can be seen that the first and second imf mainly reflect the change characteristics of the interannual scale of the reconstructed sequence the correlation of the first and second imf with the original sequence are higher and the amplitude are larger than other components these are the main components of the reconstructed sequence that reflect the changing characteristics the third imf showed a 10 13 year scale fluctuation which is very similar r 0 0873 p value 0 0864 to the solar activity of an 11 year cycle the sun s spectral irradiance ssi muscheler et al 2007 lean 2000 however over time this scale cycle and amplitude show multiple jumps fig 8c during the reconstruction period of 1590 1640 corresponding to the extremely dry period of the reconstructed series both amplitude and signal decrease significantly the amplitude and signal intensity of the 17th century dry period 1660 1720 decrease rapidly during the reconstruction period in the late 19th century to the early 20th century amplitude and frequency decreased first and then increased which also corresponds to the dry period to obtain more reliable information on climate consistency we compared the third imf with the interdecadal component of the reconstructed may september precipitation field for the whole of china over the past 500 years icp fig 8c shi et al 2017 both showed a significant negative correlation r 0 1091 p value 0 0215 the results indicated that the runoff has a certain delayed response to precipitation in this area which may be mainly related to the runoff by snowmelt replenishment the fourth imf mainly represents the 21 64 years multidecadal oscillation of our reconstructed runoff the fourth imf was compared to the multidecadal component of the reconstructed may september precipitation field in western china over the past 500 years mcp shi et al 2017 these two showed a significant positive correlation r 0 3505 p value 0 0001 the drought flood changes in the fourth imf and mcp are generally consistent over the multidecadal timescale in fig 8d the fifth imf shows the probable stability oscillation of the century scale of runoff and the correlation between the fifth imf and reconstruction sequence is significant r 0 138 p value 0 01 it is worth noting that the four wave peaks correspond to the extreme wet years of the reconstructed sequence 1560 1580 1720 1860 and 1990 the strongest trough 1630 s corresponds to the extremely dry year of the reconstructed sequence the fifth imf was compared to the centennial component of the reconstructed may september precipitation field in western china over the past 500 years ccp shi et al 2017 yang et al 2014 tan et al 2008 the correlation coefficient of the centennial component of runoff and precipitation during the interval ce 1557 2005 is 0 7712 p value 0 0001 both centennial components describe a wet climate during the 16th century and a drought during the 17th century a mega drought period ce 1590 s 1720 s during the little ice age has also been reported in previous studies e g griggset al 2017 staggeet al 2017 cook et al 2010 stuiver et al 1998 this reflects a wet dry wet low frequency fluctuation component in this region over the past 500 years as can be seen from fig 8d and e the periodic and amplitude of the reconstructed series are very consistent with the reconstructed may september precipitation shi et al 2017 in the same time domain the results indicate that the trend of our reconstructed runoff is more credible in multidecadal scale and centennial scale the results have reference value for research on the relationship between flow prediction and the rainfall runoff in the interannual and centennial scale of the watershed the residue imf is the remainder of our sequence from high frequency to low frequency which reflects the long term variation trend of the runoff sequence over the past 449 years fig 8f the long term trend can be broadly divided into two stages a drying trend was found during the first phase before the late 18th century and then the conditions became wetter until now these findings are consistent with previous studies e g yang et al 2014 tan et al 2008 the correlation between the residue imf and the original sequence decreased significantly and the correlation coefficient is lower than 0 1272 p value 0 01 table 7 moreover the amplitude decreased which partly reflected the century scale fluctuation characteristics of the reconstructed sequence however the signal was weak these results indicate that tree ring chronology could be a suitable approach for runoff reconstruction even in alpine regions with sensitive climate impacts 4 conclusion in this study we obtained and analyzed eight tree ring chronologies of the upper mekong river basin for the past 449 years prior to the reconstruction we analyzed the correlation between the annual runoff and the sample trees for the period 1967 2005 the results show that the eight tree ring chronologies all significantly correlate with the annual runoff data from the jiuzhou hydrology station the average value for the correlation coefficients between the eight tree ring chronologies and the annual runoff is 0 69 p 0 001 with the highest value r 0 82 p 0 001 for chn025 and the lowest value r 0 52 p 0 001 for chn065 the annual runoff for the period of 1557 to 2005 was reconstructed based on these eight tree ring chronologies the standard error was 27 71 108 m3 and the relative standard error was 13 85 the reconstruction results indicate that 22 years is the significant period of the reconstruction sequence an apparent prolonged relative drought occurred from the 1580 s to the 1720 s in this region subsequently the hydrological conditions remained relatively stable from the early 18th century and there was a significant wetting trend during the last 30 years there were 37 extremely wet years and 23 extremely dry years exceeding the mean 1 standard deviation during the past 449 years the emd was used to fully analyze and understand the multi scale variation of the reconstructed runoff six imf components with different scales were obtained the first and second imf mainly reflect the change characteristics of the interannual scale of the reconstructed sequence they are likely controlled by the qbo and the enso respectively the third imf showed a 10 13 year scale fluctuation which is very similar to the solar activity of an 11 year cycle the fourth and fifth imf mainly represents the multidecadal and centennial oscillation which have showed coherent variations with previously reconstructed may september precipitation in the same time domain the lowest frequency component the residue imf represents the trend term of the

6789,in this study with the use of a multiple linear regression approach the tree ring chronologies of eight sampling sites in the upper lancang mekong river basin were developed to provide a 449 year ce 1557 2005 reconstruction of the annual runoff thus placing recent changes in annual runoff into a long term context these eight tree ring chronologies have recently been archived in publicly available databases through the international tree ring data bank reconstruction results showed a good correlation coefficient of 0 662 n 39 p value 0 01 between the reconstructed and the observed annual runoff the adjusted coefficient r2 for the degrees of freedom is 42 3 which meets the precision requirements of reconstruction the reconstructed runoff displays a trend toward more moist conditions there were 37 extremely wet years and 23 extremely dry years exceeding the mean 1 standard deviation during the past 449 years empirical mode decomposition emd was used to fully analyze and understand the multi scale variation of the reconstructed runoff six intrinsic mode function imf components with different scales were obtained and the sum of all components can be reverted to the

decomposition 1 introduction both the frequency and intensity of flood and drought disasters in southeastern asia have been predicted to increase in future ipcc 2014 the annual runoff variations associated with global warming have recently been documented for many regions of the world treydteet al 2006 touchanet al 2008 wang et al 2017 studies vaidyanathan 2011 bolch et al 2012 have shown that the melting of the himalayan glaciers has a specific impact on the runoff variations of the lancang mekong river water resources from mountainous regions are vital for both natural ecosystems and human activities in adjacent lowlands bogra et al 2014 ferrero et al 2015 approximately 80 million people in southeast asia depend on this river for their livelihood mekong river commission 2010 therefore river flow changes in this part of the region can severely affect downstream flow and water supply availability wang et al 2002 while annual runoff variations are random they exhibit a quasi periodic regularity the variations largely depend on the timescale willems 2006 their statistical characteristics may be significantly different for short vs long time series data in a practical sense for the purpose of understanding the current conditions as well as for predicting the rules of annual runoff variations for the future it is necessary to understand the long term variations of the lancang mekong river runoff prowse et al 2006 however the existing instrument based hydrometric data of most rivers in the world cover only a short period of around 50 60 years this period is far from the goal to analyze the annual runoff response to climate variations at timescales of more than a hundred years therefore it is difficult to place the recently observed variations into a longer term perspective hence an urgent need exists to use various proxy data for the reconstruction of annual runoff to expand the length of the data series high resolution proxy records for centuries that include historical documents zhang et al 1997 qian et al 2003 mudelsee et al 2006 pfister et al 2006 tree ring records meko et al 2001 kang et al 2002 cook et al 2004 liu et al 2017 stalagmite deposits xu 2015 and historical flood level marks brázdil et al 2006 can provide a long term historical context that allows to understand the conditions of hydrological systems consequently they have

tree growth is influenced by the same climatic variables that modulate runoff therefore annual variations in discharge may be reconstructed from tree rings based on the strong relationship between tree growth and river runoff researchers from the us were among the first who studied tree rings chronologies and consequently several scientific research results were achieved in that country in the us tree rings have been widely used to extend or update hydrological records as well as for the reconstruction of annual or seasonal streamflow cook and jacoby 1983 meko and graybill 1995 woodhouse 2000 pederson et al 2001 woodhouse 2001 devineni et al 2013 ferrero et al 2015 in asia the first runoff reconstruction was developed by zhou 1984 who extended the irtysh river runoff records back to 1582 using tree ring chronologies from xinjiang china the observation period in the paper of zhou encompasses ce 1928 1981 the mean of the reconstructed annual runoff in the rivers was 9 163 109 m3 while the measured average annual runoff was 9 872 109 m3 subsequently other scholars conducted extensive research in northwest china but the research area mainly remained concentrated in xinjiang see li et al 2000 and references therein the observation period mainly concentrated on ce 1900 2000 the differences of the reconstructed value and the measured value were about 5 qin et al 2004 used sabina tibetica tree rings from the headwater area of the yangtze river to reconstruct the runoff back to ce 1485 the observation period in qin s paper is ce 1957 2001 the mean of the reconstructed annual runoff in the rivers was 1 461 1010 m3 which is more than 5 of the measured average annual runoff gou et al 2007 used juniperus przewalski tree rings from the headwater area of the yellow river to reconstruct the stream flow back to 1409 all of these studies on runoff reconstruction based on tree rings either have shorter reconstruction periods lower elevations in the study area or lack of prominent climate and environment characteristics long term i e hundreds of years hydrological variation reconstructions in cold plateau regions such as the qinghai tibetan plateau are rare due to the paucity of tree ring chronologies and the measured runoff data in these regions consequently the unique geographical location and climatic conditions of the lancang mekong river basin and the increasing water resource problem have led to a more urgent need for this study in the basin to improve our understanding of long term variations in runoff in cold plateau regions especially for the southeastern qinghai tibetan plateau we designed a runoff reconstruction scenario that was based on eight tree ring chronologies from the headwaters of the lancang mekong river to guarantee the reliability of the reconstructed annual runoff a multiple linear regression reconstruction model was calibrated and validated using observed runoff data of 1967 2005 furthermore the reconstructed annual runoff was verified and compared to other precipitation and drought reconstruction results of the southeastern qinghai tibetan plateau based on proxy data such as tree ring or stalagmite the purpose of this study is to enlarge runoff time series for water resources research with sufficient representativeness in the complex area of the alpine region and to provide a theoretical basis for trend forecasts of the water resource development in the lancang mekong river basin 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the sampling sites of this study are located in the upper lancang mekong river basin which is a transboundary basin that covers many countries in southeastern asia the lancang mekong river originates from the qinghai tibetan plateau and the altitude of the river source is 5500 m the studied river has a length of 2161 km covers 190 000 km2 liu et al 2009 wang et al 2018 and is allocated within the range of 93 51 101 50 e and 21 30 33 49 n fig 1 the lancang mekong river basin is shaped like a ribbon running from north to south and the average width of the basin is 80 km after flowing out of the qinghai tibetan plateau the river flows through alpine valley areas where the mountain peaks are more than 3000 m above mean sea level the actual runoff data used in this paper stems from the jiuzhou hydrology station 25 78 n 99 28e fig 1 which is a controlled site of the upper lancang mekong river basin the average annual runoff was 201 108 m3 or 106 mm during 1967 2005 the mean annual precipitation ce 1967 2005 of three meteorological stations in this region is 578 mm

is consistent nikolopoulos et al 2015 braud et al 2016 to ensure that the results of the study are representative the eight sampling sites are distributed at different altitudes slopes and orientations in the upper lancang mekong river basin fig 2 2 2 tree ring chronologies and its correlation with annual runoff with the purpose of identifying long timescale climate runoff signals eight

series and percent problem segments are the correlation statistics program cofecha output crossdating quality analysis of the tree ring width measurements from the international tree ring data bank grissino mayer 2001 fritts 1976 holmes 1983 series intercorrelation is a measure of the strength of the signal typically the climate signal common to all sampled trees at the site the highest values are around 0 900 for very drought sensitive conifers and the lowest values for trees that can still be reliably cross dated are around 0 400 higher values of series intercorrelation are generally more desirable however trees of some species and in some regions will have higher values than others series intercorrelation is an important consideration in assessing chronology quality mean sensitivity is a measure of the relative change in ring width from one year to the next in a given series trees with stronger common signals tend to be more sensitive average mean sensitivity varies among species and regional climates from around 0 650 for very drought sensitive conifers to 0 150 for the most complacent trees it is a good measure of the relative ease of cross dating a higher number of series is always more desirable since it increases the robustness of the common signal usually few series span the entire chronology so at any point the sample length is usually less than the number of dated series most chronologies have between 15 and 60 series but some have well over 100 percent problem segments are the number of problem segments as a percentage of the total number of 50 year segments which were flagged by cofecha a problem segment does not necessarily reflect a dating error it can be caused by periods in which a tree is less responsive to the common often climatic signal or by growth anomalies to verify the correlation between the annual runoff and the tree ring data we used the actual annual runoff data from the jiuzhou hydrology station and the eight tree ring chronologies from 1967 to 2005 for analysis with the aim to provide a theoretical basis for runoff reconstruction the correlation coefficients table 2 indicate that the cross correlation of the eight tree ring chronologies and the correlations between the chronologies and the annual runoff data are positive the average autocorrelation coefficient of the eight tree ring chronologies is 0 544 p value 0 01 the two sampling sites with the highest correlations are chn025 and chn028 r 0 77 p value 0 001 furthermore the sampling sites of chn047 and chn065 r 0 25 have the lowest correlation in addition the first column of table 2 and fig 3 show that the eight tree ring chronologies during the period of 1967 2005 are all significantly correlated to the annual runoff data from the jiuzhou hydrology station the average correlation coefficient between the eight tree ring chronologies and the annual runoff is 0 69 p value 0 001 the highest correlation coefficient r 0 82 p value 0 001 was observed at chn025 and the lowest coefficient r 0 52 p value 0 001 was observed at chn065 we observe that correlation of dendrochronologies with runoff is higher than the cross correlation between dendrochronologies indicating that a common climatic forcing but also other local highly variable factors influence tree growth therefore we assume that the eight tree ring chronologies are suitable for the reconstruction of annual runoff 2 3 model development based on the relationship existing between sampling trees and runoff of this region we used the annual runoff data for the period of 1967 2005 and the eight tree ring chronologies of the corresponding years to conduct a multiple regression analysis to establish a runoff reconstruction model the 449 year annual runoff time series is reconstructed through multiple regression between the sampled eight tree ring chronologies and the recorded annual runoff using the following reconstruction equation 1 y t a 0 i 1 k a i x t i where y t represents the estimated annual runoff in year t k represents the number of predictors in the model a 0 a 1 a k represent the estimated regression constant and coefficients and x t i represents the ith predictor the residual chronology in year t meko and graybill 1995 the total length of the modeling data period is 39 years in this paper 2 3 of the total length of the model were selected as the calibration period using the remaining 1 3 as the verification period to enhance model calibration and verification data series were randomly divided into two groups with data of 1967 1992 and 1993 2005 as group i and 1980 2005 and 1967 1979 as group ii used for model calibration and verification respectively several types of statistical measures were employed to evaluate the stability of the calibration model including the pearson s correlation coefficient r the explained variance r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nse is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise as compared to the measured data variance information nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus estimated data fits the 1 1 line mccuen et al 2006 the nse was computed as follows 2 nse 1 0 x i x i 2 x i x v 2 where x i and x i represent the actual and estimated data in year i of the verification period respectively and x v represents the mean of the actual data in the verification period nse has a theoretical range of to 1 when the nse exceed zero the calibration model is more suitable than the mean of the instrumental data from the calibration or verification period respectively 2 4 calibration of the reconstruction model corresponding to the regression equation 1 the regression model has nine parameters one constant term and eight regression coefficients that belonging to different tree ring data the study used data of 1967 1992 group i and 1980 2005 group ii to calibrate the parameters of the reconstruction model two sets of model parameters listed in table 3 were input into the regression model to reconstruct two sets of runoff values respectively among them the correlation coefficient between the reconstructed and observed values of period 1967 1992 group i is 0 752 n 26 p value 0 001 fig 4 the r2 explained 56 6 of the recorded annual runoff variance the correlation coefficient between the reconstructed and observed values of period 1980 2005 group ii is 0 743 n 26 p value 0 001 fig 4 the r2 explained 55 2 of the recorded annual runoff variance the average of the parameters of both groups are the final parameters of the model table 3 2 5 verification of the reconstruction model corresponding to the calibration period of two groups the study used data of 1993 2005 group i and 1967 1979 group ii respectively to verify the reconstruction model runoff reconstruction was conducted for the validation period using two groups of parameters corresponding to the calibration periods respectively the correlation coefficients between reconstructed and observed values were 0 451 group i n 13 p value 0 001 and 0 503 group ii n 13 p value 0 001 fig 4 as shown in table 4 the values of the most rigorous tests of model validation nse are positive positive nse values suggest a robust verification since the nse is generally considered a particularly rigorous indicator of model validity mccuen et al 2006 as shown in fig 5 the reconstructed value of annual runoff of both groups with different calibration and verification periods show some agreement with the observed values the calibration verification tests performed reasonably well at capturing the actual annual runoff which confirms the reliability of the regression model table 5 shows the skill statistics of the final reconstruction model 3 results and discussion 3 1 reconstruction of annual runoff the reconstructed upper lancang meikong river annual runoff extended back to 1557 augmenting the instrumental record by over 400 years the runoff reconstruction contains considerable low frequency variability which is only indicated from the very short instrumental runoff record figs 5 and 6 a since the 1990 s the annual runoff of the lancang meikong river has increased with each passing year which may be closely related to the melting of the glaciers of the tibetan plateau during the last 30 years in response to global warming the present annual runoff reconstruction showed several extreme wet and dry years fig 6b we calculated the mean for the period of observed annual runoff to determine the dryness and wetness periods respectively in addition the lower and upper thresholds were determined based on the percentile distribution the 25th and 75th percentiles were considered as extreme wetness and dryness respectively in the reconstruction the extremely wet years had annual runoff levels above the 25 percentile threshold 206 57 108 m3 and the extremely dry years had annual runoff levels below the 75 percentile threshold 173 72 108 m3 fig 6b and table 6 more years had extreme wetness 37 years compared to those with extreme dryness 23 years and the distributions of extremely wet years were more concentrated during 1724 1731 1569 1578 and 1992 2005 eight or more consecutive wet years were found based on the redfit function which is part of schulz s redfit version 3 8e program and estimates the red noise spectra of a time series in dplr while the dplr the dendrochronology program library in r is a package that enables dendrochronologists to handle data processing and analysis in the package of dplr in r spectral analysis was used to assess the oscillatory domains in the lancang mekong river annual runoff reconstruction over the 1557 2005 period the 99 95 and 90 confidence levels of the spectrum were estimated from a red noise first order markov null continuum based on a lag 1 autocorrelation of the time series the results indicate several inter annual inter decadal and centennial time scales in particular the inter decadal variance and century scale low frequency variance are evidently related to the frequent appearance of multifold inter decadal cycles fig 7 the dominant inter annual variation is 2 5 years the inter decadal and corresponding multifold cycles are significant p value 0 05 for the 12 21 and 59 year peaks while 21 years is the significant period of the reconstruction sequence 3 2 multi scale variation analysis of reconstructed annual runoff to fully understand the multi scale variation of annual runoff the empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1998 1999 was used to analyze the reconstruction sequence the emd provides more scientific information and a better basis for understanding the regularity of wet and dry changes in our study area it is a new method that has been proposed by huang et al 1998 to fully analyze and understand a long sequence of multi scale change features the advantage is that the signal components of different scales can be preserved and extracted which aids the understanding of the multi scale change characteristics and the general trend of the target sequence the emd essentially decomposes the fluctuations or trends of different scales frequencies from the original signal according to the natural oscillation of the signal a series of intrinsic mode function imf components with different scales can be obtained and the sum of all components can also be reverted to the original variable sequence in our paper six different imf components of the annual runoff over the past 449 years ce 1557 2005 have been extracted and are shown in fig 8 each imf corresponds to an annual runoff fluctuation of one band reflecting the change of the period and the amplitude of runoff at this scale over time the lowest frequency component the residue imf represents the trend term of the original signal the trend term represents a linear term in the signal or a slowly changing component with a period exceeding the length of the signal data each imf component change law accords with the non linear change characteristic of the natural signal and the fluctuation has a relatively stable quasi period which is called the main period as shown in fig 8 each component shows the distribution and variation of the main period and the amplitude in the time domain of the annual runoff series at different scales respectively however the influence of different scale signals on the overall characteristics of the original data are different the square of the amplitude of each component can reflect the signal strength and energy of the components of the original data the correlation coefficient reflects the influence of each component on the original sequence change characteristics table 7 the main period of the first imf is 2 3 years which is the strongest component of the signal in the original sequence it reflects the main high frequency oscillation of the reconstruction sequence this may be mainly caused by the quasi biennial oscillation qbo gordon et al 2010 naujokat 1986 as shown in fig 8a and the correlation coefficient between the first imf and qbo reached 0 225 p value 0 05 this indicates that the effect of qbo formed by continuous conversion between the eastern and western winds of the equatorial stratosphere for a period of 26 30 months the maximum amplitude appears around the 1650 s corresponding to an extremely wet year 1653 1654 fig 6b during the reconstruction period the minimum amplitude near the 1890 s corresponds to the extremely dry years of 1873 1883 and 1886 fig 6b the second imf represents the 5 8 years fluctuation of the main cycle which is mainly associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso li et al 2011 allan et al 1996 as shown in fig 8b correlation coefficients of both reached 0 107 p value 0 0236 it can be seen that the first and second imf mainly reflect the change characteristics of the interannual scale of the reconstructed sequence the correlation of the first and second imf with the original sequence are higher and the amplitude are larger than other components these are the main components of the reconstructed sequence that reflect the changing characteristics the third imf showed a 10 13 year scale fluctuation which is very similar r 0 0873 p value 0 0864 to the solar activity of an 11 year cycle the sun s spectral irradiance ssi muscheler et al 2007 lean 2000 however over time this scale cycle and amplitude show multiple jumps fig 8c during the reconstruction period of 1590 1640 corresponding to the extremely dry period of the reconstructed series both amplitude and signal decrease significantly the amplitude and signal intensity of the 17th century dry period 1660 1720 decrease rapidly during the reconstruction period in the late 19th century to the early 20th century amplitude and frequency decreased first and then increased which also corresponds to the dry period to obtain more reliable information on climate consistency we compared the third imf with the interdecadal component of the reconstructed may september precipitation field for the whole of china over the past 500 years icp fig 8c shi et al 2017 both showed a significant negative correlation r 0 1091 p value 0 0215 the results indicated that the runoff has a certain delayed response to precipitation in this area which may be mainly related to the runoff by snowmelt replenishment the fourth imf mainly represents the 21 64 years multidecadal oscillation of our reconstructed runoff the fourth imf was compared to the multidecadal component of the reconstructed may september precipitation field in western china over the past 500 years mcp shi et al 2017 these two showed a significant positive correlation r 0 3505 p value 0 0001 the drought flood changes in the fourth imf and mcp are generally consistent over the multidecadal timescale in fig 8d the fifth imf shows the probable stability oscillation of the century scale of runoff and the correlation between the fifth imf and reconstruction sequence is significant r 0 138 p value 0 01 it is worth noting that the four wave peaks correspond to the extreme wet years of the reconstructed sequence 1560 1580 1720 1860 and 1990 the strongest trough 1630 s corresponds to the extremely dry year of the reconstructed sequence the fifth imf was compared to the centennial component of the reconstructed may september precipitation field in western china over the past 500 years ccp shi et al 2017 yang et al 2014 tan et al 2008 the correlation coefficient of the centennial component of runoff and precipitation during the interval ce 1557 2005 is 0 7712 p value 0 0001 both centennial components describe a wet climate during the 16th century and a drought during the 17th century a mega drought period ce 1590 s 1720 s during the little ice age has also been reported in previous studies e g griggset al 2017 staggeet al 2017 cook et al 2010 stuiver et al 1998 this reflects a wet dry wet low frequency fluctuation component in this region over the past 500 years as can be seen from fig 8d and e the periodic and amplitude of the reconstructed series are very consistent with the reconstructed may september precipitation shi et al 2017 in the same time domain the results indicate that the trend of our reconstructed runoff is more credible in multidecadal scale and centennial scale the results have reference value for research on the relationship between flow prediction and the rainfall runoff in the interannual and centennial scale of the watershed the residue imf is the remainder of our sequence from high frequency to low frequency which reflects the long term variation trend of the runoff sequence over the past 449 years fig 8f the long term trend can be broadly divided into two stages a drying trend was found during the first phase before the late 18th century and then the conditions became wetter until now these findings are consistent with previous studies e g yang et al 2014 tan et al 2008 the correlation between the residue imf and the original sequence decreased significantly and the correlation coefficient is lower than 0 1272 p value 0 01 table 7 moreover the amplitude decreased which partly reflected the century scale fluctuation characteristics of the reconstructed sequence however the signal was weak these results indicate that tree ring chronology could be a suitable approach for runoff reconstruction even in alpine regions with sensitive climate impacts 4 conclusion in this study we obtained and analyzed eight tree ring chronologies of the upper mekong river basin for the past 449 years prior to the reconstruction we analyzed the correlation between the annual runoff and the sample trees for the period 1967 2005 the results show that the eight tree ring chronologies all significantly correlate with the annual runoff data from the jiuzhou hydrology station the average value for the correlation coefficients between the eight tree ring chronologies and the annual runoff is 0 69 p 0 001 with the highest value r 0 82 p 0 001 for chn025 and the lowest value r 0 52 p 0 001 for chn065 the annual runoff for the period of 1557 to 2005 was reconstructed based on these eight tree ring chronologies the standard error was 27 71 108 m3 and the relative standard error was 13 85 the reconstruction results indicate that 22 years is the significant period of the reconstruction sequence an apparent prolonged relative drought occurred from the 1580 s to the 1720 s in this region subsequently the hydrological conditions remained relatively stable from the early 18th century and there was a significant wetting trend during the last 30 years there were 37 extremely wet years and 23 extremely dry years exceeding the mean 1 standard deviation during the past 449 years the emd was used to fully analyze and understand the multi scale variation of the reconstructed runoff six imf components with different scales were obtained the first and second imf mainly reflect the change characteristics of the interannual scale of the reconstructed sequence they are likely controlled by the qbo and the enso respectively the third imf showed a 10 13 year scale fluctuation which is very similar to the solar activity of an 11 year cycle the fourth and fifth imf mainly represents the multidecadal and centennial oscillation which have showed coherent variations with previously reconstructed may september precipitation in the same time domain the lowest frequency component the residue imf represents the trend term of the
