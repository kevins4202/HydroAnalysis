israel 1 these authors contributed equally to this work sars cov 2 variants of concern demonstrating higher infection rate and lower vaccine effectiveness as compared with the original virus are important factors propelling the ongoing covid 19 global outbreak therefore prompt identification of these variants in the environment is essential for pandemic assessment and containment efforts one well established tool for such viral monitoring is the use of wastewater systems here we describe continuous monitoring of traces of sars cov 2 viruses in the municipal wastewater of a large city in israel by observing morbidity fluctuations during three main covid 19 surges occurring in parallel with pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine vaccination rate compromised immunity was revealed in the current morbidity peak rt qpcr assays for the original d614g alpha and beta variants had been previously developed and are being employed for wastewater surveillance in the present study we developed a sensitive rt qpcr assay designed for the rapid direct detection of gamma and delta variants of concern sensitive quantification and detection of the various variants showed the prevalence of the original variant during the first morbidity peak the dominance of the alpha variant over the original variant correlated with the second morbidity peak these variants decreased concurrently with an increase in vaccinations feb march 2021 and the observed decrease in morbidity the appearance and subsequent rise of the delta variant became evident and corresponded to the third morbidity peak june august 2021 these results suggest a high vaccine neutralization efficiency towards the alpha variant compared to its neutralization efficiency towards the delta variant moreover the third vaccination dose booster seems to regain neutralization efficiency towards the delta variant the developed assays and wastewater based epidemiology are important tools aiding in morbidity surveillance and disclosing vaccination efforts and immunity dynamics in the community graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 variants of concern reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction vaccination wastewater based epidemiological covid 19 1 introduction since declaring covid 19 a world pandemic in march 2020 the disease continues to evolve and affect significant portions of the world population increasing circulation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 virus within the world population results in a continual natural processes of random mutations and evolution harvey et al 2021 in some cases a mutation will provide the virus an evolutionary advantage and create a new viral lineage that will overpower previous forms first evidence for such an evolutionary event for the sars cov 2 virus occurred in april 2020 when the d614g substitution enhanced infectivity and transmission the d614g mutation lineage became the dominant sars cov 2 variant form hou et al 2021 korber et al 2020 by late 2020 the term variants of concern emerged with regards to the high numbered mutations in a single variant and its increased pathogenicity davies et al 2021 variants of concern are mainly characterized through mutations in their spike protein gene s gene such mutations affect the receptor biding domain affinity thomson et al 2021 and antibody neutralization efficiency weisblum et al 2020 antibody neutralization efficiency is lower when antibodies generated by vaccination or by prior infection are less compatible to the new variants previous studies found that the alpha variant b 1 1 7 associated with receptor binding motif replacements does not significantly reduce the neutralizing antibodies capability despite its increased infectivity compared to the original strain meng et al 2021 mutations in the beta b 1 351 gamma p 1 and delta b 1 617 variants proved to be less susceptible to antibody neutralization mlcochova et al 2021 planas et al 2021 wibmer et al 2021 high transmission rates and lower vaccine efficacy towards these variants bernal et al 2021 hoffmann et al 2021 z wang et al 2021 resulted in a greater threat of infectivity and morbidity compared to the original sars cov 2 virus therefore quick detection and quantification of variants of concern are vital for initiating response and for proper policy making for pandemic containment currently sars cov 2 variant detection mainly relies on costly next generation sequencing where results are obtained within 3 5 days at best andrés et al 2020 khan et al 2020 with new variants of interest constantly emerging sequencing based approaches are important for their initial identification however they present difficulties considering the need for special instruments and resources including data analysis skills thus to ease detection a reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr based assay can provide rapid results for detection of known variants of concern such an assay can help assess a variant s frequency within a population and contribute to policy guidelines indeed a number of publications targeting variants of concern detection using rt qpcr barreto et al 2020 bivins et al 2021 gand et al 2021 vega magaña et al 2021 vogels et al 2021 wang et al 2021b yaniv et al 2021 as well as available commercial kits e g taqpath thermoscientific gt molecular perkinelmer have emerged for individual assessments population morbidity monitoring through wastewater or wastewater based epidemiology is well described and is considered an important method martin et al 2020 its advantage is that it can provide critical information regarding the spread of pathogens in the population in a given area without relying on individual testing tendencies or testing capacity since the beginning of the pandemic the sars cov 2 virus has been monitored in wastewater around the world ahmed et al 2020 bar or et al 2020 claro et al 2021 la rosa et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 trottier et al 2020 westhaus et al 2021 wu et al 2021 2020 despite this in order to detect specific sars cov 2 variants such as the gamma and delta variants of concern there is a need for a direct and sensitive probe based rt qpcr assay with detection ability in wastewater samples such a quick and accurate method could thus help generate better health policies in a given region in this study we monitored sars cov 2 traces in the wastewater of beer sheva israel s 4th largest city with population of approximately 220 000 beer sheva city is considered a high vaccination area with fluctuating morbidity and was therefore chosen as a model we developed a novel sensitive rt qpcr assay design for the direct detection of gamma and delta variants of concern the new assay was later employed for wastewater based epidemiology together with the rt qpcr assays developed previously by our group for quantification of the various variants of sars cov 2 these results were then compared to morbidity levels in the population allowing us to speculate the immunity level in the city population 2 methodology 2 1 primers and probes the original sequence of sars cov 2 nc 045512 2 was taken from ncbi database gamma variant p 1 brazilian epi isl 981 709 and delta variant b 1 617 indian epi isl 1 704 637 sequences were taken from gisaid database shu and mccauley 2017 all primers and probe used in this study are listed in table s1 for the gamma variant the newly probe design focused on the end of orf8 and the beginning of n

procedure was executed according to zymo environmental water rna zymo research r2042 manufacture protocol including their viral enrichment protocol for 5 ml sample volume for internal control we added 104 or 105 copies ms2 phage to the lysis buffer in each rna extraction rna was eluted with 50 μl of rnase free water the fresh wastewater samples were kept at 4 c until processed rna samples were kept at 80 c in the case of not detected result after rt qpcr the wastewater sample was concentrated using mce electronegative membrane as described before bar or et al 2021 with minor change 45 ml of wastewater was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min and the supernatant was collected into separate 50 ml tube containing 1 g of mgcl2 the mixture was gently shaken for 5 min and was then split into a duplicate 20 ml each every 20 ml were vacuum pumped through 0 45 μm 47 mm diameter electronegative mce membrane merck millipore ltd the membrane was immediately transferred into a petri dish

rna sample dreier et al 2005 ms2 addition was meant for inhibitors assessment through calculated recovery percentage appear in table s4 values were calculated using fig s1 ct value initially converted to rna copies per μl in the rna sample based on the standard curves as described in the next section duplicate were averaged for each target gene separately the gene copies per l of wastewater sample were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 for raw or concentrated sample respectively 2 5 calibration curves and limit of detection determination calibration curves were performed on a known positive double strands dna template three different templates were used and full sequences are reported in table s3 1 gblocks gene fragments double stranded dna fragments from idt technologies containing sars cov 2 s gene sequence as reported for wuhan hu 1 nc 045512 2 2 puc gw kan plasmid from genewiz cloned with the end of orf8 until the beginning of n gene matching the reported 4 nucleotides insertion of the gamma variant 3 gblocks gene fragments double stranded dna fragments from idt technologies containing s gene sequence matching the reported 157 158 deletion of the delta variant calibration of p 1 probe was performed using the second gene block while calibration of s 157 probe was performed with the third gene block negative control for the p 1 probe was performed using wastewater samples confirmed as positive for the original variant or alpha variant of concern and negative control for the s 157 probe was performed using the first gene block serial dilutions for the relevant gene block were prepared based on copy number calculations at an initial concentration of 106 copies per µl down to 10 copies per µl the resulting ct values were plotted against the log copy number of the gene block template each concentration was examined by six repetitions and a standard deviation was calculated the lowest concentration tested i e 10 copies per µl was verified for at least 10 times to ensure more than 95 success in positive detection linear regression was performed between the log copy number and the ct values from the rt qpcr results in addition the coefficient of variants between replicates was 3 35 for gamma assay and 2 94 for the delta assay 2 6 complex matrix detection wastewater matrix consist of various pcr inhibitors that are likely to affect the assay performance therefore there was a need to assess the primers probe detection abilities in an environment as complex as that in order to validate the rt qpcr designed assay s sensitivity in a wastewater matrix rna extracted from pre determined negative wastewater sample for sars cov 2 was examined using standard cdc s detection sets centers for disease control and prevention 2019 the negative rna sample was supplemented with known concentrations of a desired gene block to reach 10 101 and 102 copies per µl all experiments were executed with a pre determined negative matrix for additional verification of the sample as negative eight repetitions were performed for each viral concentration or control ct results were plotted to represent the new probes limit of detection in a complex environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater based epidemiology immunity trends throughout the covid 19 outbreak we monitored wastewater samples from beer sheva city and several other locations in israel for the presence of sars cov 2 virus using rt qpcr considering that the different sars cov 2 variants share very high similarity in their n gene we employed n gene detection in prospect of general detection of all the sars cov 2 rna traces in the wastewater using a cdc s standard detection set cdc s n2 and our previously published designed primers probe set yaniv et al 2021 improved n3 we documented the sars cov 2 rna levels in wastewater and monitored these values together with the corresponding reported active cases and percent vaccination in the city populations fig 1 looking at fig 1 it is evident that an increase in detected sars cov 2 rna levels in the city wastewater appeared just prior to every one of the three peaks in reported active cases thus the appearance in the city s wastewater foresaw the increase in reported clinical cases of covid 19 this result was unsurprising as it is supported by other studies showing that the use of wastewater based epidemiology is an effective tool for population morbidity monitoring ahmed et al 2020 bar or et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 trottier et al 2020 westhaus et al 2021 wu et al 2020 we then wanted to ascertain if the effects of massive vaccinations could also be assessed using wastewater epidemiology in december 2020 israel began vaccinating its population with the pfizer biontech bnt162b2 covid 19 vaccine with a two dose three weeks interval regimen individuals were considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the second dose in accordance with the clinical trial data polack et al 2020 concurrently to the beginning of the vaccination efforts a meaningful morbidity peak was apparent fig 1 with values of 55 to 71 sars cov 2 active cases per 10 k people subsequently when over 50 of the population was vaccinated a steady and consistent decrease appeared in the level of sars cov 2 rna detected in wastewater and in the concurrent reported active cases per 10 k people in the population the declines in sars cov 2 rna levels in wastewater reached the lowest values by the end of may 2021 fig 1 when reported active cases decreased below 10 diagnosed patients per 10 k of the population at this time rna levels in wastewater decreased below detectable concentrations resulted in not detected value one month later by the end of june 2021 sars cov 2 rna levels in wastewater reappeared this was followed by an increase in reported active cases 2 3 weeks later fig 1 another analysis zooming on the appearance of the third morbidity peak was done for observing new sars cov 2 verified cases alongside our wastewater n gene rna detection fig s2 wastewater n gene detection was not visible at a rate of lower than two new cases per day in the city and remained undetected in five measurements between june 1 17 on june 22 the first positive wastewater result was obtained while notedly a meaningful increase in cases was seen only a week later this reappearance of increased morbidity continues throughout september 2021 despite vaccination percentages second dose of nearly 70 of the city s population previously we reported the emergence of the alpha variant of concern b 1 1 7 in israel by the end of january 2021 using rt qpcr assay we developed yaniv et al 2021 soon after appearance the alpha variant dominated the original variant to such an extent that within one month all sars cov 2 rna traces in wastewater corresponded solely to the alpha variant moreover the observed decline in morbidity suggest the effectiveness of the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine against the alpha variant meng et al 2021 the reappearance of covid 19 morbidity in june 2021 raised questions regarding the efficiency of the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine is the vaccine less efficient over time or it is compromised due to lack of compatibility to other variants of concerns 3 2 developed rt qpcr assays for gamma p 1 and delta b 1 617 detection previously we developed direct rt qpcr detection assays for the alpha variant b 1 17 british and beta variant b 1 315 south africa yaniv et al 2021 the possibility that the new outbreak is a result of the invasion of a novel variant of concern that differs from the alpha or beta was suggested the most prominent variants of concern to invade israel were the gamma variant p 1 brazilian or the delta variant b 1 617 indian therefore they were the most urgent variants in need for rapid detection we therefore developed direct rt qpcr detection assays for these two variants of concern our design for detection of these two variants is based on the differences in gene sequence from the original sars cov 2 sequence nc 045512 2 the gamma variant contains an insertion in the orf8 region and the delta variant s gene contains a deletion known as δ157 158 accordingly our primers probe sets were designed with a focus on these regions fig 2 a sequences available in table s1 for gamma variant detection the designed forward primer is located at the end of orf8 gene and the reverse primer is located at the beginning of the n gene meaning that 28 227 28 286 bp of the original sequence are included within this range the original sars cov 2 and gamma variant sequences are identical apart from a four nucleotide insertion in the gamma lineage fig 2a using a detection set comprised of two primers meant to amplify the target region a single probe p 1 probe was designed for the detection of the gamma variant only corresponding to the insertion for the detection of the delta variant the designated detection region was chosen from within the s gene focusing on s gene s 21 989 22 083 bp of the original sequence the original sars cov 2 sequence is identical to the delta variant sequence with the exception of a 6 nucleotides deletion in the delta lineage fig 2a using a detection set comprised of two primers meant to amplify the target region a single probe s 157 probe was designed for the area corresponding to the deletions resulting in the detection of the delta variant only to ensure functionality the described sets of primers and probes underwent characterization initially a calibration curve was generated for the two primers probe sets using dsdna as a template a detection range of between 106 copies and 10 copies per µl was tested for each set fig 2b linear regression performed for the two probes demonstrated strong correlation a limit of detection lod could be determined for each primers probe set and was identified as 10 copies per µl for the two sets fig 2b table s2 a lod of 10 copies per µl is equivalent to a lod calculated as 2000 copies per l wastewater in wastewater samples that were extracted directly defined as raw in equation s1 additionally in wastewater samples that were concentrated and then extracted for rna defined as concentrated in equation s2 10 copies per µl lod is equivalent to a calculated lod of 500 copies per l wastewater this indicates highly sensitive detection specificity of the described sets was examined with either dsdna fragments from the original sars cov 2 relevant to the assigned detection regions or using wastewater found positive for the original sars cov 2 and for the alpha variant both sets did not manifest a signal when tested with such negative controls and were therefore found to be highly specific wastewater matrix consists of various pcr inhibitors that are likely to affect the rt qpcr performance therefore there was a need to assess the primers probe detection abilities in such a complex environment hence primer probe sets were further characterized within a more intricate matrix wastewater from a rural area in binyamina israel served as a more complex environment for the rt qpcr assay wastewater samples were pre determined as negative for sars cov 2 using n gene detection after confirming that the wastewater samples were negative relevant dsdna template copies were added exogenously at known concentrations fig 2c these samples were then used for sars cov 2 detection by the examined primers probe sets as can be seen in fig 2c despite the wastewater matrix p 1 and s 157 probes maintained high functionality with a lod of 10 copies per µl proving their sensitivity and stability after fully characterizing the developed primers probe sets revealing their specificity sensitivity and durability we employed them on recently collected wastewater samples until recently the alpha variant was the most dominant in israel however a noticeable decrease in this variant was observed in the past months in may june 2021 clinical reports indicated that the delta variant had reached israel and was responsible for the majority of new morbidity cases taking this into account samples from different locations in the city of modi in were collected on june 23rd 2021 and tested for general sars cov 2 presence using n gene detection as well as for the presence of the alpha and delta variants using relevant s gene detection fig 2d as can be seen in fig 2d all of the tested samples were positive to sars cov 2 through n gene detection however none of the samples resulted in a positive detection for the alpha variant this corresponded to the disappearance of this variant in clinical tests as reported by health officials furthermore all samples except for one resulted in a positive signal for the delta variant using the specific designed primers probe set described above these field results confirmed the new primers probe sets ability to detect the delta variant in a quantitative sensitive manner even within a complex environment this technology thus can provide an assessment for variant of concern s geographical spread in the population a gamma variant primer probe set was also employed on numerous wastewater samples however none resulted in a positive signal as yet considering the importance of wastewater monitoring as well as the possibility of their use in clinical settings these new tools may serve for enhancing sars cov 2 variants of concern detection in a population 3 3 variants of concern detection discloses compromised immunity with the new rt qpcr tool for detection of variants of concern in hand we set out to identify and quantify the various variants of concern in beer sheva s wastewater during the past year fig 3 illustrates the dynamics of the different sars cov 2 variants in beer sheva s wastewater prior work by our group yaniv et al 2021 revealed that until january 2021 the original sars cov 2 was apparently the only version of sars cov 2 in israel and was detected by the s1 primers probe set primers probe set details in the si during january 2021 a shift occurred and the alpha variant detected by sδ69 primers probe set primers probe set details in the si manifested in the wastewater samples within a month quickly taking over the original variant the alpha variant was the only detectable variant in the city s wastewater it is important to note that the s1 detection set was relevant for original sars cov 2 detection until around march 2021 however with the emergence of new variants of concern it could no longer serve as an indication for the original variant as it relied strictly on differences between the original and the alpha variant the high vaccination values allowed the containment of this variant by the end of may and resulted in not detected values until june 24th concurrent to the latest emergence of sars cov 2 at end of june 2021 fig 1 we employed our previously developed detection primer probe sets for the alpha and beta variants of concern yaniv et al 2021 together with the newly developed detection sets for the gamma and delta variants of concern the results from the rt qpcr assays on wastewater samples indicated that the delta variant had arrived in beer sheva city fig 3 by the end of june 2021 none of the other variants of concern manifested a signal during late june july august september and october 2021 apart from the delta variant it is important to note that as in our previous study yaniv et al 2021 the rna detection levels of the s gene in wastewater samples are generally lower than the n gene here as well positive samples for sars cov 2 rna demonstrated detection levels of the s gene lower than the detection levels of the n gene despite the demonstrated sensitivity of used designed sets this was suggested to be related to different gene transcription levels between the n gene and s gene in the sars cov 2 emanuel et al 2021 kim et al 2020 however such a subject requires further research since first being documented in india the delta variant is known to be less responsive to the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine due to s gene mutations mlcochova et al 2021 antibodies generated by the vaccine are apparently less compatible for neutralization of the delta variant in fact the wastewater epidemiology results presented in this study clearly reflects this lower immunity despite high vaccination percentages additionally finding the delta virus strain in wastewater may also reflect that despite vaccination vaccinated people may still be infected and carry the virus while being asymptomatic supporting this notion is the health ministry report in which 50 of the clinically infected people in the current morbidity peak are vaccinated furthermore a decrease in immunity as reflected by an increase in morbidity observed until the end of september could also be a result of decrease in antibodies in vaccinated and recovering people over time despite this our results provide strong evidence for the connection of the presence of the delta variant in wastewater to the observed morbidity and this can serve as a partial explanation regarding the latest morbidity trend in beer sheva with relation to the level of vaccination and immunity in its population nevertheless in an effort to regain population immunity the booster vaccination efforts third dose began in the first week of august 2021 only two months later when over 40 of the population was vaccinated with the third dose a moderated decrease emerged in sars cov 2 rna detection levels in the city s wastewater and a sharp decrease in reported morbidity cases occurred figs 1 and 3 more data is needed to determine the possible effects of the third vaccination dose on the current morbidity peak yet these results emphasize the importance and reliability of this study to use wastewater as an epidemiology tool for early warning and policy decision making in regards to pandemic containment 4 conclusions the study presented here consolidate data gathered on a single model city throughout the past year the targeted research demonstrated how wastewater based epidemiology can serve as a tool for morbidity surveillance within the population given a specific geographical area wastewater monitoring was able to provide early alerts of 2 3 weeks before three observed morbidity peaks during this study s time period combining our sars cov 2 wastewater results with vaccination data raised questions regarding vaccine induced immunity out of three observed morbidity peaks as vaccine percentages increased to above 50 the second peak s infection was lowered despite this the infection reemerged into the third peak a month later regardless of almost 70 vaccine coverage an explanation to these observed results could be found in the exposure of the population to a new variant we aimed to prove that our rt qpcr assessment of sars cov 2 variants for the gamma p 1 and delta b 1 617 can be used as an expansion to the previously published alpha b 1 1 7 and beta b 1 351 variants yaniv et al 2021 probe sets and novel sets may be needed as more variants appear rt qpcr primers probe sets were designed based on sequence differences from the original sars cov 2 and other variants the new sets for gamma and delta variants detection were found specific as well as sensitive with a lod of 10 both in sterile conditions and in sewage matrix employment of the sets on israel s wastewater was positive for the delta variant and negative for the gamma variant corresponding to health officials reports for infections during the third peak having 4 different primers probe sets for detection of the variants of concern 2 of which are presented for the first time here enabled the identification and quantification of the sars cov 2 variants presence the city s wastewater interestingly each observed morbidity peak in this study corresponded to a different sars cov 2 variant indicating the usefulness of this tool the original variant responsible for the first peak the alpha variant responsible for the second peak and the delta variant responsible for the third peak this study also demonstrated that a second dose vaccine percentage of over 50 successfully contained the alpha variant as expected based on published in vitro studies nevertheless a second dose vaccination percentage of almost 70 was not enough to prevent the outbreak and continuous spread of the delta variant in the population in order to regain and maintain vaccine induced immunity for longer period in the population an additional vaccine dose was given this study validates that the booster third dose vaccine rate of over 40 successfully started to reduce the delta variant detection however further monitoring is required to fully elucidate the booster effect within the population overall the tools used in this study can provide valuable information not only regarding morbidity but also regarding vaccine induced immunity in the population credit authorship contribution statement karin yaniv conceptualization writing original draft visualization formal

israel 1 these authors contributed equally to this work sars cov 2 variants of concern demonstrating higher infection rate and lower vaccine effectiveness as compared with the original virus are important factors propelling the ongoing covid 19 global outbreak therefore prompt identification of these variants in the environment is essential for pandemic assessment and containment efforts one well established tool for such viral monitoring is the use of wastewater systems here we describe continuous monitoring of traces of sars cov 2 viruses in the municipal wastewater of a large city in israel by observing morbidity fluctuations during three main covid 19 surges occurring in parallel with pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine vaccination rate compromised immunity was revealed in the current morbidity peak rt qpcr assays for the original d614g alpha and beta variants had been previously developed and are being employed for wastewater surveillance in the present study we developed a sensitive rt qpcr assay designed for the rapid direct detection of gamma and delta variants of concern sensitive quantification and detection of the various variants showed the prevalence of the original variant during the first morbidity peak the dominance of the alpha variant over the original variant correlated with the second morbidity peak these variants decreased concurrently with an increase in vaccinations feb march 2021 and the observed decrease in morbidity the appearance and subsequent rise of the delta variant became evident and corresponded to the third morbidity peak june august 2021 these results suggest a high vaccine neutralization efficiency towards the alpha variant compared to its neutralization efficiency towards the delta variant moreover the third vaccination dose booster seems to regain neutralization efficiency towards the delta variant the developed assays and wastewater based epidemiology are important tools aiding in morbidity surveillance and disclosing vaccination efforts and immunity dynamics in the community graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 variants of concern reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction vaccination wastewater based epidemiological covid 19 1 introduction since declaring covid 19 a world pandemic in march 2020 the disease continues to evolve and affect significant portions of the world population increasing circulation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 virus within the world population results in a continual natural processes of random mutations and evolution harvey et al 2021 in some cases a mutation will provide the virus an evolutionary advantage and create a new viral lineage that will overpower previous forms first evidence for such an evolutionary event for the sars cov 2 virus occurred in april 2020 when the d614g substitution enhanced infectivity and transmission the d614g mutation lineage became the dominant sars cov 2 variant form hou et al 2021 korber et al 2020 by late 2020 the term variants of concern emerged with regards to the high numbered mutations in a single variant and its increased pathogenicity davies et al 2021 variants of concern are mainly characterized through mutations in their spike protein gene s gene such mutations affect the receptor biding domain affinity thomson et al 2021 and antibody neutralization efficiency weisblum et al 2020 antibody neutralization efficiency is lower when antibodies generated by vaccination or by prior infection are less compatible to the new variants previous studies found that the alpha variant b 1 1 7 associated with receptor binding motif replacements does not significantly reduce the neutralizing antibodies capability despite its increased infectivity compared to the original strain meng et al 2021 mutations in the beta b 1 351 gamma p 1 and delta b 1 617 variants proved to be less susceptible to antibody neutralization mlcochova et al 2021 planas et al 2021 wibmer et al 2021 high transmission rates and lower vaccine efficacy towards these variants bernal et al 2021 hoffmann et al 2021 z wang et al 2021 resulted in a greater threat of infectivity and morbidity compared to the original sars cov 2 virus therefore quick detection and quantification of variants of concern are vital for initiating response and for proper policy making for pandemic containment currently sars cov 2 variant detection mainly relies on costly next generation sequencing where results are obtained within 3 5 days at best andrés et al 2020 khan et al 2020 with new variants of interest constantly emerging sequencing based approaches are important for their initial identification however they present difficulties considering the need for special instruments and resources including data analysis skills thus to ease detection a reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr based assay can provide rapid results for detection of known variants of concern such an assay can help assess a variant s frequency within a population and contribute to policy guidelines indeed a number of publications targeting variants of concern detection using rt qpcr barreto et al 2020 bivins et al 2021 gand et al 2021 vega magaña et al 2021 vogels et al 2021 wang et al 2021b yaniv et al 2021 as well as available commercial kits e g taqpath thermoscientific gt molecular perkinelmer have emerged for individual assessments population morbidity monitoring through wastewater or wastewater based epidemiology is well described and is considered an important method martin et al 2020 its advantage is that it can provide critical information regarding the spread of pathogens in the population in a given area without relying on individual testing tendencies or testing capacity since the beginning of the pandemic the sars cov 2 virus has been monitored in wastewater around the world ahmed et al 2020 bar or et al 2020 claro et al 2021 la rosa et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 trottier et al 2020 westhaus et al 2021 wu et al 2021 2020 despite this in order to detect specific sars cov 2 variants such as the gamma and delta variants of concern there is a need for a direct and sensitive probe based rt qpcr assay with detection ability in wastewater samples such a quick and accurate method could thus help generate better health policies in a given region in this study we monitored sars cov 2 traces in the wastewater of beer sheva israel s 4th largest city with population of approximately 220 000 beer sheva city is considered a high vaccination area with fluctuating morbidity and was therefore chosen as a model we developed a novel sensitive rt qpcr assay design for the direct detection of gamma and delta variants of concern the new assay was later employed for wastewater based epidemiology together with the rt qpcr assays developed previously by our group for quantification of the various variants of sars cov 2 these results were then compared to morbidity levels in the population allowing us to speculate the immunity level in the city population 2 methodology 2 1 primers and probes

rna sample dreier et al 2005 ms2 addition was meant for inhibitors assessment through calculated recovery percentage appear in table s4 values were calculated using fig s1 ct value initially converted to rna copies per μl in the rna sample based on the standard curves as described in the next section duplicate were averaged for each target gene separately the gene copies per l of wastewater sample were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 for raw or concentrated sample respectively 2 5 calibration curves and limit of detection determination calibration curves were performed on a known positive double strands dna template three different templates were used and full sequences are reported in table s3 1 gblocks gene fragments double stranded dna fragments from idt technologies containing sars cov 2 s gene sequence as reported for wuhan hu 1 nc 045512 2 2 puc gw kan plasmid from genewiz cloned with the end of orf8 until the beginning of n gene matching the reported 4 nucleotides insertion of the gamma variant 3 gblocks gene fragments double stranded dna fragments from idt technologies containing s gene sequence matching the reported 157 158 deletion of the delta variant calibration of p 1 probe was performed using the second gene block while calibration of s 157 probe was performed with the third gene block negative control for the p 1 probe was performed using wastewater samples confirmed as positive for the original variant or alpha variant of concern and negative control for the s 157 probe was performed using the first gene block serial dilutions for the relevant gene block were prepared based on copy number calculations at an initial concentration of 106 copies per µl down to 10 copies per µl the resulting ct values were plotted against the log copy number of the gene block template each concentration was examined by six repetitions and a standard deviation was calculated the lowest concentration tested i e 10 copies per µl was verified for at least 10 times to ensure more than 95 success in positive detection linear regression was performed between the log copy number and the ct values from the rt qpcr results in addition the coefficient of variants between replicates was 3 35 for gamma assay and 2 94 for the delta assay 2 6 complex matrix detection wastewater matrix consist of various pcr inhibitors that are likely to affect the assay performance therefore there was a need to assess the primers probe detection abilities in an environment as complex as that in order to validate the rt qpcr designed assay s sensitivity in a wastewater matrix rna extracted from pre determined negative wastewater sample for sars cov 2 was examined using standard cdc s detection sets centers for disease control and prevention 2019 the negative rna sample was supplemented with known concentrations of a desired gene block to reach 10 101 and 102 copies per µl all experiments were executed with a pre determined negative matrix for additional verification of the sample as negative eight repetitions were performed for each viral concentration or control ct results were plotted to represent the new probes limit of detection in a complex environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater based epidemiology immunity trends throughout the covid 19 outbreak we monitored wastewater samples from beer sheva city and several other locations in israel for the presence of sars cov 2 virus using rt qpcr considering that the different sars cov 2 variants share very high similarity in their n gene we employed n gene detection in prospect of general detection of all the sars cov 2 rna traces in the wastewater using a cdc s standard detection set cdc s n2 and our previously published designed primers probe set yaniv et al 2021 improved n3 we documented the sars cov 2 rna levels in wastewater and monitored these values together with the corresponding reported active cases and percent vaccination in the city populations fig 1 looking at fig 1 it is evident that an increase in detected sars cov 2 rna levels in the city wastewater appeared just prior to every one of the three peaks in reported active cases thus the appearance in the city s wastewater foresaw the increase in reported clinical cases of covid 19 this result was unsurprising as it is supported by other studies showing that the use of wastewater based epidemiology is an effective tool for population morbidity monitoring ahmed et al 2020 bar or et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 trottier et al 2020 westhaus et al 2021 wu et al 2020 we then wanted to ascertain if the effects of massive vaccinations could also be assessed using wastewater epidemiology in december 2020 israel began vaccinating its population with the pfizer biontech bnt162b2 covid 19 vaccine with a two dose three weeks interval regimen individuals were considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the second dose in accordance with the clinical trial data polack et al 2020 concurrently to the beginning of the vaccination efforts a meaningful morbidity peak was apparent fig 1 with values of 55 to 71 sars cov 2 active cases per 10 k people subsequently when over 50 of the population was vaccinated a steady and consistent decrease appeared in the level of sars cov 2 rna detected in wastewater and in the concurrent reported active cases per 10 k people in the population the declines in sars cov 2 rna levels in wastewater reached the lowest values by the end of may 2021 fig 1 when reported active cases decreased below 10 diagnosed patients per 10 k of the population at this time rna levels in wastewater decreased below detectable concentrations resulted in not detected value one month later by the end of june 2021 sars cov 2 rna levels in wastewater reappeared this was followed by an increase in reported active cases 2 3 weeks later fig 1 another analysis zooming on the appearance of the third morbidity peak was done for observing new sars cov 2 verified cases alongside our wastewater n gene rna detection fig s2 wastewater n gene detection was not visible at a rate of lower than two new cases per day in the city and remained undetected in five measurements between june 1 17 on june 22 the first positive wastewater result was obtained while notedly a meaningful increase in cases was seen only a week later this reappearance of increased morbidity continues throughout september 2021 despite vaccination percentages second dose of nearly 70 of the city s population previously we reported the emergence of the alpha variant of concern b 1 1 7 in israel by the end of january 2021 using rt qpcr assay we developed yaniv et al 2021 soon after appearance the alpha variant dominated the original variant to such an extent that within one month all sars cov 2 rna traces in wastewater corresponded solely to the alpha variant moreover the observed decline in morbidity suggest the effectiveness of the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine against the alpha variant meng et al 2021 the reappearance of covid 19 morbidity in june 2021 raised questions regarding the efficiency of the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine is the vaccine less efficient over time or it is compromised due to lack of compatibility to other variants of concerns 3 2 developed rt qpcr assays for gamma p 1 and delta b 1 617 detection previously we developed direct rt qpcr detection assays for the alpha variant b 1 17 british and beta variant b 1 315 south africa yaniv et al 2021 the possibility that the new outbreak is a result of the invasion of a novel variant of concern that differs from the alpha or beta was suggested the most prominent variants of concern to invade israel were the gamma variant p 1 brazilian or the delta variant b 1 617 indian therefore they were the most urgent variants in need for rapid detection we therefore developed direct rt qpcr detection assays for these two variants of concern our design for detection of these two variants is based on the differences in gene sequence from the original sars cov 2 sequence nc 045512 2 the gamma variant contains an insertion in the orf8 region and the delta variant s gene contains a deletion known as δ157 158 accordingly our primers probe sets were designed with a focus on these regions fig 2 a sequences available in table s1 for gamma variant detection the designed forward primer is located at the end of orf8 gene and the reverse primer is located at the beginning of the n gene meaning that 28 227 28 286 bp of the original sequence are included within this range the original sars cov 2 and gamma variant sequences are identical apart from a four nucleotide insertion in the gamma lineage fig 2a using a detection set comprised of two primers meant to amplify the target region a single probe p 1 probe was designed for the detection of the gamma variant only corresponding to the insertion for the detection of the delta variant the designated detection region was chosen from within the s gene focusing on s gene s 21 989 22 083 bp of the original sequence the original sars cov 2 sequence is identical to the delta variant sequence with the exception of a 6 nucleotides deletion in the delta lineage fig 2a using a detection set comprised of two primers meant to amplify the target region a single probe s 157 probe was designed for the area corresponding to the deletions resulting in the detection of the delta variant only to ensure functionality the described sets of primers and probes underwent characterization initially a calibration curve was generated for the two primers probe sets using dsdna as a template a detection range of between 106 copies and 10 copies per µl was tested for each set fig 2b linear regression performed for the two probes demonstrated strong correlation a limit of detection lod could be determined for each primers probe set and was identified as 10 copies per µl for the two sets fig 2b table s2 a lod of 10 copies per µl is equivalent to a lod calculated as 2000 copies per l wastewater in wastewater samples that were extracted directly defined as raw in equation s1 additionally in wastewater samples that were concentrated and then extracted for rna defined as concentrated in equation s2 10 copies per µl lod is equivalent to a calculated lod of 500 copies per l wastewater this indicates highly sensitive detection specificity of the described sets was examined with either dsdna fragments from the original sars cov 2 relevant to the assigned detection regions or using wastewater found positive for the original sars cov 2 and for the alpha variant both sets did not manifest a signal when tested with such negative controls and were therefore found to be highly specific wastewater matrix consists of various pcr inhibitors that are likely to affect the rt qpcr performance therefore there was a need to assess the primers probe detection abilities in such a complex environment hence primer probe sets were further characterized within a more intricate matrix wastewater from a rural area in binyamina israel served as a more complex environment for the rt qpcr assay wastewater samples were pre determined as negative for sars cov 2 using n gene detection after confirming that the wastewater samples were negative relevant dsdna template copies were added exogenously at known concentrations fig 2c these samples were then used for sars cov 2 detection by the examined primers probe sets as can be seen in fig 2c despite the wastewater matrix p 1 and s 157 probes maintained high functionality with a lod of 10 copies per µl proving their sensitivity and stability after fully characterizing the developed primers probe sets revealing their specificity sensitivity and durability we employed them on recently collected wastewater samples until recently the alpha variant was the most dominant in israel however a noticeable decrease in this variant was observed in the past months in may june 2021 clinical reports indicated that the delta variant had reached israel and was responsible for the majority of new morbidity cases taking this into account samples from different locations in the city of modi in were collected on june 23rd 2021 and tested for general sars cov 2 presence using n gene detection as well as for the presence of the alpha and delta variants using relevant s gene detection fig 2d as can be seen in fig 2d all of the tested samples were positive to sars cov 2 through n gene detection however none of the samples resulted in a positive detection for the alpha variant this corresponded to the disappearance of this variant in clinical tests as reported by health officials furthermore all samples except for one resulted in a positive signal for the delta variant using the specific designed primers probe set described above these field results confirmed the new primers probe sets ability to detect the delta variant in a quantitative sensitive manner even within a complex environment this technology thus can provide an assessment for variant of concern s geographical spread in the population a gamma variant primer probe set was also employed on numerous wastewater samples however none resulted in a positive signal as yet considering the importance of wastewater monitoring as well as the possibility of their use in clinical settings these new tools may serve for enhancing sars cov 2 variants of concern detection in a population 3 3 variants of concern detection discloses compromised immunity with the new rt qpcr tool for detection of variants of concern in hand we set out to identify and quantify the various variants of concern in beer sheva s wastewater during the past year fig 3 illustrates the dynamics of the different sars cov 2 variants in beer sheva s wastewater prior work by our group yaniv et al 2021 revealed that until january 2021 the original sars cov 2 was apparently the only version of sars cov 2 in israel and was detected by the s1 primers probe set primers probe set details in the si during january 2021 a shift occurred and the alpha variant detected by sδ69 primers probe set primers probe set details in the si manifested in the wastewater samples within a month quickly taking over the original variant the alpha variant was the only detectable variant in the city s wastewater it is important to note that the s1 detection set was relevant for original sars cov 2 detection until around march 2021 however with the emergence of new variants of concern it could no longer serve as an indication for the original variant as it relied strictly on differences between the original and the alpha variant the high vaccination values allowed the containment of this variant by the end of may and resulted in not detected values until june 24th concurrent to the latest emergence of sars cov 2 at end of june 2021 fig 1 we employed our previously developed detection primer probe sets for the alpha and beta variants of concern yaniv et al 2021 together with the newly developed detection sets for the gamma and delta variants of concern the results from the rt qpcr assays on wastewater samples indicated that the delta variant had arrived in beer sheva city fig 3 by the end of june 2021 none of the other variants of concern manifested a signal during late june july august september and october 2021 apart from the delta variant it is important to note that as in our previous study yaniv et al 2021 the rna detection levels of the s gene in wastewater samples are generally lower than the n gene here as well positive samples for sars cov 2 rna demonstrated detection levels of the s gene lower than the detection levels of the n gene despite the demonstrated sensitivity of used designed sets this was suggested to be related to different gene transcription levels between the n gene and s gene in the sars cov 2 emanuel et al 2021 kim et al 2020 however such a subject requires further research since first being documented in india the delta variant is known to be less responsive to the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine due to s gene mutations mlcochova et al 2021 antibodies generated by the vaccine are apparently less compatible for neutralization of the delta variant in fact the wastewater epidemiology results presented in this study clearly reflects this lower immunity despite high vaccination percentages additionally finding the delta virus strain in wastewater may also reflect that despite vaccination vaccinated people may still be infected and carry the virus while being asymptomatic supporting this notion is the health ministry report in which 50 of the clinically infected people in the current morbidity peak are vaccinated furthermore a decrease in immunity as reflected by an increase in morbidity observed until the end of september could also be a result of decrease in antibodies in vaccinated and recovering people over time despite this our results provide strong evidence for the connection of the presence of the delta variant in wastewater to the observed morbidity and this can serve as a partial explanation regarding the latest morbidity trend in beer sheva with relation to the level of vaccination and immunity in its population nevertheless in an effort to regain population immunity the booster vaccination efforts third dose began in the first week of august 2021 only two months later when over 40 of the population was vaccinated with the third dose a moderated decrease emerged in sars cov 2 rna detection levels in the city s wastewater and a sharp decrease in reported morbidity cases occurred figs 1 and 3 more data is needed to determine the possible effects of the third vaccination dose on the current morbidity peak yet these results emphasize the importance and reliability of this study to use wastewater as an epidemiology tool for early warning and policy decision making in regards to pandemic containment 4 conclusions the study presented here consolidate data gathered on a single model city throughout the past year the targeted research demonstrated how wastewater based epidemiology can serve as a tool for morbidity surveillance within the population given a specific geographical area wastewater monitoring was able to provide early alerts of 2 3 weeks before three observed morbidity peaks during this study s time period combining our sars cov 2 wastewater results with vaccination data raised questions regarding vaccine induced immunity out of three observed morbidity peaks as vaccine percentages increased to above 50 the second peak s infection was lowered despite this the infection reemerged into the third peak a month later regardless of almost 70 vaccine coverage an explanation to these observed results could be found in the exposure of the population to a new variant we aimed to prove that our rt qpcr assessment of sars cov 2 variants for the gamma p 1 and delta b 1 617 can be used as an expansion to the previously published alpha b 1 1 7 and beta b 1 351 variants yaniv et al 2021 probe sets and novel sets may be needed as more variants appear rt qpcr primers probe sets were designed based on sequence differences from the original sars cov 2 and other variants the new sets for gamma and delta variants detection were found specific as well as sensitive with a lod of 10 both in sterile conditions and in sewage matrix employment of the sets on israel s wastewater was positive for the delta variant and negative for the gamma variant corresponding to health officials reports for infections during the third peak having 4 different primers probe sets for detection of the variants of concern 2 of which are presented for the first time here enabled the identification and quantification of the sars cov 2 variants presence the city s wastewater interestingly each observed morbidity peak in this study corresponded to a different sars cov 2 variant indicating the usefulness of this tool the original variant responsible for the first peak the alpha variant responsible for the second peak and the delta variant responsible for the third peak this study also demonstrated that a second dose vaccine percentage of over 50 successfully contained the alpha variant as expected based on published in vitro studies nevertheless a second dose vaccination percentage of almost 70 was not enough to prevent the outbreak and continuous spread of the delta variant in the population in order to regain and maintain vaccine induced immunity for longer period in the population an additional vaccine dose was given this study validates that the booster third dose vaccine rate of over 40 successfully started to reduce the delta variant detection however further monitoring is required to fully elucidate the booster effect within the population overall the tools used in this study can provide valuable information not only regarding morbidity but also regarding vaccine induced immunity in the population credit authorship contribution statement karin yaniv conceptualization writing original draft visualization formal

16501,iron deposits stimulate chlorine consumption and trihalomethane thm formation in drinking water distribution systems through distinct mechanisms in this study a second order chlorine decay model with a variable reaction rate coefficient was developed to quantitatively evaluate the influences of iron deposits on chlorine reactions by considering the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom the type and dosages of deposits as well as the initial chlorine concentrations based on a reliable prediction of residual chlorine the concept that thm formation had a linear relationship with chlorine consumption was further validated by chlorination of dom in the presence of iron deposits due to the catalysis influences the reactivity of dom towards chlorine decay or thm formation was accelerated although iron deposits activated the reactivity of dom with bromine and chlorine thm slightly shifted toward chlorinated species due to the adsorption influences the maximum chlorine demand increased with the increasing deposit dosages whereas the extent of enhancement mainly relied on the dom properties low molecular weight dom with a hydrophilic characteristic was prone to be elevated by iron deposits based on the model simulation approximately 20 of chlorine consumption and 37 of thm formation were contributed by deposits after 168 h reaction the data provided herein

secreted by biofilms are non negligible precursors of dbps jin et al 2014 the presence of copper corrosion products could further enhance the formation of dbps with eps as a precursor hu et al 2020 although the properties of dom in bulk water or the characteristics of corrosion deposits at the pipe wall have been investigated individually ding et al 2019 peng et al 2010 the interactions among chlorine dom and pipe corrosion deposits remain not fully understood considerable modeling efforts have been made as the standard measurement of chlorine and dbp concentrations is usually difficult and time consuming ike et al 2020 however model predictions in the presence of pipe corrosion products are still in a preliminary stage chlorine decay models have been developed as first order or as second order models fisher et al 2011 the second order models were improved by taking the different reactivity of dom into account which led to the development of an augmented two reactant 2r model and a variable rate coefficient model fisher et al 2012 jonkergouw et al 2009 these models can accurately describe chlorine decay which is caused by the reaction with dom under different ph temperature as well as re chlorination conditions fisher et al 2017 extended the focus from dom in bulk water to the attached biofilm at the pipe wall an expbio decay model was introduced to quantify the wall decay rate under a given flow regime the decay rate firstly increased with chlorine concentration due to the mass transport limitation then decreased followed by an intersecting negative exponential curve to represent the intrinsic reaction fisher et al 2017 however the existing models have not considered the contributions of the dom deposits complex to chlorine consumption although corrosion deposits significantly accelerate chlorine consumption regarding the prediction of thm formation sathasivan et al 2020 developed the thm species model based on the concept that thm productive chlorine consumption was linearly related to the formation of thm a total of four species or individual thm species including trichloromethane tcm dichlorobromomethane dcbm dibromochloromethane dbcm and tribromomethane tbm the thm species model was tested on different water samples and offered good predictions however the model performances in the presence of corrosion deposits have not yet been evaluated as kinetic models of chlorine decay and dbp formation are semi mechanistic models understanding the fundamental mechanisms of chlorine reaction in the presence of corrosion deposits is helpful to improve model accuracy and adequacy both adsorption and catalytic behavior affect the chlorine reaction in the presence of deposits but the decisive mechanism is highly dependent on the dom characteristics and deposit types specifically catalytic behavior instead of adsorption is a dominant mechanism for copper corrosion products because the adsorption of dom on copper oxides has not been observed huang et al 2019 liu and croué 2016 in contrast the adsorption of dom on iron corrosion products and chlorination occur simultaneously the surface properties of ferric iron oxides such as the surface morphology and zeta potential were changed due to dom adsorption rahman and gagnon 2014 safiur rahman et al 2013 the dom particles can form an organic layer of approximately 1 2 nm thick and then change the surface charge from positive to negative wang et al 2019 generally iron deposits take part in many reactions including adsorption complexation and catalysis which may increase the total amount as well as stimulate the reactivity of dbp precursors therefore questions arise about how to quantify the contribution of iron deposits to the increased dbp precursors in dwds which mechanism significantly affects the reactivity of dbp precursor reaction models were developed to help answer these questions given the significance of the reaction between chlorine dom and deposits in dwds the first objective of this study is to simulate residual chlorine thm and individual thm species concentrations in the presence of iron deposits through the chlorine decay thm formation kinetics models the investigated factors include the type and dosages of deposits the compositions and characteristics of the dom and the initial chlorine concentrations iccs the second objective is to evaluate the applicability of the proposed models under the following two conditions chlorination of specific water at identical iccs with different dosages of iron deposits and chlorination of specific water at different iccs in the presence of a certain amount of deposits kinetic models were developed considering influences of adsorption and catalysis conversely models are helpful to 1 quantify the enhancement of chlorine demand and thm formation potential 2 evaluate the co effects of adsorption and catalysis that stimulate the reactivity of thm precursors 2 material and methods 2 1 chemical determination filtered water before final disinfection was collected from the hosterwitz hwt drinking water treatment plant located in the state of saxony germany in 2018 samples were collected in pre cleaned dissolved organic carbon doc free bottles and stored at 4 c until analysis citric acid ca a low molecular weight organic acid that is poorly removed by the conventional drinking water treatment process was chosen as one of the dom models in this study humic acid ha is the most important reactive fraction of dom and was chosen as another dom model the ha stock solution was prepared by dissolving commercial ha sigma aldrich switzerland at ph 12 naoh 2 mol l and stirred at room temperature for approximately 30 hours the solution was adjusted to neutral and then filtered through a 0 45 µm polycarbonate filter nuclepore track etched membrane whatman germany to remove suspended solids then the preparation of the ha and ca solutions at target aqueous phase concentrations was accomplished with distilled and deionized water the chlorine stock solution was prepared by diluting a concentrated sodium hypochlorite solution available chlorine with ultrapure water all chemicals were at least of analytical grade except where noted oxy hydroxides goethite α feooh and magnetite fe3o4 are the main crystalline iron minerals in the dwds as they have very low mobility and exist at the interface between the water phase and the pipe wall yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 they serve as barriers that protect the pipe from further corrosion this study focused on these two iron oxides i e goethite and magnetite which were purchased from a commercial agent sigma aldrich switzerland 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 adsorption envelopes adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the preferential adsorption of dom components onto goethite and magnetite as well as to establish the dom adsorption isotherm through a suitable mathematical expression the dom composition was fractionated based on liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd including biopolymers bp 10 kda humic substances hs building blocks bb low molecular weight acids lmw acids low molecular weight neutrals lmw neutrals and hydrophobic organic carbon hoc huber et al 2011 as the fraction of bb is considered a natural breakdown product of hs and is used to reflect hs like material of low molecular weight huber et al 2011 hs and bb are assumed to have similar characteristics therefore they were treated as one component and referred to as hs bb in this study the adsorption procedure followed the method described by safiur rahman et al 2013 generally the doc in ha and ca was set to seven different concentrations ranging from 1 0 to 16 0 mg c l while the particle dosage was set to a constant concentration of 2 0 g l the suspensions were shaken at 175 rpm using an orbital shaker at room temperature 20 1 c for 5 days to achieve equilibration the ph value was adjusted to 7 5 by 0 1 m naoh or hcl according to the previous study chun et al 2005 after 5 days the suspensions were first centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min and then filtered through 0 45 µm polycarbonate filters the filtered suspensions were immediately pipetted into glass vials for doc measurement the adsorption isotherm was calculated by the langmuir isotherm as shown in eq 1 safiur rahman et al 2013 schlautman and morgan 1994 the langmuir isotherm was selected for the analysis to estimate the dom adsorption capacity mg c g onto goethite and magnetite zhang et al 2016 it assumes that the absorbate forms a monolayer around the homogenous surface of the adsorbent 1 c e q e 1 k l q m 1 q m c e where q e mg c g deposits is the equilibrium adsorption capacity c e mg l is the equilibrium concentration k l l mg is the constant of the langmuir isotherm and q m is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg c g goethite or magnetite q m is calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot between c e q e and c e adsorption experiments were further conducted in parallel at different dosages of particles with constant dom in the same experimental setup the doc in ha and ca was set constantly to 5 mg c l mixing with a goethite magnetite dosage ranging from 0 2 to a maximum of 10 0 g l under extreme conditions control flasks containing no adsorbent were prepared and followed the same procedure as described above 2 2 2 chlorination experiments the combined effects of the iccs and goethite magnetite dosages on chlorine consumption and thm formation were investigated the experiment was conducted in 250 ml chlorine demand free bottles which were tightly sealed and placed in the dark during experiments a blank experiment was conducted in advance i e chlorination of dom free water with goethite or magnetite to determine if iron deposits alone would consume chlorine then the hwt ca and ha samples with 2 mg l dom were chlorinated in the absence of deposits 0 g l bulk water chlorination the same water samples were dosed with goethite or magnetite at 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 g l individually according to previous studies hu et al 2016 liu et al 2013 samples were then chlorinated at 12 0 mg cl2 l that recommended by zhao et al 2016 additionally the particle dosage was constant at 1 0 g l while the iccs ranged from 4 to 12 mg cl2 l following the same experimental setup before chlorination ph was adjusted to 7 2 with 0 1 mol l h2so4 or 0 1 mol l naoh solution and then 10 mm phosphate buffer solution was added to keep the ph stable the reaction time was from 2 h to a maximum of 168 h at the end of the reaction time the water sample was filtered through 0 45 µm polycarbonate filters the residual chlorine thm as well as iron concentrations in the filtered solution were determined immediately all experimental conditions were kept constant at a temperature of 20 c the more detailed method for chlorination is described elsewhere hua et al 2015 it should be noticed that treated drinking water is usually chlorinated at clear water tanks before entering dwds to further elucidate the influences of iron deposits on chlorine reaction with oxidized dom as the precursor the consumer s tap water tap water was employed and re chlorinated from may to june 2021 tap water was collected in an office building located in south china normal university china the households taps were flushed for 5 min and then filtered through 0 45 µm polycarbonate filters the doc of tap water was 2 68 0 10 mg l residual chlorine concentration was 0 51 0 06 mg l thm concentration was 26 95 4 50 µg l tap water was re chlorinated at 2 mg l in the absence and presence of goethite or magnetite 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 g l individually before re chlorination 10 mm phosphate buffer was given to keep the ph stable at the end of reaction time the samples were extracted residual chlorine thm concentration as well as iron concentrations were determined 2 3 analytical methods the free chlorine concentration was determined spectrophotometrically according to the dpd colorimetric standard method 4500 cl g from the american public health association the water samples were first quenched by the addition of sodium thiosulfate solution and the thm concentration was measured by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc 7890a ms 7000 agilent dom was measured as doc with a toc vcph analyzer equipped with an auto sampler asi v shimadzu corp the maximum standard deviation and coefficient of variance were set as 0 1 and 5 respectively the doc measurement was conducted repeatedly until the thresholds were satisfied the individual doc components were determined by lc ocd the iron concentration in the filtered solution was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer varian spectraa 220 fast sequential aas 220 z with the limit of quantification loq of 20 µg l zhang et al 2017 the ph value of each sample was determined at the end of chlorination by ph meter 340i wtw germany 2 4 model development 2 4 1 modeling chlorine decay in the presence of iron deposits the kinetics of chlorine decay in the presence of iron deposits can be expressed as follows 2 d c c l d t r b r d where r b is the bulk decay rate representing the reaction between chlorine and reactants in bulk water r d represents the reaction between chlorine iron deposits and adsorbed nom i e the deposits related reaction rate a second order model with a variable reaction rate coefficient was applied for predicting the chlorine concentration in bulk water hua et al 2015 jonkergouw et al 2009 as shown in eq 3 3 r b k c l b t c c l t c r b t α b e x p β b c r b t c c l m a x b c c l t c r b t where α b l mg h and β b dimensionless are model parameters related to the bulk reaction coefficient k c l b t c c l t mg l is the chlorine concentration c r b t mg l is the reactants concentration at time t c c l m a x b is the maximum chlorine demand in bulk water which represents total chlorine reactants entering the dwds i e c c l m a x b c r b 0 δ c r b t is the consumed reactant concentration at time t thus c r b t c r b 0 δ c r b t as the stoichiometric coefficient of chlorine and reactant is equal to one in bulk water the consumed reactant δ c r b t is equal to t 0 t r b t δ t based on the euler method finally the c r b t c c l m a x b t 0 t r b t δ t the bulk reaction coefficient k c l b is a function of α b β b and δ c r b t which is related to the reactivity of the reactant but independent of the initial chlorine dosage therefore once the model parameters α b and β b are calibrated by fitting to one chlorination dataset the constant parameters can be applied to predict all datasets with variable initial chlorine dosages in the operational range hua et al 2015 it is assumed that the deposits related decay rate r d is the first order concerning chlorine and reactant at deposits surfaces meanwhile the reactivity of adsorbed dom changes with reaction time thus similar to the bulk decay rate r d is calculated as follows 4 r d k c l d t c c l t c r d t α d e x p β d c r d t c c l m a x d c c l t c r d t where α d l mg h and β d dimensionless are model parameters related to the reaction coefficient k c l d t c c l m a x d mg l is the maximum chlorine demand and δ c r d t is the consumed reactant which are related to the deposit reaction δ c r d t t 0 t r d t δ t c c l m a x d c r d t by calculating t 0 t r d t δ t the influences of pipe deposits on chlorine consumption can be quantified substituting eqs 3 and 4 to eq 2 the overall chlorine decay kinetics in the presence of deposits was obtained it includes bulk reaction and deposits related reaction which can be solved numerically 2 4 2 modeling thm formation in the presence of iron deposits by analog to the chlorine decay model it is hypothesized that thm formation comprises thm formed in bulk water c thm b and thm contributed by deposits related reaction c thm d within the designated time interval δ t the yields of c thm b and c thm d are linear with their corresponding chlorine demand sathasivan et al 2020 then the overall thm model can be expressed as follows 5 c thm t α thm b t 0 t r b t δ t α thm d t 0 t r d t δ t α thm b c oth b α thm d c oth d c thm 0 where c oth b and c oth d are the chlorine demands that do not produce thm non productive chlorine demand in bulk water and at the pipe deposits respectively α thm b and α thm d are the specific thm formations in μmol mg of consumed chlorine c thm 0 is the thm concentration before chlorine is dosed in μm 2 4 3 evolutionary polynomial regression based on the model development eqs 3 and 4 it can be observed that the chlorine demand c cl max is an important parameter exploring the relationship between c cl max and dosages of iron oxides can facilitate model application and elucidate how deposits quantitatively affect chlorine consumption for this reason evolutionary polynomial regression epr which is a hybrid data driven technique and has been widely used in environmental fields was applied giustolisi and savic 2006 the following forms of function were used 6 y a 0 j 1 m a j f x 1 es j k 1 x 1 es j 2 k 1 where y is the maximum chlorine demand c cl max x k is the k th explanatory variable es is the matrix of unknown exponents a j is unknown polynomial coefficients m is the number of polynomial terms a 0 is the bias term and f is a function selected by the user the model parameter estimations were evaluated using the coefficient of determination cod while the model structure search was based on a genetic algorithm yang et al 2012 7 cod 1 n y y obs 2 n y obs y obs 2 2 4 4 model performance evaluation the best fit model parameters for chlorine decay i e α β and c cl max were obtained by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the experimentally determined residual chlorine concentrations and the simulations at corresponding times namely the sum of the squared errors sse likewise the best fit model parameters α thm c oth b and c oth d were also obtained by minimizing the sse of the experimentally determined total thm thm species concentrations and corresponding simulation results the model parameters were related to the concentration and composition of dom as well as the type and dosages of deposits it should be highlighted that these parameters were independent of the icc for the hwt water containing a specific type of deposits at a constant concentration the parameters were expected to be invariable when different iccs were spiked since the proposed model does not have an analytical solution the euler method was adopted to solve the model numerically with a time interval of 0 25 h excel solver which is based on the generalized reduced gradient algorithm was employed to obtain the best fit model parameters the models were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse dong and zhang 2021 yang et al 2021 all these methods have often been used as measures of the difference between the predicted data and those obtained experimentally piñeiro et al 2008 3 results 3 1 adsorption of dom on iron deposits the dom composition of the hwt treated water at the beginning and the equilibrium conditions with different dosages of goethite or magnetite are presented in figs 1 a and s1 respectively according to chromatography hs bb was the main component of the hwt water sample which accounted for approximately 80 of the total doc bp was limited in the treated water and totally removed by adsorption fig 1 a biopolymer dashed line lmw acid was not detected in the hwt water sample hoc varied randomly and no clear adsorption trend was observed because it was the remaining fraction of doc retained on the chromatographic column and not eluted quantitatively the concentrations of hs bb decreased substantially by approximately 50 at 10 g l for goethite and above 30 for magnetite indicating that hs and bb were the main components that were preferentially removed by adsorption fig 1 c the lmw neutral concentration only slightly decreased with magnetite from 0 295 mg l to 0 248 mg l and even increased with goethite from 0 295 mg l to 0 428 mg l fig 1 d generally the doc of a larger molecular weight fraction decreased preferentially while the doc with a low molecular weight fraction remained in solution the possible reason for the change of mw distribution is that the higher molecular weight compounds tend to be more aromatic and might have a larger number of reaction sites than the smaller molecular compounds which be preferentially adsorbed onto the surface of iron deposits rahman and gagnon 2014 langmuir isotherms which represent the 5 day adsorption capacity of ca and ha in the presence of goethite and magnetite are shown in fig s2 a and b the best fit isotherm parameters are summarized in table s1 student s t test revealed that there was no statistical significance between the langmuir isotherm model and experimental data α 0 05 p 0 05 considering the values of the regression coefficients r2 it was concluded that the experimental datasets moderately fit the langmuir isotherm model indicating monolayer adsorption the adsorption capacity of goethite was systematically higher than that of magnetite e g q m 4 99 mg g vs 2 36 mg g for the ha water sample the results are consistent with the fact that the bet surface area of goethite is higher than that of magnetite yang et al 2012 and goethite has a more positively charged surface facilitating the adsorption of negatively charged dom molecules safiur rahman et al 2013 based on the q m and langmuir isotherm model the amount of adsorbed ha and ca with regard to the different goethite magnetite dosages was simulated as shown in fig s2 c and d the adsorption affinity of ha was higher than that of ca for both goethite and magnetite under the same conditions the difference may have been driven by the physical and chemical properties of ha and ca such as molecular weight and molecular dynamic diameter the influence of the adsorption affinity on the chlorine reaction is discussed in the following section 3 2 effects of iron deposits on chlorine consumption ultrapure water containing 1 g l goethite or magnetite was spiked at an icc of 4 mg l and incubated at room temperature for 24 h the results show that 2 75 and 0 75 of the initial chlorine dosages were consumed by goethite and magnetite respectively indicating that the chlorine consumption by goethite or magnetite alone was quite limited the residual chlorine and thm concentrations in the hwt water for various goethite doses ranging from 0 to 2 g l are shown in fig s3 a and b respectively when iron oxides were present enhanced chlorine consumption was observed with an increasing ratio of 25 by 0 5 g l goethite increasing the iron oxide dosages led to even lower residual chlorine similar conclusions can be drawn for the chlorination of ha and ca when goethite or magnetite was present one of the reasonable explanations for this observation is the influence of adsorption due to the coexisting of dom the iron particles inevitably undergo structural transformation a recent study has reported that the feooh organic complex had a higher specific area and more oxygen containing groups zhuang et al 2020 the structure transformation may lead to an increased number of dom reactive sites making functional groups available for reactions that are not available in bulk water evanko and dzombak 1998 hassan et al 2006 moreover dom effectively reduced the iron particle sizes confirming the break of the aggregates into individual particles rahman and gagnon 2014 the individual particles may further undergo structural transformation and enhance the total budget of chlorine reactive sites the abovementioned explanation shows that chlorine consumption increased with increasing particle dosage but it fails to elucidate the variable consumption increment for different types of iron oxides specifically the maximum adsorption capacity q m of magnetite 2 36 mg g for ha is smaller than that of goethite 4 99 mg g considering the adsorption mechanism the chlorine consumption by magnetite would be theoretically lower than that by goethite however conflicting results were obtained i e the presence of magnetite led to a comparable or an even higher increase of chlorine consumption especially for ca sample as shown in fig 2 the results indicate that the increase in chlorine consumption was not only attributed to dom adsorption another possible explanation is the dissolution of iron oxides leading to the formation of ferrous ions fe2 which further reacted with chlorine to form the products of fe3 and hydroxyl radicals oh heeb et al 2014 hu et al 2016 the reaction between chlorine and ferrous ions was faster than that with dom thus the overall chlorine decay rate was accelerated in the presence of iron deposits considering this hypothesis the iron concentrations in different dom solutions were measured as shown in fig s4 the iron concentration in the solution with magnetite was generally higher than that in the goethite samples however the reason for the variation of iron concentration is unknown the iron concentration was not detected in hwt and tap water samples after chlorination the third explanation is that the catalyzing metals such as cu ni and cr may be adsorbed on iron oxides to catalyze the decomposition of hypochlorite ion fisher et al 2017 thus the metal composition of iron oxides after chlorination requires further investigation 3 3 effects of iron deposits on thm formation the specific tcm concentrations of different water samples spiked at an icc of 12 mg l icc of 2 mg l for tap water rechlorination in the presence of goethite and magnetite 0 g l to 2 g l at 168 h are shown in fig 3 for bulk water ca produced the highest specific tcm formation at 2 64 μmol mg doc which was nearly ten times higher than that of the hwt water at 0 29 μmol mg doc and two times higher than that of the ha water at 1 38 μmol mg doc ca has been reported to produce a large amount of tcm which through two step reactions i e an oxidative decarboxylation reaction followed by the subsequent chlorination of β ketoglutaric acid blatchley et al 2003 tsamba et al 2020 the presence of goethite magnetite enhanced the total tcm formation the first reason for this observation is similar to it for chlorine consumption i e the presence of iron oxides provides stronger surface reactions for tcm formation second the hydroxyl radical which is produced by the reaction between residual chlorine and ferrous ion oxidize dom to tcm precursor hu et al 2016 third the increased tcm formation may be attributed to degradation or transformation from other dbp species such as 1 1 1 trichloropropanone and or trichloroacetaldehyde hydrate chun et al 2005 as ph was kept stable the co effects of iron oxides and ph on thm formation are not discussed in the present study ph was measured for each sample at the beginning and end of reaction time the variations are given in fig s5 although iron oxides stimulated tcm formation the extent of enhancement was different specifically the tcm enhancement for ha in the presence of 2 g l goethite was 47 whereas it reached 114 for the hwt water especially for the ca sample with 2 g l goethite an increasing specific tcm concentration was observed at 8 28 μmol mg c which was three times higher than the tcm concentration in bulk water at 2 64 μmol mg c fig 3 a this illustrates that the characteristics of dom led to different extents of enhancement considering the ha sample with the highest suva254 among the three samples ha 5 45 l mg m hwt 1 55 l mg m ca 0 11 l mg m it is assumed that dom with a higher suva254 value exhibited a lower enhancement towards tcm formation furthermore the adsorption affinity of ha on goethite was consistently higher than that of ca fig s2 but the tcm enhancement of ha was less sensitive than that of ca this result indicates that the adsorption influence is not a decisive factor responsible for the tcm enhancement fig 3 b shows the tcm enhancement of different dom types in the presence of magnetite the growth percent for ha was still significantly lower than that for ca or the hwt water which is consistent with the previous conclusion that tcm enhancement of dom with higher suva254 was limited this further illustrates the importance of dom characteristics to tcm formation in the presence of iron based particles slight decreases in tcm for the hwt sample with goethite and ca with magnetite were observed fig 3 it is speculated that the adsorption of tcm outcompetes tcm formation which requires further investigation 4 discussion 4 1 chlorine decay kinetic model as shown previously adsorption and catalysis have a synergistic influence on chlorine consumption in the presence of iron deposits from a modeling standpoint the parameter of maximum chlorine demand c cl max and the reaction rate coefficients k cl are able to represent the influences of adsorption and catalysis respectively therefore c cl max d as well as parameters α d and β d k cl d f α d β d eq 4 were calibrated against each individual dataset regarding chlorination of the water sample in the absence and presence of iron oxides ranging from 0 5 to 2 g l the best fit parameters for the hwt sample are categorized by the type of iron oxide and summarized in table 1 the calibration and prediction procedures for simulating the chlorine decay kinetics of the ha ca and tap samples were the same as the procedure for the hwt sample likewise the best fit parameters for ha ca and tap are summarized in tables s2 s4 4 1 1 maximum chlorine demand the calibrated chlorine demand in bulk water c cl max b was constant at 5 01 mg l for the hwt sample but independent of iron oxide concentration this is because the concentration and characteristics of dom in bulk water are assumed to be stable at the adsorption equilibrium phase similarly the chlorine bulk demand c cl max b for the ha ca and tap samples were kept constant at 7 46 mg l 4 08 mg l and 2 06 mg l respectively tables s2 s4 the calibrated c cl max d increased with increasing concentrations of goethite or magnetite which is consistent with the previous hypothesis that more iron oxides provide more reactive sites the ca samples containing magnetite showed higher c cl max d than those containing goethite confirming the catalytic effects of iron oxides on chlorine consumption it should be noted that the chlorine decay model was calibrated against each dataset containing different dosages of iron oxides which limits the application of the model for this reason the relationship between c cl max and sample characteristics were obtained by applying data driven evolutionary polynomial regression epr analysis as shown in table s5 eight equations were obtained according to their selected explanatory variable numbers the fitness of equations to the observed data improved substantially when new explanatory variables were introduced considering that the maximum chlorine demand was affected by both the type of iron oxides and the dom characteristics function 8 was selected 4 1 2 reaction rate coefficients the deposits related rate coefficient at beginning of reaction time k d 0 which equals to α d eq 4 was consistently equal to or faster than the initial bulk rate coefficient α b for example 8 58e 3 l mg h k d 0 vs 6 33e 3 l mg h k b 0 for the hwt water 7 25e 2 l mg h vs 7 21e 3 l mg h for ha water table s2 and 1 88e 3 l mg h vs 9 59e 4 l mg h for the ca water table s3 constant parameters i e α b α d were observed for tap water as shown in table s4 this indicates that the iron oxides have limited influences on the reactivity of pre oxidized dom the model parameters including α b β b α d and β d were constantly applied to simulate the decay kinetics of the water samples chlorinated at any icc in the operational range taking the hwt water sample containing 1 g l goethite as an example the best fit α β and ccl max which were calibrated against the dataset of an icc at 12 mg l were applied to predict the chlorine decay kinetics of the hwt sample chlorinated at iccs of 4 and 7 mg l the best fit parameters were constant in this case as shown in table 1 similarly the model parameters for magnetite which were calibrated against the icc dataset at 12 mg l and 1 g l magnetite were further used to predict the chlorine decay of the hwt treated water that was spiked at 4 and 7 mg l with 1 g l magnetite this indicates that the chlorine decay model is able to provide accurate predictions in the presence of iron deposits by applying invariant parameters over the maximum time taken for water to travel through the dwds the goodness of curve fitting calibration for the hwt treated water samples chlorinated with identical iccs but containing different initial particle dosages are presented in fig 4 a and b fig 4 c and d illustrate the model prediction results by using invariant parameters for the hwt treated water containing constant iron oxides concentrations but spiked at different iccs as seen from the figures the proposed chlorine model described the experimental data moderately well with r 2 values ranging from 0 85 to 0 98 for a specific iron oxide there were no significant differences in model accuracy between chlorination conditions with different iccs and varied dosages the model fits the data in the ha ca and tap samples are presented in the supplementary information fig s6 fig s7 and fig s8 respectively with the assistant of the model the deposits related chlorine consumption t 0 t r d t δ t and dom related chlorine consumption t 0 t r b t δ t can be calculated at 168 h it was found that t 0 t r d t δ t accounted for 29 of total chlorine consumption for hwt 10 for ha and tap as well as 39 for ca samples 4 2 thm formation kinetic model the parameters of the thm formation model which were calibrated against chlorination datasets of the hwt sample containing variable iron oxide concentrations are summarized in table 2 the model fit to the data of the hwt sample is presented in fig 5 generally the model simulated well all measured concentrations of tcm dcbm and dbcm tbm was not detected in the hwt water 4 2 1 specific formation ratio as shown α tcm b α dcbm b α dbcm b is 85 13 2 which indicates that tcm was the major species in bulk water the bulk reaction related parameters including α thm b and c oth b were kept constant for predicting thm formation in the water samples with iron oxides the deposits reaction parameters including α thm d and c oth d were individually calibrated against datasets of goethite and magnetite with variable dosages in the presence of goethite the transformation ratio α tcm d α dcbm d α dbcm d is 93 6 1 α tcm increased from 85 for bulk reaction to 93 when deposits are present indicating a slight shift of thm to tcm formation a similar result was obtained by the rechlorination of the tap water sample in the absence and presence of iron deposits 4 2 2 nonproductive chlorine consumption the unproductive chlorine consumption c oth d generally increased with an increasing concentration of iron oxides as shown in fig 5 for hwt and fig s9 for tap two formation phases were observed take fig 5 d as an example the suppression of thm formation was observed in the first formation phase from 0 to 24 h while the second formation phase was accelerated as the nonproductive chlorine consumption was consumed in the first phase the second formation phase was contributed by both bulk and deposit related reactions graphically the model describes well the measured total thm and thm species as a function of time the goodness of fit is shown in table 2 for hwt and table s6 8 for the ha ca and tap samples for the hwt sample the sse value of tcm ranges from 6 05e 3 to 8 88e 2 generally the sse of the reaction in the presence of iron oxides was higher than it of the bulk reaction indicating the model performance was less effective when deposits were present as shown in fig 5 most errors occurred in the first phase of thm formation in particular the experimental results were underestimated in the hwt water containing 2 g l goethite fig 5 d or magnetite fig 5 g at 6 h this may be attributed to the parameter c oth d which was overestimated and further depressed the modeled thm concentration to improve the goodness of fit with respect to thm concentration in the first 6 hours the c oth d value was modified manually by doing so the model data overestimated thm formation from 24 hours until the end of the reaction time this may indicate that c oth d is not a constant for the overall reaction period but is variable along with the reaction time another possibility is that the total chlorine consumption was underestimated within the first 6 hours which resulted in an underestimation of thm formation due to the lack of datasets for the first 6 hours of reaction the abovementioned hypothesis requires further validation 4 3 implementation in the water distribution system it should be noted that the data obtained in this study were from the batch experiments which were different from the real hydraulic and transportation conditions in dwds the particles are settling at the bottom or the upper half of the horizontal pipes van thienen et al 2011 therefore the pipe diameter and mass transport should be considered further work will be required to identify whether the proposed model can be integrated with the mass transfer coefficient to provide reliable prediction results in real dwds in addition the real pipe deposits are usually covered with bacterial eps the exist of eps may decrease the adsorption sites that are available for dom thus the co effects of dom and eps on thm formation in the presence of iron based particles require evaluation 5 conclusions this study provided kinetics models to explain the interactions among chlorine dom and iron deposits based on the reliable prediction of the residual chlorine concentration as well as the concept that productive chlorine consumption is linearly related to thm or thm species formation the thm species model was validated for re chlorination of the four water samples containing goethite and magnetite at variable dosages with the assistance of mathematical models a better understanding of chlorine decay and thm formation in the presence of goethite and magnetite was obtained the major conclusions are 1 the reactivity of dom towards chlorine decay k cl and the thm transformation ratio α thm were enhanced in the presence of iron deposits mainly due to the catalysis mechanism the enhancement ratio is critically dependent on the dom characteristics and type of iron deposits but independent of the initial chlorine dosage 2 the maximum chlorine demand c cl max as well as the nonproductive chlorine consumption c oth increased with increasing particle dosages indicating that the number of chlorine reactive sites increased along with the pipe dosages which was attributed to the adsorption influences 3 the chlorine consumption of dom with higher suva254 values was stable in the presence of deposits whereas low molecular weight dom with hydrophilic characteristics is prone to be elevated by iron oxides iron oxides have limited influences on the reactivity of pre oxidized dom 4 the chlorine decay model provides predictions with invariant and fewer parameters for any initial chlorine dosages in the operational range the thm species model provided accurate thm thm species simulation results for bulk reactions however the prediction accuracy decreased for the deposits related reactions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16501,iron deposits stimulate chlorine consumption and trihalomethane thm formation in drinking water distribution systems through distinct mechanisms in this study a second order chlorine decay model with a variable reaction rate coefficient was developed to quantitatively evaluate the influences of iron deposits on chlorine reactions by considering the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom the type and dosages of deposits as well as the initial chlorine concentrations based on a reliable prediction of residual chlorine the concept that thm formation had a linear relationship with chlorine consumption was further validated by chlorination of dom in the presence of iron deposits due to the catalysis influences the reactivity of dom towards chlorine decay or thm formation was accelerated although iron deposits activated the reactivity of dom with bromine and chlorine thm slightly shifted toward chlorinated species due to the adsorption influences the maximum chlorine demand increased with the increasing deposit dosages whereas the extent of enhancement mainly relied on the dom properties low molecular weight dom with a hydrophilic characteristic was prone to be elevated by iron deposits based on the model simulation approximately 20 of chlorine consumption and 37 of thm formation were contributed by deposits after 168 h reaction the data provided herein emphasize the role of iron deposits in chlorine consumption and thm formation which assist the water quality management in drinking water distribution systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine decay iron deposits kinetics model trihalomethane formation 1 introduction chlorine is routinely used to inhibit microbial regrowth in drinking water distribution systems dwds hua et al 2018 rosario ortiz et al 2016 however chlorine reacts with residual dissolved organic matter dom leading to the formation of undesirable disinfection byproducts dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids and other unregulated byproducts dong et al 2020 tang et al 2020 these compounds are suspected carcinogens teratogens and mutagens that threaten human health mian et al 2018 it has been reported that the pipe corrosion products in dwds such as copper or iron based particles could elevate chlorine consumption and dbps formation with enhancement ratios ranging from 45 to 137 hassan et al 2006 huang et al 2019 in addition bacteria can even grow on the surface of pipe corrosion products to form biofilms while the extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by biofilms are non negligible precursors of dbps jin et al 2014 the presence of copper corrosion products could further enhance the formation of dbps with eps as a precursor hu et al 2020 although the properties of dom in bulk water or the characteristics of corrosion deposits at the pipe wall have been investigated individually ding et al 2019 peng et al 2010 the interactions among chlorine dom and pipe corrosion deposits remain not fully understood considerable modeling efforts have been made as the standard measurement of chlorine and dbp concentrations is usually difficult and time consuming ike et al 2020 however model predictions in the presence of pipe corrosion products are still in a preliminary stage chlorine decay models have been developed as first order or as second order models fisher et al 2011 the second order models were improved by taking the different reactivity of dom into account which led to the development of an augmented two reactant 2r model and a variable rate coefficient model fisher et al 2012 jonkergouw et al 2009 these models can accurately describe chlorine decay which is caused by the reaction with dom under different ph temperature as well as re chlorination conditions fisher et al 2017 extended the focus from dom in bulk water to the attached biofilm at the pipe wall an expbio decay model was introduced to quantify the wall decay rate under a given flow regime the decay rate firstly increased with chlorine concentration due to the mass transport limitation then decreased followed by an intersecting negative exponential curve to represent the intrinsic reaction fisher et al 2017 however the existing models have not considered the contributions of the dom deposits complex to chlorine consumption although corrosion deposits significantly accelerate chlorine consumption regarding the prediction of thm formation sathasivan et al 2020 developed the thm species model based on the concept that thm productive chlorine consumption was linearly related to the formation of thm a total of four species or individual thm species including trichloromethane tcm dichlorobromomethane dcbm dibromochloromethane dbcm and tribromomethane tbm the thm species model was tested on different water samples and offered good predictions however the model performances in the presence of corrosion deposits have not yet been evaluated as kinetic models of chlorine decay and dbp formation are semi mechanistic models understanding the fundamental mechanisms of chlorine reaction in the presence of corrosion deposits is helpful to improve model accuracy and adequacy both adsorption and catalytic behavior affect the chlorine reaction in the presence of deposits but the decisive mechanism is highly dependent on the dom characteristics and deposit types specifically catalytic behavior instead of adsorption is a dominant mechanism for copper corrosion products because the adsorption of dom on copper oxides has not been observed huang et al 2019 liu and croué 2016 in contrast the adsorption of dom on iron corrosion products and chlorination occur simultaneously the surface properties of ferric iron oxides such as the surface morphology and zeta potential were changed due to dom adsorption rahman and gagnon 2014 safiur rahman et al 2013 the dom particles can form an organic layer of approximately 1 2 nm thick and then change the surface charge from positive to negative wang et al 2019 generally iron deposits take part in many reactions including adsorption complexation and catalysis which may increase the total amount as well as stimulate the reactivity of dbp precursors therefore questions arise about how to quantify the contribution of iron deposits to the increased dbp precursors in dwds which mechanism significantly affects the reactivity of dbp precursor reaction models were developed to help answer these questions given the significance of the reaction between chlorine dom and deposits in dwds the first objective of this study is to simulate residual chlorine thm and individual thm species concentrations in the presence of iron deposits through the chlorine decay thm formation kinetics models the investigated factors include the type and dosages of deposits the compositions and characteristics of the dom and the initial chlorine concentrations iccs the second objective is to evaluate the applicability of the proposed models under the following two conditions chlorination of specific water at identical iccs with different dosages of iron deposits and chlorination of specific water at different iccs in the presence of a certain amount of deposits kinetic models were developed considering influences of adsorption and catalysis conversely models are helpful to 1 quantify the enhancement of chlorine demand and thm formation potential 2 evaluate the co effects of adsorption and catalysis that stimulate the reactivity of thm precursors 2 material and methods 2 1 chemical determination filtered water before final disinfection was collected from the hosterwitz hwt drinking water treatment plant located in the state of saxony germany in 2018 samples were collected in pre cleaned dissolved organic carbon doc free bottles and stored at 4 c until analysis citric acid ca a low molecular weight organic acid that is poorly removed by the conventional drinking water treatment process was chosen as one of the dom models in this study humic acid ha is the most important reactive fraction of dom and was chosen as another dom model the ha stock solution was prepared by dissolving commercial ha sigma aldrich switzerland at ph 12 naoh 2 mol l and stirred at room temperature for approximately 30 hours the solution was adjusted to neutral and then filtered through a 0 45 µm polycarbonate filter nuclepore track etched membrane whatman germany to remove suspended solids then the preparation of the ha and ca solutions at target aqueous phase concentrations was accomplished with distilled and deionized water the chlorine stock solution was prepared by diluting a concentrated sodium hypochlorite solution available chlorine with ultrapure water all chemicals were at least of analytical grade except where noted oxy hydroxides goethite α feooh and magnetite fe3o4 are the main crystalline iron minerals in the dwds as they have very low mobility and exist at the interface between the water phase and the pipe wall yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 they serve as barriers that protect the pipe from further corrosion this study focused on these two iron oxides i e goethite and magnetite which were purchased from a commercial agent sigma aldrich switzerland 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 adsorption envelopes adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the preferential adsorption of dom components onto goethite and magnetite as well as to establish the dom adsorption isotherm through a suitable mathematical expression the dom composition was fractionated based on liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd including biopolymers bp 10 kda humic substances hs building blocks bb low molecular weight acids lmw acids low molecular weight neutrals lmw neutrals and hydrophobic organic carbon hoc huber et al 2011 as the fraction of bb is considered a natural breakdown product of hs and is used to reflect hs like material of low molecular weight huber et al 2011 hs and bb are assumed to have similar characteristics therefore they were treated as one component and referred to as hs bb in this study the adsorption procedure followed the method described by safiur rahman et al 2013 generally the doc in ha and ca was set to seven different concentrations ranging from 1 0 to 16 0 mg c l while the particle dosage was set to a constant concentration of 2 0 g l the suspensions were shaken at 175 rpm using an orbital shaker at room temperature 20 1 c for 5 days to achieve equilibration the ph value was adjusted to 7 5 by 0 1 m naoh or hcl according to the previous study chun et al 2005 after 5 days the suspensions were first centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min and then filtered through 0 45 µm polycarbonate filters the filtered suspensions were immediately pipetted into glass vials for doc measurement the adsorption isotherm was calculated by the langmuir isotherm as shown in eq 1 safiur rahman et al 2013 schlautman and morgan 1994 the langmuir isotherm was selected for the analysis to estimate the dom adsorption capacity mg c g onto goethite and magnetite zhang et al 2016 it assumes that the absorbate forms a monolayer around the homogenous surface of the adsorbent 1 c e q e 1 k l q m 1 q m c e where q e mg c g deposits is the equilibrium adsorption capacity c e mg l is the equilibrium concentration k l l mg is the constant of the langmuir isotherm and q m is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg c g goethite or magnetite q m is calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot between c e q e and c e adsorption experiments were further conducted in parallel at different dosages of particles with constant dom in the same experimental setup the doc in ha and ca was set constantly to 5 mg c l mixing with a goethite magnetite dosage ranging from 0 2 to a maximum of 10 0 g l under extreme conditions control flasks containing no adsorbent were prepared and followed the same procedure as described above 2 2 2 chlorination experiments the combined effects of the iccs and goethite magnetite dosages on chlorine consumption and thm formation were investigated the experiment was conducted in 250 ml chlorine demand free bottles which were tightly sealed and placed in the dark during experiments a blank experiment was conducted in advance i e chlorination of dom free water with goethite or magnetite to determine if iron deposits alone would consume chlorine then the hwt ca and ha samples with 2 mg l dom were chlorinated in the absence of deposits 0 g l bulk water chlorination the same water samples were dosed with goethite or magnetite at 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 g l individually according to previous studies hu et al 2016 liu et al 2013 samples were then chlorinated at 12 0 mg cl2 l that recommended by zhao et al 2016 additionally the particle dosage was constant at 1 0 g l while the iccs ranged from 4 to 12 mg cl2 l following the same experimental setup before chlorination ph was adjusted to 7 2 with 0 1 mol l h2so4 or 0 1 mol l naoh solution and then 10 mm phosphate buffer solution was added to keep the ph stable the reaction time was from 2 h to a maximum of 168 h at the end of the reaction time the water sample was filtered through 0 45 µm polycarbonate filters the residual chlorine thm as well as iron concentrations in the filtered solution were determined immediately all experimental conditions were kept constant at a temperature of 20 c the more detailed method for chlorination is described elsewhere hua et al 2015 it should be noticed that treated drinking water is usually chlorinated at clear water tanks before entering dwds to further elucidate the influences of iron deposits on chlorine reaction with oxidized dom as the precursor the consumer s tap water tap water was employed and re chlorinated from may to june 2021 tap water was collected in an office building located in south china normal university china the households taps were flushed for 5 min and then filtered through 0 45 µm polycarbonate filters the doc of tap water was 2 68 0 10 mg l residual chlorine concentration was 0 51 0 06 mg l thm concentration was 26 95 4 50 µg l tap water was re chlorinated at 2 mg l in the absence and presence of goethite or magnetite 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 g l individually before re chlorination 10 mm phosphate buffer was given to keep the ph stable at the end of reaction time the samples were extracted residual chlorine thm concentration as well as iron concentrations were determined 2 3 analytical methods the free chlorine concentration was determined spectrophotometrically according to the dpd colorimetric standard method 4500 cl g from the american public health association the water samples were first quenched by the addition of sodium thiosulfate solution and the thm concentration was measured by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc 7890a ms 7000 agilent dom was measured as doc with a toc vcph analyzer equipped with an auto sampler asi v shimadzu corp the maximum standard deviation and coefficient of variance were set as 0 1 and 5 respectively the doc measurement was conducted repeatedly until the thresholds were satisfied the individual doc components were determined by lc ocd the iron concentration in the filtered solution was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer varian spectraa 220 fast sequential aas 220 z with the limit of quantification loq of 20 µg l zhang et al 2017 the ph value of each sample was determined at the end of chlorination by ph meter 340i wtw germany 2 4 model development 2 4 1 modeling chlorine decay in the presence of iron deposits the kinetics of chlorine decay in the presence of iron deposits can be expressed as follows 2 d c c l d t r b r d where r b is the bulk decay rate representing the reaction between chlorine and reactants in bulk water r d represents the reaction between chlorine iron deposits and adsorbed nom i e the deposits related reaction rate a second order model with a variable reaction rate coefficient was applied for predicting the chlorine concentration in bulk water hua et al 2015 jonkergouw et al 2009 as shown in eq 3 3 r b k c l b t c c l t c r b t α b e x p β b c r b t c c l m a x b c c l t c r b t where α b l mg h and β b dimensionless are model parameters related to the bulk reaction coefficient k c l b t c c l t mg l is the chlorine concentration c r b t mg l is the reactants concentration at time t c c l m a x b is the maximum chlorine demand in bulk water which represents total chlorine reactants entering the dwds i e c c l m a x b c r b 0 δ c r b t is the consumed reactant concentration at time t thus c r b t c r b 0 δ c r b t as the stoichiometric coefficient of chlorine and reactant is equal to one in bulk water the consumed reactant δ c r b t is equal to t 0 t r b t δ t based on the euler method finally the c r b t c c l m a x b t 0 t r b t δ t the bulk reaction coefficient k c l b is a function of α b β b and δ c r b t which is related to the reactivity of the reactant but independent of the initial chlorine dosage therefore once the model parameters α b and β b are calibrated by fitting to one chlorination dataset the constant parameters can be applied to predict all datasets with variable initial chlorine dosages in the operational range hua et al 2015 it is assumed that the deposits related decay rate r d is the first order concerning chlorine and reactant at deposits surfaces meanwhile the reactivity of adsorbed dom changes with reaction time thus similar to the bulk decay rate r d is calculated as follows 4 r d k c l d t c c l t c r d t α d e x p β d c r d t c c l m a x d c c l t c r d t where α d l mg h and β d dimensionless are model parameters related to the reaction coefficient k c l d t c c l m a x d mg l is the maximum chlorine demand and δ c r d t is the consumed reactant which are related to the deposit reaction δ c r d t t 0 t r d t δ t c c l m a x d c r d t by calculating t 0 t r d t δ t the influences of pipe deposits on chlorine consumption can be quantified substituting eqs 3 and 4 to eq 2 the overall chlorine decay kinetics in the presence of deposits was obtained it includes bulk reaction and deposits related reaction which can be solved numerically 2 4 2 modeling thm formation in the presence of iron deposits by analog to the chlorine decay model it is hypothesized that thm formation comprises thm formed in bulk water c thm b and thm contributed by deposits related reaction c thm d within the designated time interval δ t the yields of c thm b and c thm d are linear with their corresponding chlorine demand sathasivan et al 2020 then the overall thm model can be expressed as follows 5 c thm t α thm b t 0 t r b t δ t α thm d t 0 t r d t δ t α thm b c oth b α thm d c oth d c thm 0 where c oth b and c oth d are the chlorine demands that do not produce thm non productive chlorine demand in bulk water and at the pipe deposits respectively α thm b and α thm d are the specific thm formations in μmol mg of consumed chlorine c thm 0 is the thm concentration before chlorine is dosed in μm 2 4 3 evolutionary polynomial regression based on the model development eqs 3 and 4 it can be observed that the chlorine demand c cl max is an important parameter exploring the relationship between c cl max and dosages of iron oxides can facilitate model application and elucidate how deposits quantitatively affect chlorine consumption for this reason evolutionary polynomial regression epr which is a hybrid data driven technique and has been widely used in environmental fields was applied giustolisi and savic 2006 the following forms of function were used 6 y a 0 j 1 m a j f x 1 es j k 1 x 1 es j 2 k 1 where y is the maximum chlorine demand c cl max x k is the k th explanatory variable es is the matrix of unknown exponents a j is unknown polynomial coefficients m is the number of polynomial terms a 0 is the bias term and f is a function selected by the user the model parameter estimations were evaluated using the coefficient of determination cod while the model structure search was based on a genetic algorithm yang et al 2012 7 cod 1 n y y obs 2 n y obs y obs 2 2 4 4 model performance evaluation the best fit model parameters for chlorine decay i e α β and c cl max were obtained by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the experimentally determined residual chlorine concentrations and the simulations at corresponding times namely the sum of the squared errors sse likewise the best fit model parameters α thm c oth b and c oth d were also obtained by minimizing the sse of the experimentally determined total thm thm species concentrations and corresponding simulation results the model parameters were related to the concentration and composition of dom as well as the type and dosages of deposits it should be highlighted that these parameters were independent of the icc for the hwt water containing a specific type of deposits at a constant concentration the parameters were expected to be invariable when different iccs were spiked since the proposed model does not have an analytical solution the euler method was adopted to solve the model numerically with a time interval of 0 25 h excel solver which is based on the generalized reduced gradient algorithm was employed to obtain the best fit model parameters the models were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse dong and zhang 2021 yang et al 2021 all these methods have often been used as measures of the difference between the predicted data and those obtained experimentally piñeiro et al 2008 3 results 3 1 adsorption of dom on iron deposits the dom composition of the hwt treated water at the beginning and the equilibrium conditions with different dosages of goethite or magnetite are presented in figs 1 a and s1 respectively according to chromatography hs bb was the main component of the hwt water sample which accounted for approximately 80 of the total doc bp was limited in the treated water and totally removed by adsorption fig 1 a biopolymer dashed line lmw acid was not detected in the hwt water sample hoc varied randomly and no clear adsorption trend was observed because it was the remaining fraction of doc retained on the chromatographic column and not eluted quantitatively the concentrations of hs bb decreased substantially by approximately 50 at 10 g l for goethite and above 30 for magnetite indicating that hs and bb were the main components that were preferentially removed by adsorption fig 1 c the lmw neutral concentration only slightly decreased with magnetite from 0 295 mg l to 0 248 mg l and even increased with goethite from 0 295 mg l to 0 428 mg l fig 1 d generally the doc of a larger molecular weight fraction decreased preferentially while the doc with a low molecular weight fraction remained in solution the possible reason for the change of mw distribution is that the higher molecular weight compounds tend to be more aromatic and might have a larger number of reaction sites than the smaller molecular compounds which be preferentially adsorbed onto the surface of iron deposits rahman and gagnon 2014 langmuir isotherms which represent the 5 day adsorption capacity of ca and ha in the presence of goethite and magnetite are shown in fig s2 a and b the best fit isotherm parameters are summarized in table s1 student s t test revealed that there was no statistical significance between the langmuir isotherm model and experimental data α 0 05 p 0 05 considering the values of the regression coefficients r2 it was concluded that the experimental datasets moderately fit the langmuir isotherm model indicating monolayer adsorption the adsorption capacity of goethite was systematically higher than that of magnetite e g q m 4 99 mg g vs 2 36 mg g for the ha water sample the results are consistent with the fact that the bet surface area of goethite is higher than that of magnetite yang et al 2012 and goethite has a more positively charged surface facilitating the adsorption of negatively charged dom molecules safiur rahman et al 2013 based on the q m and langmuir isotherm model the amount of adsorbed ha and ca with regard to the different goethite magnetite dosages was simulated as shown in fig s2 c and d the adsorption affinity of ha was higher than that of ca for both goethite and magnetite under the same conditions the difference may have been driven by the physical and chemical properties of ha and ca such as molecular weight and molecular dynamic diameter the influence of the adsorption affinity on the chlorine reaction is discussed in the following section 3 2 effects of iron deposits on chlorine consumption ultrapure water containing 1 g l goethite or magnetite was spiked at an icc of 4 mg l and incubated at room temperature for 24 h the results show that 2 75 and 0 75 of the initial chlorine dosages were consumed by goethite and magnetite respectively indicating that the chlorine consumption by goethite or magnetite alone was quite limited the residual chlorine and thm concentrations in the hwt water for various goethite doses ranging from 0 to 2 g l are shown in fig s3 a and b respectively when iron oxides were present enhanced chlorine consumption was observed with an increasing ratio of 25 by 0 5 g l goethite increasing the iron oxide dosages led to even lower residual chlorine similar conclusions can be drawn for the chlorination of ha and ca when goethite or magnetite was present one of the reasonable explanations for this observation is the influence of adsorption due to the coexisting of dom the iron particles inevitably undergo structural transformation a recent study has reported that the feooh organic complex had a higher specific area and more oxygen containing groups zhuang et al 2020 the structure transformation may lead to an increased number of dom reactive sites making functional groups available for reactions that are not available in bulk water evanko and dzombak 1998 hassan et al 2006 moreover dom effectively reduced the iron particle sizes confirming the break of the aggregates into individual particles rahman and gagnon 2014 the individual particles may further undergo structural transformation and enhance the total budget of chlorine reactive sites the abovementioned explanation shows that chlorine consumption increased with increasing particle dosage but it fails to elucidate the variable consumption increment for different types of iron oxides specifically the maximum adsorption capacity q m of magnetite 2 36 mg g for ha is smaller than that of goethite 4 99 mg g considering the adsorption mechanism the chlorine consumption by magnetite would be theoretically lower than that by goethite however conflicting results were obtained i e the presence of magnetite led to a comparable or an even higher increase of chlorine consumption especially for ca sample as shown in fig 2 the results indicate that the increase in chlorine consumption was not only attributed to dom adsorption another possible explanation is the dissolution of iron oxides leading to the formation of ferrous ions fe2 which further reacted with chlorine to form the products of fe3 and hydroxyl radicals oh heeb et al 2014 hu et al 2016 the reaction between chlorine and ferrous ions was faster than that with dom thus the overall chlorine decay rate was accelerated in the presence of iron deposits considering this hypothesis the iron concentrations in different dom solutions were measured as shown in fig s4 the iron concentration in the solution with magnetite was generally higher than that in the goethite samples however the reason for the variation of iron concentration is unknown the iron concentration was not detected in hwt and tap water samples after chlorination the third explanation is that the catalyzing metals such as cu ni and cr may be adsorbed on iron oxides to catalyze the decomposition of hypochlorite ion fisher et al 2017 thus the metal composition of iron oxides after chlorination requires further investigation 3 3 effects of iron deposits on thm formation the specific tcm concentrations of different water samples spiked at an icc of 12 mg l icc of 2 mg l for tap water rechlorination in the presence of goethite and magnetite 0 g l to 2 g l at 168 h are shown in fig 3 for bulk water ca produced the highest specific tcm formation at 2 64 μmol mg doc which was nearly ten times higher than that of the hwt water at 0 29 μmol mg doc and two times higher than that of the ha water at 1 38 μmol mg doc ca has been reported to produce a large amount of tcm which through two step reactions i e an oxidative decarboxylation reaction followed by the subsequent chlorination of β ketoglutaric acid blatchley et al 2003 tsamba et al 2020 the presence of goethite magnetite enhanced the total tcm formation the first reason for this observation is similar to it for chlorine consumption i e the presence of iron oxides provides stronger surface reactions for tcm formation second the hydroxyl radical which is produced by the reaction between residual chlorine and ferrous ion oxidize dom to tcm precursor hu et al 2016 third the increased tcm formation may be attributed to degradation or transformation from other dbp species such as 1 1 1 trichloropropanone and or trichloroacetaldehyde hydrate chun et al 2005 as ph was kept stable the co effects of iron oxides and ph on thm formation are not discussed in the present study ph was measured for each sample at the beginning and end of reaction time the variations are given in fig s5 although iron oxides stimulated tcm formation the extent of enhancement was different specifically the tcm enhancement for ha in the presence of 2 g l goethite was 47 whereas it reached 114 for the hwt water especially for the ca sample with 2 g l goethite an increasing specific tcm concentration was observed at 8 28 μmol mg c which was three times higher than the tcm concentration in bulk water at 2 64 μmol mg c fig 3 a this illustrates that the characteristics of dom led to different extents of enhancement considering the ha sample with the highest suva254 among the three samples ha 5 45 l mg m hwt 1 55 l mg m ca 0 11 l mg m it is assumed that dom with a higher suva254 value exhibited a lower enhancement towards tcm formation furthermore the adsorption affinity of ha on goethite was consistently higher than that of ca fig s2 but the tcm enhancement of ha was less sensitive than that of ca this result indicates that the adsorption influence is not a decisive factor responsible for the tcm enhancement fig 3 b shows the tcm enhancement of different dom types in the presence of magnetite the growth percent for ha was still significantly lower than that for ca or the hwt water which is consistent with the previous conclusion that tcm enhancement of dom with higher suva254 was limited this further illustrates the importance of dom characteristics to tcm formation in the presence of iron based particles slight decreases in tcm for the hwt sample with goethite and ca with magnetite were observed fig 3 it is speculated that the adsorption of tcm outcompetes tcm formation which requires further investigation 4 discussion 4 1 chlorine decay kinetic model as shown previously adsorption and catalysis have a synergistic influence on chlorine consumption in the presence of iron deposits from a modeling standpoint the parameter of maximum chlorine demand c cl max and the reaction rate coefficients k cl are able to represent the influences of adsorption and catalysis respectively therefore c cl max d as well as parameters α d and β d k cl d f α d β d eq 4 were calibrated against each individual dataset regarding chlorination of the water sample in the absence and presence of iron oxides ranging from 0 5 to 2 g l the best fit parameters for the hwt sample are categorized by the type of iron oxide and summarized in table 1 the calibration and prediction procedures for simulating the chlorine decay kinetics of the ha ca and tap samples were the same as the procedure for the hwt sample likewise the best fit parameters for ha ca and tap are summarized in tables s2 s4 4 1 1 maximum chlorine demand the calibrated chlorine demand in bulk water c cl max b was constant at 5 01 mg l for the hwt sample but independent of iron oxide concentration this is because the concentration and characteristics of dom in bulk water are assumed to be stable at the adsorption equilibrium phase similarly the chlorine bulk demand c cl max b for the ha ca and tap samples were kept constant at 7 46 mg l 4 08 mg l and 2 06 mg l respectively tables s2 s4 the calibrated c cl max d increased with increasing concentrations of goethite or magnetite which is consistent with the previous hypothesis that more iron oxides provide more reactive sites the ca samples containing magnetite showed higher c cl max d than those containing goethite confirming the catalytic effects of iron oxides on chlorine consumption it should be noted that the chlorine decay model was calibrated against each dataset containing different dosages of iron oxides which limits the application of the model for this reason the relationship between c cl max and sample characteristics were obtained by applying data driven evolutionary polynomial regression epr analysis as shown in table s5 eight equations were obtained according to their selected explanatory variable numbers the fitness of equations to the observed data improved substantially when new explanatory variables were introduced considering that the maximum chlorine demand was affected by both the type of iron oxides and the dom characteristics function 8 was selected 4 1 2 reaction rate coefficients the deposits related rate coefficient at beginning of reaction time k d 0 which equals to α d eq 4 was consistently equal to or faster than the initial bulk rate coefficient α b for example 8 58e 3 l mg h k d 0 vs 6 33e 3 l mg h k b 0 for the hwt water 7 25e 2 l mg h vs 7 21e 3 l mg h for ha water table s2 and 1 88e 3 l mg h vs 9 59e 4 l mg h for the ca water table s3 constant parameters i e α b α d were observed for tap water as shown in table s4 this indicates that the iron oxides have limited influences on the reactivity of pre oxidized dom the model parameters including α b β b α d and β d were constantly applied to simulate the decay kinetics of the water samples chlorinated at any icc in the operational range taking the hwt water sample containing 1 g l goethite as an example the best fit α β and ccl max which were calibrated against the dataset of an icc at 12 mg l were applied to predict the chlorine decay kinetics of the hwt sample chlorinated at iccs of 4 and 7 mg l the best fit parameters were constant in this case as shown in table 1 similarly the model parameters for magnetite which were calibrated against the icc dataset at 12 mg l and 1 g l magnetite were further used to predict the chlorine decay of the hwt treated water that was spiked at 4 and 7 mg l with 1 g l magnetite this indicates that the chlorine decay model is able to provide accurate predictions in the presence of iron deposits by applying invariant parameters over the maximum time taken for water to travel through the dwds the goodness of curve fitting calibration for the hwt treated water samples chlorinated with identical iccs but containing different initial particle dosages are presented in fig 4 a and b fig 4 c and d illustrate the model prediction results by using invariant parameters for the hwt treated water containing constant iron oxides concentrations but spiked at different iccs as seen from the figures the proposed chlorine model described the experimental data moderately well with r 2 values ranging from 0 85 to 0 98 for a specific iron oxide there were no significant differences in model accuracy between chlorination conditions with different iccs and varied dosages the model fits the data in the ha ca and tap samples are presented in the supplementary information fig s6 fig s7 and fig s8 respectively with the assistant of the model the deposits related chlorine consumption t 0 t r d t δ t and dom related chlorine consumption t 0 t r b t δ t can be calculated at 168 h it was found that t 0 t r d t δ t accounted for 29 of total chlorine consumption for hwt 10 for ha and tap as well as 39 for ca samples 4 2 thm formation kinetic model the parameters of the thm formation model which were calibrated against chlorination datasets of the hwt sample containing variable iron oxide concentrations are summarized in table 2 the model fit to the data of the hwt sample is presented in fig 5 generally the model simulated well all measured concentrations of tcm dcbm and dbcm tbm was not detected in the hwt water 4 2 1 specific formation ratio as shown α tcm b α dcbm b α dbcm b is 85 13 2 which indicates that tcm was the major species in bulk water the bulk reaction related parameters including α thm b and c oth b were kept constant for predicting thm formation in the water samples with iron oxides the deposits reaction parameters including α thm d and c oth d were individually calibrated against datasets of goethite and magnetite with variable dosages in the presence of goethite the transformation ratio α tcm d α dcbm d α dbcm d is 93 6 1 α tcm increased from 85 for bulk reaction to 93 when deposits are present indicating a slight shift of thm to tcm formation a similar result was obtained by the rechlorination of the tap water sample in the absence and presence of iron deposits 4 2 2 nonproductive chlorine consumption the unproductive chlorine consumption c oth d generally increased with an increasing concentration of iron oxides as shown in fig 5 for hwt and fig s9 for tap two formation phases were observed take fig 5 d as an example the suppression of thm formation was observed in the first formation phase from 0 to 24 h while the second formation phase was accelerated as the nonproductive chlorine consumption was consumed in the first phase the second formation phase was contributed by both bulk and deposit related reactions graphically the model describes well the measured total thm and thm species as a function of time the goodness of fit is shown in table 2 for hwt and table s6 8 for the ha ca and tap samples for the hwt sample the sse value of tcm ranges from 6 05e 3 to 8 88e 2 generally the sse of the reaction in the presence of iron oxides was higher than it of the bulk reaction indicating the model performance was less effective when deposits were present as shown in fig 5 most errors occurred in the first phase of thm formation in particular the experimental results were underestimated in the hwt water containing 2 g l goethite fig 5 d or magnetite fig 5 g at 6 h this may be attributed to the parameter c oth d which was overestimated and further depressed the modeled thm concentration to improve the goodness of fit with respect to thm concentration in the first 6 hours the c oth d value was modified manually by doing so the model data overestimated thm formation from 24 hours until the end of the reaction time this may indicate that c oth d is not a constant for the overall reaction period but is variable along with the reaction time another possibility is that the total chlorine consumption was underestimated within the first 6 hours which resulted in an underestimation of thm formation due to the lack of datasets for the first 6 hours of reaction the abovementioned hypothesis requires further validation 4 3 implementation in the water distribution system it should be noted that the data obtained in this study were from the batch experiments which were different from the real hydraulic and transportation conditions in dwds the particles are settling at the bottom or the upper half of the horizontal pipes van thienen et al 2011 therefore the pipe diameter and mass transport should be considered further work will be required to identify whether the proposed model can be integrated with the mass transfer coefficient to provide reliable prediction results in real dwds in addition the real pipe deposits are usually covered with bacterial eps the exist of eps may decrease the adsorption sites that are available for dom thus the co effects of dom and eps on thm formation in the presence of iron based particles require evaluation 5 conclusions this study provided kinetics models to explain the interactions among chlorine dom and iron deposits based on the reliable prediction of the residual chlorine concentration as well as the concept that productive chlorine consumption is linearly related to thm or thm species formation the thm species model was validated for re chlorination of the four water samples containing goethite and magnetite at variable dosages with the assistance of mathematical models a better understanding of chlorine decay and thm formation in the presence of goethite and magnetite was obtained the major conclusions are 1 the reactivity of dom towards chlorine decay k cl and the thm transformation ratio α thm were enhanced in the presence of iron deposits mainly due to the catalysis mechanism the enhancement ratio is critically dependent on the dom characteristics and type of iron deposits but independent of the initial chlorine dosage 2 the maximum chlorine demand c cl max as well as the nonproductive chlorine consumption c oth increased with increasing particle dosages indicating that the number of chlorine reactive sites increased along with the pipe dosages which was attributed to the adsorption influences 3 the chlorine consumption of dom with higher suva254 values was stable in the presence of deposits whereas low molecular weight dom with hydrophilic characteristics is prone to be elevated by iron oxides iron oxides have limited influences on the reactivity of pre oxidized dom 4 the chlorine decay model provides predictions with invariant and fewer parameters for any initial chlorine dosages in the operational range the thm species model provided accurate thm thm species simulation results for bulk reactions however the prediction accuracy decreased for the deposits related reactions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16502,sulfamethoxazole smx has a high concentration and detection frequency in aquatic environments due to the poor removal efficiency of traditional biological treatment processes bioelectrochemical technology integrated constructed wetlands cws have great potential for smx removal however the process of smx removal in different bioelectrochemical technology integrated cws microbial fuel cell mfc and direct current ec remains unclear to address this we examined the mechanism of smx removal in mfccw and eccw the results revealed that the smx removal efficiency can reach 96 0 2 4 in the eccw and 97 2 2 2 in the mfccw the enhancement of mfc for smx removal in cw was slightly better than that in direct current p 0 05 it was found that the adsorption process of smx in the substrate promoted by ec was more enhanced than that by mfc furthermore bioelectrochemical technology improved plant activity including root and enzymatic superoxide dismutase peroxidase and catalase activities and fluorescence parameters photochemical quenching coefficient non photochemical quenching coefficient and quantum efficiency of ps ii significant differences were found between cw and eccw p 0 05 while no significant differences were found between cw and mfccw p 0 05 the microbial activity and abundance in cw were improved by bioelectrochemical technology and the microbial community structure was optimised to be simpler and more stable however ec tended to promote microbial and plant activity in cw whereas mfc tended to optimise the microbial community and improve the tightness and stability of the module the enhanced difference might also account for the changes in the smx degradation pathway 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid tp174 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole tp99 and 5 methylisoxazole tp84 were all common products in the three reactors whereas tp99 underwent further ring opening in mfccw and tp174 underwent further hydrolysis in eccw this study provided an important reference for the targeted regulation of plants and microorganisms in constructed wetlands via different bioelectrochemistry to enhance characteristic pollutants degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial fuel cell direct current constructed wetland sulfamethoxazole removal enhanced mechanism removal mechanism 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx is the first sulfonamide antibiotic commonly used to treat diseases and infections ying et al 2017 however the removal efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics by sewage treatment plants is unsatisfactory wang et al 2021 moreover domestic sewage is rarely treated effectively in rural areas and thus becomes a major source of antibiotics in aquatic environments additionally the smx metabolic rate in the human body only 45 0 is poor cribb and spielberg 1992 the degradation rate of smx was only 16 0 after illumination for 11 days in natural aquatic environments poirier larabie et al 2016 and its low maximum baseline concentration of 6 9 10 2 mg l 1 meng et al 2015 can pose a great potential risk to ecosystems constructed wetlands cws are an environmentally friendly and economical technology for treating several sewage pollutants via the combined effects of physical chemical and biological processes zhao et al 2019 chen et al 2019a where biodegradation is considered to be the main contributor to the removal of most pollutants however smx removal was limited due to the slow oxygen transport rate and low metabolic activity of microorganisms liu et al 2019 resulting in the accumulation of antibiotics in the substrate and limiting the ability of microorganisms to capture and degrade sulfonamides bioelectrochemical technology a low environmental impact enhanced technology with zero or minimal energy input wang et al 2021 can regulate electro active microorganisms with extracellular electron transfer function and accelerate the exchange of energy and information via a potential difference compared to traditional cws bioelectrochemical technology integrated cws are capable of more efficient and stable removal of sulfonamide antibiotics zhang et al 2018 2016a bioelectrochemical technology integrated cws are mainly divided into microbial fuel cell integrated cws mfccw and direct current voltage 1 2 v integrated cws eccw these can meet the required redox gradient of an mfc operation anaerobic anodes in the bottom layer and aerobic cathodes in the surface layer yadav et al 2012 reported the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewater by mfccw for the first time and the system was widely applied in wastewater treatment in recent years most studies have focused on improving the performance of mfccw for electricity generation and removal of traditional pollutants e g chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen by optimising electrode materials and system configuration doherty et al 2015 guo et al 2014 wen et al 2020 additionally mfccw showed good antibiotic removal efficiency zhang et al 2018 degradation products electricity generation microbial community structure influencing factors electrode material and antibiotic resistance gene occurrence have also been studied zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a 2016b in eccw electrons protons and co2 were generated through electro active bacteria on the anode surface under the stimulation of a stable low voltage direct current the electrons collected by the anode can reach the cathode through the external circuit and then combine with protons to produce hydrogen parkhey and gupta 2017 however oxygen is preferred as an electron acceptor at the cathode wang et al 2015 the anode reactions of ec and mfc were the same however the redox potential of the ec cathode was lower than that of the anode as a result of which electrons could not flow spontaneously in the external circuit therefore voltage was increased to overcome the energy barrier the applied voltage was generally 0 3 0 8 v in the actual reaction due to overpotential generation which was still less than the required voltage in water electrolysis 1 2 v kinoshita 1992 as an emerging pollution control technology it has also been applied to the removal of antibiotics xue et al 2019 and ammonia villano et al 2013 and can achieve an smx removal efficiency of more than 70 guo et al 2017 reported that microbial electrolysis cells positively change the acidogenesis pathway and regulate the anaerobic digestion process srivastava et al 2018 found that bioelectrochemical systems can significantly improve nitrogen removal in cw however it needs to be explored further if antibiotic removal in cw can be enhanced by ec due to the lack of related studies on antibiotic removal in eccw there were many similarities between mfccw and eccw however the operating conditions and reaction processes were different most studies on mfccw and eccw have focused on nitrogen removal only one study reported the difference between mfccw and eccw where nh4 removal efficiency in eccw was higher than that of mfccw at 10 c yu et al 2020 eccws with lower internal resistance have more advantages in promoting the electron transfer process xia et al 2020 however the differences in antibiotic removal between mfccw and eccw were not identified and studies of antibiotic removal were only performed on mfccws zhang et al 2018 2016b wen et al 2021 zhang et al 2017b additionally these published studies focused on the advantages of bioelectrochemical technology itself whereas the impact on the overall microecology of cw was ignored moreover knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic removal in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw is limited due to the lack of comparative studies between bioelectricity and direct current on intensified smx removal in cw considering the application prospects in the treatment of antibiotic containing domestic sewage further studies are urgently needed to provide important support for optimising bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw operation and efficient removal of toxic and harmful pollutants in this study an in situ electron transport pathway was constructed to investigate the enhanced performance of mfc and ec in smx removal and analyse the effects on the microecology of cw based on multiple factors coupled with substrates plants and microorganisms the differences in the mechanism of smx removal between mfccw and eccw were revealed this study provides solid technical support for the optimisation of cw and makes the treatment of domestic wastewater containing antibiotics more sustainable and efficient 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of reactors the traditional cw cw mfccw and eccw four replicates designed in a vertical flow style were constructed in a greenhouse at 25 3 c and covered with black adhesive tape fig 1 each reactor consisted of a perspex tube cylinder with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 55 cm with 5 cm of a uniform water distribution layer as described in a previous study liu et al 2020a the main substrate layer consisted of gravel φ 6 8 mm 5 cm in height and zeolite φ 3 5 mm 48 cm in contrast to cw activated carbon titanium mesh composite electrodes were used as the anode and cathode in mfccw and eccw and the details are provided in the supporting information text s1 additionally mfccw with open circuit modes accw and ec integrated system without substrates ec p other parts are the same as eccw fig s1 were constructed to identify the effect of the activated carbon layer and quantify the contributions of plant uptake and rhizosphere microorganisms to smx removal smx purity 98 was purchased from anpel shanghai china the details of the physicochemical properties are provided in table s1 an acclimation process for microorganisms with synthetic wastewater was performed for approximately 100 d thereafter the experiment was started by feeding smx of 1000 μg l 1 into the systems with peristaltic pump all systems were operated in an up flow continuous mode with a hydraulic retention time of 1 5 d the compositions of synthetic wastewater simulated domestic sewage are provided in the supporting information text s2 2 2 sample collection and determination the influent and effluent were sampled every 2 d during the first 10 days and then every 7 d substrate and plant samples of smx were collected at 230 d smx and intermediate products were determined by hplc ms ms 8040 shimadzu japan and uplc qtof ms sciex concord on canada respectively and detailed information are provided in

chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were measured using an imaging pam chlorophyll fluorometer heinzwalz gmb h effeltrich germany 2 4 microbial community and molecular ecological networks analysis

low quality sequences and the screening of high quality sequences with a 97 identity threshold was performed following the methodology of wang et al 2019 picrust analysis was performed to predict the

information is provided in the supporting information text s7 2 5 analysis of morphology and activity of biofilm and the ft ir spectra of zeolite scanning electron microscopy sem su3500 japan was used to characterise the surface morphology of the zeolite samples before and after the experiment the bacterial activity on the substrate surface was analysed using an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm780 germany the biofilm samples were stained with the live dead baclight staining kit for bacterial activity l7012 molecular probes invitrogen usa dehydrogenase activity was determined using triphenyltetrazolium chloride colorimetry zhang et al 2010 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy vertex 70 germany was used to analyse the functional groups of the zeolite before and after the experiment in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 2 6 statistical analysis all assays were conducted in triplicate analysis of variance was used to compare results by group where p 0 05 was considered statistically significant spss 20 0 matlab was used to cluster 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioelectrochemical technology improves smx removal in cw the entire operation period was divided into four stages in all reactors stage i without smx lasted from day 1 to day 100 to allow the biofilm to develop and start the bioelectrochemical technology successfully in summary the voltage of the mfccw was approximately 330 400 mv it was increased and substantially stabilised with an incubation period of 100 days fig s3 where the average voltage was 384 56 44 49 mv liu et al 2020a the voltage of mfccw decreased when smx was added 341 28 23 69 mv which might be due to the toxic effects of smx on the electro active bacteria stage ⅱ lasted from days 101 to 110 and showed the decreased removal efficiencies of smx until day 110 to the lowest point of 71 1 0 8 eccw 76 5 1 1 mfccw and 52 6 0 9 cw stage iii lasted from days 111 to 120 showed increased removal efficiencies of smx and then tended to stabilise stage ⅳ lasted from days 121 to 230 and showed stable and high removal efficiencies between 85 1 99 2 fig 2 which was higher than that in most traditional cws 30 8 95 0 hijosa valsero et al 2011 liu et al 2014 2020b and sewage treatment plants from 107 8 to 74 9 tran et al 2016 blair et al 2015 gros et al 2006 in summary smx removal efficiencies in mfccw and eccw were more stable and significantly higher than cw p 0 05 the average smx removal efficiency in mfccw 97 2 2 2 was 9 4 higher than cw 87 8 1 8 in contrast a large specific surface area of activated carbon rice husk carbon has been reported in several studies zhang et al 2017c liu et al 2012 which can promote the adsorption of smx and provide a carbon source and large adhesion area for microbial growth although the contribution was limited see section 3 2 some organic pollutants can be consumed in the anode layer of mfccw to produce electron flow increasing the metabolic rate of anaerobic bacteria srivastava et al 2015 additionally the micro electric field also plays a beneficial role in regulating the overall microbial community structure in cw cheng et al 2016 si et al 2019 which might improve the degradation of smx by antibiotic degrading bacteria the average smx removal efficiency in the eccw 96 0 2 4 was 8 2 higher than that in cw compared with mfccw the electron transfer efficiencies in eccw were higher because of the stable electric potential difference of the direct current wang et al 2016 it has been reported that pollutant removal performance in the soil is enhanced by conductive materials which mediate the interspecific electron transfer in bacteria rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 theoretically the contribution of electrocatalytic degradation for smx removal was supposed to be ignored where the voltage of eccw 0 3 0 4 v was lower than the standard voltage of hydrogen production by water electrolysis 1 2 v therefore the enhanced effect of ec on cw was mainly dependent on the extracellular electron transfer process of electro active bacteria attached to the electrode surface even if oh cannot be produced in the cathode activated carbon as one of the electrodes under the action of a microcurrent can also promote electron transfer between the anode and cathode zhang et al 2018 wu et al 2017 3 2 contribution of substrate adsorption plant uptake and biodegradation to smx removal it has been reported that the hydrolysis of smx is weak under neutral or alkaline conditions halling sørensen 2000 where the ph value of the influent was 7 1 0 2 additionally all reactors were wrapped in black plastic bags to avoid the effects of light therefore the effects of hydrolysis and photodegradation were negligible smx removal mainly depends on substrate adsorption plant uptake and biodegradation the contribution rate of the smx removal pathways was calculated and the results are shown in fig 3 biodegradation by microorganisms attached to substrate and plant root was the main removal pathway of smx in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw with a contribution rate of over 90 which was further confirmed by degradation experiments in shaking flasks by sterilised and unsterilized substrate covered biofilm from the system fig s4 miran et al 2018 also found that biodegradation was the main factor driving smx removal additionally the contribution rate of plant uptake and rhizosphere microorganisms to smx removal was approximately 16 9 25 7 fig s5 through smx removal efficiency in ec p ignoring the synergistic effect between plant and substrate microorganisms due to the lack of quantitative methods it was inferred that the microorganisms attached to the substrate contributed the most to smx removal substrate adsorption accounted for approximately 3 0 10 3 2 9 10 1 of the total influent load which might be due to lower octanol water partition coefficient logk ow 0 89 a et al 2013 compared with cw the substrate adsorption capacity was improved by bioelectrochemical technology however the enhanced effect was still limited the contribution of plant uptake to smx removal was the smallest accounting for 4 4 10 2 1 3 10 1 plants promote smx removal mainly through indirect action such as ameliorating the environmental conditions of rhizosphere microorganisms liang et al 2018 kurade et al 2019 and promoting the secretion of plant root exudates wang et al 2017 although the contribution of substrate adsorption and plant uptake in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw was less than 1 the substrate and plant were still an important part of the system and provided a conducive environment for microbial growth the contributions were all improved by bioelectrochemical technology and a more detailed analysis is presented in sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 3 bioelectrochemistry promotes smx adsorption in zeolite as shown in fig s6 the contents of smx in the substrate layer in mfccw and eccw were 51 6 and 82 1 ng g 1 respectively which were 64 5 times and 102 6 times higher than that of cw 0 8 ng g 1 respectively the smx contents in mfccw and eccw followed the order of cathode layer anode layer and middle layer which might be due to high microbial abundance in the anode layer table s3 that promoted smx degradation additionally the activated carbon of the electrode layer had a large specific surface area which enhanced the adsorption capacity of smx however the limited contribution of activated carbon for smx removal in cw was further confirmed by accw in the long term the smx removal efficiency in accw 89 8 1 4 fig s7 was only 2 0 higher than that of cw p 0 05 therefore the promotion effect of the activated carbon layer on the overall performance of cw was not significant however it contributed to the higher removal efficiency and effluent stability of smx in the early operational stage of bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw the smx contents in the zeolite layer in mfccw and eccw were 7 8 0 7 ng g 1 and 6 8 0 3 ng g 1 respectively which were 9 8 times and 8 5 times higher than that of cw respectively wen et al 2020 also showed that micro currents could enhance the adsorption capacity of smx on a substrate ft ir analysis also showed that the amount of oxygen containing functional groups fig s8 in mfccw and eccw were significantly higher than those in cw detailed analysis is shown in supporting information text s8 which can promote the adsorption of smx han 2009 the enhanced effect of mfc was significantly higher than that of ec p 0 05 additionally the ion diffusion rate can be accelerated by an electric field which promotes the interfacial transport of smx between the zeolite and biofilm wang et al 2002 the adsorption quantity of smx in the zeolite of cw was much lower than that obtained by the shaking flask experiment 2 7 103 ng g 1 liu et al 2020c which might be related to the interfacial exchange between the zeolite and biofilm 3 4 bioelectrochemistry improves plant activity and smx uptake as shown in fig s9 the contents of smx in root were 194 8 ng g 1 mfccw and 154 5 ng g 1 mfccw respectively which were 2 7 and 2 1 times higher than that of cw 72 3 ng g 1 respectively compared with mfc ec with stable and constant voltage was more conducive to improving the capacity of plant uptake for smx in cw which might be attributed to higher root activity in eccw fig 5 additionally the contents of smx in different organs of cyperus alternifolius followed the order of root 72 3 194 8 ng g 1 stem and leaf 0 7 15 2 ng g 1 dodgen et al 2015 and dudley et al 2018 also found that the enrichment factor of smx in roots was twice as high as than that in leaves and buds a slight terminal accumulation was observed in cyperus alternifolius in eccw which was due to the enhancement of the ability of leaf cells to transport substances by direct electric fields lu et al 2010 additionally smx mainly existed in anion form with an influent ph value of 7 1 0 2 where the dissociation constants were 1 6 pk a 1 and 5 7 pk a 2 liu et al 2019 anionic smx can easily cause xylem translocation goodman 1962 accelerating smx migration in plants and thus resulting in higher smx content in the leaves than in the stem the long distance migration characteristics of smx in cyperus alternifolius also show that smx can be transported over long distances from the leaf detailed information is presented in supporting information text s9 and fig s10 in summary the uptake capacity and transport rate of cyperus alternifolius for smx were all increased by bioelectrochemical technology in cw and the enhanced effect of ec was better than that of mfc as shown in fig 4 the root activity and the fluorescence electron transfer rate of leaves had all improved which was beneficial for cell protection lu et al 2010 plants can maintain intracellular homeostasis through antioxidant systems the balance between antibiotic intermediates and degradation cannot be maintained by the cellular system therefore it can result in damage to proteins lipids and dna farmer and mueller 2013 it was shown that antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat activities and cell repair factor expression were all improved by bioelectrochemical technology which was conducive to the absorption of smx the antioxidant mechanism of cyperus alternifolius was enhanced by micro current where malonaldehyde mda content followed the order of cw mfccw eccw which can reduce the stress damage caused by continuous smx input furthermore the energy capture efficiency of the psii reaction centre and the photosynthetic electron transfer ability of leaves can also be improved by electrical stimulation where the coefficient of photochemical qp showed a similar tendency to φpsⅱ it was inferred that ec might increase the activity of dna gyrase fromm and eschrich 1993 the key enzyme of photosynthetic electron transport in psii which can promote electron transport from psii to psi and the biosynthesis of chlorophyll vredenberg et al 2006 3 5 bioelectrochemistry improves microbial activity and optimizes microbial community structure 3 5 1 bioelectrochemistry improves microbial abundance and activity the biofilm on the substrate surface in mfccw and eccw was more uniform and denser than cw fig s11a and s10b which was related to the higher diversity and richness of bacteria in eccw and mfccw table s4 renslow et al 2013 indicated that external electrical stimulation can change the morphology of microbial cells and promote cell division the diversity and richness of bacteria in the mfccw were higher than those in the eccw compared with stable ec variable voltage pulse electrical stimulation of mfc fig s3 promoted microbial diversity where it appeared to be a phenomenon similar to compensation growth mechanism of biological wei et al 2009 this further indicates that mfccw is more adaptable to smx than eccw additionally clsm images showed that the substrate surface was nearly completely covered by living microbial cells fig s11c whereas the microbial activity of cw was low this phenomenon indicated that both bioelectrochemical techniques promoted the growth of active microorganisms on the substrate surface which was consistent with the higher dehydrogenase activity in eccw and mfccw fig s12 p 0 05 however the microbial activity in the eccw was higher than that in the mfccw which was not consistent with the characteristics of microbial abundance in eccw and mfccw thus ec tended to improve microbial activity in cw whereas mfc tended to promote microbial multiplication 3 5 2 bioelectrochemistry optimizes microbial community structure compared with those in cw as the important electrochemically active bacteria eab belonging to phylum proteobacteria croese et al 2014 and genus geobacter yang et al 2019 were significantly enriched in the anode layer in eccw and mfccw p 0 05 fig 5 indicating that bioelectrochemical technology had successfully started and also ensured a high extracellular electron transfer rate and metabolic rate in eccw and mfccw by picrust analysis figs s13 and s14 supporting information text s10 additionally the relative abundance of eab in the anode layer in the eccw was significantly higher than that in the mfccw p 0 05 which was consistent with the extracellular electron transfer rate of the biological phase fig s13 in the later stage of operation the direct current power supply of the eccw was removed and then converted into mfccw 1 connected with an external resistance where the voltage of the mfccw was approximately 500 mv fig s15 the voltage decreased to 409 6 16 7 mv after 40 days of operation which was still higher than mfccw 327 2 14 2 mv this further indicates that the electron transfer rate of the electrode layer in the eccw was higher than that in the mfccw bioelectrochemical technology significantly changed the microbial community structure figs s16 s18 and supporting information text s11 to further reveal the effect of bioelectrochemical technology on the overall microbial structure of cw mens based on the original otu were constructed for mfc w eccw and cw respectively the average connectivity average path length average aggregation coefficient and modularity of the molecular networks were larger than the random networks table 1 the average clustering coefficient of mfccw was significantly higher than that of eccw p 0 05 indicating that the mfccw had a higher degree of modularity the average path distance of mfccw was significantly lower than that of eccw p 0 01 suggesting that the transmission of substances information and energy exchange among microorganisms was faster in mfccw maslov and sneppen 2002 the molecular network modules of mfccw were higher than those of eccw and cw where the modularity of mf cw eccw and cw were 0 876 0 774 and 0 682 respectively the same module represents the same microbial population with the same niche and the number of niches in the community can be represented by the module numbers wang et al 2018 the niche amount of mfccw was increased which prevented direct competition among populations and ensured the stability of the microbial community the niche amount between eccw and cw was not significantly different p 0 05 indicating that ec had little effect on the interaction between microbial communities to study the changes in the microbial molecular network intuitively the module of the node with connectivity over 35 was analysed visually as shown in fig 6 compared with cw the connection between modules in the mfccw was weaker whereas the internal connection was closer the number of modules in the eccw decreased significantly where the relationship between microorganisms tended to be concentrated in a few modules these results showed a closer relationship between microbial populations and the overall microbial community in mfccw was more stable whereas the interaction of some species was strengthened in eccw topologically different nodes play distinct roles in a network which can be used as a basis for determining the key species in this study nodes were classified as peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs based on their among module connectivity pi and within module connectivity zi olesen et al 2007 nodes of module hubs connectors and network hubs are regarded as the key species deng et al 2012 the connectivity of all modules in the mfccw eccw and cw are shown in fig s19 most of the nodes were peripheral accounting for 99 6 cw 99 4 mfccw and 99 5 eccw there were no central nodes in any of the mens the key species of cw mfccw and eccw were different with six species belonging to the module centre node and connection node in mfccw they were classified as proteobacteria otu7261 otu801 and otu7046 actinobacteria otu6232 and otu7050 and planctomycetes otu1965 respectively six key species of chloroflexi otu294 spirochaetes otu6211 firmicutes otu6245 proteobacteria otu638 and otu1782 and lentisphaerae otu6214 belonged to eccw whereas two key species chloroflexi otu3543 and proteobacteria otu4339 were found in the cw pan et al 2020 have shown that the presence of a module central node can enhance the stability of mens where it is generally used as an important functional microorganism or a key microbial medium connecting other microbial groups it was indicated that the stability of mens in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw with more module centre nodes was higher than that of cw both proteobacteria otu7046 and actinobacteria otu6232 and otu7050 were the key bacteria in mfccw whereas lentisphaerae otu6214 and chloroflex otu3543 were the key linkers in eccw and cw respectively it has been reported that otu6232 belongs to nocardioides which can degrade sulfanilamide antibiotics chen et al 2019b 3 6 degradation products and mechanism of smx the intermediate products of smx fig s20 and table s5 in mfccw and eccw were detected by uplc qtof ms to reveal the different effects of ec and mfc on smx removal in cw the possible degradation pathways of smx were proposed and compared as shown in fig s21 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid tp174 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole tp99 and 5 methylisoxazole tp84 were all common products in mfccw eccw and cw it has been reported that the active sites of smx including free amino and sulfonyl groups on the benzene ring and unsaturated c c and ch3 on the isoxazole ring are vulnerable to attack gao et al 2016 tp99 and tp174 were the main products of smx biodegradation jiang et al 2014 bonvin et al 2013 attributed to the hydrolysis of the s n bond of the sulfonyl group the formation of tp84 could be ascribed to the deamination of tp99 by deaminase zhang et al 2017b additionally five other intermediate products m h of smx in cw were also identified with peaks at m z 284 1504 204 1643 270 0051 288 1063 and 304 0618 namely tp284 tp204 tp270a tp288 and tp304 respectively 4 no2 smx tp284 is also an intermediate product of smx biodegradation which is generally considered as a secondary product of no smx however no smx with half lives of 47 1 h was not detected because of its low concentration and instability in this study bonvin et al 2013 it was believed that tp284 the main intermediate product of nitrification was ascribed to the oxidation of smx by ammonia oxidising bacteria kassotaki et al 2016 which is related to the nonspecific co metabolic biotransformation of antibiotics by ammonia monooxygenase luo et al 2014 tp284 can be further broken via microbial metabolism to form tp204 tp270a could be formed by electrophilic substitution of the h atom on the c c bond of the benzene ring thereafter tp288 was formed by further oxidation electrophilic substitution and addition reaction which is a common product in the sulfate reducing bacteria sludge system for smx co metabolism jia et al 2017 tp304 was obtained owing to the electrophilic substitution of the h atom on the c atom of the benzene ring of tp288 compared with cw six other products namely tp270b tp256 tp225 tp190 and tp217 respectively were also found in mfccw the isoxazole ring of tp84 was broken and transformed into isopropanol tp61 because of the enhanced effect of mfc on microorganisms zhang et al 2018 also reported the formation of isopropanol in a biofilm reactor tp156 was obtained owing to the electrophilic substitution of ch3 on the smx isoxazole ring subsequently the isoxazole ring was opened for tp225 formation tp190 was obtained because of the substitution reaction of the h atom of nh2 in the side chain of the benzene ring and the fracture of the s n bond tp284 was converted to tp217 due to the fracture of the s n bond by oxidation with microorganisms the formation of tp270b was due to the electrophilic substitution of the h atom on the c atom of the benzene ring which was also discovered in a water sediment test for biodegradation of smx photo transformation products biodegradation su et al 2016 these products can be further decomposed into simple molecules such as methane carbon dioxide and water under microorganism metabolism tp174 tp99 tp84 tp304 tp270a and tp288 were all detected in eccw and cw which were attributed to microorganism co metabolism in cw tp274 formation could be ascribed to the electrochemical reduction and addition reaction of the no bond of the isoxazole ring furthermore n 4 aminophenyl sulfonyl carbamate tp216 was formed due to further oxidation the cleavage of the no bond is an important process of smx biotransformation under sulfate reduction where it is a biological reduction reaction catalysed by nadh dependent reductase zhang et al 2008 tp174 could be formed due to constant direct current stimulation and then s n was attacked to form tp94 these four products might be related to the electrochemical redox reaction on the electrode surface in the eccw in summary the metabolic processes of smx and its products in cw were changed by bioelectrochemical technology where mfc enhanced the further cleavage of the isoxazole ring and the further hydrolysis of the sulfonyl group was enhanced by ec the intensities of the main products in mfccw and eccw are further studied in fig s22 it was shown that the intensity of tp174 and tp99 in the effluent from the bottom of the anode layer reached a maximum and then gradually degraded suggesting that the anode might contribute to the higher smx removal and produce products the intensity of tp84 in the effluent from the top of the anode layer was also the maximum tp99 tp84 aniline the product of tp174 was mainly removed at the cathode in the eccw whereas isopropanol the product of tp84 was mainly removed at the zeolite layer and cathode layer in mfccw the zeolite layer also contributed to product degradation additionally the smx removal efficiency at different heights in mfccw and eccw measured in this study table s6 also showed that the contribution rate of the anode to smx removal was higher than that of the cathode the acute toxicity effect of tp174 tp99 and tp84 on fish predicted by the ecological structure activity relationships predictive model was significantly lower than smx fig s23 chronic toxicity chv of smx and other products on fish daphnia and algae were all higher than those of acute toxicity all products except tp304 and tp190 were harmful to daphnia where the chv concentration was less than 100 mg l 1 only tp94 and tp217 were harmful to acute toxicity in fish where lc50 or ec50 ranged from 10 to 100 mg l 1 4 conclusions bioelectrochemical technology promotes smx removal in cw by improving substrate adsorption capacity plant activity and microbial richness biodegradation is a key contributor to smx removal in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cws the microbial response to bioelectrochemistry was different between mfccw and eccw the microbial community structure in mfccw tended to be more diversified and compact and the relationship between microorganisms in the module was closer and more stable the higher microbial activity and plant activity in the eccw provided a guarantee of a stable electron transfer rate of the electrode layer additionally the difference in enhanced bioelectrochemical technology for cw might result in different degradation pathways of smx in which tp99 was further ring opened in mfccw and tp174 was further hydrolysed in eccw however this process needs to be further verified by stoichiometry and

16502,sulfamethoxazole smx has a high concentration and detection frequency in aquatic environments due to the poor removal efficiency of traditional biological treatment processes bioelectrochemical technology integrated constructed wetlands cws have great potential for smx removal however the process of smx removal in different bioelectrochemical technology integrated cws microbial fuel cell mfc and direct current ec remains unclear to address this we examined the mechanism of smx removal in mfccw and eccw the results revealed that the smx removal efficiency can reach 96 0 2 4 in the eccw and 97 2 2 2 in the mfccw the enhancement of mfc for smx removal in cw was slightly better than that in direct current p 0 05 it was found that the adsorption process of smx in the substrate promoted by ec was more enhanced than that by mfc furthermore bioelectrochemical technology improved plant activity including root and enzymatic superoxide dismutase peroxidase and catalase activities and fluorescence parameters photochemical quenching coefficient non photochemical quenching coefficient and quantum efficiency of ps ii significant differences were found between cw and eccw p 0 05 while no significant differences were found between cw and mfccw p 0 05 the microbial activity and abundance in cw were improved by bioelectrochemical technology and the microbial community structure was optimised to be simpler and more stable however ec tended to promote microbial and plant activity in cw whereas mfc tended to optimise the microbial community and improve the tightness and stability of the module the enhanced difference might also account for the changes in the smx degradation pathway 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid tp174 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole tp99 and 5 methylisoxazole tp84 were all common products in the three reactors whereas tp99 underwent further ring opening in mfccw and tp174 underwent further hydrolysis in eccw this study provided an important reference for the targeted regulation of plants and microorganisms in constructed wetlands via different bioelectrochemistry to enhance characteristic pollutants degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial fuel cell direct current constructed wetland sulfamethoxazole removal enhanced mechanism removal mechanism 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx is the first sulfonamide antibiotic commonly used to treat diseases and infections ying et al 2017 however the removal efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics by sewage treatment plants is unsatisfactory wang et al 2021 moreover domestic sewage is rarely treated effectively in rural areas and thus becomes a major source of antibiotics in aquatic environments additionally the smx metabolic rate in the human body only 45 0 is poor cribb and spielberg 1992 the degradation rate of smx was only 16 0 after illumination for 11 days in natural aquatic environments poirier larabie et al 2016 and its low maximum baseline concentration of 6 9 10 2 mg l 1 meng et al 2015 can pose a great potential risk to ecosystems constructed wetlands cws are an environmentally friendly and economical technology for treating several sewage pollutants via the combined effects of physical chemical and biological processes zhao et al 2019 chen et al 2019a where biodegradation is considered to be the main contributor to the removal of most pollutants however smx removal was limited due to the slow oxygen transport rate and low metabolic activity of microorganisms liu et al 2019 resulting in the accumulation of antibiotics in the substrate and limiting the ability of microorganisms to capture and degrade sulfonamides bioelectrochemical technology a low environmental impact enhanced technology with zero or minimal energy input wang et al 2021 can regulate electro active microorganisms with extracellular electron transfer function and accelerate the exchange of energy and information via a potential difference compared to traditional cws bioelectrochemical technology integrated cws are capable of more efficient and stable removal of sulfonamide antibiotics zhang et al 2018 2016a bioelectrochemical technology integrated cws are mainly divided into microbial fuel cell integrated cws mfccw and direct current voltage 1 2 v integrated cws eccw these can meet the required redox gradient of an mfc operation anaerobic anodes in the bottom layer and aerobic cathodes in the surface layer yadav et al 2012 reported the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewater by mfccw for the first time and the system was widely applied in wastewater treatment in recent years most studies have focused on improving the performance of mfccw for electricity generation and removal of traditional pollutants e g chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen by optimising electrode materials and system configuration doherty et al 2015 guo et al 2014 wen et al 2020 additionally mfccw showed good antibiotic removal efficiency zhang et al 2018 degradation products electricity generation microbial community structure influencing factors electrode material and antibiotic resistance gene occurrence have also been studied zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a 2016b in eccw electrons protons and co2 were generated through electro active bacteria on the anode surface under the stimulation of a stable low voltage direct current the electrons collected by the anode can reach the cathode through the external circuit and then combine with protons to produce hydrogen parkhey and gupta 2017 however oxygen is preferred as an electron acceptor at the cathode wang et al 2015 the anode reactions of ec and mfc were the same however the redox potential of the ec cathode was lower than that of the anode as a result of which electrons could not flow spontaneously in the external circuit therefore voltage was increased to overcome the energy barrier the applied voltage was generally 0 3 0 8 v in the actual reaction due to overpotential generation which was still less than the required voltage in water electrolysis 1 2 v kinoshita 1992 as an emerging pollution control technology it has also been applied to the removal of antibiotics xue et al 2019 and ammonia villano et al 2013 and can achieve an smx removal efficiency of more than 70 guo et al 2017 reported that microbial electrolysis cells positively change the acidogenesis pathway and regulate the anaerobic digestion process srivastava et al 2018 found that bioelectrochemical systems can significantly improve nitrogen removal in cw however it needs to be explored further if antibiotic removal in cw can be enhanced by ec due to the lack of related studies on antibiotic removal in eccw there were many similarities between mfccw and eccw however the operating conditions and reaction processes were different most studies on mfccw and eccw have focused on nitrogen removal only one study reported the difference between mfccw and eccw where nh4 removal efficiency in eccw was higher than that of mfccw at 10 c yu et al 2020 eccws with lower internal resistance have more advantages in promoting the electron transfer process xia et al 2020 however the differences in antibiotic removal between mfccw and eccw were not identified and studies of antibiotic removal were only performed on mfccws zhang et al 2018 2016b wen et al 2021 zhang et al 2017b additionally these published studies focused on the advantages of bioelectrochemical technology itself whereas the impact on the overall microecology of cw was ignored moreover knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic removal in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw is limited due to the lack of comparative studies between bioelectricity and direct current on intensified smx removal in cw considering the application prospects in the treatment of antibiotic containing domestic sewage further studies are urgently needed to provide important support for optimising bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw operation and efficient removal of toxic and harmful pollutants in this study an in situ electron transport pathway was constructed to investigate the enhanced performance of mfc and ec in smx removal and analyse the effects on the microecology of cw based on multiple factors coupled with substrates plants and microorganisms the differences in the mechanism of smx removal between mfccw and eccw were revealed this study provides solid technical support for the optimisation of cw and makes the treatment of domestic wastewater containing antibiotics more sustainable and efficient 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of reactors the traditional cw cw mfccw and eccw four replicates designed in a vertical flow style were constructed in a greenhouse at 25 3 c and covered with black adhesive tape fig 1 each reactor consisted of a perspex tube cylinder with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 55 cm with 5 cm of a uniform water distribution layer as described in a previous study liu et al 2020a the main substrate layer consisted of gravel φ 6 8 mm 5 cm in height and zeolite φ 3 5 mm 48 cm in contrast to cw activated carbon titanium mesh composite electrodes were used as the anode and cathode in mfccw and eccw and the details are provided in the supporting information text s1 additionally mfccw with open circuit modes accw and ec integrated system without substrates ec p other parts are the same as eccw fig s1 were constructed to identify the effect of the activated carbon layer and quantify the contributions of plant uptake and rhizosphere microorganisms to smx removal smx purity 98 was purchased from anpel shanghai china the details of the physicochemical properties are provided in table s1 an acclimation process for microorganisms with synthetic wastewater was performed for approximately 100 d thereafter the experiment was started by feeding smx of 1000 μg l 1 into the systems with peristaltic pump all systems were operated in an up flow continuous mode with a hydraulic retention time of 1 5 d the compositions of synthetic wastewater simulated domestic sewage are provided in the supporting information text s2 2 2 sample collection and determination the influent and effluent were sampled every 2 d during the first 10 days and then every 7 d substrate and plant samples of smx were collected at 230 d smx and intermediate products were determined by hplc ms ms 8040 shimadzu japan and uplc qtof ms sciex concord on canada respectively and detailed information are provided in

chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were measured using an imaging pam chlorophyll fluorometer heinzwalz gmb h effeltrich germany 2 4 microbial community and molecular ecological networks analysis substrate samples were collected at 30 90 160 and 230 d total dna was extracted from membranes using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the 338f 806r primers liu et al 2020a high throughput sequencing analysis was conducted using illumina miseq from majorbio shanghai china removal of low quality sequences and the screening of high quality sequences with a 97 identity threshold was performed following the methodology of wang et al 2019 picrust analysis was performed to predict the kegg orthology and kegg pathways from the bacterial community data construction and analysis of molecular ecological networks mens based on an online platform http ieg2 ou edu mena where detailed information is provided in the supporting information text s7 2 5 analysis of morphology and activity of biofilm and the ft ir spectra of zeolite scanning electron microscopy sem su3500 japan was used to characterise the surface morphology of the zeolite samples before and after the experiment the bacterial activity on the substrate surface was analysed using an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm780 germany the biofilm samples were stained with the live dead baclight staining kit for bacterial activity l7012 molecular probes invitrogen usa dehydrogenase activity was determined using triphenyltetrazolium chloride colorimetry zhang et al 2010 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy vertex 70 germany was used to analyse the functional groups of the zeolite before and after the experiment in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 2 6 statistical analysis all assays were conducted in triplicate analysis of variance was used to compare results by group where p 0 05 was considered statistically significant spss 20 0 matlab was used to cluster 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioelectrochemical technology improves smx removal in cw the entire operation period was divided into four stages in all reactors stage i without smx lasted from day 1 to day 100 to allow the biofilm to develop and start the bioelectrochemical technology successfully in summary the voltage of the mfccw was approximately 330 400 mv it was increased and substantially stabilised with an incubation period of 100 days fig s3 where the average voltage was 384 56 44 49 mv liu et al 2020a the voltage of mfccw decreased when smx was added 341 28 23 69 mv which might be due to the toxic effects of smx on the electro active bacteria stage ⅱ lasted from days 101 to 110 and showed the decreased removal efficiencies of smx until day 110 to the lowest point of 71 1 0 8 eccw 76 5 1 1 mfccw and 52 6 0 9 cw stage iii lasted from days 111 to 120 showed increased removal efficiencies of smx and then tended to stabilise stage ⅳ lasted from days 121 to 230 and showed stable and high removal efficiencies between 85 1 99 2 fig 2 which was higher than that in most traditional cws 30 8 95 0 hijosa valsero et al 2011 liu et al 2014 2020b and sewage treatment plants from 107 8 to 74 9 tran et al 2016 blair et al 2015 gros et al 2006 in summary smx removal efficiencies in mfccw and eccw were more stable and significantly higher than cw p 0 05 the average smx removal efficiency in mfccw 97 2 2 2 was 9 4 higher than cw 87 8 1 8 in contrast a large specific surface area of activated carbon rice husk carbon has been reported in several studies zhang et al 2017c liu et al 2012 which can promote the adsorption of smx and provide a carbon source and large adhesion area for microbial growth although the contribution was limited see section 3 2 some organic pollutants can be consumed in the anode layer of mfccw to produce electron flow increasing the metabolic rate of anaerobic bacteria srivastava et al 2015 additionally the micro electric field also plays a beneficial role in regulating the overall microbial community structure in cw cheng et al 2016 si et al 2019 which might improve the degradation of smx by antibiotic degrading bacteria the average smx removal efficiency in the eccw 96 0 2 4 was 8 2 higher than that in cw compared with mfccw the electron transfer efficiencies in eccw were higher because of the stable electric potential difference of the direct current wang et al 2016 it has been reported that pollutant removal performance in the soil is enhanced by conductive materials which mediate the interspecific electron transfer in bacteria rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 theoretically the contribution of electrocatalytic degradation for smx removal was supposed to be ignored where the voltage of eccw 0 3 0 4 v was lower than the standard voltage of hydrogen production by water electrolysis 1 2 v therefore the enhanced effect of ec on cw was mainly dependent on the extracellular electron transfer process of electro active bacteria attached to the electrode surface even if oh cannot be produced in the cathode activated carbon as one of the electrodes under the action of a microcurrent can also promote electron transfer between the anode and cathode zhang et al 2018 wu et al 2017 3 2 contribution of substrate adsorption plant uptake and biodegradation to smx removal it has been reported that the hydrolysis of smx is weak under neutral or alkaline conditions halling sørensen 2000 where the ph value of the influent was 7 1 0 2 additionally all reactors were wrapped in black plastic bags to avoid the effects of light therefore the effects of hydrolysis and photodegradation were negligible smx removal mainly depends on substrate adsorption plant uptake and biodegradation the contribution rate of the smx removal pathways was calculated and the results are shown in fig 3 biodegradation by microorganisms attached to substrate and plant root was the main removal pathway of smx in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw with a contribution rate of over 90 which was further confirmed by degradation experiments in shaking flasks by sterilised and unsterilized substrate covered biofilm from the system fig s4 miran et al 2018 also found that biodegradation was the main factor driving smx removal additionally the contribution rate of plant uptake and rhizosphere microorganisms to smx removal was approximately 16 9 25 7 fig s5 through smx removal efficiency in ec p ignoring the synergistic effect between plant and substrate microorganisms due to the lack of quantitative methods it was inferred that the microorganisms attached to the substrate contributed the most to smx removal substrate adsorption accounted for approximately 3 0 10 3 2 9 10 1 of the total influent load which might be due to lower octanol water partition coefficient logk ow 0 89 a et al 2013 compared with cw the substrate adsorption capacity was improved by bioelectrochemical technology however the enhanced effect was still limited the contribution of plant uptake to smx removal was the smallest accounting for 4 4 10 2 1 3 10 1 plants promote smx removal mainly through indirect action such as ameliorating the environmental conditions of rhizosphere microorganisms liang et al 2018 kurade et al 2019 and promoting the secretion of plant root exudates wang et al 2017 although the contribution of substrate adsorption and plant uptake in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw was less than 1 the substrate and plant were still an important part of the system and provided a conducive environment for microbial growth the contributions were all improved by bioelectrochemical technology and a more detailed analysis is presented in sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 3 bioelectrochemistry promotes smx adsorption in zeolite as shown in fig s6 the contents of smx in the substrate layer in mfccw and eccw were 51 6 and 82 1 ng g 1 respectively which were 64 5 times and 102 6 times higher than that of cw 0 8 ng g 1 respectively the smx contents in mfccw and eccw followed the order of cathode layer anode layer and middle layer which might be due to high microbial abundance in the anode layer table s3 that promoted smx degradation additionally the activated carbon of the electrode layer had a large specific surface area which enhanced the adsorption capacity of smx however the limited contribution of activated carbon for smx removal in cw was further confirmed by accw in the long term the smx removal efficiency in accw 89 8 1 4 fig s7 was only 2 0 higher than that of cw p 0 05 therefore the promotion effect of the activated carbon layer on the overall performance of cw was not significant however it contributed to the higher removal efficiency and effluent stability of smx in the early operational stage of bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw the smx contents in the zeolite layer in mfccw and eccw were 7 8 0 7 ng g 1 and 6 8 0 3 ng g 1 respectively which were 9 8 times and 8 5 times higher than that of cw respectively wen et al 2020 also showed that micro currents could enhance the adsorption capacity of smx on a substrate ft ir analysis also showed that the amount of oxygen containing functional groups fig s8 in mfccw and eccw were significantly higher than those in cw detailed analysis is shown in supporting information text s8 which can promote the adsorption of smx han 2009 the enhanced effect of mfc was significantly higher than that of ec p 0 05 additionally the ion diffusion rate can be accelerated by an electric field which promotes the interfacial transport of smx between the zeolite and biofilm wang et al 2002 the adsorption quantity of smx in the zeolite of cw was much lower than that obtained by the shaking flask experiment 2 7 103 ng g 1 liu et al 2020c which might be related to the interfacial exchange between the zeolite and biofilm 3 4 bioelectrochemistry improves plant activity and smx uptake as shown in fig s9 the contents of smx in root were 194 8 ng g 1 mfccw and 154 5 ng g 1 mfccw respectively which were 2 7 and 2 1 times higher than that of cw 72 3 ng g 1 respectively compared with mfc ec with stable and constant voltage was more conducive to improving the capacity of plant uptake for smx in cw which might be attributed to higher root activity in eccw fig 5 additionally the contents of smx in different organs of cyperus alternifolius followed the order of root 72 3 194 8 ng g 1 stem and leaf 0 7 15 2 ng g 1 dodgen et al 2015 and dudley et al 2018 also found that the enrichment factor of smx in roots was twice as high as than that in leaves and buds a slight terminal accumulation was observed in cyperus alternifolius in eccw which was due to the enhancement of the ability of leaf cells to transport substances by direct electric fields lu et al 2010 additionally smx mainly existed in anion form with an influent ph value of 7 1 0 2 where the dissociation constants were 1 6 pk a 1 and 5 7 pk a 2 liu et al 2019 anionic smx can easily cause xylem translocation goodman 1962 accelerating smx migration in plants and thus resulting in higher smx content in the leaves than in the stem the long distance migration characteristics of smx in cyperus alternifolius also show that smx can be transported over long distances from the leaf detailed information is presented in supporting information text s9 and fig s10 in summary the uptake capacity and transport rate of cyperus alternifolius for smx were all increased by bioelectrochemical technology in cw and the enhanced effect of ec was better than that of mfc as shown in fig 4 the root activity and the fluorescence electron transfer rate of leaves had all improved which was beneficial for cell protection lu et al 2010 plants can maintain intracellular homeostasis through antioxidant systems the balance between antibiotic intermediates and degradation cannot be maintained by the cellular system therefore it can result in damage to proteins lipids and dna farmer and mueller 2013 it was shown that antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat activities and cell repair factor expression were all improved by bioelectrochemical technology which was conducive to the absorption of smx the antioxidant mechanism of cyperus alternifolius was enhanced by micro current where malonaldehyde mda content followed the order of cw mfccw eccw which can reduce the stress damage caused by continuous smx input furthermore the energy capture efficiency of the psii reaction centre and the photosynthetic electron transfer ability of leaves can also be improved by electrical stimulation where the coefficient of photochemical qp showed a similar tendency to φpsⅱ it was inferred that ec might increase the activity of dna gyrase fromm and eschrich 1993 the key enzyme of photosynthetic electron transport in psii which can promote electron transport from psii to psi and the biosynthesis of chlorophyll vredenberg et al 2006 3 5 bioelectrochemistry improves microbial activity and optimizes microbial community structure 3 5 1 bioelectrochemistry improves microbial abundance and activity the biofilm on the substrate surface in mfccw and eccw was more uniform and denser than cw fig s11a and s10b which was related to the higher diversity and richness of bacteria in eccw and mfccw table s4 renslow et al 2013 indicated that external electrical stimulation can change the morphology of microbial cells and promote cell division the diversity and richness of bacteria in the mfccw were higher than those in the eccw compared with stable ec variable voltage pulse electrical stimulation of mfc fig s3 promoted microbial diversity where it appeared to be a phenomenon similar to compensation growth mechanism of biological wei et al 2009 this further indicates that mfccw is more adaptable to smx than eccw additionally clsm images showed that the substrate surface was nearly completely covered by living microbial cells fig s11c whereas the microbial activity of cw was low this phenomenon indicated that both bioelectrochemical techniques promoted the growth of active microorganisms on the substrate surface which was consistent with the higher dehydrogenase activity in eccw and mfccw fig s12 p 0 05 however the microbial activity in the eccw was higher than that in the mfccw which was not consistent with the characteristics of microbial abundance in eccw and mfccw thus ec tended to improve microbial activity in cw whereas mfc tended to promote microbial multiplication 3 5 2 bioelectrochemistry optimizes microbial community structure compared with those in cw as the important electrochemically active bacteria eab belonging to phylum proteobacteria croese et al 2014 and genus geobacter yang et al 2019 were significantly enriched in the anode layer in eccw and mfccw p 0 05 fig 5 indicating that bioelectrochemical technology had successfully started and also ensured a high extracellular electron transfer rate and metabolic rate in eccw and mfccw by picrust analysis figs s13 and s14 supporting information text s10 additionally the relative abundance of eab in the anode layer in the eccw was significantly higher than that in the mfccw p 0 05 which was consistent with the extracellular electron transfer rate of the biological phase fig s13 in the later stage of operation the direct current power supply of the eccw was removed and then converted into mfccw 1 connected with an external resistance where the voltage of the mfccw was approximately 500 mv fig s15 the voltage decreased to 409 6 16 7 mv after 40 days of operation which was still higher than mfccw 327 2 14 2 mv this further indicates that the electron transfer rate of the electrode layer in the eccw was higher than that in the mfccw bioelectrochemical technology significantly changed the microbial community structure figs s16 s18 and supporting information text s11 to further reveal the effect of bioelectrochemical technology on the overall microbial structure of cw mens based on the original otu were constructed for mfc w eccw and cw respectively the average connectivity average path length average aggregation coefficient and modularity of the molecular networks were larger than the random networks table 1 the average clustering coefficient of mfccw was significantly higher than that of eccw p 0 05 indicating that the mfccw had a higher degree of modularity the average path distance of mfccw was significantly lower than that of eccw p 0 01 suggesting that the transmission of substances information and energy exchange among microorganisms was faster in mfccw maslov and sneppen 2002 the molecular network modules of mfccw were higher than those of eccw and cw where the modularity of mf cw eccw and cw were 0 876 0 774 and 0 682 respectively the same module represents the same microbial population with the same niche and the number of niches in the community can be represented by the module numbers wang et al 2018 the niche amount of mfccw was increased which prevented direct competition among populations and ensured the stability of the microbial community the niche amount between eccw and cw was not significantly different p 0 05 indicating that ec had little effect on the interaction between microbial communities to study the changes in the microbial molecular network intuitively the module of the node with connectivity over 35 was analysed visually as shown in fig 6 compared with cw the connection between modules in the mfccw was weaker whereas the internal connection was closer the number of modules in the eccw decreased significantly where the relationship between microorganisms tended to be concentrated in a few modules these results showed a closer relationship between microbial populations and the overall microbial community in mfccw was more stable whereas the interaction of some species was strengthened in eccw topologically different nodes play distinct roles in a network which can be used as a basis for determining the key species in this study nodes were classified as peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs based on their among module connectivity pi and within module connectivity zi olesen et al 2007 nodes of module hubs connectors and network hubs are regarded as the key species deng et al 2012 the connectivity of all modules in the mfccw eccw and cw are shown in fig s19 most of the nodes were peripheral accounting for 99 6 cw 99 4 mfccw and 99 5 eccw there were no central nodes in any of the mens the key species of cw mfccw and eccw were different with six species belonging to the module centre node and connection node in mfccw they were classified as proteobacteria otu7261 otu801 and otu7046 actinobacteria otu6232 and otu7050 and planctomycetes otu1965 respectively six key species of chloroflexi otu294 spirochaetes otu6211 firmicutes otu6245 proteobacteria otu638 and otu1782 and lentisphaerae otu6214 belonged to eccw whereas two key species chloroflexi otu3543 and proteobacteria otu4339 were found in the cw pan et al 2020 have shown that the presence of a module central node can enhance the stability of mens where it is generally used as an important functional microorganism or a key microbial medium connecting other microbial groups it was indicated that the stability of mens in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cw with more module centre nodes was higher than that of cw both proteobacteria otu7046 and actinobacteria otu6232 and otu7050 were the key bacteria in mfccw whereas lentisphaerae otu6214 and chloroflex otu3543 were the key linkers in eccw and cw respectively it has been reported that otu6232 belongs to nocardioides which can degrade sulfanilamide antibiotics chen et al 2019b 3 6 degradation products and mechanism of smx the intermediate products of smx fig s20 and table s5 in mfccw and eccw were detected by uplc qtof ms to reveal the different effects of ec and mfc on smx removal in cw the possible degradation pathways of smx were proposed and compared as shown in fig s21 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid tp174 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole tp99 and 5 methylisoxazole tp84 were all common products in mfccw eccw and cw it has been reported that the active sites of smx including free amino and sulfonyl groups on the benzene ring and unsaturated c c and ch3 on the isoxazole ring are vulnerable to attack gao et al 2016 tp99 and tp174 were the main products of smx biodegradation jiang et al 2014 bonvin et al 2013 attributed to the hydrolysis of the s n bond of the sulfonyl group the formation of tp84 could be ascribed to the deamination of tp99 by deaminase zhang et al 2017b additionally five other intermediate products m h of smx in cw were also identified with peaks at m z 284 1504 204 1643 270 0051 288 1063 and 304 0618 namely tp284 tp204 tp270a tp288 and tp304 respectively 4 no2 smx tp284 is also an intermediate product of smx biodegradation which is generally considered as a secondary product of no smx however no smx with half lives of 47 1 h was not detected because of its low concentration and instability in this study bonvin et al 2013 it was believed that tp284 the main intermediate product of nitrification was ascribed to the oxidation of smx by ammonia oxidising bacteria kassotaki et al 2016 which is related to the nonspecific co metabolic biotransformation of antibiotics by ammonia monooxygenase luo et al 2014 tp284 can be further broken via microbial metabolism to form tp204 tp270a could be formed by electrophilic substitution of the h atom on the c c bond of the benzene ring thereafter tp288 was formed by further oxidation electrophilic substitution and addition reaction which is a common product in the sulfate reducing bacteria sludge system for smx co metabolism jia et al 2017 tp304 was obtained owing to the electrophilic substitution of the h atom on the c atom of the benzene ring of tp288 compared with cw six other products namely tp270b tp256 tp225 tp190 and tp217 respectively were also found in mfccw the isoxazole ring of tp84 was broken and transformed into isopropanol tp61 because of the enhanced effect of mfc on microorganisms zhang et al 2018 also reported the formation of isopropanol in a biofilm reactor tp156 was obtained owing to the electrophilic substitution of ch3 on the smx isoxazole ring subsequently the isoxazole ring was opened for tp225 formation tp190 was obtained because of the substitution reaction of the h atom of nh2 in the side chain of the benzene ring and the fracture of the s n bond tp284 was converted to tp217 due to the fracture of the s n bond by oxidation with microorganisms the formation of tp270b was due to the electrophilic substitution of the h atom on the c atom of the benzene ring which was also discovered in a water sediment test for biodegradation of smx photo transformation products biodegradation su et al 2016 these products can be further decomposed into simple molecules such as methane carbon dioxide and water under microorganism metabolism tp174 tp99 tp84 tp304 tp270a and tp288 were all detected in eccw and cw which were attributed to microorganism co metabolism in cw tp274 formation could be ascribed to the electrochemical reduction and addition reaction of the no bond of the isoxazole ring furthermore n 4 aminophenyl sulfonyl carbamate tp216 was formed due to further oxidation the cleavage of the no bond is an important process of smx biotransformation under sulfate reduction where it is a biological reduction reaction catalysed by nadh dependent reductase zhang et al 2008 tp174 could be formed due to constant direct current stimulation and then s n was attacked to form tp94 these four products might be related to the electrochemical redox reaction on the electrode surface in the eccw in summary the metabolic processes of smx and its products in cw were changed by bioelectrochemical technology where mfc enhanced the further cleavage of the isoxazole ring and the further hydrolysis of the sulfonyl group was enhanced by ec the intensities of the main products in mfccw and eccw are further studied in fig s22 it was shown that the intensity of tp174 and tp99 in the effluent from the bottom of the anode layer reached a maximum and then gradually degraded suggesting that the anode might contribute to the higher smx removal and produce products the intensity of tp84 in the effluent from the top of the anode layer was also the maximum tp99 tp84 aniline the product of tp174 was mainly removed at the cathode in the eccw whereas isopropanol the product of tp84 was mainly removed at the zeolite layer and cathode layer in mfccw the zeolite layer also contributed to product degradation additionally the smx removal efficiency at different heights in mfccw and eccw measured in this study table s6 also showed that the contribution rate of the anode to smx removal was higher than that of the cathode the acute toxicity effect of tp174 tp99 and tp84 on fish predicted by the ecological structure activity relationships predictive model was significantly lower than smx fig s23 chronic toxicity chv of smx and other products on fish daphnia and algae were all higher than those of acute toxicity all products except tp304 and tp190 were harmful to daphnia where the chv concentration was less than 100 mg l 1 only tp94 and tp217 were harmful to acute toxicity in fish where lc50 or ec50 ranged from 10 to 100 mg l 1 4 conclusions bioelectrochemical technology promotes smx removal in cw by improving substrate adsorption capacity plant activity and microbial richness biodegradation is a key contributor to smx removal in bioelectrochemical technology integrated cws the microbial response to bioelectrochemistry was different between mfccw and eccw the microbial community structure in mfccw tended to be more diversified and compact and the relationship between microorganisms in the module was closer and more stable the higher microbial activity and plant activity in the eccw provided a guarantee of a stable electron transfer rate of the electrode layer additionally the difference in enhanced bioelectrochemical technology for cw might result in different degradation pathways of smx in which tp99 was further ring opened in mfccw and tp174 was further hydrolysed in eccw however this process needs to be further verified by stoichiometry and

16503,a solar light driven magnetic photocatalyst reduced graphene oxide fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs was developed for the photocatalytic disinfection of different strains of bacteria gram negative escherichia coli e coli and salmonella typhimurium s typhimurium and gram positive enterococcus faecalis e faecalis the different responses of the bacteria during the reaction were investigated gram positive e faecalis was found to be more susceptible to photocatalytic disinfection and exhibited a higher leakage of intracellular components than the two gram negative bacteria the interactions between the bacteria and rgofentfs were analyzed for zeta potential hydrophilicity and sem under the experimental conditions the opposite surface charges of the bacteria negative zeta potential and rgofentfs positive zeta potential contribute to their interactions with a more negative zeta potential than e coli and e faecalis s typhimurium interacts more strongly with rgofentfs and is mainly attacked by oh near the photocatalyst surface e coli and e faecalis with less negative zeta potentials interact less strongly with rgofentfs and compete for the dominant reactive species o2 in the bulk solution therefore the co existence of bacteria significantly inhibits the photocatalytic disinfection of e coli and e faecalis but insignificantly for s typhimurium moreover photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs show potential for treating real sewage which meets the local discharge standard of e coli after a 60 min reaction in real sewage different bacteria are disinfected simultaneously graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords e coli e faecalis interaction real sewage s typhimurium 1 introduction sewage often contains pathogens that put human and animal health at risk and as such it is important that effective disinfection treatment of sewage is always available in order to ensure there is clean safe access to water compared to conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination ozonation and uv irradiation whose downsides include being chemical and or energy intensive and potentially generating toxic disinfection byproducts photocatalytic disinfection is a promising technology which has the advantages of being driven by green energy sunlight and being able to prevent toxic byproducts from forming asahi et al 2014 he et al 2019 nevertheless photocatalyst materials may have some drawbacks that limit their disinfection practicality for instance their absorption is restricted to the low wavelength region there is limited generation of reactive species due to the high recombination of charge carriers and the difficult separation of the photocatalyst materials from the treated sewage is challenging the practicality of the technology is therefore contingent on the ability to fabricate highly effective photocatalysts that can solve these issues tio2 is a widely investigated semiconductor for photocatalytic disinfection and has the advantages of being nontoxic stable and cost effective asahi et al 2014 doping tio2 with metal and or non metal provides the added advantage of making its bandgap customizable thereby allowing it to be activated at visible light wavelength he et al 2019 in particular codoping tio2 using fe and n narrows its bandgap and extends its range of operation from uv to the visible light region enhancing the sunlight driven utility of the doped tio2 kalantari et al 2017 kim et al 2013 at this stage however this codoped tio2 photocatalyst still has a downside with the high recombination of the photocatalytically generated charge carriers therefore reduced graphene oxide rgo which has high conductivity is introduced to the composite thereby promoting charge carrier separation by migrating the photocatalytically generated electrons to the composite surface liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 rgo has the added advantage of being free of toxic elements which ensures that the tio2 composite is safe to use finally to allow the tio2 composite to be separated and recovered from the treated sewage for reuse and to prevent secondary pollution a magnetic material such as fe3o4 is introduced to magnetize the photocatalyst this technique has already been developed and featured in previous studies he et al 2019 kumar et al 2018 following the above approach the magnetic solar light driven photocatalyst rgo fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs is developed escherichia coli e coli is commonly used as an indicator to monitor the pathogen level of water or sewage and to measure the efficiency of disinfection treatment bear et al 2017 different bacterial species coexist with e coli in typical sewage and threaten wildlife and human health and are generally classified by their cell membrane structures as gram positive or gram negative koivunen et al 2003 for example salmonella typhimurium s typhimurium is gram negative bacteria a same type as e coli that may cause adverse effects on human beings barashkov et al 2011 it is widespread in different types of water bodies such as surface water and has been detected in sewage koivunen et al 2003 li et al 2015 enterococcus faecalis e faecalis an example of gram positive bacteria is also found in sewage and like e coli can serve as a good indicator for fecal contamination and marine water quality in temperate climates rincón and pulgarin 2004 ashbolt et al 2001 we therefore elected to study e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis when only a single species of bacteria is present in the solution gram positive and gram negative bacteria have already been reported to respond differently to disinfection reactions barnes et al 2013 in the real sewage environment different species of bacteria co exist in the same conditions responses of these bacteria to disinfection treatment may be influenced by each other this study investigates how the co existing bacteria gram positive and gram negative react to disinfection this will contribute to a more thorough understanding of bacterial behavior during photocatalytic disinfection of wastewater sewage furthermore most studies have only studied pure bacterial cultures in synthetic solutions or di water and little has been reported regarding native bacteria that naturally occurr in real sewage understanding how effectively the photocatalysts can perform in real sewage which has complex characteristics will assist in enhancing the practicality of photocatalysis this study uses rgofentfs for the photocatalytic disinfection of e coli s typhimurium both gram negative and e faecalis gram positive under simulated solar light and investigates the different susceptibilities of these bacteria strains to the reaction it also studies the different interactions between the three bacteria mixed in one solution and the rgofentfs and the bacterial responses to photocatalytic disinfection before finally examining the rgofentfs s photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage please note that sewage sample used in this study is the real sewage treated after secondary biological treatment without undergoing disinfection operation 2 methodology 2 1 materials and bacteria all chemicals listed in text s1 in this study were used as received without treatment deionized di water with 18 2 mω cm resistivity was used throughout the study the e coli atcc 15597 s typhimurium atcc 53648 and e faecalis atcc 47077 were purchased from atcc manassas va 2 2 preparation of rgo fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs to obtain a facile separation of photocatalyst from the treated aqueous media magnetism is induced in the photocatalyst composite by combining it with the magnetic fe3o4 which was synthesized via the co precipitation method before combining it with the codoped tio2 fe3o4 was coated with sio2 via the sol gel method to prevent corrosion by the sewage co doping with fe and n narrows the tio2 bandgap and consequently extends the light spectrum which tio2 responds to into the visible light region therefore the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of such co doped tio2 under solar light is improved finally the combination with rgo during the synthesis of tio2 via sol gel method inhibits the charge carrier recombination thus the magnetic solar driven rgofentfs was designed and synthesized via a multi step procedure as described in text s2 2 3 characterization of rgofentfs the optical properties of the photocatalyst were analyzed using a uv vis nir spectrometer lambda 950 perkin elmer usa with an integrating sphere for solid sample analysis the optical bandgap of the rgofentfs was determined according to the tauc plot derived from the uv vis absorption spectrum the crystal phase of the photocatalyst was measured using powder x ray diffraction xrd pw1830 philips with a cu k α x ray source λ 1 5406 å over a scanning 2θ range of 10 to 90 the magnetization of the material was recorded at room temperature using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm lake shore 7300 usa the elemental properties were analyzed with an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps phi 5600 physical electronics inc usa with al k α radiation 1486 6 ev c1s peak at 285 0 ev was used as a reference to adjust the binding energy the graphene material in the photocatalyst was monitored using a raman microscope ramanmicro 300 perkin elmer usa over the range of 900 2300 cm 1 with 785 nm laser irradiation the morphology of the photocatalyst was analyzed via scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi tm3030 japan and transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy tem eds jem 2010 jeol japan 2 4 methods of culturing and enumeration of bacteria the methods of culturing different bacteria were undertaken following the guideline provided by atcc as summarized in table s1 the e coli atcc15597 s typhimurium atcc 53648 and e faecalis atcc47077 were cultured respectively in lb broth nutrient broth and brain heart infusion broth at 37 c with aeration for 12 h the bacteria were then secondarily cultured in a fresh broth at 37 c for another 2 h to allow them to reach the exponential phase optical density of 0 6 at 600 nm the bacteria were harvested via centrifugation 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c and were washed twice in a sterile saline solution they were then resuspended in a saline solution bacterial density of 108 cfu ml as stock for the tests the membrane filtration technique was used for bacterial enumeration using the selective media of m lauryl sulfate broth brilliant green agar and mei agar for e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis respectively as summarized in table s1 the culture temperatures and time for these bacteria during the bacterial enumeration were 44 5 c for 24 h 37 c for 18 houts and 41 c for 24 h under aeration condition respectively 2 5 collection and characterization of sewage sample the sewage sample low salinity was collected from a secondary biological sewage treatment works stws in hong kong the sampling point is upstream from the disinfection operation unit after secondary biological treatment therefore sewage sample used in this study is the treated sewage after secondary biological treatment before undergoing disinfection to make it simple sewage in this study means the above mentioned treated sewage the collection and preservation of the sewage sample followed the apha 1060 standard briefly a string and an hdpe bucket were used to collect the sewage sample which was stored in a 20 l hdpe container filled without headspace and sealed with a cap the sewage sample was kept in a cool box with ice during transportation and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for subsequent tests the collected sewage was characterized for ph conductivity and do level turbidity total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss and inorganic ions as described in text s3 the bacterial content of real sewage is typically complex with multiple species and their variants since brilliant green agar and mei agar were used to isolate salmonella and enterococci variants of the same bacterial species can also be grown and presented on the medium as colonies therefore for photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage the densities of bacterial species salmonella and enterococci in the sewage sample were determined text s3 2 6 photocatalytic disinfection tests 2 6 1 experimental setup in this study the photocatalysts were suspended in 50 ml in a 125 ml conical flask of either saline solution or sewage under mechanical stirring a xenon light 300 w pls sxe300uv perfectlight technology beijing equipped with an air mass 1 5 global filter was used to simulate solar irradiation 816 w m2 having a similar light spectrum as actual sunlight for all of the disinfection tests fig s1 the experimental setup followed the approach developed in a previous study he et al 2021 2 6 2 photocatalytic disinfection the photocatalytic disinfection tests were conducted in a saline solution 0 9 wt of nacl using rgofentfs 1 g l specific bacteria were cultured as described in section 2 4 and then added to the saline solution to obtain a particular bacterial density pursuant to the e coli density of the sewage sample collected from the secondary biological stws 103 104 cfu ml the initial e coli density for the photocatalytic disinfection tests was set at 104 cfu ml which was also the initial density of s typhimurium and e faecalis for the photocatalytic disinfection tests it should be noted that the densities of s typhimurium and e faecalis for tests in the saline solution are different from their densities measured in real sewage photocatalytic disinfection was performed both on the individual and co existing species of bacteria to examine their 1 different responses to photocatalysis reaction and 2 interactions with photocatalysts in addition the effects from inter bacteria interactions were also investigated in the tests involving individual bacterial species only one strain of bacterium e coli s typhimurium or e faecalis was added to the saline solution whereas in the mixed test all three bacteria each with density 104 cfu ml were added to the solution two additional control tests were performed 1 with rgofentfs in the dark to study the impact of the photocatalyst on the bacteria and 2 with light simulated solar irradiation but without rgofentfs to study the effects of light irradiation on the viability of the bacteria the bacteria and photocatalyst in the saline solutions had their hydrophilicity further analyzed by measuring their contact angles through a contact angle meter biolin theta the contact angle was determined from measurements on 3 drops of deionized water both sides the volume of each drop being 4 μl the bacteria 105 cfu ml and rgofentfs 1 g l in the saline solution were then measured for their zeta potential using an analyzer zetaplus laborscience s a greece and direct contact between bacteria and rgofentfs during the photocatalytic disinfection was observed using sem the protocol of sample treatment is described in text s4 to evaluate and better understand the rgofentfs s practicality it was used to disinfect real sewage and the responses of the different bacteria the three species in this study to the disinfection under such real world conditions were studied it is notable that the local sewage effluent discharge standard uses only the density of e coli as the indicator of the pathogen level and does not prescribe a standard level for either s typhimurium or e faecalis hkepd 1991 the discharge standard of e coli is 1500 cfu 100 ml hkepd 1991 and this was also used to assess the efficiency of the rgofentfs for disinfecting real sewage for the tests on real sewage without the addition of bacteria the sewage sample was tested without pretreatment moreover to understand the different bacterial responses in real sewage under a consistent condition s typhimurium and e faecalis were cultured as described in section 2 4 and added to the sewage sample to reach a density similar to e coli around 3 2 log cfu ml so that the density of each bacterium is consistent the methods of culturing bacteria and adding bacteria to the sewage sample are the same as for the photocatalytic disinfection tests in saline solution 2 6 3 determination of intracellular components leakage in the solution during the photocatalytic disinfection of the individual bacteria in the saline solution the leakage of intracellular components potassium ion nucleic acid and protein like substances from the bacteria was monitored the level of nucleic acid was determined by the absorbance of the supernatant at 260 nm li et al 2019 the concentration of the potassium leaked was measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry hitachi z 8200 japan the levels of the protein like substances in the solution were recorded as an excitation emission matrix eem using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4500 hitachi zeng et al 2019 2 6 4 scavenger studies photocatalytic disinfection is mainly due to the redox potential of reactive species which can play different roles in attacking bacterial cells depending on the varying interaction of the bacteria and photocatalysts to determine the roles of the reactive species in the reaction individual scavenger studies for photocatalytic disinfection were carried out with e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis before the tests various scavenger chemicals were added to the solution but the experimental conditions were otherwise identical to the photocatalytic disinfection test cr vi from k2cr2o7 ammonium oxalate isopropanol and l ascorbic acid each with concentration 0 1 mm were individually added to the solution to scavenge for e h oh and o2 respectively it has been proved that at 0 1 mm these scavenging chemicals are nontoxic to the bacteria in saline solution he et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of rgofentfs vsm was used to measure and determine the magneticity of fe3o4 fe3o4 sio2 and rgofentfs fig 1 a fe3o4 has a superparamagnetic property with no coercivity or remanence in the hysteresis loop providing a magnetic effect to the photocatalyst composite sio2 is coated onto the fe3o4 to protect the magnetic core from corrosion during reaction rgofentfs is formed via combining rgo and the modified tio2 with the fe3o4 sio2 showing a saturation magnetization value of 3 64 emu g this allows 99 5 of the rgofentfs to be magnetically separated from di water after 5 min in the presence of a magnet field 200 mt the crystalline structure of the photocatalyst was analyzed using powder x ray diffraction xrd as shown in fig 1b the characteristic peaks jcpds card 72 2303 of the xrd pattern of fe3o4 show that the magnetic core is in a cubic phase the sio2 s peak was not detected inside the fe3o4 sio2 pattern which demonstrates the amorphous property of the sio2 coating fentfs and rgofentfs have a similar xrd pattern showing peaks at 25 5 38 1 47 8 and 55 1 in line with anatase tio2 jcpds 73 1764 the bandgap of the rgofentfs was examined via measuring its optical property using uv vis drs fig 1c and the results indicate that its light absorption has been extended from unmodified anatase tio2 s absorption of only uv light asahi et al 2014 to also include the visible light region with peak absorption at 300 550 nm moreover as shown in the tauc plot inset of fig 1c derived from the uv vis absorption spectrum rgofentfs has a narrowed optical bandgap of 2 76 ev compared to 3 2 ev for anatase tio2 indicating the enhanced activity of the material under visible light valence xps was employed to analyze the bandgap structure of the rgofentfs and revealed its valence band edge to be at 2 41 v as shown in fig s2a the schematic band structure obtained for rgofentfs is illustrated in fig s2b the raman spectrum of the rgofentfs fig 1d shows the graphene characteristic peaks at the d band 1326 cm 1 and g band 1600 cm 1 the d band is due to structural defects caused by the reduction of graphene oxide whereas the g band corresponds to the sp2 carbon structure of the graphene sheets huízar félix et al 2019 the presence of the d and g bands demonstrates the combination of graphene like material in the rgofentfs composite the ratio of the intensity of these bands is used as a measure of disorder lópez díaz et al 2017 xu et al 2018 in the spectrum of the rgofentfs a ratio id ig of 1 16 1 suggests a disorder of the structural carbon and the presence of rgo in the composite xps was employed to study the surface chemical states and the bonding patterns of the photocatalyst s composition fig s3 the survey spectrum fig s3a identifies the elemental composition ti fe n c si and o of the rgofentfs the ti2p spectrum fig s3b shows a 5 9 ev gap between the energy levels of ti2p1 2 and ti2p2 3 which corresponds to the bonding energy of ti4 in the composites mo and ye 2009 pang and abdullah 2012 the ti2p2 3 bonding energy 458 ev shifts positively to 458 9 ev to indicate successful doping in the tio2 s structure jaiswal et al 2015 su et al 2011 the peaks of the n1s spectrum fig s3c correspond to the sorption of ambient nitrogen onto the material s surface 400 8 ev the bonding structure of ti o n 399 4 ev and ti n o 397 7 ev formed in the doped tio2 lattice asahi et al 2001 huang et al 2013 qiu and burda 2007 these bonding patterns confirm that nitrogen has been doped into the tio2 the c1s curve is fitted as shown in fig s3d and three peaks located at 288 4 286 1 and 284 6 ev are obtained a covalent bond may form between the graphene oxide and tio2 via calcination as the peak near 288 4 ev is attributed to the co ti min et al 2013 the peak at 284 6 ev is ascribed to the cc bond of the graphene structure min et al 2013 sun et al 2012 whereas the presence of absorbed co2 on the material surface and the residual oxygen functional groups after thermal treatment explain the peak at 286 1 ev compared to the peak at 286 1 ev the 284 6 ev peak contributes to the higher proportion of the c1s spectrum indicating the formation of cc in the carbon component rgo in the rgofentfs composite combined with the raman analysis fig 1d it shows graphene oxide has been reduced by the calcination treatment in the o1s spectrum fig s3e the main peak at 530 2 ev corresponding to the ti o bond of tio2 exhibits a shift from 530 7 ev to a lower position further implying the incorporation of n atoms into the tio2 lattice min et al 2013 the peak at around 531 2 ev explains the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the rgo structure and the adsorbed water which are residual functional groups on the rgo structure after calcination karaolia et al 2018 the fe2p spectrum fig s3f indicates the chemical states of iron fe2 and fe3 which are mainly due to the strong signal of the fe3o4 core of the rgofentfs to examine the iron species doped in the tio2 lattice rgofent without fe3o4 sio2 was synthesized and analyzed the fe2p spectrum of the rgofent inset of fig s3f shows the characteristic peaks of fe 2p3 2 710 5 ev and fe 2p1 2 724 2 ev indicating that fe was successfully doped into the tio2 he et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 tem was employed to study the morphology of the rgofentfs fig 1e shows the composite structure of the photocatalyst where the modified tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 are in nanoparticle form as demonstrated in a previous study he et al 2019 the hrtem of the rgofentfs fig 1f demonstrates the presence of rgo sheets in the composite the uniform distribution of the elements ti fe n and c in the edx mapping of the tem image of fig s4 further confirms the existence of fe3o4 fe n tio2 and rgo in the rgofentfs composite 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection of different bacteria the efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection may be impacted by not only the photocatalyst properties but also the bacteria s cell structure and the interactions between the bacteria and the photocatalyst in turn the bacterial cell structure varies from bacteria to bacteria gram positive bacteria for example have one phospholipid bilayer while gram negative bacteria have dual phospholipid bilayers gupta et al 2019 reddy et al 2017 different types of bacteria are therefore hypothesized to respond differently to photocatalytic disinfection in addition since direct contact benefits photocatalytic disinfection the presence of various bacteria may affect the interactions between themselves and the photocatalyst subsequently impacting the photocatalytic reaction therefore photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs under simulated solar light of the individual and mixed bacteria gram negative e coli and s typhimurium as well as gram positive e faecalis was conducted to better understand the reaction process 3 2 1 photocatalytic disinfection of individual bacteria the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs against e coli a universal bacterial indicator under simulated solar light was studied rgofentfs s performance was also compared against fentfs fig s5 so as to identify if combining fentfs with rgo introduces any improvement in photocatalytic capability after 60 min of photocatalytic disinfection the rgofentfs showed a higher efficiency 4 24 log reduction of e coli than fentfs 2 69 log reduction indicating that rgo enhances the photocatalytic disinfection to evaluate the effects of the presence of rgofentfs and incident light on the bacteria dark control tests in darkness with the presence of rgofentfs and light control tests without rgofentfs under simulated solar light were carried out as shown in fig 2 the densities of the three bacteria were stable in the dark control tests indicating that in darkness the presence of rgofentfs is nontoxic to the bacteria and that the bacteria are stable in the saline environment in the light control tests the simulated solar light without the photocatalyst causes all three strains of bacteria to be inactivated but falls short of killing them this is likely due to the solar radiation s intrinsic ability to inactivate microorganisms rubio et al 2013 however the same light control tests with simulated solar irradiation but no photocatalyst results in insignificant leakage of intracellular components leakages of nucleic acid and k as shown in fig 3 a b and protein like substances monitored by eem analysis shown in fig s6 for e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis the low and stable level of intracellular components in the light control tests indicates that the bacterial envelopes of the three bacteria are still intact i e no leakage even though under the simulated solar conditions the bacteria have indeed been inactivated on the other hand under simulated solar light the rgofentfs effectively disinfects all three bacteria e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis as shown in fig 2 achieving 4 2 log 4 1 log and 4 5 log bacterial reduction after 60 min of reaction respectively thus it can be concluded that the significant disinfection of the three bacteria is due to the photocatalytic performance of rgofentfs 1 g l under simulated solar light compared to the gram negative e coli and s typhimurium the gram positive e faecalis appears to be more susceptible to photocatalytic reaction 4 5 log reduction after 60 min the bacteria are thought to respond differently to the photocatalysis mainly due to their different cell structures with the dominant difference in the cell membrane rather than the cell wall gram positive and gram negative bacteria share a similar cell wall both are single peptidoglycan layer since they have different cell membranes single and dual phospholipid bilayers for gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively gupta et al 2019 reddy et al 2017 the degree of damage to their cell membranes was monitored in terms of leakage of intracellular components during photocatalytic disinfection as shown in fig 3a the amount of nucleic acid as absorbance at 260 nm leaked from the three bacteria to the solution during photocatalytic reaction of the three bacteria the gram positive e faecalis shows the largest amounts of both nucleic acid and k leakage fig 3b the leakage of protein like substances during the photocatalytic disinfection was also measured fig 3c after 60 min of reaction a stronger eem signal was detected for the disinfection of e faecalis indicating a higher concentration of protein like substances leakage in the solution the leakage of the intracellular components is due to the damage to the cell membrane which can be visualized through the sem images of the bacteria as shown in fig 4 before disinfection the e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis were in good shape with smooth and intact cell structures but after 60 min of reaction wrinkles and holes were found on the cells indicating damage to the cell envelopes these results therefore demonstrate that as the photocatalytic reaction progresses 1 the bacterial cell membranes become damaged causing intracellular component leakage 2 gram positive e faecalis is less resistant to photocatalytic disinfection than gram negative e coli and s typhimurium 3 the gram positive e faecalis whose cell membrane structure causes it to be more vulnerable ends up leaking a larger amount of intracellular components than the two strains of gram negative bacteria to study the roles of different reactive species and the mechanism of photocatalytic disinfection scavenger tests of the individual bacteria in saline solution fig 2d f were performed the results revealed that different reactive species play different roles in the disinfection of different bacteria even gram negative bacteria do not share the same reactive species during their disinfection o2 is the dominant reactive species for the gram negative e coli and gram positive e faecalis whereas oh plays a dominant role in the photocatalytic disinfection of the gram negative s typhimurium moreover despite having similar dominant reactive species specific bacteria such as gram negative e coli and gram positive e faecalis may have their disinfection efficiency affected by the presence of other bacteria during the photocatalytic disinfection of a mixture of bacteria 3 2 2 photocatalytic disinfection of bacteria mixture since e coli is used to indicate the inactivation of bacteria in aqueous media during the disinfection treatment disinfection against co existing bacteria is worth evaluating to better understand the reaction disinfection of e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis mixed together was examined and compared for efficiency against the same three bacteria being disinfected individually as shown in fig 5 a in a bacterial mix disinfection of all three bacteria occurs simultaneously using rgofentfs under simulated solar irradiation indicating the effectiveness of the photocatalyst against different bacteria present in the same solution however when compared with the results of the individual bacteria section 3 2 1 in the bacterial mix the disinfection efficiency is shown to have been inhibited fig 5b specifically the disinfection of e coli and e faecalis is significantly inhibited by the presence of other bacteria whereas the effect on s typhimurium is insignificant in addition the composition of rgofentfs after the disinfection of mixed bacteria was analyzed in the rgofentfs composite consistent rgo is indicated by the stable id ig ratio of the raman spectra fig 5c before id ig 1 16 and after the disinfection of mixed bacteria id ig 1 15 and the stable tio2 based component has been evidenced in a previous study he et al 2021 this shows that the rgofentfs maintains a stable structure after the reaction cycle as the composition of the rgofentfs remains intact the varying degrees of disinfection efficiency for the mix of bacteria are attributable to the different interactions between the rgofentfs and the individual bacteria such interaction is a crucial factor impacting the disinfection reaction he et al 2019 and can be visualized in this study from the sem images fig 4 typically this interaction depends mainly on the hydrophilicity and electrostatic charge effects katsikogianni and missirlis 2004 the hydrophilicity of the bacteria and the rgofentfs were analyzed by measuring the contact angle between a di water droplet 4 μl and the bacteria or rgofentfs surface the three strains of bacteria e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis were measured as hydrophilic with a contact angle 90 table s2 with a contact angle of 14 9 fig s7 fresh rgofentfs before reaction shows higher hydrophilicity than the three bacteria therefore the attachment of the less hydrophilic bacteria onto the photocatalyst may reduce the hydrophilicity of the rgofentfs after the photocatalytic disinfection of the individual bacteria the rgofentfs shows a decreased contact angle and becomes less hydrophilic as summarized in table s2 this further proves that interactions have definitely occurred between the different bacteria and rgofentfs corresponding to the sem results on the other hand the interaction between the bacteria and the photocatalyst is attributable to electrostatic attraction the different bacteria e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis individually and rgofentfs were measured for surface potential presented as zeta potential in a saline solution to determine their surface charge under different ph values fig 6 shows that rgofentfs has a high positive charge of 35 46 mv under acidic to neutral conditions with a point of zero charge at a ph of around 8 03 on the contrary the three bacteria exhibit a negative surface charge in saline solution under measured ph values of 3 11 in the photocatalytic disinfection reaction ph 7 7 5 the photocatalyst surface is positively charged under this condition ph 7 7 5 s typhimurium has a more negative surface charge 54 mv than e coli 49 mv and e faecalis 43 mv indicating the highest adhesion among the three bacteria to the positive rgofentfs furthermore the interactions between the bacteria and the photocatalyst possibly involve the different reactive species playing different roles as has been reported oh has a lower diffusing capability and mainly triggers reactions near the photocatalyst surface since o2 has a longer diffusion lifespan for attacking bacteria in the solution fisher et al 2013 maness et al 1999 watts et al 2003 s typhimurium s higher potential in adhesion to the photocatalyst is more related to the reaction on the photocatalyst surface with oh since e coli and e faecalis are less capable of adhering to the photocatalyst they have a higher reaction potential in the solution with better diffused o2 the zeta potential measurement and scavenger study results provide strong evidence to show that 1 there is less inhibition of the disinfection of s typhimurium due to more direct contact with the photocatalyst and 2 competition between e coli and e faecalis for o2 leads to inhibiting disinfection in a mix of bacteria 3 3 photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage as a potential technique for sewage treatment photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs in real sewage was also carried out to evaluate its practicality the characterization of the sewage sample is summarized in table s3 the complex characteristics of sewage can suppress the efficiency of its photocatalytic disinfection so a higher photocatalyst dosage may be required to keep up the performance as shown in fig s8 a dosage of 3 g l of the rgofentfs is the most efficient for disinfecting the sewage sample and is recommended for the tests in real sewage treated with a 3 g l rgofentfs dosage under simulated solar irradiation for 60 min as shown in fig 7 a the sewage sample met the discharge standard 1500 cfu 100 ml of e coli showing that rgofentfs is a practical photocatalyst for the disinfection of sewage with the concurrent disinfection of salmonella and enterococci in the sewage sample to compare the varying responses of different bacteria to the photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage cultured s typhimurium and e faecalis were added to the sewage to reach the same initial density as e coli at around 3 2 log cfu ml the densities of the added bacteria were stable in the sewage environment after 60 min in the dark fig s9 indicating that the significant bacterial reduction in the subsequent tests is due to the photocatalytic reaction for the photocatalytic disinfection of the sewage fig 7b although the total initial density of bacteria is increased with the additional bacteria s typhimurium and e faecalis the treated sewage can still meet the discharge standard of e coli after 60 min of reaction showing a 2 0 log reduction of e coli the photocatalytic disinfection of e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis occurs simultaneously as the total bacterial density increases after adding bacteria to the sewage the reduction of the whole number of bacteria is higher than that for a single species fig 7 it is likely that the higher bacterial density results in more chances for direct contact of bacteria to the photocatalyst which benefits the photocatalytic disinfection he et al 2019 similar to the tests carried out in saline solution the gram positive e faecalis is more sensitive to photocatalytic disinfection in the sewage than the gram negative e coli and s typhimurium demonstrating that the sewage characteristics do not affect the gram positive e faecalis s higher susceptibility to the reaction 4 conclusions the magnetic rgofentfs has the capacity for photocatalytic disinfection of multiple species of bacteria e coli and s typhimurium both gram negative and e faecalis gram positive under solar irradiation these three species of bacteria show different responses to the photocatalysis reaction among the three species of bacteria the gram positive e faecalis has the highest intracellular component leakage during the reaction due to the lower resistance of e faecalis cell membrane to the photocatalytic disinfection disinfection of e faecalis gram positive is more effective than e coli and s typhimurium both gram negative under the same experimental conditions moreover different bacteria exhibit various interactions with rgofentfs in their photocatalytic disinfection co existence of the three species of bacteria significantly inhibits the disinfection of e coli and e faecalis but not s typhimurium compared with s typhimurium e coli and e faecalis demonstrate lower potential to interact with rgofentfs during the photocatalytic disinfection of the three species of bacteria simultaneously other than the reaction occurring on photocatalyst surface e coli and e faecalis are mainly attacked by o2 that diffuses in the solution and consequently compete with each other for the same dominant reactive species o2 this competition results in the inhibition of the disinfection reaction however s typhimurium having stronger adhesion to rgofentfs is mainly attacked by oh and is less influenced by the presence of other bacteria photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage using rgofentfs under simulated solar light is promising the treated sewage met the discharge standard 1500 cfu 100 ml of e coli the local standard for stws in hong kong after 60 min of photocatalytic reaction using rgofentfs concurrent disinfection of s typhimurium and e faecalis in the sewage occurs with the disinfection of e coli it shows that different bacteria can be photocatalytically disinfected using rgofentfs simultaneously under simulated solar light and this technology has the potential for practical applications in the disinfection of sewage declaration of competing interest the authors

16503,a solar light driven magnetic photocatalyst reduced graphene oxide fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs was developed for the photocatalytic disinfection of different strains of bacteria gram negative escherichia coli e coli and salmonella typhimurium s typhimurium and gram positive enterococcus faecalis e faecalis the different responses of the bacteria during the reaction were investigated gram positive e faecalis was found to be more susceptible to photocatalytic disinfection and exhibited a higher leakage of intracellular components than the two gram negative bacteria the interactions between the bacteria and rgofentfs were analyzed for zeta potential hydrophilicity and sem under the experimental conditions the opposite surface charges of the bacteria negative zeta potential and rgofentfs positive zeta potential contribute to their interactions with a more negative zeta potential than e coli and e faecalis s typhimurium interacts more strongly with rgofentfs and is mainly attacked by oh near the photocatalyst surface e coli and e faecalis with less negative zeta potentials interact less strongly with rgofentfs and compete for the dominant reactive species o2 in the bulk solution therefore the co existence of bacteria significantly inhibits the photocatalytic disinfection of e coli and e faecalis but insignificantly for s typhimurium moreover photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs show potential for treating real sewage which meets the local discharge standard of e coli after a 60 min reaction in real sewage different bacteria are disinfected simultaneously graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords e coli e faecalis interaction real sewage s typhimurium 1 introduction sewage often contains pathogens that put human and animal health at risk and as such it is important that effective disinfection treatment of sewage is always available in order to ensure there is clean safe access to water compared to conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination ozonation and uv irradiation whose downsides include being chemical and or energy intensive and potentially generating toxic disinfection byproducts photocatalytic disinfection is a promising technology which has the advantages of being driven by green energy sunlight and being able to prevent toxic byproducts from forming asahi et al 2014 he et al 2019 nevertheless photocatalyst materials may have some drawbacks that limit their disinfection practicality for instance their absorption is restricted to the low wavelength region there is limited generation of reactive species due to the high recombination of charge carriers and the difficult separation of the photocatalyst materials from the treated sewage is challenging the practicality of the technology is therefore contingent on the ability to fabricate highly effective photocatalysts that can solve these issues tio2 is a widely investigated semiconductor for photocatalytic disinfection and has the advantages of being nontoxic stable and cost effective asahi et al 2014 doping tio2 with metal and or non metal provides the added advantage of making its bandgap customizable thereby allowing it to be activated at visible light wavelength he et al 2019 in particular codoping tio2 using fe and n narrows its bandgap and extends its range of operation from uv to the visible light region enhancing the sunlight driven utility of the doped tio2 kalantari et al 2017 kim et al 2013 at this stage however this codoped tio2 photocatalyst still has a downside with the high recombination of the photocatalytically generated charge carriers therefore reduced graphene oxide rgo which has high conductivity is introduced to the composite thereby promoting charge carrier separation by migrating the photocatalytically generated electrons to the composite surface liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 rgo has the added advantage of being free of toxic elements which ensures that the tio2 composite is safe to use finally to allow the tio2 composite to be separated and recovered from the treated sewage for reuse and to prevent secondary pollution a magnetic material such as fe3o4 is introduced to magnetize the photocatalyst this technique has already been developed and featured in previous studies he et al 2019 kumar et al 2018 following the above approach the magnetic solar light driven photocatalyst rgo fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs is developed escherichia coli e coli is commonly used as an indicator to monitor the pathogen level of water or sewage and to measure the efficiency of disinfection treatment bear et al 2017 different bacterial species coexist with e coli in typical sewage and threaten wildlife and human health and are generally classified by their cell membrane structures as gram positive or gram negative koivunen et al 2003 for example salmonella typhimurium s typhimurium is gram negative bacteria a same type as e coli that may cause adverse effects on human beings barashkov et al 2011 it is widespread in different types of water bodies such as surface water and has been detected in sewage koivunen et al 2003 li et al 2015 enterococcus faecalis e faecalis an example of gram positive bacteria is also found in sewage and like e coli can serve as a good indicator for fecal contamination and marine water quality in temperate climates rincón and pulgarin 2004 ashbolt et al 2001 we therefore elected to study e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis when only a single species of bacteria is present in the solution gram positive and gram negative bacteria have already been reported to respond differently to disinfection reactions barnes et al 2013 in the real sewage environment different species of bacteria co exist in the same conditions responses of these bacteria to disinfection treatment may be influenced by each other this study investigates how the co existing bacteria gram positive and gram negative react to disinfection this will contribute to a more thorough understanding of bacterial behavior during photocatalytic disinfection of wastewater sewage furthermore most studies have only studied pure bacterial cultures in synthetic solutions or di water and little has been reported regarding native bacteria that naturally occurr in real sewage understanding how effectively the photocatalysts can perform in real sewage which has complex characteristics will assist in enhancing the practicality of photocatalysis this study uses rgofentfs for the photocatalytic disinfection of e coli s typhimurium both gram negative and e faecalis gram positive under simulated solar light and investigates the different susceptibilities of these bacteria strains to the reaction it also studies the different interactions between the three bacteria mixed in one solution and the rgofentfs and the bacterial responses to photocatalytic disinfection before finally examining the rgofentfs s photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage please note that sewage sample used in this study is the real sewage treated after secondary biological treatment without undergoing disinfection operation 2 methodology 2 1 materials and bacteria all chemicals listed in text s1 in this study were used as received without treatment deionized di water with 18 2 mω cm resistivity was used throughout the study the e coli atcc 15597 s typhimurium atcc 53648 and e faecalis atcc 47077 were purchased from atcc manassas va 2 2 preparation of rgo fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs to obtain a facile separation of photocatalyst from the treated aqueous media magnetism is induced in the photocatalyst composite by combining it with the magnetic fe3o4 which was synthesized via the co precipitation method before combining it with the codoped tio2 fe3o4 was coated with sio2 via the sol gel method to prevent corrosion by the sewage co doping with fe and n narrows the tio2 bandgap and consequently extends the light spectrum which tio2 responds to into the visible light region therefore the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of such co doped tio2 under solar light is improved finally the combination with rgo during the synthesis of tio2 via sol gel method inhibits the charge carrier recombination thus the magnetic solar driven rgofentfs was designed and synthesized via a multi step procedure as described in text s2 2 3 characterization of rgofentfs the optical properties of the photocatalyst were analyzed using a uv vis nir spectrometer lambda 950 perkin elmer usa with an integrating sphere for solid sample analysis the optical bandgap of the rgofentfs was determined according to the tauc plot derived from the uv vis absorption spectrum the crystal phase of the photocatalyst was measured using powder x ray diffraction xrd pw1830 philips with a cu k α x ray source λ 1 5406 å over a scanning 2θ range of 10 to 90 the magnetization of the material was recorded at room temperature using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm lake shore 7300 usa the elemental properties were analyzed with an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps phi 5600 physical electronics inc usa with al k α radiation 1486 6 ev c1s peak at 285 0 ev was used as a reference to adjust the binding energy the graphene material in the photocatalyst was monitored using a raman microscope ramanmicro 300 perkin elmer usa over the range of 900 2300 cm 1 with 785 nm laser irradiation the morphology of the photocatalyst was analyzed via scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi tm3030 japan and transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy tem eds jem 2010 jeol japan 2 4 methods of culturing and enumeration of bacteria the methods of culturing different bacteria were undertaken following the guideline provided by atcc as summarized in table s1 the e coli atcc15597 s typhimurium atcc 53648 and e faecalis atcc47077 were cultured respectively in lb broth nutrient broth and brain heart infusion broth at 37 c with aeration for 12 h the bacteria were then secondarily cultured in a fresh broth at 37 c for another 2 h to allow them to reach the exponential phase optical density of 0 6 at 600 nm the bacteria were harvested via centrifugation 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c and were washed twice in a sterile saline solution they were then resuspended in a saline solution bacterial density of 108 cfu ml as stock for the tests the membrane filtration technique was used for bacterial enumeration using the selective media of m lauryl sulfate broth brilliant green agar and mei agar for e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis respectively as summarized in table s1 the culture temperatures and time for these bacteria during the bacterial enumeration were 44 5 c for 24 h 37 c for 18 houts and 41 c for 24 h under aeration condition respectively 2 5 collection and characterization of sewage sample the sewage sample low salinity was collected from a secondary biological sewage treatment works stws in hong kong the sampling point is upstream from the disinfection operation unit after secondary biological treatment therefore sewage sample used in this study is the treated sewage after secondary biological treatment before undergoing disinfection to make it simple sewage in this study means the above mentioned treated sewage the collection and preservation of the sewage sample followed the apha 1060 standard briefly a string and an hdpe bucket were used to collect the sewage sample which was stored in a 20 l hdpe container filled without headspace and sealed with a cap the sewage sample was kept in a cool box with ice during transportation and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for subsequent tests the collected sewage was characterized for ph conductivity and do level turbidity total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss and inorganic ions as described in text s3 the bacterial content of real sewage is typically complex with multiple species and their variants since brilliant green agar and mei agar were used to isolate salmonella and enterococci variants of the same bacterial species can also be grown and presented on the medium as colonies therefore for photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage the densities of bacterial species salmonella and enterococci in the sewage sample were determined text s3 2 6 photocatalytic disinfection tests 2 6 1 experimental setup in this study the photocatalysts were suspended in 50 ml in a 125 ml conical flask of either saline solution or sewage under mechanical stirring a xenon light 300 w pls sxe300uv perfectlight technology beijing equipped with an air mass 1 5 global filter was used to simulate solar irradiation 816 w m2 having a similar light spectrum as actual sunlight for all of the disinfection tests fig s1 the experimental setup followed the approach developed in a previous study he et al 2021 2 6 2 photocatalytic disinfection the photocatalytic disinfection tests were conducted in a saline solution 0 9 wt of nacl using rgofentfs 1 g l specific bacteria were cultured as described in section 2 4 and then added to the saline solution to obtain a particular bacterial density pursuant to the e coli density of the sewage sample collected from the secondary biological stws 103 104 cfu ml the initial e coli density for the photocatalytic disinfection tests was set at 104 cfu ml which was also the initial density of s typhimurium and e faecalis for the photocatalytic disinfection tests it should be noted that the densities of s typhimurium and e faecalis for tests in the saline solution are different from their densities measured in real sewage photocatalytic disinfection was performed both on the individual and co existing species of bacteria to examine their 1 different responses to photocatalysis reaction and 2 interactions with photocatalysts in addition the effects from inter bacteria interactions were also investigated in the tests involving individual bacterial species only one strain of bacterium e coli s typhimurium or e faecalis was added to the saline solution whereas in the mixed test all three bacteria each with density 104 cfu ml were added to the solution two additional control tests were performed 1 with rgofentfs in the dark to study the impact of the photocatalyst on the bacteria and 2 with light simulated solar irradiation but without rgofentfs to study the effects of light irradiation on the viability of the bacteria the bacteria and photocatalyst in the saline solutions had their hydrophilicity further analyzed by measuring their contact angles through a contact angle meter biolin theta the contact angle was determined from measurements on 3 drops of deionized water both sides the volume of each drop being 4 μl the bacteria 105 cfu ml and rgofentfs 1 g l in the saline solution were then measured for their zeta potential using an analyzer zetaplus laborscience s a greece and direct contact between bacteria and rgofentfs during the photocatalytic disinfection was observed using sem the protocol of sample treatment is described in text s4 to evaluate and better understand the rgofentfs s practicality it was used to disinfect real sewage and the responses of the different bacteria the three species in this study to the disinfection under such real world conditions were studied it is notable that the local sewage effluent discharge standard uses only the density of e coli as the indicator of the pathogen level and does not prescribe a standard level for either s typhimurium or e faecalis hkepd 1991 the discharge standard of e coli is 1500 cfu 100 ml hkepd 1991 and this was also used to assess the efficiency of the rgofentfs for disinfecting real sewage for the tests on real sewage without the addition of bacteria the sewage sample was tested without pretreatment moreover to understand the different bacterial responses in real sewage under a consistent condition s typhimurium and e faecalis were cultured as described in section 2 4 and added to the sewage sample to reach a density similar to e coli around 3 2 log cfu ml so that the density of each bacterium is consistent the methods of culturing bacteria and adding bacteria to the sewage sample are the same as for the photocatalytic disinfection tests in saline solution 2 6 3 determination of intracellular components leakage in the solution during the photocatalytic disinfection of the individual bacteria in the saline solution the leakage of intracellular components potassium ion nucleic acid and protein like substances from the bacteria was monitored the level of nucleic acid was determined by the absorbance of the supernatant at 260 nm li et al 2019 the concentration of the potassium leaked was measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry hitachi z 8200 japan the levels of the protein like substances in the solution were recorded as an excitation emission matrix eem using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4500 hitachi zeng et al 2019 2 6 4 scavenger studies photocatalytic disinfection is mainly due to the redox potential of reactive species which can play different roles in attacking bacterial cells depending on the varying interaction of the bacteria and photocatalysts to determine the roles of the reactive species in the reaction individual scavenger studies for photocatalytic disinfection were carried out with e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis before the tests various scavenger chemicals were added to the solution but the experimental conditions were otherwise identical to the photocatalytic disinfection test cr vi from k2cr2o7 ammonium oxalate isopropanol and l ascorbic acid each with concentration 0 1 mm were individually added to the solution to scavenge for e h oh and o2 respectively it has been proved that at 0 1 mm these scavenging chemicals are nontoxic to the bacteria in saline solution he et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of rgofentfs vsm was used to measure and determine the magneticity of fe3o4 fe3o4 sio2 and rgofentfs fig 1 a fe3o4 has a superparamagnetic property with no coercivity or remanence in the hysteresis loop providing a magnetic effect to the photocatalyst composite sio2 is coated onto the fe3o4 to protect the magnetic core from corrosion during reaction rgofentfs is formed via combining rgo and the modified tio2 with the fe3o4 sio2 showing a saturation magnetization value of 3 64 emu g this allows 99 5 of the rgofentfs to be magnetically separated from di water after 5 min in the presence of a magnet field 200 mt the crystalline structure of the photocatalyst was analyzed using powder x ray diffraction xrd as shown in fig 1b the characteristic peaks jcpds card 72 2303 of the xrd pattern of fe3o4 show that the magnetic core is in a cubic phase the sio2 s peak was not detected inside the fe3o4 sio2 pattern which demonstrates the amorphous property of the sio2 coating fentfs and rgofentfs have a similar xrd pattern showing peaks at 25 5 38 1 47 8 and 55 1 in line with anatase tio2 jcpds 73 1764 the bandgap of the rgofentfs was examined via measuring its optical property using uv vis drs fig 1c and the results indicate that its light absorption has been extended from unmodified anatase tio2 s absorption of only uv light asahi et al 2014 to also include the visible light region with peak absorption at 300 550 nm moreover as shown in the tauc plot inset of fig 1c derived from the uv vis absorption spectrum rgofentfs has a narrowed optical bandgap of 2 76 ev compared to 3 2 ev for anatase tio2 indicating the enhanced activity of the material under visible light valence xps was employed to analyze the bandgap structure of the rgofentfs and revealed its valence band edge to be at 2 41 v as shown in fig s2a the schematic band structure obtained for rgofentfs is illustrated in fig s2b the raman spectrum of the rgofentfs fig 1d shows the graphene characteristic peaks at the d band 1326 cm 1 and g band 1600 cm 1 the d band is due to structural defects caused by the reduction of graphene oxide whereas the g band corresponds to the sp2 carbon structure of the graphene sheets huízar félix et al 2019 the presence of the d and g bands demonstrates the combination of graphene like material in the rgofentfs composite the ratio of the intensity of these bands is used as a measure of disorder lópez díaz et al 2017 xu et al 2018 in the spectrum of the rgofentfs a ratio id ig of 1 16 1 suggests a disorder of the structural carbon and the presence of rgo in the composite xps was employed to study the surface chemical states and the bonding patterns of the photocatalyst s composition fig s3 the survey spectrum fig s3a identifies the elemental composition ti fe n c si and o of the rgofentfs the ti2p spectrum fig s3b shows a 5 9 ev gap between the energy levels of ti2p1 2 and ti2p2 3 which corresponds to the bonding energy of ti4 in the composites mo and ye 2009 pang and abdullah 2012 the ti2p2 3 bonding energy 458 ev shifts positively to 458 9 ev to indicate successful doping in the tio2 s structure jaiswal et al 2015 su et al 2011 the peaks of the n1s spectrum fig s3c correspond to the sorption of ambient nitrogen onto the material s surface 400 8 ev the bonding structure of ti o n 399 4 ev and ti n o 397 7 ev formed in the doped tio2 lattice asahi et al 2001 huang et al 2013 qiu and burda 2007 these bonding patterns confirm that nitrogen has been doped into the tio2 the c1s curve is fitted as shown in fig s3d and three peaks located at 288 4 286 1 and 284 6 ev are obtained a covalent bond may form between the graphene oxide and tio2 via calcination as the peak near 288 4 ev is attributed to the co ti min et al 2013 the peak at 284 6 ev is ascribed to the cc bond of the graphene structure min et al 2013 sun et al 2012 whereas the presence of absorbed co2 on the material surface and the residual oxygen functional groups after thermal treatment explain the peak at 286 1 ev compared to the peak at 286 1 ev the 284 6 ev peak contributes to the higher proportion of the c1s spectrum indicating the formation of cc in the carbon component rgo in the rgofentfs composite combined with the raman analysis fig 1d it shows graphene oxide has been reduced by the calcination treatment in the o1s spectrum fig s3e the main peak at 530 2 ev corresponding to the ti o bond of tio2 exhibits a shift from 530 7 ev to a lower position further implying the incorporation of n atoms into the tio2 lattice min et al 2013 the peak at around 531 2 ev explains the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the rgo structure and the adsorbed water which are residual functional groups on the rgo structure after calcination karaolia et al 2018 the fe2p spectrum fig s3f indicates the chemical states of iron fe2 and fe3 which are mainly due to the strong signal of the fe3o4 core of the rgofentfs to examine the iron species doped in the tio2 lattice rgofent without fe3o4 sio2 was synthesized and analyzed the fe2p spectrum of the rgofent inset of fig s3f shows the characteristic peaks of fe 2p3 2 710 5 ev and fe 2p1 2 724 2 ev indicating that fe was successfully doped into the tio2 he et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 tem was employed to study the morphology of the rgofentfs fig 1e shows the composite structure of the photocatalyst where the modified tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 are in nanoparticle form as demonstrated in a previous study he et al 2019 the hrtem of the rgofentfs fig 1f demonstrates the presence of rgo sheets in the composite the uniform distribution of the elements ti fe n and c in the edx mapping of the tem image of fig s4 further confirms the existence of fe3o4 fe n tio2 and rgo in the rgofentfs composite 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection of different bacteria the efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection may be impacted by not only the photocatalyst properties but also the bacteria s cell structure and the interactions between the bacteria and the photocatalyst in turn the bacterial cell structure varies from bacteria to bacteria gram positive bacteria for example have one phospholipid bilayer while gram negative bacteria have dual phospholipid bilayers gupta et al 2019 reddy et al 2017 different types of bacteria are therefore hypothesized to respond differently to photocatalytic disinfection in addition since direct contact benefits photocatalytic disinfection the presence of various bacteria may affect the interactions between themselves and the photocatalyst subsequently impacting the photocatalytic reaction therefore photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs under simulated solar light of the individual and mixed bacteria gram negative e coli and s typhimurium as well as gram positive e faecalis was conducted to better understand the reaction process 3 2 1 photocatalytic disinfection of individual bacteria the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs against e coli a universal bacterial indicator under simulated solar light was studied rgofentfs s performance was also compared against fentfs fig s5 so as to identify if combining fentfs with rgo introduces any improvement in photocatalytic capability after 60 min of photocatalytic disinfection the rgofentfs showed a higher efficiency 4 24 log reduction of e coli than fentfs 2 69 log reduction indicating that rgo enhances the photocatalytic disinfection to evaluate the effects of the presence of rgofentfs and incident light on the bacteria dark control tests in darkness with the presence of rgofentfs and light control tests without rgofentfs under simulated solar light were carried out as shown in fig 2 the densities of the three bacteria were stable in the dark control tests indicating that in darkness the presence of rgofentfs is nontoxic to the bacteria and that the bacteria are stable in the saline environment in the light control tests the simulated solar light without the photocatalyst causes all three strains of bacteria to be inactivated but falls short of killing them this is likely due to the solar radiation s intrinsic ability to inactivate microorganisms rubio et al 2013 however the same light control tests with simulated solar irradiation but no photocatalyst results in insignificant leakage of intracellular components leakages of nucleic acid and k as shown in fig 3 a b and protein like substances monitored by eem analysis shown in fig s6 for e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis the low and stable level of intracellular components in the light control tests indicates that the bacterial envelopes of the three bacteria are still intact i e no leakage even though under the simulated solar conditions the bacteria have indeed been inactivated on the other hand under simulated solar light the rgofentfs effectively disinfects all three bacteria e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis as shown in fig 2 achieving 4 2 log 4 1 log and 4 5 log bacterial reduction after 60 min of reaction respectively thus it can be concluded that the significant disinfection of the three bacteria is due to the photocatalytic performance of rgofentfs 1 g l under simulated solar light compared to the gram negative e coli and s typhimurium the gram positive e faecalis appears to be more susceptible to photocatalytic reaction 4 5 log reduction after 60 min the bacteria are thought to respond differently to the photocatalysis mainly due to their different cell structures with the dominant difference in the cell membrane rather than the cell wall gram positive and gram negative bacteria share a similar cell wall both are single peptidoglycan layer since they have different cell membranes single and dual phospholipid bilayers for gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively gupta et al 2019 reddy et al 2017 the degree of damage to their cell membranes was monitored in terms of leakage of intracellular components during photocatalytic disinfection as shown in fig 3a the amount of nucleic acid as absorbance at 260 nm leaked from the three bacteria to the solution during photocatalytic reaction of the three bacteria the gram positive e faecalis shows the largest amounts of both nucleic acid and k leakage fig 3b the leakage of protein like substances during the photocatalytic disinfection was also measured fig 3c after 60 min of reaction a stronger eem signal was detected for the disinfection of e faecalis indicating a higher concentration of protein like substances leakage in the solution the leakage of the intracellular components is due to the damage to the cell membrane which can be visualized through the sem images of the bacteria as shown in fig 4 before disinfection the e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis were in good shape with smooth and intact cell structures but after 60 min of reaction wrinkles and holes were found on the cells indicating damage to the cell envelopes these results therefore demonstrate that as the photocatalytic reaction progresses 1 the bacterial cell membranes become damaged causing intracellular component leakage 2 gram positive e faecalis is less resistant to photocatalytic disinfection than gram negative e coli and s typhimurium 3 the gram positive e faecalis whose cell membrane structure causes it to be more vulnerable ends up leaking a larger amount of intracellular components than the two strains of gram negative bacteria to study the roles of different reactive species and the mechanism of photocatalytic disinfection scavenger tests of the individual bacteria in saline solution fig 2d f were performed the results revealed that different reactive species play different roles in the disinfection of different bacteria even gram negative bacteria do not share the same reactive species during their disinfection o2 is the dominant reactive species for the gram negative e coli and gram positive e faecalis whereas oh plays a dominant role in the photocatalytic disinfection of the gram negative s typhimurium moreover despite having similar dominant reactive species specific bacteria such as gram negative e coli and gram positive e faecalis may have their disinfection efficiency affected by the presence of other bacteria during the photocatalytic disinfection of a mixture of bacteria 3 2 2 photocatalytic disinfection of bacteria mixture since e coli is used to indicate the inactivation of bacteria in aqueous media during the disinfection treatment disinfection against co existing bacteria is worth evaluating to better understand the reaction disinfection of e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis mixed together was examined and compared for efficiency against the same three bacteria being disinfected individually as shown in fig 5 a in a bacterial mix disinfection of all three bacteria occurs simultaneously using rgofentfs under simulated solar irradiation indicating the effectiveness of the photocatalyst against different bacteria present in the same solution however when compared with the results of the individual bacteria section 3 2 1 in the bacterial mix the disinfection efficiency is shown to have been inhibited fig 5b specifically the disinfection of e coli and e faecalis is significantly inhibited by the presence of other bacteria whereas the effect on s typhimurium is insignificant in addition the composition of rgofentfs after the disinfection of mixed bacteria was analyzed in the rgofentfs composite consistent rgo is indicated by the stable id ig ratio of the raman spectra fig 5c before id ig 1 16 and after the disinfection of mixed bacteria id ig 1 15 and the stable tio2 based component has been evidenced in a previous study he et al 2021 this shows that the rgofentfs maintains a stable structure after the reaction cycle as the composition of the rgofentfs remains intact the varying degrees of disinfection efficiency for the mix of bacteria are attributable to the different interactions between the rgofentfs and the individual bacteria such interaction is a crucial factor impacting the disinfection reaction he et al 2019 and can be visualized in this study from the sem images fig 4 typically this interaction depends mainly on the hydrophilicity and electrostatic charge effects katsikogianni and missirlis 2004 the hydrophilicity of the bacteria and the rgofentfs were analyzed by measuring the contact angle between a di water droplet 4 μl and the bacteria or rgofentfs surface the three strains of bacteria e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis were measured as hydrophilic with a contact angle 90 table s2 with a contact angle of 14 9 fig s7 fresh rgofentfs before reaction shows higher hydrophilicity than the three bacteria therefore the attachment of the less hydrophilic bacteria onto the photocatalyst may reduce the hydrophilicity of the rgofentfs after the photocatalytic disinfection of the individual bacteria the rgofentfs shows a decreased contact angle and becomes less hydrophilic as summarized in table s2 this further proves that interactions have definitely occurred between the different bacteria and rgofentfs corresponding to the sem results on the other hand the interaction between the bacteria and the photocatalyst is attributable to electrostatic attraction the different bacteria e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis individually and rgofentfs were measured for surface potential presented as zeta potential in a saline solution to determine their surface charge under different ph values fig 6 shows that rgofentfs has a high positive charge of 35 46 mv under acidic to neutral conditions with a point of zero charge at a ph of around 8 03 on the contrary the three bacteria exhibit a negative surface charge in saline solution under measured ph values of 3 11 in the photocatalytic disinfection reaction ph 7 7 5 the photocatalyst surface is positively charged under this condition ph 7 7 5 s typhimurium has a more negative surface charge 54 mv than e coli 49 mv and e faecalis 43 mv indicating the highest adhesion among the three bacteria to the positive rgofentfs furthermore the interactions between the bacteria and the photocatalyst possibly involve the different reactive species playing different roles as has been reported oh has a lower diffusing capability and mainly triggers reactions near the photocatalyst surface since o2 has a longer diffusion lifespan for attacking bacteria in the solution fisher et al 2013 maness et al 1999 watts et al 2003 s typhimurium s higher potential in adhesion to the photocatalyst is more related to the reaction on the photocatalyst surface with oh since e coli and e faecalis are less capable of adhering to the photocatalyst they have a higher reaction potential in the solution with better diffused o2 the zeta potential measurement and scavenger study results provide strong evidence to show that 1 there is less inhibition of the disinfection of s typhimurium due to more direct contact with the photocatalyst and 2 competition between e coli and e faecalis for o2 leads to inhibiting disinfection in a mix of bacteria 3 3 photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage as a potential technique for sewage treatment photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs in real sewage was also carried out to evaluate its practicality the characterization of the sewage sample is summarized in table s3 the complex characteristics of sewage can suppress the efficiency of its photocatalytic disinfection so a higher photocatalyst dosage may be required to keep up the performance as shown in fig s8 a dosage of 3 g l of the rgofentfs is the most efficient for disinfecting the sewage sample and is recommended for the tests in real sewage treated with a 3 g l rgofentfs dosage under simulated solar irradiation for 60 min as shown in fig 7 a the sewage sample met the discharge standard 1500 cfu 100 ml of e coli showing that rgofentfs is a practical photocatalyst for the disinfection of sewage with the concurrent disinfection of salmonella and enterococci in the sewage sample to compare the varying responses of different bacteria to the photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage cultured s typhimurium and e faecalis were added to the sewage to reach the same initial density as e coli at around 3 2 log cfu ml the densities of the added bacteria were stable in the sewage environment after 60 min in the dark fig s9 indicating that the significant bacterial reduction in the subsequent tests is due to the photocatalytic reaction for the photocatalytic disinfection of the sewage fig 7b although the total initial density of bacteria is increased with the additional bacteria s typhimurium and e faecalis the treated sewage can still meet the discharge standard of e coli after 60 min of reaction showing a 2 0 log reduction of e coli the photocatalytic disinfection of e coli s typhimurium and e faecalis occurs simultaneously as the total bacterial density increases after adding bacteria to the sewage the reduction of the whole number of bacteria is higher than that for a single species fig 7 it is likely that the higher bacterial density results in more chances for direct contact of bacteria to the photocatalyst which benefits the photocatalytic disinfection he et al 2019 similar to the tests carried out in saline solution the gram positive e faecalis is more sensitive to photocatalytic disinfection in the sewage than the gram negative e coli and s typhimurium demonstrating that the sewage characteristics do not affect the gram positive e faecalis s higher susceptibility to the reaction 4 conclusions the magnetic rgofentfs has the capacity for photocatalytic disinfection of multiple species of bacteria e coli and s typhimurium both gram negative and e faecalis gram positive under solar irradiation these three species of bacteria show different responses to the photocatalysis reaction among the three species of bacteria the gram positive e faecalis has the highest intracellular component leakage during the reaction due to the lower resistance of e faecalis cell membrane to the photocatalytic disinfection disinfection of e faecalis gram positive is more effective than e coli and s typhimurium both gram negative under the same experimental conditions moreover different bacteria exhibit various interactions with rgofentfs in their photocatalytic disinfection co existence of the three species of bacteria significantly inhibits the disinfection of e coli and e faecalis but not s typhimurium compared with s typhimurium e coli and e faecalis demonstrate lower potential to interact with rgofentfs during the photocatalytic disinfection of the three species of bacteria simultaneously other than the reaction occurring on photocatalyst surface e coli and e faecalis are mainly attacked by o2 that diffuses in the solution and consequently compete with each other for the same dominant reactive species o2 this competition results in the inhibition of the disinfection reaction however s typhimurium having stronger adhesion to rgofentfs is mainly attacked by oh and is less influenced by the presence of other bacteria photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage using rgofentfs under simulated solar light is promising the treated sewage met the discharge standard 1500 cfu 100 ml of e coli the local standard for stws in hong kong after 60 min of photocatalytic reaction using rgofentfs concurrent disinfection of s typhimurium and e faecalis in the sewage occurs with the disinfection of e coli it shows that different bacteria can be photocatalytically disinfected using rgofentfs simultaneously under simulated solar light and this technology has the potential for practical applications in the disinfection of sewage declaration of competing interest the authors

16504,urine with its abundant macronutrients n p k is an ideal resource for the production of fertiliser however the odor and pathogens in the raw urine must be removed to meet the public acceptance of urine collection systems and to enable its safe reuse as a fertiliser in this work real urine was collected and treated through a pilot scale gravity driven membrane bioreactor gdmbr to remove the malodorous organics and to nitrify almost 50 of the ammonia into nitrate the stablised urine was subsequently distilled via low cost heat localized solar evaporation hlse to produce a non odorous solid fertiliser the developed hlse with a small footprint can attract bulk solution into a vertical insulated space and quickly heat it up to 68 c within 1 h the hlse process had vapour flux at 1 3 kg m 2 h 1 as well as high solar to vapour conversion efficiency at 87 based on the edx mapping and xrd analysis the generated crystals are mainly nano3 nh4cl nacl nh4h2po4 and k2hpo4 which are ideal nutrients for vegetation in this study the produced urine derived fertilisers have a better performance on the growth of the leafy basil than the all purpose commercial fertilisers generally the gdmbr

stabilization membrane bioreactor heat localised solar evaporation urine fertiliser 1 introduction human urine contains abundant nutrients like nitrogen n phosphate p potassium k calcium ca magnesium mg and sulphur s which make urine an attractive resource for their recovery as raw material for fertiliser production heinonen tanski et al 2007 volpin et al 2018 previous agricultural trials have proved that using urine as fertiliser can effectively increase crop yields and it is comparable with using synthetic fertilisers freguia et al 2021 meanwhile after urine accounts for up to 80 nh3 n in domestic wastewater but only around 1 of the volume of domestic wastewater the cost of wastewater treatment will be greatly reduced if there is urine separation bisinella de faria et al 2015 freguia et al 2021 jacquin et al 2018 larsen et al 2009 2016 maurer et al 2003 since untreated urine contains some malodorous volatile scent chemicals such as ammonia methanethiol etc and harmful bacteria it is hardly accepted by the public lienert and larsen 2010 segrè cohen et al 2020 it is broadly agreed that urine should be processed into an odourless and aseptic fertiliser product before use moreover the urea in raw urine is usually hydrolysed along the pipe network during collection and conveyance and causes high ph of about 9 2 with consequence release of ammonia nh3 struvite mg nh4 po4 6h2o precipitation and pipeline blockages segrè cohen et al 2020 udert et al 2006 to solve these problems a decentralized in situ biological nitrification system is an ideal process to reduce ph convert nh3 nh4 to no3 for urine stabilization and degradation of the malodorous organics with the increasing popularity of green buildings the production of in situ urine source fertiliser is a better choice of nutrients for the growth of the in situ vegetation kavvada et al 2017 apart from the irrigation of in situ vegetation produced urine fertiliser can also be concentrated to reduce the cost of conveyance and storage costs for vegetation in other places udert and wächter 2012 investigated a biological urine oxidation process with a sequencing batch reactor sbr to reduce ph and remove organics after which thermal distillation was used to produce highly concentrated fertiliser products however direct thermal distillation requires boiling the bulk solution at 100 c or even 130 c to obtain a higher concentration factor udert and wächter 2012 to further remove pathogenic bacteria and reduce energy consumption volpin et al 2020 investigated the use of a membrane bioreactor mbr followed by low temperature membrane distillation md which successfully produced a 20 time concentrated liquid fertiliser under a 50 c operation nevertheless both conventional thermal distillation and low temperature membrane distillation are energy intensive concentration processes alternatively heat localized solar evaporation hlse with natural solar energy was investigated in this study hlse is a state of the art solar evaporation process whereby solar irradiation can be efficiently absorbed in a localized area via a porous absorber to converge heat and bulk solution which can significantly expedite generation of solar steam kashyap and ghasemi 2020 xu et al 2020 studied an ultrahigh efficiency desalination via a thermally localized multistage solar still to harvest distilled water from sea water xia et al 2019 investigated a spatially isolating salt crystallization process from seawater evaporation for continuous solar steam generation and salt harvesting most of the current studies in hlse are focused on desalination for seawater recovery while the application of the heat localized solar evaporation process in nutrient recovery from urine is still an unexplored application in this study in order to minimize the energy consumption a gravity driven membrane bioreactor gdmbr set up was first applied to stabilize raw urine collected from waterless urinals at the university of technology sydney uts the permeate after the treatment was dewatered using hlse which included a low cost ink printed capillary filter paper as the absorber for the liquid and energy absorption finally the produced fertiliser was used to cultivate basil ocimum basilicum via hydroponics the produced urine sourced fertiliser had a better performance than the check group from an all purpose commercial fertiliser 2 methodology 2 1 raw urine collection and storage raw urine was collected from around 40 male urinals at uts building 11 where the sewage drainage system has a urine separated

reaction volume is 80 l in this study the biological sludge was originally taken from central park wastewater treatment plant sydney nsw australia based on our previous experience the ph was set at 6

pumped bl7916 1 dosing pump hanna instruments australia into the reactor to maintain ph a commercial polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf corrugated microfiltration membrane module fmbr e 5 supplied by beijing originwater technology was used the nominal membrane pore size is 0 1 µm and the surface area is 0 06 m2 membrane module was soaked in the mbr and connected with a permeate tank to collect treated urine via gravity driven filtration process the hydrostatic height was kept at 60 cm to provide stable filtration driving force by ball float valve three air diffusers were evenly distributed in the reactor to supply fine bubble aeration which can ensure the dissolved oxygen do above 6 mg l for biomass air scrubbing for membrane and the full blending for reactor theoretically only 50 nh3 can be converted to no3 at most with only hydrolysed urine feeding udert and wächter 2012 the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of the reactor were maintained at 5 1 g l 1 solid retention time is around 200 d which enable the mlss mlvss ratio 0 85 hrt varies from nh3 concentration and membrane flux after the mbr stabilized the permeate was stored at 4 c in preparation for the hlse tests 2 3 heat localized solar evaporation hlse heat localized solar evaporation hlse process was selected for permeate concentration due to its zero energy consumption low cost and portable configuration lee et al 2017 fig 2 schematically shows the hlse setup including a 3 layer absorber a container and a balance with a computer in each experiment 90 ml stabilized urine was collected from mbr permeate in a self made quartz cubic container the 3 layer absorber was vertically inserted in the container to minimize the footprint and heat loss the middle layer of the absorber was prepared by a 9 cm 2 cm hydrophilic filter paper at 2 mm thickness for capillary attraction commercial black ink hp63 black is printed on the filter paper hp deskjet 2130 series 2 on one side as an adsorption layer to absorb solar radiation on the other side a polystyrene insulating layer was stuck to the filter paper to minimize thermal loss the container was covered with a parafilm to avoid direct water evaporation from the solution surface subsequently the absorber was exposed to continuous simulated solar irradiation for 24 h the solar flux is controlled at 1000 w m2 via a solar simulator in a chamber with a ventilation system the weight variation of the bulk solution was measured by a balance and recorded by a computer for water vapour flux calculation after the process the absorber was dried in oven at 60 c overnight to quantify the solid fertiliser the generated solid fertiliser powders were scraped off from the absorber after drying and collected in a sealed container filled with nitrogen gas to investigate the evaporation performance of hlse permeate solutions in dark evaporation de direct solar evaporation dse heat localized solar evaporation with absorber in 1 piece hlse 1 and heat localized solar evaporation with the same absorber but cut into 2 pieces hlse 2 are compared in this study the vapour flux is calculated as the followed eq 1 1 v a p o r f l u x δ m a δ t where the δ

fertiliser the urine sourced solid fertiliser collected from the hlse was used for hydroponic growth of basil ocimum basilicum the cultivation performance of the produced urine source fertiliser commercial fertiliser and di water as blank solution was compared from seedling stage with a hydroponic method three basil seedlings purchased from flower market were rinsed and then cultivated in three conical flasks where the flasks were filled with 250 ml urine source fertiliser 2 g l commercial fertiliser 2 g l and di water the nutrients solutions were wasted and refilled per week the

from a needle tip onto the filter paper surface a motion camera was mounted to take photos at a rate of 12 frames per second each sample was measured for three times and the average value was taken the solar absorbance test was scanned from 250 nm to 2500 nm by lambda 950 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrification membrane bioreactor mbr the mbr reactor was firstly started with 50 l running for 4 weeks and then upscaled to 80 l and operated for 8 more weeks for the 3 month operation the sludge was gradually acclimatised to the feed urine the ratio of ammonia to nitrate conversion was stable at 48 50 after the last 6 weeks of operation fig s1 the membrane flux was controlled at 3 8 14 8 lmh by monthly hydraulic cleaning fig s2 an average hrt of 10 5 days was reached with an ammonia conversion rate of 230 135 mg n l 1 d 1 after 3 months operation we collected the mbr permeate as the feed water for the subsequent hlse test the components of the urine before and after mbr are listed in table 1 the concentrations of n p and k in the raw urine are considerable at 2950 280 and 1078 mg l respectively which are similar as our previous bench scale results volpin et al 2020 after the nitrification process 95 tn remained in the permeate the other 5 might be purged or consumed during the nitrification 50 of nh4 was converted to no3 which makes the nh4 no3 ratio approximately 1 1 meanwhile the ph of the permeate decreased from 9 5 to 6 2 which is conducive to the stabilization of nh4 the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 in the permeate are higher than those in the raw urine which is probably because the re dissolution of struvite and caco3 precipitated in the urine tank due to the change of ph as the apparatus such as icp ms ic required pre filtration before measurement struvite and caco3 as precipitants existed in the hydrolysed urine alkaline ambience were rejected by the filter which caused the mg2 and ca2 concentrations to be lower in the untreated urine the concentrations of p k and other ions in the permeate are also the similar level as the untreated urine which are expected in the urine sourced fertiliser production 3 2 heat localized solar evaporation 3 2 1 characterization of absorber the absorber is simply prepared with a commercial capillary filter paper and printed with blank ink fig 3 a the absorbance of the absorbers ranging from 250 nm to 2500 nm was measured as shown in fig 3b the raw filter paper had low absorbance between 250 and 1300 nm and weak absorbance between 1300 and 2500 nm in contrast the black filter paper had strong absorbance covering all the spectrum of uv light visible light and infrared light regions which is consistent with the irradiation scope of solar light and proven to be an excellent absorber in terms of the surface morphology there is no big difference in fibre structure between the raw filter paper fig 3c and the black filter paper fig 3d but the ink printed filter paper had smoother surface probably due to the printing process the contact angle results indicated that after printing black ink the filter paper surface transformed from hydrophilic 0 o fig 3e to hydrophobic 135 24 o

dsd heat localized solar evaporation with 1 piece hlse 1 heat localized solar evaporation with 2 pieces hlse 2 are compared in this study hlse 1 and hlse 2 had the same surface area for solar irradiation but the absorber of hlse 2 was cut into two pieces to increase extra lateral surface area for evaporation as shown in fig 4 a the solution in the dark condition remains at room temperature 25 c when it comes to dsd the solution temperature increased by 6 c within 0 5 h and then kept 31 c till the end of the process in contrast the solution temperature of hlse 1 and hlse 2 increased significantly to 65 c and 61 c respectively within the first hour subsequently they maintained 65 68 c and 61 64 c respectively during 1 to 12 h after 12 h operation both hlse 1 and hlse 2 temperature had a slightly decline from 65 4 to 63 5 c and from 62 8 to 60 9 c respectively this is probably because the generation of solid fertiliser covered the surface and hindered the light absorption correspondingly the mass changes and vapour flux had a consistent trend with the temperature variations the solution mass of hlse is lower than that of de and sd specifically de dsd hlse 1 and hlse 2 evaporated 2 17 6 67 53 7 and 56 88 g respectively during 24 h operation although hlse 1 and hlse 2 had the same front surface area for energy absorption hlse 2 had a larger surface area on the side

the solar to vapour conversion efficiency of sd hlse 1 and hlse 2 are calculated as 9 3 81 and 87 respectively compared to the other water based solar evaporation experiments the vapour flux and solar to vapour conversion efficiency of hlse 2 1 33 kg m 2 h 1 and 87 had the overwhelming performance according to the images in fig 4c and 4d it is observed that the crystals were initially generated on the corners of the absorber due to the front facet is the hydrophobic ink coating solution was repulsed to the lateral side for the evaporation as the corner had the most air water interface area and the furthest distance from the bulk solution the corner would have the optimal evaporation condition and nucleate earlier with the accumulation of the crystals the ambient surface area was gradually covered and absorbed less heat as a result crystallization interface was moving down along the lateral after 24 h hlse 2 generated 0 62 g solid fertiliser while hlse 1 generated 0 58 g solid fertiliser interestingly due to the uneven generation of crystal and a slight change of solution water level the absorber was slightly tilted therefore crystals were also generated following the tilted position this may be explained by the path of solution flow which was determined by effects of the capillary attraction and gravity 3 2 3 solid fertiliser components the produced crystals are collected and dried in an oven at 60 c before use the components of the solid fertiliser are analysed by sem edx and xrd as shown in fig 5 a elements of c o n p k na cl s are detected in the presented sem image area n p and k are the most primary elements that we are targeting in the nutrient recovery from the urine permeate according to the mapping images n p and k are well distributed in the crystals the xrd result indicates that nano3 nh4cl nacl nh4h2po4 and k2hpo4 are the main crystals generated in the hlse process which is consistent with edx mapping results specifically the mapping distribution of na and cl proves the existence of nacl crystal the mapping distributions of k o and p are consistent with k2hpo4 crystal since the n mapping includes both ammonium and nitrate the n distribution was combined nano3 nh4cl nh4h2po4 and k2hpo4 are typical components for commercial fertiliser therefore the produced solid fertiliser is used for the subsequent hydroponics test 3 3 hydroponic test to investigate the performance of the urine sourced fertiliser no fertiliser and commercial fertiliser brunnings all purpose npk fertiliser are also compared in the hydroponic tests the components of the hydroponic medium after addition of urine sourced fertiliser 2 g l and commercial fertiliser 2 g l are presented in table 2 the primary macronutrients n p k in the urine sourced fertiliser account for 15 5 1 9 and 9 2 which means that the n and k are the main nutrients in the urine sourced fertiliser in contrast the primary macronutrients n p k in the commercial fertiliser account for 7 8 8 25 and 9 6 which indicates that the ratio of n p and k in the commercial fertiliser are more even in terms of the secondary macronutrients s ca and mg account for only 0 9 0 9 and 0 4 in urine sourced fertiliser which is much lower than those in commercial fertiliser 13 9 8 and 0 5 fig 6 a and fig 6b presented the 3 week growth of the basils in di water urine sourced fertiliser and commercial fertiliser clearly the urine sourced fertiliser grew best with a larger leaf size longer stems and roots and more robust colour on the contrary the basil grew in di water with the smallest size of leaf stem and roots and yellow pattern was apparently unhealthy due to lack of nutrients the commercial fertiliser falls in between with a green colour but medium size leaves stems and roots specifically the leaf weight of the basil grown in urine sourced fertiliser 196 6 48 4 mg was 2 4 times the figure for that in commercial fertiliser 80 3 23 7 mg and 3 7 times the figure for that in di water 51 8 17 5 mg the leaf area of basil grew in urine sourced fertiliser 11 4 2 9 cm2 was 2 3 times the figure for commercial fertiliser 4 9 1 6 cm2 and 4 2 times the figure for di water 2 7 0 7 cm2 meanwhile the stem height and diameter of the basil grew in urine sourced fertiliser 18 1 5 and 0 35 0 05 cm are more than twice in commercial fertiliser 8 5 0 8 and 0 17 0 03 cm and in di water 7 5 0 7 and 0 15 0 02 cm the main reason why the urine based fertiliser had a better performance in basil growth is probably because of a higher ratio of n n as the primary macronutrient plays the most significant role in leaf and stem growth especially for herbs in the seedling stage although commercial fertiliser had higher concentrations of other nutrients p s and ca n as the predominant nutrient is only half of the concentration in urine sourced fertiliser the basil root in urine source fertiliser also had the highest weight 5 5 2 3 mg and length 4 2 8 cm while commercial fertiliser had lower weight 2 5 1 5 mg and length 2 7 1 6 cm which are similarly as those in di water 2 8 1 3 mg and 3 1 5 cm this is mainly because the presence of no3 in urine sourced fertiliser contributes to the growth of roots kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 besides some other micronutrients may also contribute to the growth of basil we also conducted two more hydroponic tests in the lab to compare the liquid urine sourced fertiliser with another commercial liquid fertiliser power feed for the growth of both basil and coriander as reference fig s3 the visual observation indicates that the produced urine sourced fertiliser shows a comparable performance with commercial fertiliser in terms of the plant visual health such as plant height number of leaves colour of the leaves etc however it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this hydroponic study the npk ratio including the minor and micronutrient concentrations and ratios are quite different for urine compared to commercial fertiliser and hence their comparison should not be considered absolute although the exceptionally high n concentration of urine based fertiliser can be effective for leafy vegetables such as basil and coriander the same may not be effective for other plants where such high n concentration is not necessary or can be rather toxic future studies should therefore include understanding the need for a nutrient adjustment in the urine based fertiliser to make it more universally applicable nutrient 4 conclusions in this study source separated urine was stabilized using gravity driven mbr and then dewatered through hlse to produce solid fertiliser which was tested to grow basil by hydroponics the mbr reactor successfully converted 50 of nh3 to no3 and removed malodorous smell the nitrified urine with a low ph of 6 was stabilized and managed to generate crystals via hlse process the developed hlse with a very low cost absorber can attract bulk solution into a vertical insulated space and heat the solution up to 68 c within 1 h to distil water and harvest crystals simultaneously the hlse method achieved a high vapour flux of 1 33 kg m 2 h 1 and overwhelming evaporation efficiency at 87 the generated crystals mainly including nano3 nh4cl nh4h2po4 and k2hpo4 could be applied as solid fertiliser for basil growth its performance showed comparable adaptation for basil growth to an all purpose commercial fertiliser finally the gdmbr hlse as a cost effective green technology is probably a promising field in nutrients recovery from urine further studies such as simultaneous recoveries of nutrients and water continuous production of crystals the optimization and regeneration of absorbers life cycle assessment for the whole process are being investigated and

16504,urine with its abundant macronutrients n p k is an ideal resource for the production of fertiliser however the odor and pathogens in the raw urine must be removed to meet the public acceptance of urine collection systems and to enable its safe reuse as a fertiliser in this work real urine was collected and treated through a pilot scale gravity driven membrane bioreactor gdmbr to remove the malodorous organics and to nitrify almost 50 of the ammonia into nitrate the stablised urine was subsequently distilled via low cost heat localized solar evaporation hlse to produce a non odorous solid fertiliser the developed hlse with a small footprint can attract bulk solution into a vertical insulated space and quickly heat it up to 68 c within 1 h the hlse process had vapour flux at 1 3 kg m 2 h 1 as well as high solar to vapour conversion efficiency at 87 based on the edx mapping and xrd analysis the generated crystals are mainly nano3 nh4cl nacl nh4h2po4 and k2hpo4 which are ideal nutrients for vegetation in this study the produced urine derived fertilisers have a better performance on the growth of the leafy basil than the all purpose commercial fertilisers generally the gdmbr hlse is a promising cost effective and green technology for nutrients recovery from urine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source separated urine nutrient recovery urine stabilization membrane bioreactor heat localised solar evaporation urine fertiliser 1 introduction human urine contains abundant nutrients like nitrogen n phosphate p potassium k calcium ca magnesium mg and sulphur s which make urine an attractive resource for their recovery as raw material for fertiliser production heinonen tanski et al 2007 volpin et al 2018 previous agricultural trials have proved that using urine as fertiliser can effectively increase crop yields and it is comparable with using synthetic fertilisers freguia et al 2021 meanwhile after urine accounts for up to 80 nh3 n in domestic wastewater but only around 1 of the volume of domestic wastewater the cost of wastewater treatment will be greatly reduced if there is urine separation bisinella de faria et al 2015 freguia et al 2021 jacquin et al 2018 larsen et al 2009 2016 maurer et al 2003 since untreated urine contains some malodorous volatile scent chemicals such as ammonia methanethiol etc and harmful bacteria it is hardly accepted by the public lienert and larsen 2010 segrè cohen et al 2020 it is broadly agreed that urine should be processed into an odourless and aseptic fertiliser product before use moreover the urea in raw urine is usually hydrolysed along the pipe network during collection and conveyance and causes high ph of about 9 2 with consequence release of ammonia nh3 struvite mg nh4 po4 6h2o precipitation and pipeline blockages segrè cohen et al 2020 udert et al 2006 to solve these problems a decentralized in situ biological nitrification system is an ideal process to reduce ph convert nh3 nh4 to no3 for urine stabilization and degradation of the malodorous organics with the increasing popularity of green buildings the production of in situ urine source fertiliser is a better choice of nutrients for the growth of the in situ vegetation kavvada et al 2017 apart from the irrigation of in situ vegetation produced urine fertiliser can also be concentrated to reduce the cost of conveyance and storage costs for vegetation in other places udert and wächter 2012 investigated a biological urine oxidation process with a sequencing batch reactor sbr to reduce ph and remove organics after which thermal distillation was used to produce highly concentrated fertiliser products however direct thermal distillation requires boiling the bulk solution at 100 c or even 130 c to obtain a higher concentration factor udert and wächter 2012 to further remove pathogenic bacteria and reduce energy consumption volpin et al 2020 investigated the use of a membrane bioreactor mbr followed by low temperature membrane distillation md which successfully produced a 20 time concentrated liquid fertiliser under a 50 c operation nevertheless both conventional thermal distillation and low temperature membrane distillation are energy intensive concentration processes alternatively heat localized solar evaporation hlse with natural solar energy was investigated in this study hlse is a state of the art solar evaporation process whereby solar irradiation can be efficiently absorbed in a localized area via a porous absorber to converge heat and bulk solution which can significantly expedite generation of solar steam kashyap and ghasemi 2020 xu et al 2020 studied an ultrahigh efficiency desalination via a thermally localized multistage solar still to harvest distilled water from sea water xia et al 2019 investigated a spatially isolating salt crystallization process from seawater evaporation for continuous solar steam generation and salt harvesting most of the current studies in hlse are focused on desalination for seawater recovery while the application of the heat localized solar evaporation process in nutrient recovery from urine is still an unexplored application in this study in order to minimize the energy consumption a gravity driven membrane bioreactor gdmbr set up was first applied to stabilize raw urine collected from waterless urinals at the university of technology sydney uts the permeate after the treatment was dewatered using hlse which included a low cost ink printed capillary filter paper as the absorber for the liquid and energy absorption finally the produced fertiliser was used to cultivate basil ocimum basilicum via hydroponics the produced urine sourced fertiliser had a better performance than the check group from an all purpose commercial fertiliser 2 methodology 2 1 raw urine collection and storage raw urine was collected from around 40 male urinals at uts building 11 where the sewage drainage system has a urine separated piping network according to our previous experience and measurements volpin et al 2020 urea is hydrolysed in the collection pipes by the time it reaches a collection tank at the bottom of the building

see section 2 5 2 2 urine stabilization via gravity driven membrane bioreactor gdmbr urine stabilization by nitrification was conducted with a 100 l pilot scale aerobic mbr reactor fig 1 the effective reaction volume is 80 l in this study the biological sludge was originally taken from central park wastewater treatment plant sydney nsw australia based on our previous experience the ph was set at 6

pumped bl7916 1 dosing pump hanna instruments australia into the reactor to maintain ph a commercial polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf corrugated microfiltration membrane module fmbr e 5 supplied by beijing originwater technology was used the nominal membrane pore size is 0 1 µm and the surface area is 0 06 m2 membrane module was soaked in the mbr and connected with a permeate tank to collect treated urine via gravity driven filtration process the hydrostatic height was kept at 60 cm to provide stable filtration driving force by ball float valve three air diffusers were evenly distributed in the reactor to supply fine bubble aeration which can ensure the dissolved oxygen do above 6 mg l for biomass air scrubbing for membrane and the full blending for reactor theoretically only 50 nh3 can be converted to no3 at most with only hydrolysed urine feeding udert and wächter 2012 the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of the reactor were maintained at 5 1 g l 1 solid retention time is around 200 d which enable the mlss mlvss ratio 0 85 hrt varies from nh3 concentration and membrane flux after the mbr stabilized the permeate was stored at 4 c in preparation for the hlse tests 2 3 heat localized solar evaporation hlse heat localized solar evaporation hlse process was selected for permeate concentration due to its zero energy consumption low cost and portable configuration lee et al 2017 fig 2 schematically shows the hlse setup including a 3 layer absorber a container and a balance with a computer in each experiment 90 ml stabilized urine was collected from mbr permeate in a self made quartz cubic container the 3 layer absorber was vertically inserted in the container to minimize the footprint and heat loss the middle layer of the absorber was prepared by a 9 cm 2 cm hydrophilic filter paper at 2 mm thickness for capillary attraction commercial black ink hp63 black is printed on the filter paper hp deskjet 2130 series 2 on one side as an adsorption layer to absorb solar radiation on the other side a polystyrene insulating layer was stuck to the filter paper to minimize thermal loss the container was covered with a parafilm to avoid direct water evaporation from the solution surface subsequently the absorber was exposed to continuous simulated solar irradiation for 24 h the solar flux is controlled at 1000 w m2 via a solar simulator in a chamber with a ventilation system the weight variation of the bulk solution was measured by a balance and recorded by a computer for water vapour flux calculation after the process the absorber was dried in oven at 60 c overnight to quantify the solid fertiliser the generated solid fertiliser powders were scraped off from the absorber after drying and collected in a sealed container filled with nitrogen gas to investigate the evaporation performance of hlse permeate solutions in dark evaporation de direct solar evaporation dse heat localized solar evaporation with absorber in 1 piece hlse 1 and heat localized solar evaporation with the same absorber but cut into 2 pieces hlse 2 are compared in this study the vapour flux is calculated as the followed eq 1 1 v a p o r f l u x δ m a δ t where the δ m is the mass change of bulk solution δ t is the time change for the mass change a is the effective irradiation area 2 4 hydroponic growth of basil with urine sourced fertiliser and commercial fertiliser the urine sourced solid fertiliser collected from the hlse was used for hydroponic growth of basil ocimum basilicum the cultivation performance of the produced urine source fertiliser commercial fertiliser and di water as blank solution was compared from seedling stage with a hydroponic method three basil seedlings purchased from flower market were rinsed and then cultivated in three conical flasks where the flasks were filled with 250 ml urine source fertiliser 2 g l commercial fertiliser 2 g l and di water the nutrients solutions were wasted and refilled per week the temperature is ranging from 14 3 c to 30 4 c and humidity is 62 15 after 3 weeks growth the leaves roots and radicles are cut to compare the growth performance 2 5 analytical measurements 2 5 1 water

from a needle tip onto the filter paper surface a motion camera was mounted to take photos at a rate of 12 frames per second each sample was measured for three times and the average value was taken the solar absorbance test was scanned from 250 nm to 2500 nm by lambda 950 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrification membrane bioreactor mbr the mbr reactor was firstly started with 50 l running for 4 weeks and then upscaled to 80 l and operated for 8 more weeks for the 3 month operation the sludge was gradually acclimatised to the feed urine the ratio of ammonia to nitrate conversion was stable at 48 50 after the last 6 weeks of operation fig s1 the membrane flux was controlled at 3 8 14 8 lmh by monthly hydraulic cleaning fig s2 an average hrt of 10 5 days was reached with an ammonia conversion rate of 230 135 mg n l 1 d 1 after 3 months operation we collected the mbr permeate as the feed water for the subsequent hlse test the components of the urine before and after mbr are listed in table 1 the concentrations of n p and k in the raw urine are considerable at 2950 280 and 1078 mg l respectively which are similar as our previous bench scale results volpin et al 2020 after the nitrification process 95 tn remained in the permeate the other 5 might be purged or consumed during the nitrification 50 of nh4 was converted to no3 which makes the nh4 no3 ratio approximately 1 1 meanwhile the ph of the permeate decreased from 9 5 to 6 2 which is conducive to the stabilization of nh4 the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 in the permeate are higher than those in the raw urine which is probably because the re dissolution of struvite and caco3 precipitated in the urine tank due to the change of ph as the apparatus such as icp ms ic required pre filtration before measurement struvite and caco3 as precipitants existed in the hydrolysed urine alkaline ambience were rejected by the filter which caused the mg2 and ca2 concentrations to be lower in the untreated urine the concentrations of p k and other ions in the permeate are also the similar level as the untreated urine which are expected in the urine sourced fertiliser production 3 2 heat localized solar evaporation 3 2 1 characterization of absorber the absorber is simply prepared with a commercial capillary filter paper and printed with blank ink fig 3 a the absorbance of the absorbers ranging from 250 nm to 2500 nm was measured as shown in fig 3b the raw filter paper had low absorbance between 250 and 1300 nm and weak absorbance between 1300 and 2500 nm in contrast the black filter paper had strong absorbance covering all the spectrum of uv light visible light and infrared light regions which is consistent with the irradiation scope of solar light and proven to be an excellent absorber in terms of the surface morphology there is no big difference in fibre structure between the raw filter paper fig 3c and the black filter paper fig 3d but the ink printed filter paper had smoother surface probably due to the printing process the contact angle results indicated that after printing black ink the filter paper surface transformed from hydrophilic 0 o fig 3e to hydrophobic 135 24 o fig 3f this is mainly because the black ink was oil based this property was designed to absorb solar energy from the hydrophobic front facet while the evaporation process was conducted on the

space and heat the solution up to 68 c within 1 h to distil water and harvest crystals simultaneously the hlse method achieved a high vapour flux of 1 33 kg m 2 h 1 and overwhelming evaporation efficiency at 87 the generated crystals mainly including nano3 nh4cl nh4h2po4 and k2hpo4 could be applied as solid fertiliser for basil growth its performance showed comparable adaptation for basil growth to an all purpose commercial fertiliser finally the gdmbr hlse as a cost effective green technology is probably a promising field in nutrients recovery from urine further studies such as simultaneous recoveries of nutrients and water continuous production of crystals the optimization and regeneration of absorbers life cycle assessment for the whole process are being investigated and
