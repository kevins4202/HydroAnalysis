18110,cohesive particles in aquatic systems can play an important role in determining the fate of spilled oil via the generation of oil mineral aggregates omas series of laboratory experiments have been conducted aiming at filling the knowledge gap regarding how cohesive clay particles influence the accumulation of petroleum through forming different aggregate structures and their resulting settling velocity omas have been successfully created in a stirring jar with artificial sea water crude oil and two types of most common cohesive minerals kaolinite and bentonite clay with the magnetic stirrer adjusted to 490 rpm to provide a high level homogeneous flow turbulence turbulence dissipation ε estimated to be about 0 02 m2 s 3 droplet omas and flake solid omas were obtained in oil kaolinite sample and oil bentonite sample respectively kaolinite clay with relatively low flocculation rate r f 0 13 min 1 tends to physically attach around the surface of oil droplets with the lower density of oil these oil kaolinite droplet omas generally show lower settling velocity comparing to pure mineral kaolinite flocs differently bentonite clay with higher flocculation rate r f 0 66 min 1 produces more porous flocs that can absorb or be absorbed by the oil and form compact flake solid omas with higher density and settling velocity than pure bentonite flocs in the mixed kaolinite bentonite sample 1 1 in weight oil is observed to preferably interacting with bentonite and increase settling velocity especially in larger floc size classes graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil

the global economic growth extremely large oil spill disasters such as the 1989 exxon valdez spill peterson et al 2003 and the 2010 deepwater horizon dwh disaster crone and tolstoy 2010 atlas and hazen 2011 and increasingly smaller size spills hayakawa et al 2006 doshi et al 2018 liu and callies 2019 had occurred in the coastal zones these oil spill accidents pose detrimental impacts on sea based human activities peterson et al 2003 and contamination of aquatic bio communities ainsworth et al 2018 such as fishes murawski et al 2014 birds henkel et al 2012 coral white et al 2012 or plankton almeda et al 2013 2016 although most mitigation methods focus on spilt oil floating onto the water surface reddy et al 2002 2012 liu et al 2012 there can be a considerable portion of spilt oil settles to the sea floor due to flocculation with natural cohesive materials including sediments and organic particles chanton et al 2014 yan et al 2016 jones and bridgeman 2016 romero et al 2017 o laughlin et al 2017 flocculation with cohesive mineral sediments can be especially common in more energetic coastal environments where resuspension of sediment is more likely or near river mouths where new supplies of sediments are abundant strom and keyvani 2016 shen et al 2018 when crude oil is released into aquatic systems oil droplets can flocculate with suspended particles sterling et al 2005 through settling and deposition the oil mineral aggregates may eventually arrive sea floor and affects benthic ecosystem romero et al 2017 therefore the interactions of oil and aquatic mineral particles or biological materials can play an important role in the fate of spilt oil khelifa et al 2002 2005a passow and hetland 2016 o laughlin et al 2017 this study focuses on the influence of mineral sediments on oil droplets through flocculation insights into flocculation of oil droplets with biological materials e g marine snows can be found in passow et al 2012 and a comprehensive review article of daly et al 2016 oil droplets tend to flocculate with and be stabilized by cohesive particles or suspended particle materials spm in the water column and form oil mineral aggregates omas khelifa et al 2002 oil spm aggregates osas khelifa et al 2005a or oil particle aggregates opas e g zhao et al 2014 2016 2017 in the present study the term omas has been used because only mineral clay was used to flocculate with oil droplets several earlier studies focus on the structure of omas using microscopy imagery and droplet omas flake omas or solid omas are most commonly observed oma structures lee and stoffyn egli 2001 stoffyn egli and lee 2002 droplet omas are combination or enclosure of one or several oil droplet s and mineral particles flocs via surface attachments on the contrary flake omas and solid omas both have similar membrane like sheets with an orderly arranged oil and mineral particle configuration stoffyn egli and lee 2002 with higher shear strength structures of flake omas could be altered to become solid omas because the crumpling or breaking of flake type omas may form more compact and denser floc structures stoffyn egli and lee 2002 loh et al 2014 more quantitative studies of omas can be found in for example omotoso et al 2002 who presented a quantitatively study on flocculation index based on the sedimentation rate of a sheared oil mineral water mixture the degree of interaction of oil and minerals in water was found to be dependent on the viscosity of the crude oil and the type of mineral present moreover khelifa et al 2002 reported that the concentration of oil droplets contained in oma depended on oil viscosity temperature and asphaltenes resins content arc le floch et al 2002 quantified the amount of oil incorporated into oma with the salinity ranging from 0 35 ppt they demonstrated that the oma formation was significantly enhanced by salinity when comparing to distilled water condition however the amount of oil contained in omas saturated at low salinity of only 2 ppt and further enhancing salinity showed almost no effect on oma formation hill et al 2002 presented an equation that defines the time required to coat and stabilize oil droplets with mineral particles suspended in a turbulent medium with the high demand of quantitative understanding on the formation of omas some further laboratory studies have been reported sun et al 2010 2013 showed that the formation of omas increased exponentially with the mixing time and reached an equilibrium within 4 5 hrs at a provided turbulence dissipation rate of 2 6 m2 s 3 they suggested that the shaking rate turbulence largely influenced the maximum oil trapping efficiency in omas in low mixing energy condition most of the aggregates they obtained were solid aggregates and single droplet aggregates while multi droplet oil suspended particles aggregates are observed in high mixing energies among all the existing oma literature very limited studies have been reported to systematically investigate omas settling velocities khelifa et al 2008 reported a series of laboratory jar tests on oma formation by chemically dispersed oil and natural cohesive sediments their data probably for the first time showed a direct relationships between the measured settling velocity and oma size they suggested that those flocs with low oil concentration may barely change the oma characteristics but with high oil concentration within the omas their density can be significantly lower than pure sediment flocs for most sediment types they tested the effective density of the oil sediment aggregates can be about 2 3 times less than those of pure sediment flocs importantly they also suggested that the presence of chemically dispersed oil may enhance the stickiness of sediment grains which helps building up the large flocs with oil participation more recently o laughlin et al 2017 reported measured settling velocity of dilbit derived omas from series of jar tests and wave flume experiments in response to the presence or absence chemical dispersants they suggested that settling velocities of artificially formed omas on the order of 0 1 0 4 mm s 1 moreover the oma size settling velocity and effective particle density were increased in response to the higher concentration of suspended sediment however their data showed evidences that dispersant may inhibits flocculation these two studies clearly indicated the importance of cohesion stickiness in determining the resulting oil floc and their settling velocity the present study is motivated to investigate the effect of mineral types in determining the oma structures and the resulting settling velocities we hypothesize that a main factor controlling the structures of oma is the stickiness of the mineral sediments which further leads to different settling characteristics data obtained from the controlled laboratory experiments are analyzed with three main objectives 1 to understand the omas structures formed with different types of common clay minerals by high resolution digital microscopy 2 to measure physical characteristics of omas such as their sizes and settling velocities using labsfloc 2 camera and to 3 synthesize measured data to gain insights into oma structure and settling dynamics due to different clay types the remaining of this paper is organized as follow section 2 focuses on the laboratory methods measured results are presented in section 3 discussions are given in section 4 and main concluding remarks are provided in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiment setup an experimental stand set fig 1 a was designed and a series of magnetic stirring jar experiments have been conducted at the center for applied coastal research

proportions are used to generate omas these two common clay types are chosen due to their large difference in cohesion in saline water as summarized in table 1 we specify oil to sediment ratio close to 2 with clay mineral concentration of 0 5 g per litre of saline water which provides a condition for maximum oma formation efficiency according to the previous studies guyomarch et al 2002 khelifa et al 2008 ajijolaiya et al 2006 artificial seawater salinity 35 ppt has been made from mixing clean water and pure salt the jar has a diameter of 11 cm and the flow depth is 13 cm 1 l salt water magnetic stirring speed is set to 490 rpm device range 0 1000 rpm for providing a constant turbulence intensity for omas generation three component flow velocities are measured by a vectrino profiler nortek which was mounted on the shelf above the magnetic stirrer with the sensor probes located 5 cm below the water surface in the jar in fig 1a flow velocity data was collected without crude oil and sediment but in otherwise the same flow conditions the time series of turbulent velocity fluctuations are transformed into fourier space to obtain turbulent kinetic energy spectrum turbulence dissipation rate is then estimated to be ε 0 02 m2 s 3 via matching the kolmogorov spectrum with taylor frozen turbulence approximation e g voulgaris and trowbridge 1998 huang et al 2018 all the experiments reported here were carried out in artificial seawater of salinity 35 ppt at 20 c with viscosity 1 08 10 3 pa s different types of mineral flocs and oil mineral aggregates omas samples are generated see table 1 each experimental run last up to 2 hrs and omas are allowed to settle down overnight 8 hrs before they are collected for settling column experiment using labsfloc 2 system see next the mass settling velocity of omas were observed using the low intrusive labsfloc 2 system the 2nd version of laboratory spectral flocculation characteristics instrument fig 1b more information on its design and capability can be found in manning and dyer 2007 and gratiot and manning 2004 the system measures the entire floc population for each sample being assessed and has been successfully applied in many cohesive sediment transport studies manning et al 2010 manning and schoellhamer 2013 uncles and mitchell 2017 labsfloc 2 utilizes a low intrusive 2 0 mp grasshopper monochrome digital video camera to optically observe individual flocs as they settle in a 350 mm high by 100 mm square perspex settling column the video camera positioned nominally 75 mm above the base of the column views all particles in the center of the column that pass within a 1 mm depth of field 45 mm from the sill tzm 1560 high magnification 5 μm pixel resolution telecentric maximum pixel distortion of 0 6 0 66 1 1 5 magnification f4 macro lens fitted behind a 5 mm thick glass faceplate the labsfloc 2 settling column sampling was conducted at the end of each 2 h floc generation experiment and these oma samples are in an equilibrium stage a high resolution digital microscope system has been used to observe detailed floc structures and to carry out statistical analysis on floc numbers at different time during the floc generation in order to evaluate flocculation rate all the floc samples were directly collected from the running experiment in real time using wide mouth 2 mm plastic pipettes to minimize floc disturbance and to transfer the samples from the mixing jar to the microscope slides without using coverslip to prevent the samples being squeezed floc samples are observed with a 4 10 times zoom in screen on a dell laptop by the camera software provided by amscope inc 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 labsfloc 2 camera floc data the labsfloc 2 system produces visible floc individual images that are analyzed to obtain other essential quantitative floc properties including floc size floc shape and floc settling velocity manning et al 2010 through additional theories other floc quantities can be derived such as floc density fractal dimension and so on the recorded videos of floc settling videos can be analyzed with matlab software routines based on the hr wallingford ltd digifloc software benson and manning 2013 and java script to semi automatically process the digital recording image stack to obtain floc size and settling velocity spectra manning et al 2010 uncles and mitchell 2017 using the measured floc diameter d settling velocity w s and floc shape a modified stokes law stokes 1851 is used to estimate individual floc effective density manning and schoellhamer 2013 1 ρ e 18 w s ρ ν g d 2 f r e in which ρ the is the saltwater density ν is the kinematic viscosity and g is gravitational acceleration to account for the floc shape effect the diameters associated with the major and minor axes are identified and the sphere equivalent diameter is used to calculate floc diameter d d m a j o r d m i n o r 0 5 the oseen 1927 correction factor is written as f r e 1 1 0 1875 r e which accounts for higher particle reynolds number effect the particle reynolds number r e is defined as 2 r e ρ e w s d ρ ν when r e is much smaller than unity the modified stokes law shown in eq 1 reduces to commonly used stokes law by assuming floc has a fractal structure the fractal dimension of floc n f can be calculated via the following relationship winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 3 d d n f 3 ρ e ρ s ρ in which d 4 μ m is the minimum primary particle size 2 2 2 microscope images analysis the floc images e g fig 2 a collected from the digital microscope of each floc sample allow a detailed examination of floc and oma structures microscope images also provide independent and high resolution data of floc population which are number counted manually according to the contours and shape analyzed for further statistical analysis and flocculation rate evaluation for each sample six different microscopy images have been analyzed which cover hundreds to thousands individual flocs we also use microscope images to estimate averaged oil droplets size under the given turbulence level e g see fig 2b in the inset of fig 2b we present the pure oil droplets size distribution under the given constant turbulence the statistical analysis of the pure oil droplets samples images shows the maximum oil droplets size can be up to 120 μm and the mean droplets size is approximately 57 μm 2 2 3 mineral stickiness quantification via flocculation rate r f as mentioned before we expect mineral stickiness plays a key role in determining the corresponding oma characteristics in the study of flocculation with significant organic content such as due to the presence of transparent exopolymer particles tep e g passow 2002 the stickiness of each sample was quantified by performing experiments to estimate flocculation efficiency rate engel 2000 similar flocculation rate experiments were carried out in this study for three types of mineral particles without the presence of oil i e cases s01 kaolinite s03 bentonite and s05 kaolinite bentonite mixture see table 1 respectively temporal microscopy images six images for each sample at a time have been collected during mineral flocs development in a magnetic stirrer jar from beginning 0 min to the end 2 h for each mineral sample by counting the floc numbers at different instants and normalizing them by the initial floc number of each mineral sample flocculation evolution time series were obtained for each type of mineral clay fig 3 the manually counted floc numbers cover hundreds to thousands individual flocs which are statistically significant to represent the characteristics of each sample due to flocculation the number of particles in each case decayed in time in the semi logarithmic plot shown in fig 3 we observed a nearly exponential decay of particle number in the first couple of minutes of the flocculation before the particle number becomes more or less constant in time by fitting the first three data points in each run we obtain the representative flocculation rate r f the three trend lines in fig 3 indicate that kaolinite clay has the lowest flocculation rate of r f k a o l i n i t e 0 13 min 1 while the bentonite clay shows a nearly 5 times larger flocculation rate of r f b e n t o n i t e 0 66 min 1 the mixture of equal amount of kaolinite and bentonite has an intermediate flocculation rate of r f m i x e d 0 32 min 1 following engel 2000 we will consider kaolinite having the lowest cohesion followed by the mixture of kaolinite bentonite and bentonite is among the most cohesive sediments investigated in this study this information will be shown later to be very useful for the interpretation of the oma structure and labsfloc 2 settling column experimental results we also like to point out that in the bentonite red dots and kaolinite bentonite mixture yellow dots samples normalized floc numbers increase after reaching the maximum flocculation lowest normalized floc number at 5 6 min the increase is most evident for kaolinite bentonite mixture and consequently the flocs reach an equilibrium stage much later at about 30 min we believe that this interesting feature is due to the break up of part of the larger fragile flocs after reaching the maximum flocculation at the maximum flocculation stage the participation of more cohesive bentonite flocs are likely to connect those smaller but denser kaolinite flocs to form large aggregate structures however these large aggregates are fragile and can be further broken into smaller flocs in high turbulence this complex interaction in mixed kaolinite bentonite sediment can also be seen in the settling column data to be discussed later 3 results 3 1 floc structures we examine floc structures using high resolution microscope images samples from each case presented in table 1 were collected after the flocculation process reached equilibrium fig 4a1 shows a representative microscope image of pure kaolinite clay flocs 500 mg l 1 s01 in table 1 with the addition of 1 g texas crude oil s02 in table 1 the oil droplets are observed to be attached or embraced within the kaolinite clay structures such as fig 4a2 4 the attachment is limited to the surface of oil droplets while the droplets structure remains intact the oil kaolinite aggregates observed here are consistent with the droplet oma type reported in the previous studies stoffyn egli and lee 2002 khelifa et al 2002 in which oil droplets are coated by sediment aggregates through surface attachment the quantity of mineral attached to a droplet is highly variable the oma obtained from the bentonite clay run s03 in table 1 are shown in fig 4b1 the bentonite flocs are generally larger than kaolinite flocs and their size can be up to 100 200 μm in width and several hundred microns in length these features are distinct from the pure kaolinite run s01 shown in fig 4a1 as demonstrated in section 2 2 3 or fig 3 pure bentonite clay particles are much cohesive and attachable than kaolinite particles more importantly the more cohesive characteristic of bentonite floc leads to an entirely re shaped oil mineral structure see fig 4b2 s04 in table 1 compared with oil kaolinite flocs the sphere shaped oil droplets disappeared the oil bentonite flocs show much larger size of oil soaked mineral having a flake shaped aggregates up to hundreds of microns in size see fig 4b2 4 compared with the previous studies stoffyn egli and lee 2002 khelifa et al 2002 zhao et al 2016 the dominant oil bentonite aggregates observed here belong to a dense type of oil aggregate called flake solid oma flake aggregates have the appearance of membrane structures which can attain hundreds of microns in length their microstructure is highly organized as dendritic or feather like experimental results suggest that high shear strength i e extended or faster agitation tends to break or crumple flake aggregates the crumpled flakes fig 4b2 4 may be distinguished from mineral embraced droplet oma fig 4a2 4 by their folds or preferential orientation of the minerals after mixing equal amount of kaolinite and bentonite clay for case s05 the mixture flocs contain both kaolinite floc and bentonite floc structures see fig 4c1 and importantly although the general size of the mixed flocs fig 4c1 are smaller than pure bentonite case fig 4b1 the bentonite floc structure appears to be dominant in the mixture mineral sample with the addition of oil in the mixture sample s06 large flake shaped oma can be observed in fig 4c2 4 which has similar floc size with those in the oil bentonite case s04 see fig 4b2 4 however both droplet omas and flake omas can be observed in fig 4c3 4 because kaolinite clay has much lower cohesion than bentonite the resulting oma structures are also distinctly different which is expected to lead to different settling velocities in the next sections we will investigate different mineral flocs and omas settling velocities and discuss their relationship to floc structures 3 2 floc physical properties the previous section provided insights into the floc structures for different types of omas by microscopy images this section is devoted to more quantitative study of floc physical properties particularly their settling velocities the scatterplots in figs 5a 6a and 7 a illustrate individual spherical equivalent dry mass weighted floc sizes x axis plotted against their corresponding settling velocities y axis of each sample see table 1 collected and analyzed by labsfloc 2 camera system the scatterplots allow subsequent statistical analysis for floc properties using 12 different size classes size band definition is shown in the bottom of figs 5 7 the physical properties shown are the counted floc numbers of each size band figs 5c 6c and 7c and the averaged settling velocity figs 5d 6d and 7d floc density figs 5e 6e and 7e and fractal dimension figs 5f 6f and 7f for each size band 3 3 kaolinite and oil kaolinite flocs the scatterplot presented in fig 5a indicates that the kaolinite clay flocs s01 cover a size range from 20 to 400 μm while their settling velocities vary from 0 04 to 10 mm s 1 although with some notable scatters the floc settling velocities are more or less proportional to floc sizes adding oil into kaolinite mineral s02 shows negligible change in the floc size range see fig 5b however when floc size is greater than about 80 μm the peak settling velocities about 4 mm s 1 show almost no change with respect to floc size also there exist some low density flocs in the rather large size range of 200 400 μm with settling velocities ranging from 0 2 0 6 mm s 1 around the red constant density line of 16 kg m 3 in fig 5b this is due to the large oil kaolinite flocs having much lower density than those of pure kaolinite flocs a more quantitative understanding on these interesting features can be obtained by examining the statistics of 12 size bands the number of kaolinite flocs increases dramatically from size band sb 1 20 40 μm to sb 3 80 120 μm and then drops quickly from sb 3 to sb 8 320 400 μm fig 5c blue bands since the labsfloc 2 analysis can reliably resolve particles size down to 20 μm it is reminded that some very small flocs are not captured in the results shown here adding oil to kaolinite significantly increases floc number for small size flocs 20 80 μm at sb 1 and sb 2 while floc numbers at larger size class are generally lower than or similar to those of pure kaolinite flocs fig 5c orange bars the settling velocities of kaolinite samples s01 and s02 in table 1 averaged for each size class are shown in fig 5d pure mineral flocs s01 show a rapid increase of settling velocities with respect to the increase of floc sizes for the entire size class spectrum sb 1 to sb 8 on the contrary oil kaolinite flocs show milder increase of settling velocity with respect to floc size from sb 1 to sb 6 until a completely different trend is observed for larger size class sb 6 to sb 8 where the settling velocity decreases as the floc size increases it is evident that adding oil to kaolinite decreases settling velocity particularly for larger floc size classes by nearly factor 3 in the sb 6 and nearly a factor 7 in the sb 8 considerable reduction of settling velocity at sb 6 to sb 8 is clearly associated with the significant decrease of floc effective density due to the addition of oil to kaolinite at this size range see fig 5e adding oil reduces floc effective density in all floc size bands but the reduction is much more pronounced at large size class in sb 2 and sb 3 effective density decreases by approximate 1 3 to 1 4 by adding oil while settling velocity also decreases accordingly in sb 4 to sb 8 the effective density decreased by half or much more especially in the larger size bands and their settling velocity shows a remarkable reduction since averaged droplet size is about 57 μm see fig 2b oil participation is more likely to occur in larger size bands overall the results presented here is consistent with the presence of oil as droplets see fig 4a2 a4 having lower density than saltwater or mineral the fractal dimension for kaolinite flocs or kaolinite oil flocs is in the range of 2 4 2 6 except for a small number of large flocs in sb 7 8 62 and 52 in s01 and s02 respectively mostly in sb 7 in general adding oil slightly reduces fractal dimension to 2 4 a notable exception is that when oil is added to kaolinite we observed the largest single floc in sb 8 which show a much lower fractal dimension of 2 05 due to containing several low density oil droplets in the large structure 3 3 1 bentonite and oil bentonite flocs in the pure bentonite sample s03 fig 6a we observe about 30 very large size flocs up to 400 700 μm that do not exist in the pure kaolinite sample s01 the resulting settling velocity range is also wider 0 01 20 mm s 1 than that in kaolinite samples a more careful examination further suggests that many large size flocs in sb 9 sb 12 in fig 6c in pure bentonite sample s03 are of very low density within 50 kg m 3 and their settling velocities are limited to range of 1 5 mm s 1 despite very large floc size adding oil further produced a very large floc of 800 μm fig 6b the upper limit of settling velocity reached to about 10 mm s 1 which is about a factor 2 larger than that of oil kaolinite floc see fig 5b comparing to kaolinite samples s01 and s02 the most notable difference is that the floc numbers for bentonite samples are significantly lower larger floc sizes and lower floc number in bentonite samples are consistent with the high flocculation rate high stickiness of bentonite discussed in section 2 2 3 when oil is added to bentonite s04 see fig 6d we observe a monotonic increase of settling velocities with the floc size except at the largest size class sb 12 but it only consists of one floc this trend is different from the oil kaolinite sample s02 fig 5d moreover when oil is added to bentonite we observe a more rapid increase of settling velocity when floc size increases from sb 9 to sb 12 comparing to the pure bentonite condition we obtain an increase of settling velocity by more than a fact of 2 in sb 11 while recall that for kaolinite samples adding oil to kaolinite s02 significantly reduces the floc settling velocity these observations are supported by the floc effective density data from fig 6e we can see that adding oil to bentonite clay generally increases floc effective density with the most significant increases occur at sb 1 and sb 9 to sb 12 contrast with fig 5e adding oil reduces floc effective density in all size bands in kaolinite samples this suggests that oil interact differently with kaolinite and bentonite samples and it is consistent with their distinct droplet oma and flake oma structures presented in fig 4 in the bentonite case s04 the oil droplets no longer exists and become absorbed into mineral flocs it is likely that at such micro scale oil changes the adhesion characteristic and make the small flocs more compact dense with lower porosity the fractal dimension for bentonite floc or bentonite oil flocs are in the range of 2 2 2 4 which is slightly lower than those of kaolinite samples however adding oil to bentonite generally increases fractal dimension with the largest increase occurs at sb 1 with a fractal dimension near 2 5 it is interesting to the point out that a notable fractal dimension changes after adding oil is in larger size class floc of sb 8 320 400 μm for kaolinite sample and in the smallest size class of sb 1 20 40 μm for bentonite sample this drastic difference is again consistent with different oma structure of kaolinite and bentonite clay 3 3 2 mixed kaolinite bentonite and oil kaolinite bentonite flocs the settling velocity for mixed kaolinite bentonite flocs s05 peaks at about 10 mm s 1 for floc size greater than about 100 μm fig 7a when oil is further added to the mixed kaolinite bentonite sample fig 7b we observe even higher floc settling velocities exceeding 10 mm s 1 generally both kaolinite bentonite minerals flocs and oil kaolinite bentonite flocs show increasing settling velocity with the increasing floc sizes fig 7d except at the largest size class in other words by adding oil to equally mixed kaolinite and bentonite mixture the overall settling velocity trend is similar to that of pure bentonite fig 6d this observation can be further confirmed by examining floc effective density shown in fig 7e similar to adding oil to pure bentonite see fig 6e adding oil to kaolinite bentonite mixture generally increase floc effective density and hence the settling velocity also increases in most size bands there are also some minor but unique differences in the pure kaolinite bentonite sample a large number of small sized flocs 80 μm in sb 1 and sb 2 are observed which are lacking in pure kaolinite fig 5a or pure bentonite fig 6a samples this feature can be due to complex interaction of kaolinte and bentonite clays having very different stickiness firstly the presence of kaolinite particles decrease the stickiness of the mixed floc comparing to pure bentonite condition which leads to more small flocs comparing to pure bentonite condition moreover it is likely that the more porous bentonite flocs when flocculate with kaolinite flocs make the whole mixed flocs more fragile and with the high turbulence level provided part of the mixture flocs tends to break up into smaller flocs even smaller than those in pure bentonite or kaolinite cases finally there exist some very small flocs with diameter smaller than 20 μ m that cannot be resolved by labsfloc 2 system in the kaolinite cases see those very small particles resolved by microscope images in fig 4a1 a2 when more cohesive bentonite particles are added and then bonded with kaolinite particles these very small flocs may become larger and resolvable by labsfloc 2 system since these complex processes may require longer interaction time the feature is consistent with the temporal evolution of normalized floc number shown in fig 3 that after the kaolinte bentonite mixture sample reaches maximum flocculation lowest normalized floc number at about 5 min normalized floc number starts to increase and approaches the final equilibrium at about 30 min comparing to bentonite cases we also observe much less number of flocs in large size bands sb 9 to sb 12 in kaolinite bentonite mixture cases and this is clearly due to the presence of less cohesive kaolinite consequently adding oil to kaolinite bentonite mixture also does not increase the cohesion as much when comparing to adding oil to pure bentonite overall oil can be considered to preferably interacting with bentonite and the presence of kaolinite is of secondary effect to reduce cohesion for kaolinite bentonite mixture the fractal dimension of small sized flocs can be up to 2 8 while the large flocs are of lower value around 2 4 to 2 6 the range of fractal dimension is larger than pure bentonite s03 and it is similar to pure kaolinite s01 except for the smallest size class sb 1 by adding oil flocs fractal dimension in larger size class sb 6 to sb 9 increases and those in small size class sb 1 to sb 5 show negligible change 3 4 microflocs and macroflocs in the cohesive sediment literature two distinguished floc components microflocs and macroflocs have been utilized to effectively reduce key information provided by the floc spectra manning et al 2010 manning and dyer 2007 manning and schoellhamer 2013 a floc diameter of 160 μ m has been often used to distinguish between microflocs and macroflocs groups manning and dyer 2002 manning 2004 manning et al 2010 and it is also adopted in this study in order to obtain more general understanding on the floc physical properties a summary of mean floc properties for the entire floc population and sub population categorized into microflocs and macroflocs for all cases are presented in table 2 similar to the previous sections the physical floc properties presented are floc number n mean floc diameter d mean effective density ρ e mean settling velocity w s and mean fractal dimensions f n a comparison between kaolinite s01 and bentonite flocs s03 show that the kaolinite flocs in total have around 35 higher floc number n 2631 versus 1705 and 35 smaller floc diameter d 120 versus 185 μm see table 2 the larger n in kaolinite is only due to microflocs and in terms of macrofloc number kaolinite has only half of that of bentonite the mean effective density ρ e for the entire floc population of kaolinite floc is about 2 5 times larger than that of bentonite floc however this is particularly due to the bentonite macroflocs having significantly low ρ e only 87 kg m 3 our data indicating flocculation in saline water depends on mineral type particularly for the enhancement of flocculation due to bentonite is consistent with several earlier studies khelifa et al 2005b zhang et al 2019 our study further indicates that despite smaller d of kaolinite flocs their significantly larger ρ e results in approximately 20 larger w s than that of bentonite flocs finally f n of kaolinite flocs is about 2 54 which is higher than that of bentonite flocs of around 2 3 the differences of kaolinite and bentonite flocs revealed here can be directly attributed to the almost factor 5 higher flocculation rate r f of bentonite than kaolinite in 35 ppt saline water presented in fig 3 by adding oil to the kaolinite sample s02 in table 1 oil kaolinite floc number n for the entire population is increased by around 18 while the corresponding d decreases by around 18 however instead of obtaining a slight increase of ρ e commonly expected for decreased cohesion the ρ e for the entire population also decreases by 20 as a result of both reduced d and ρ e we obtain a significant reduction of w s by 50 decreases from 2 41 mm s 1 to 1 21 mm s 1 see table 2 furthermore we observe different response of microfloc and macrofloc fractions due to the addition of oil to kaolinite in the saline water the microfloc population shows a 27 increase in n and 15 reduction of d while the macrofloc population show 20 reduced in n and very slight 2 5 increase or nearly unchanged d this indicates a minor shift to microfloc population and reduction of cohesion due to the addition of oil the common trend for both microfloc and macrofloc is their reduction of ρ e the microflocs show slight 20 decrease of ρ e while the macroflocs show nearly a factor 2 decrease of ρ e as a result the microfloc and macrofloc w s are decreased by 43 and 51 respectively overall the participation of lower density oil droplets reduces the oma density consistent with the droplet oma structure presented in fig 4 due to low stickiness of kaolinite mineral the direct interaction between oil and kaolinite is limited to a slight reduction of stickiness and increase of microfloc number these microflocs tend to attach with the oil droplets around the surface forming droplet omas with much lower density and settling velocity than the pure kaolinite mineral flocs in terms of the entire floc population adding oil to bentonite clay s04 causes minor change in n d and ρ e however more significant effect due to oil participation can be identified via a shift between microfloc and macrofloc populations we obtain 11 decrease of microfloc ρ e while the macrofloc ρ e is increased more significantly by 20 due to the participation of oil as a result microfloc w s is nearly unchanged while the macrofloc w s is increased by 29 since the total flocs are dominated by macroflocs in the bentonite cases the w s for the entire population is increased by 25 when adding oil in the mixed kaolinite bentonite sample s05 the microfloc d is 15 smaller than that of kaolinite s01 and yet in terms of the macrofloc d mixed sample is 13 larger in fact the macrofloc d for mixed kaolinite bentonite sample is nearly comparable only 5 smaller to that of pure bentonite s03 although the w s of mixed kaolinite bentonite sample for the whole floc population 1 97 mm s 1 appears to be similar to that of pure bentonite sample 2 0 mm s 1 the mixed sample reaches the similar w s due to having the largest ρ e 410 kg m 3 and the smallest d 104 μm comparing to pure kaolinite s01 and pure bentonite s03 samples looking more into the difference we can see that macrofloc d and ρ e of kaolinite bentonite mixture is about 13 larger and 12 smaller than those of pure kaolinite sample respectively which suggests a slight increase of cohesion in kaolinite bentonite flocs due to the presence of bentonite on the contrary in the microfloc population kaolinite bentonite sample show the smallest and the densest flocs which is similar to the microfloc of pure kaolinite sample but distinctly different from those of pure bentonite sample the mixed kaolinite bentonite sample possesses a dual feature namely the kaolinite like features are observed in microflocs and bentonite characteristics are more pronounced in macroflocs by adding oil into mixed kaolinite bentonite clay s06 w s for the entire population increases almost 70 however this increase cannot be explained simply by changes in d and ρ e looking into microfloc and macrofloc population adding oil decreases microfloc n by 18 increases microfloc d by 14 and reduces ρ e by only 3 this slight increase of cohesion cause a 53 increase of microfloc settling velocity oil participation also cause a similar 56 increase in macrofloc settling velocity which is caused by a significant 45 increase in ρ e with negligible decrease of d as a result w s increases by almost 70 due to increase of microfloc d as well as more dramatic increase of ρ e in macroflocs with the exception of kaolinite floc and predominant droplet omas generally it is not straightforward to understand the effect of oil on modifying the mineral floc settling velocity without looking into the behavior of floc size classes here we demonstrate that a minimum size class differentiation of microfloc and macrofloc appears to be useful 4 discussion the results presented in this study indicate the key differences of floccualtion characteristics between kaolinite and bentonite omas which in respond to their unique oma structures that are further controlled by mineral stickiness kaolinite particles tend to show lower stickiness and the resulting oil kaolinite aggregates can be categorized as droplet omas this process is also known as the pickering emulsions chevalier and bolzinger 2013 see also fig 4a2 the kaolinite particles flocs act as a web structures surrounding the oil droplet preventing its attachment to other oil droplets or further re bonding to oil slicks previous studies e g zhao et al 2017 have found that equilibrium omas are very stable structure and hardly break kaolinite omas observed here also consist of more complex multiple mineral flocs in this case kaolinite mineral particles form a much larger structure than individual oil droplet which is attached or embraced within the larger kaolinite flocs fig 4a2 4 because oil droplets structure remains intact the oil kaolinite omas show significantly lower effective density and settling velocity than the pure kaolinite flocs this finding is consistent with khelifa et al 2008 using natural cohesive sediments and suggested that omas effective density are 2 3 times lower than pure sediment flocs on the other hand bentonite particles are of very high stickiness and are observed to form large fluffy low density and high porosity and complex aggregate structure the large bentonite aggregates tend to re shape and absorb or be absorbed by the oil droplets and form denser oil bentonite aggregates fig 4b2 4 in this case because the oil droplets no longer exists by themselves and the oil is mainly absorbed at micro scale level onto the mineral structure the bentonite particles can actually become more compact than its pure mineral floc structure high porosity and the resulting omas are dominated by denser and larger macroflocs the overall settling velocities of oil bentonite omas are also slightly larger than the pure bentonite flocs previous experimental work also indicates that omas formed using natural sediment can be as large as 900 μm o laughlin et al 2017 and their settling velocity can be variable depending on the amount of oil trapped in aggregates sun et al 2010 by adding oil to kaolinite bentonite mixture oil interacts more actively with bentonite in macroflocs to increase the floc effective density and hence settling velocity however oil appears to also increase the size of microflocs due to slightly increased cohesion this study confirms that the stickiness cohesion can be one of the key factors in the formation of omas since chemical dispersant may also affect stickiness during oil sediment flocculation khelifa et al 2008 the significance of stickiness needs to be investigated more extensively the present study apply a rather high turbulence level to generate omas with the measured turbulent dissipation rate of ε 0 02 m2 s 3 the estimated kolmogorov length scale η ν 3 ε 1 4 is about 85 μm which is either slightly smaller for kaolinte or kaolinite bentonite cases or about a factor 2 smaller for bentonite cases than the measured mean floc size a similar finding that measured oma size is about a factor 2 or more larger than the estimated kolmogorov length scale has been reported by sun et al 2010 2013 for even higher turbulence level than the present study more extensive investigation on how intense turbulence can limit oma size can be very useful especially for modeling purposes 5 conclusions the labsfloc 2 system and digital microscopy are utilized to study settling velocities of omas and their corresponding floc structures consistent with previous studies droplet omas and flake solid omas have been observed however we further show that these different omas are formed primarily due to the stickiness level of mineral clay and they also lead to different settling velocities for low stickiness kaolinite clay oil participation generates droplet omas and the resulting settling velocity is about a factor 2 smaller than the pure kaolinte flocs on the other hand for high stickiness bentonite clay oil participation produces flack solid omas and the corresponding settling velocity is slightly larger about 25 than the pure bentonite flocs for the mixed kaolinite bentonite omas the resulting settling velocity is about 70 larger than the pure kaolinite bentonite flocs while it is clear that the more dominant effect is due to oil interacting with more cohesive bentonite the presence of kaolinite appears to also help increasing the settling velocity by forming denser kaolinite bentonite microflocs since the bentonite clay is one of the most common mineral particles in natural environments its role in absorbing oil forming omas and influencing the fate of oil need to be

18110,cohesive particles in aquatic systems can play an important role in determining the fate of spilled oil via the generation of oil mineral aggregates omas series of laboratory experiments have been conducted aiming at filling the knowledge gap regarding how cohesive clay particles influence the accumulation of petroleum through forming different aggregate structures and their resulting settling velocity omas have been successfully created in a stirring jar with artificial sea water crude oil and two types of most common cohesive minerals kaolinite and bentonite clay with the magnetic stirrer adjusted to 490 rpm to provide a high level homogeneous flow turbulence turbulence dissipation ε estimated to be about 0 02 m2 s 3 droplet omas and flake solid omas were obtained in oil kaolinite sample and oil bentonite sample respectively kaolinite clay with relatively low flocculation rate r f 0 13 min 1 tends to physically attach around the surface of oil droplets with the lower density of oil these oil kaolinite droplet omas generally show lower settling velocity comparing to pure mineral kaolinite flocs differently bentonite clay with higher flocculation rate r f 0 66 min 1 produces more porous flocs that can absorb or be absorbed by the oil and form compact flake solid omas with higher density and settling velocity than pure bentonite flocs in the mixed kaolinite bentonite sample 1 1 in weight oil is observed to preferably interacting with bentonite and increase settling velocity especially in larger floc size classes graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil

the global economic growth extremely large oil spill disasters such as the 1989 exxon valdez spill peterson et al 2003 and the 2010 deepwater horizon dwh disaster crone and tolstoy 2010 atlas and hazen 2011 and increasingly smaller size spills hayakawa et al 2006 doshi et al 2018 liu and callies 2019 had occurred in the coastal zones these oil spill accidents pose detrimental impacts on sea based human activities peterson et al 2003 and contamination of aquatic bio communities ainsworth et al 2018 such as fishes murawski et al 2014 birds henkel et al 2012 coral white et al 2012 or plankton almeda et al 2013 2016 although most mitigation methods focus on spilt oil floating onto the water surface reddy et al 2002 2012 liu et al 2012 there can be a considerable portion of spilt oil settles to the sea floor due to flocculation with natural cohesive materials including sediments and organic particles chanton et al 2014 yan et al 2016 jones and bridgeman 2016 romero et al 2017 o laughlin et al 2017 flocculation with cohesive mineral sediments can be especially common in more energetic coastal environments where resuspension of sediment is more likely or near river mouths where new supplies of sediments are abundant strom and keyvani 2016 shen et al 2018 when crude oil is released into aquatic systems oil droplets can flocculate with suspended particles sterling et al 2005 through settling and deposition the oil mineral aggregates may eventually arrive sea floor and affects benthic ecosystem romero et al 2017 therefore the interactions of oil and aquatic mineral particles or biological materials can play an important role in the fate of spilt oil khelifa et al 2002 2005a passow and hetland 2016 o laughlin et al 2017 this study focuses on the influence of mineral sediments on oil droplets through flocculation insights into flocculation of oil droplets with biological materials e g marine snows can be found in passow et al 2012 and a comprehensive review article of daly et al 2016 oil droplets tend to flocculate with and be stabilized by cohesive particles or suspended particle materials spm in the water column and form oil mineral aggregates omas khelifa et al 2002 oil spm aggregates osas khelifa et al 2005a or oil particle aggregates opas e g zhao et al 2014 2016 2017 in the present study the term omas has been used because only mineral clay was used to flocculate with oil droplets several earlier studies focus on the structure of omas using microscopy imagery and droplet omas flake omas or solid omas are most commonly observed oma structures lee and stoffyn egli 2001 stoffyn egli and lee 2002 droplet omas are combination or enclosure of one or several oil droplet s and mineral particles flocs via surface attachments on the contrary flake omas and solid omas both have similar membrane like sheets with an orderly arranged oil and mineral particle configuration stoffyn egli and lee 2002 with higher shear strength structures of flake omas could be altered to become solid omas because the crumpling or breaking of flake type omas may form more compact and denser floc structures stoffyn egli and lee 2002 loh et al 2014 more quantitative studies of omas can be found in for example omotoso et al 2002 who presented a quantitatively study on flocculation index based on the sedimentation rate of a sheared oil mineral water mixture the degree of interaction of oil and minerals in water was found to be dependent on the viscosity of the crude oil and the type of mineral present moreover khelifa et al 2002 reported that the concentration of oil droplets contained in oma depended on oil viscosity temperature and asphaltenes resins content arc le floch et al 2002 quantified the amount of oil incorporated into oma with the salinity ranging from 0 35 ppt they demonstrated that the oma formation was significantly enhanced by salinity when comparing to distilled water condition however the amount of oil contained in omas saturated at low salinity of only 2 ppt and further enhancing salinity showed almost no effect on oma formation hill et al 2002 presented an equation that defines the time required to coat and stabilize oil droplets with mineral particles suspended in a turbulent medium with the high demand of quantitative understanding on the formation of omas some further laboratory studies have been reported sun et al 2010 2013 showed that the formation of omas increased exponentially with the mixing time and reached an equilibrium within 4 5 hrs at a provided turbulence dissipation rate of 2 6 m2 s 3 they suggested that the shaking rate turbulence largely influenced the maximum oil trapping efficiency in omas in low mixing energy condition most of the aggregates they obtained were solid aggregates and single droplet aggregates while multi droplet oil suspended particles aggregates are observed in high mixing energies among all the existing oma literature very limited studies have been reported to systematically investigate omas settling velocities khelifa et al 2008 reported a series of laboratory jar tests on oma formation by chemically dispersed oil and natural cohesive sediments their data probably for the first time showed a direct relationships between the measured settling velocity and oma size they suggested that those flocs with low oil concentration may barely change the oma characteristics but with high oil concentration within the omas their density can be significantly lower than pure sediment flocs for most sediment types they tested the effective density of the oil sediment aggregates can be about 2 3 times less than those of pure sediment flocs importantly they also suggested that the presence of chemically dispersed oil may enhance the stickiness of sediment grains which helps building up the large flocs with oil participation more recently o laughlin et al 2017 reported measured settling velocity of dilbit derived omas from series of jar tests and wave flume experiments in response to the presence or absence chemical dispersants they suggested that settling velocities of artificially formed omas on the order of 0 1 0 4 mm s 1 moreover the oma size settling velocity and effective particle density were increased in response to the higher concentration of suspended sediment however their data showed evidences that dispersant may inhibits flocculation these two studies clearly indicated the importance of cohesion stickiness in determining the resulting oil floc and their settling velocity the present study is motivated to investigate the effect of mineral types in determining the oma structures and the resulting settling velocities we hypothesize that a main factor controlling the structures of oma is the stickiness of the mineral sediments which further leads to different settling characteristics data obtained from the controlled laboratory experiments are analyzed with three main objectives 1 to understand the omas structures formed with different types of common clay minerals by high resolution digital microscopy 2 to measure physical characteristics of omas such as their sizes and settling velocities using labsfloc 2 camera and to 3 synthesize measured data to gain insights into oma structure and settling dynamics due to different clay types the remaining of this paper is organized as follow section 2 focuses on the laboratory methods measured results are presented in section 3 discussions are given in section 4 and main concluding remarks are provided in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiment setup an experimental stand set fig 1 a was designed and a series of magnetic stirring jar experiments have been conducted at the center for applied coastal research

proportions are used to generate omas these two common clay types are chosen due to their large difference in cohesion in saline water as summarized in table 1 we specify oil to sediment ratio close to 2 with clay mineral concentration of 0 5 g per litre of saline water which provides a condition for maximum oma formation efficiency according to the previous studies guyomarch et al 2002 khelifa

magnetic stirring speed is set to 490 rpm device range 0 1000 rpm for providing a constant turbulence intensity for omas generation three component flow velocities are measured by a vectrino profiler nortek which was mounted on the shelf above the magnetic stirrer with the sensor probes located 5 cm below the water surface in the jar in fig 1a flow velocity data was collected without crude oil and sediment but in otherwise the same flow conditions the time series of turbulent velocity fluctuations are transformed into fourier space to obtain turbulent kinetic energy spectrum turbulence dissipation rate is then estimated to be ε 0 02 m2 s 3 via matching the kolmogorov spectrum with taylor frozen turbulence approximation e g voulgaris and trowbridge 1998 huang et al 2018 all the experiments reported here were carried out in artificial seawater of salinity 35 ppt at 20 c with viscosity 1 08 10 3 pa s different types of mineral flocs and oil mineral aggregates omas samples are generated see table 1 each experimental run last up to 2 hrs and omas are allowed to settle down overnight 8 hrs before they are collected for settling column experiment using labsfloc 2 system see next the mass settling velocity of omas were observed using the low intrusive labsfloc 2 system the 2nd version of laboratory spectral flocculation characteristics instrument fig 1b more information on its design and capability can be found in manning and dyer 2007 and gratiot and manning 2004 the system measures the entire floc population for each sample being assessed and has been successfully applied in many cohesive sediment transport studies manning et al 2010 manning and schoellhamer 2013 uncles and mitchell 2017 labsfloc 2 utilizes a low intrusive 2 0 mp grasshopper monochrome digital video camera to optically observe individual flocs as they settle in a 350 mm high by 100 mm square perspex settling column the video camera positioned nominally 75 mm above the base of the column

samples are in an equilibrium stage a high resolution digital microscope system has been used to observe detailed floc structures and to carry out statistical analysis on floc numbers at different time during the floc generation in order to evaluate flocculation rate all the floc samples were directly collected from the running experiment in real time using wide mouth 2 mm plastic pipettes to minimize floc disturbance and to transfer the samples from the mixing jar to the microscope slides without using coverslip to prevent the samples being squeezed floc samples are observed with a 4 10 times zoom in screen on a dell laptop by the camera software provided by amscope inc 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 labsfloc 2 camera floc data the labsfloc 2 system produces visible floc individual images that are analyzed to obtain other essential quantitative floc properties including floc size floc shape and floc settling velocity manning et al 2010 through additional theories other floc quantities can be derived such as floc density fractal dimension and so on the recorded videos of floc settling videos can be analyzed with matlab software routines based on the hr wallingford ltd digifloc software benson and manning 2013 and java script to semi automatically process the digital recording image stack to obtain floc size and settling velocity spectra manning et al 2010 uncles and mitchell 2017 using the measured floc diameter d settling velocity w s and floc shape a modified stokes law stokes 1851 is used to estimate individual floc effective density manning and schoellhamer 2013 1 ρ e 18 w s ρ ν g d 2 f r e in which ρ the is the saltwater density ν is the kinematic viscosity and g is gravitational acceleration to account for the floc shape effect the diameters associated with the major and minor axes are identified and the sphere equivalent diameter is used to calculate floc diameter d d m a j o r d m i n o r 0 5 the oseen 1927 correction factor is written as f r e 1 1 0 1875 r e which accounts for higher particle reynolds number effect the particle reynolds number r e is defined as 2 r e ρ e w s d ρ ν when r e is much smaller than unity the modified stokes law shown in eq 1 reduces to commonly used stokes law by assuming floc has a fractal structure the fractal dimension of floc n f can be calculated via the following relationship winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 3 d d n f 3 ρ e ρ s ρ in which d 4 μ m is the minimum primary particle size 2 2 2 microscope images analysis the floc images e g fig 2 a collected from the digital microscope of each floc sample allow a detailed examination of floc and oma structures microscope images also provide independent and high resolution data of floc population which are number counted manually according to the contours and shape analyzed for further statistical analysis and flocculation rate evaluation for each sample six different microscopy images have been analyzed which cover hundreds to thousands individual flocs we also use microscope images to estimate averaged oil droplets size under the given turbulence level e g see fig 2b in the inset of fig 2b we present the pure oil droplets size distribution under the given constant turbulence the statistical analysis of the pure oil droplets samples images shows the maximum oil droplets size can be up to 120 μm and the mean droplets size is approximately 57 μm 2 2 3 mineral stickiness quantification via flocculation rate r f as mentioned before we expect mineral stickiness plays a key role in determining the corresponding oma characteristics in the study of flocculation with significant organic content such as due to the presence of transparent exopolymer particles tep e g passow 2002 the stickiness of each sample was quantified by performing experiments to estimate flocculation efficiency rate engel 2000 similar flocculation rate experiments were carried out in this study for three types of mineral particles without the presence of oil i e cases s01 kaolinite s03 bentonite and s05 kaolinite bentonite mixture see table 1 respectively temporal microscopy images six images for each sample at a time have been collected during mineral flocs development in a magnetic stirrer jar from beginning 0 min to the end 2 h for each mineral sample by counting the floc numbers at different instants and normalizing them by the initial floc number of each mineral sample flocculation evolution time series were obtained for each type of mineral clay fig 3 the manually counted floc numbers cover hundreds to thousands individual flocs which are statistically significant to represent the characteristics of each sample due to flocculation the number of particles in each case decayed in time in the semi logarithmic plot shown in fig 3 we observed a nearly exponential decay of particle number in the first couple of minutes of the flocculation before the particle number becomes more or less constant in time by fitting the first three data points in each run we obtain the representative flocculation rate r f the three trend lines in fig 3 indicate that kaolinite clay has the lowest flocculation rate of r f k a o l i n i t e 0 13 min 1 while the bentonite clay shows a nearly 5 times larger flocculation rate of r f b e n t o n i t e 0 66 min 1 the mixture of equal amount of kaolinite and bentonite has an intermediate flocculation rate of r f m i x e d 0 32 min 1 following engel 2000 we will consider kaolinite having the lowest cohesion followed by the mixture of kaolinite bentonite and bentonite is among the most cohesive sediments investigated in this study this information will be shown later to be very useful for the interpretation of the oma structure and labsfloc 2 settling column experimental results we also like to point out that in the bentonite red dots and kaolinite bentonite mixture yellow dots samples normalized floc numbers increase after reaching the maximum flocculation lowest normalized floc number at 5 6 min the increase is most evident for kaolinite bentonite mixture and consequently the flocs reach an equilibrium stage much later at about 30 min we believe that this interesting feature is due to the break up of part of the larger fragile flocs after reaching the maximum flocculation at the maximum flocculation stage the participation of more cohesive bentonite flocs are likely to connect those smaller but denser kaolinite flocs to form large aggregate structures however these large aggregates are fragile and can be further broken into smaller flocs in high turbulence this complex interaction in mixed kaolinite bentonite sediment can also be seen in the settling column data to be discussed later 3 results 3 1 floc structures we examine floc structures using high resolution microscope images samples from each case presented in table 1 were collected after the flocculation process reached equilibrium fig 4a1 shows a representative microscope image of pure kaolinite clay flocs 500 mg l 1 s01 in table 1 with the addition of 1 g texas crude oil s02 in table 1 the oil droplets are observed to be attached or embraced within the kaolinite clay structures such as fig 4a2 4 the attachment is limited to the surface of oil droplets while the droplets structure remains intact the oil kaolinite aggregates observed here are consistent with the droplet oma type reported in the previous studies stoffyn egli and lee 2002 khelifa et al 2002 in which oil droplets are coated by sediment aggregates through surface attachment the quantity of mineral attached to a droplet is highly variable the oma obtained from the bentonite clay run s03 in table 1 are shown in fig 4b1 the bentonite flocs are generally larger than kaolinite flocs and their size can be up to 100 200 μm in width and several hundred microns in length these features are distinct from the pure kaolinite run s01 shown in fig 4a1 as demonstrated in section 2 2 3 or fig 3 pure bentonite clay particles are much cohesive and attachable than kaolinite particles more importantly the more cohesive characteristic of bentonite floc leads to an entirely re shaped oil mineral structure see fig 4b2 s04 in table 1 compared with oil kaolinite flocs the sphere shaped oil droplets disappeared the oil bentonite flocs show much larger size of oil soaked mineral having a flake shaped aggregates up to hundreds of microns in size see fig 4b2 4 compared with the previous studies stoffyn egli and lee 2002 khelifa et al 2002 zhao et al 2016 the dominant oil bentonite aggregates observed here belong to a dense type of oil aggregate called flake solid oma flake aggregates have the appearance of membrane structures which can attain hundreds of microns in length their microstructure is highly organized as dendritic or feather like experimental results suggest that high shear strength i e extended or faster agitation tends to break or crumple flake aggregates the crumpled flakes fig 4b2 4 may be distinguished from mineral embraced droplet oma fig 4a2 4 by their folds or preferential orientation of the minerals after mixing equal amount of kaolinite and bentonite clay for case s05 the mixture flocs contain both kaolinite floc and bentonite floc structures see fig 4c1 and importantly although the general size of the mixed flocs fig 4c1 are smaller than pure bentonite case fig 4b1 the bentonite floc structure appears to be dominant in the mixture mineral sample with the addition of oil in the mixture sample s06 large flake shaped oma can be observed in fig 4c2 4 which has similar floc size with those in the oil bentonite case s04 see fig 4b2 4 however both droplet omas and flake omas can be observed in fig 4c3 4 because kaolinite clay has much lower cohesion than bentonite the resulting oma structures are also distinctly different which is expected to lead to different settling velocities in the next sections we will investigate different mineral flocs and omas settling velocities and discuss their relationship to floc structures 3 2 floc physical properties the previous section provided insights into the floc structures for different types of omas by microscopy images this section is devoted to more quantitative study of floc physical properties particularly their settling velocities the scatterplots in figs 5a 6a and 7 a illustrate individual spherical equivalent dry mass weighted floc sizes x axis plotted against their corresponding settling velocities y axis of each sample see table 1 collected and analyzed by labsfloc 2 camera system the scatterplots allow subsequent statistical analysis for floc properties using 12 different size classes size band definition is shown in the bottom of figs 5 7 the physical properties shown are the counted floc numbers of each size band figs 5c 6c and 7c and the averaged settling velocity figs 5d 6d and 7d floc density figs 5e 6e and 7e and fractal dimension figs 5f 6f and 7f for each size band 3 3 kaolinite and oil kaolinite flocs the scatterplot presented in fig 5a indicates that the kaolinite clay flocs s01 cover a size range from 20 to 400 μm while their settling velocities vary from 0 04 to 10 mm s 1 although with some notable scatters the floc settling velocities are more or less proportional to floc sizes adding oil into kaolinite mineral s02 shows negligible change in the floc size range see fig 5b however when floc size is greater than about 80 μm the peak settling velocities about 4 mm s 1 show almost no change with respect to floc size also there exist some low density flocs in the rather large size range of 200 400 μm with settling velocities ranging from 0 2 0 6 mm s 1 around the red constant density line of 16 kg m 3 in fig 5b this is due to the large oil kaolinite flocs having much lower density than those of pure kaolinite flocs a more quantitative understanding on these interesting features can be obtained by examining the statistics of 12 size bands the number of kaolinite flocs increases dramatically from size band sb 1 20 40 μm to sb 3 80 120 μm and then drops quickly from sb 3 to sb 8 320 400 μm fig 5c blue bands since the labsfloc 2 analysis can reliably resolve particles size down to 20 μm it is reminded that some very small flocs are not captured in the results shown here adding oil to kaolinite significantly increases floc number for small size flocs 20 80 μm at sb 1 and sb 2 while floc numbers at larger size class are generally lower than or similar to those of pure kaolinite flocs fig 5c orange bars the settling velocities of kaolinite samples s01 and s02 in table 1 averaged for each size class are shown in fig 5d pure mineral flocs s01 show a rapid increase of settling velocities with respect to the increase of floc sizes for the entire size class spectrum sb 1 to sb 8 on the contrary oil kaolinite flocs show milder increase of settling velocity with respect to floc size from sb 1 to sb 6 until a completely different trend is observed for larger size class sb 6 to sb 8 where the settling velocity decreases as the floc size increases it is evident that adding oil to kaolinite decreases settling velocity particularly for larger floc size classes by nearly factor 3 in the sb 6 and nearly a factor 7 in the sb 8 considerable reduction of settling velocity at sb 6 to sb 8 is clearly associated with the significant decrease of floc effective density due to the addition of oil to kaolinite at this size range see fig 5e adding oil reduces floc effective density in all floc size bands but the reduction is much more pronounced at large size class in sb 2 and sb 3 effective density decreases by approximate 1 3 to 1 4 by adding oil while settling velocity also decreases accordingly in sb 4 to sb 8 the effective density decreased by half or much more especially in the larger size bands and their settling velocity shows a remarkable reduction since averaged droplet size is about 57 μm see fig 2b oil participation is more likely to occur in larger size bands overall the results presented here is consistent with the presence of oil as droplets see fig 4a2 a4 having lower density than saltwater or mineral the fractal dimension for kaolinite flocs or kaolinite oil flocs is in the range of 2 4 2 6 except for a small number of large flocs in sb 7 8 62 and 52 in s01 and s02 respectively mostly in sb 7 in general adding oil slightly reduces fractal dimension to 2 4 a notable exception is that when oil is added to kaolinite we observed the largest single floc in sb 8 which show a much lower fractal dimension of 2 05 due to containing several low density oil droplets in the large structure 3 3 1 bentonite and oil bentonite flocs in the pure bentonite sample s03 fig 6a we observe about 30 very large size flocs up to 400 700 μm that do not exist in the pure kaolinite sample s01 the resulting settling velocity range is also wider 0 01 20 mm s 1 than that in kaolinite samples a more careful examination further suggests that many large size flocs in sb 9 sb 12 in fig 6c in pure bentonite sample s03 are of very low density within 50 kg m 3 and their settling velocities are limited to range of 1 5 mm s 1 despite very large floc size adding oil further produced a very large floc of 800 μm fig 6b the upper limit of settling velocity reached to about 10 mm s 1 which is about a factor 2 larger than that of oil kaolinite floc see fig 5b comparing to kaolinite samples s01 and s02 the most notable difference is that the floc numbers for bentonite samples are significantly lower larger floc sizes and lower floc number in bentonite samples are consistent with the high flocculation rate high stickiness of bentonite discussed in section 2 2 3 when oil is added to bentonite s04 see fig 6d we observe a monotonic increase of settling velocities with the floc size except at the largest size class sb 12 but it only consists of one floc this trend is different from the oil kaolinite sample s02 fig 5d moreover when oil is added to bentonite we observe a more rapid increase of settling velocity when floc size increases from sb 9 to sb 12 comparing to the pure bentonite condition we obtain an increase of settling velocity by more than a fact of 2 in sb 11 while recall that for kaolinite samples adding oil to kaolinite s02 significantly reduces the floc settling velocity these observations are supported by the floc effective density data from fig 6e we can see that adding oil to bentonite clay generally increases floc effective density with the most significant increases occur at sb 1 and sb 9 to sb 12 contrast with fig 5e adding oil reduces floc effective density in all size bands in kaolinite samples this suggests that oil interact differently with kaolinite and bentonite samples and it is consistent with their distinct droplet oma and flake oma structures presented in fig 4 in the bentonite case s04 the oil droplets no longer exists and become absorbed into mineral flocs it is likely that at such micro scale oil changes the adhesion characteristic and make the small flocs more compact dense with lower porosity the fractal dimension for bentonite floc or bentonite oil flocs are in the range of 2 2 2 4 which is slightly lower than those of kaolinite samples however adding oil to bentonite generally increases fractal dimension with the largest increase occurs at sb 1 with a fractal dimension near 2 5 it is interesting to the point out that a notable fractal dimension changes after adding oil is in larger size class floc of sb 8 320 400 μm for kaolinite sample and in the smallest size class of sb 1 20 40 μm for bentonite sample this drastic difference is again consistent with different oma structure of kaolinite and bentonite clay 3 3 2 mixed kaolinite bentonite and oil kaolinite bentonite flocs the settling velocity for mixed kaolinite bentonite flocs s05 peaks at about 10 mm s 1 for floc size greater than about 100 μm fig 7a when oil is further added to the mixed kaolinite bentonite sample fig 7b we observe even higher floc settling velocities exceeding 10 mm s 1 generally both kaolinite bentonite minerals flocs and oil kaolinite bentonite flocs show increasing settling velocity with the increasing floc sizes fig 7d except at the largest size class in other words by adding oil to equally mixed kaolinite and bentonite mixture the overall settling velocity trend is similar to that of pure bentonite fig 6d this observation can be further confirmed by examining floc effective density shown in fig 7e similar to adding oil to pure bentonite see fig 6e adding oil to kaolinite bentonite mixture generally increase floc effective density and hence the settling velocity also increases in most size bands there are also some minor but unique differences in the pure kaolinite bentonite sample a large number of small sized flocs 80 μm in sb 1 and sb 2 are observed which are lacking in pure kaolinite fig 5a or pure bentonite fig 6a samples this feature can be due to complex interaction of kaolinte and bentonite clays having very different stickiness firstly the presence of kaolinite particles decrease the stickiness of the mixed floc comparing to pure bentonite condition which leads to more small flocs comparing to pure bentonite condition moreover it is likely that the more porous bentonite flocs when flocculate with kaolinite flocs make the whole mixed flocs more fragile and with the high turbulence level provided part of the mixture flocs tends to break up into smaller flocs even smaller than those in pure bentonite or kaolinite cases finally there exist some very small flocs with diameter smaller than 20 μ m that cannot be resolved by labsfloc 2 system in the kaolinite cases see those very small particles resolved by microscope images in fig 4a1 a2 when more cohesive bentonite particles are added and then bonded with kaolinite particles these very small flocs may become larger and resolvable by labsfloc 2 system since these complex processes may require longer interaction time the feature is consistent with the temporal evolution of normalized floc number shown in fig 3 that after the kaolinte bentonite mixture sample reaches maximum flocculation lowest normalized floc number at about 5 min normalized floc number starts to increase and approaches the final equilibrium at about 30 min comparing to bentonite cases we also observe much less number of flocs in large size bands sb 9 to sb 12 in kaolinite bentonite mixture cases and this is clearly due to the presence of less cohesive kaolinite consequently adding oil to kaolinite bentonite mixture also does not increase the cohesion as much when comparing to adding oil to pure bentonite overall oil can be considered to preferably interacting with bentonite and the presence of kaolinite is of secondary effect to reduce cohesion for kaolinite bentonite mixture the fractal dimension of small sized flocs can be up to 2 8 while the large flocs are of lower value around 2 4 to 2 6 the range of fractal dimension is larger than pure bentonite s03 and it is similar to pure kaolinite s01 except for the smallest size class sb 1 by adding oil flocs fractal dimension in larger size class sb 6 to sb 9 increases and those in small size class sb 1 to sb 5 show negligible change 3 4 microflocs and macroflocs in the cohesive sediment literature two distinguished floc components microflocs and macroflocs have been utilized to effectively reduce key information provided by the floc spectra manning et al 2010 manning and dyer 2007 manning and schoellhamer 2013 a floc diameter of 160 μ m has been often used to distinguish between microflocs and macroflocs groups manning and dyer 2002 manning 2004 manning et al 2010 and it is also adopted in this study in order to obtain more general understanding on the floc physical properties a summary of mean floc properties for the entire floc population and sub population categorized into microflocs and macroflocs for all cases are presented in table 2 similar to the previous sections the physical floc properties presented are floc number n mean floc diameter d mean effective density ρ e mean settling velocity w s and mean fractal dimensions f n a comparison between kaolinite s01 and bentonite flocs s03 show that the kaolinite flocs in total have around 35 higher floc number n 2631 versus 1705 and 35 smaller floc diameter d 120 versus 185 μm see table 2 the larger n in kaolinite is only due to microflocs and in terms of macrofloc number kaolinite has only half of that of bentonite the mean effective density ρ e for the entire floc population of kaolinite floc is about 2 5 times larger than that of bentonite floc however this is particularly due to the bentonite macroflocs having significantly low ρ e only 87 kg m 3 our data indicating flocculation in saline water depends on mineral type particularly for the enhancement of flocculation due to bentonite is consistent with several earlier studies khelifa et al 2005b zhang et al 2019 our study further indicates that despite smaller d of kaolinite flocs their significantly larger ρ e results in approximately 20 larger w s than that of bentonite flocs finally f n of kaolinite flocs is about 2 54 which is higher than that of bentonite flocs of around 2 3 the differences of kaolinite and bentonite flocs revealed here can be directly attributed to the almost factor 5 higher flocculation rate r f of bentonite than kaolinite in 35 ppt saline water presented in fig 3 by adding oil to the kaolinite sample s02 in table 1 oil kaolinite floc number n for the entire population is increased by around 18 while the corresponding d decreases by around 18 however instead of obtaining a slight increase of ρ e commonly expected for decreased cohesion the ρ e for the entire population also decreases by 20 as a result of both reduced d and ρ e we obtain a significant reduction of w s by 50 decreases from 2 41 mm s 1 to 1 21 mm s 1 see table 2 furthermore we observe different response of microfloc and macrofloc fractions due to the addition of oil to kaolinite in the saline water the microfloc population shows a 27 increase in n and 15 reduction of d while the macrofloc population show 20 reduced in n and very slight 2 5 increase or nearly unchanged d this indicates a minor shift to microfloc population and reduction of cohesion due to the addition of oil the common trend for both microfloc and macrofloc is their reduction of ρ e the microflocs show slight 20 decrease of ρ e while the macroflocs show nearly a factor 2 decrease of ρ e as a result the microfloc and macrofloc w s are decreased by 43 and 51 respectively overall the participation of lower density oil droplets reduces the oma density consistent with the droplet oma structure presented in fig 4 due to low stickiness of kaolinite mineral the direct interaction between oil and kaolinite is limited to a slight reduction of stickiness and increase of microfloc number these microflocs tend to attach with the oil droplets around the surface forming droplet omas with much lower density and settling velocity than the pure kaolinite mineral flocs in terms of the entire floc population adding oil to bentonite clay s04 causes minor change in n d and ρ e however more significant effect due to oil participation can be identified via a shift between microfloc and macrofloc populations we obtain 11 decrease of microfloc ρ e while the macrofloc ρ e is increased more significantly by 20 due to the participation of oil as a result microfloc w s is nearly unchanged while the macrofloc w s is increased by 29 since the total flocs are dominated by macroflocs in the bentonite cases the w s for the entire population is increased by 25 when adding oil in the mixed kaolinite bentonite sample s05 the microfloc d is 15 smaller than that of kaolinite s01 and yet in terms of the macrofloc d mixed sample is 13 larger in fact the macrofloc d for mixed kaolinite bentonite sample is nearly comparable only 5 smaller to that of pure bentonite s03 although the w s of mixed kaolinite bentonite sample for the whole floc population 1 97 mm s 1 appears to be similar to that of pure bentonite sample 2 0 mm s 1 the mixed sample reaches the similar w s due to having the largest ρ e 410 kg m 3 and the smallest d 104 μm comparing to pure kaolinite s01 and pure bentonite s03 samples looking more into the difference we can see that macrofloc d and ρ e of kaolinite bentonite mixture is about 13 larger and 12 smaller than those of pure kaolinite sample respectively which suggests a slight increase of cohesion in kaolinite bentonite flocs due to the presence of bentonite on the contrary in the microfloc population kaolinite bentonite sample show the smallest and the densest flocs which is similar to the microfloc of pure kaolinite sample but distinctly different from those of pure bentonite sample the mixed kaolinite bentonite sample possesses a dual feature namely the kaolinite like features are observed in microflocs and bentonite characteristics are more pronounced in macroflocs by adding oil into mixed kaolinite bentonite clay s06 w s for the entire population increases almost 70 however this increase cannot be explained simply by changes in d and ρ e looking into microfloc and macrofloc population adding oil decreases microfloc n by 18 increases microfloc d by 14 and reduces ρ e by only 3 this slight increase of cohesion cause a 53 increase of microfloc settling velocity oil participation also cause a similar 56 increase in macrofloc settling velocity which is caused by a significant 45 increase in ρ e with negligible decrease of d as a result w s increases by almost 70 due to increase of microfloc d as well as more dramatic increase of ρ e in macroflocs with the exception of kaolinite floc and predominant droplet omas generally it is not straightforward to understand the effect of oil on modifying the mineral floc settling velocity without looking into the behavior of floc size classes here we demonstrate that a minimum size class differentiation of microfloc and macrofloc appears to be useful 4 discussion the results presented in this study indicate the key differences of floccualtion characteristics between kaolinite and bentonite omas which in respond to their unique oma structures that are further controlled by mineral stickiness kaolinite particles tend to show lower stickiness and the resulting oil kaolinite aggregates can be categorized as droplet omas this process is also known as the pickering emulsions chevalier and bolzinger 2013 see also fig 4a2 the kaolinite particles flocs act as a web structures surrounding the oil droplet preventing its attachment to other oil droplets or further re bonding to oil slicks previous studies e g zhao et al 2017 have found that equilibrium omas are very stable structure and hardly break kaolinite omas observed here also consist of more complex multiple mineral flocs in this case kaolinite mineral particles form a much larger structure than individual oil droplet which is attached or embraced within the larger kaolinite flocs fig 4a2 4 because oil droplets structure remains intact the oil kaolinite omas show significantly lower effective density and settling velocity than the pure kaolinite flocs this finding is consistent with khelifa et al 2008 using natural cohesive sediments and suggested that omas effective density are 2 3 times lower than pure sediment flocs on the other hand bentonite particles are of very high stickiness and are observed to form large fluffy low density and high porosity and complex aggregate structure the large bentonite aggregates tend to re shape and absorb or be absorbed by the oil droplets and form denser oil bentonite aggregates fig 4b2 4 in this case because the oil droplets no longer exists by themselves and the oil is mainly absorbed at micro scale level onto the mineral structure the bentonite particles can actually become more compact than its pure mineral floc structure high porosity and the resulting omas are dominated by denser and larger macroflocs the overall settling velocities of oil bentonite omas are also slightly larger than the pure bentonite flocs previous experimental work also indicates that omas formed using natural sediment can be as large as 900 μm o laughlin et al 2017 and their settling velocity can be variable depending on the amount of oil trapped in aggregates sun et al 2010 by adding oil to kaolinite bentonite mixture oil interacts more actively with bentonite in macroflocs to increase the floc effective density and hence settling velocity however oil appears to also increase the size of microflocs due to slightly increased cohesion this study confirms that the stickiness cohesion can be one of the key factors in the formation of omas since chemical dispersant may also affect stickiness during oil sediment flocculation khelifa et al 2008 the significance of stickiness needs to be investigated more extensively the present study apply a rather high turbulence level to generate omas with the measured turbulent dissipation rate of ε 0 02 m2 s 3 the estimated kolmogorov length scale η ν 3 ε 1 4 is about 85 μm which is either slightly smaller for kaolinte or kaolinite bentonite cases or about a factor 2 smaller for bentonite cases than the measured mean floc size a similar finding that measured oma size is about a factor 2 or more larger than the estimated kolmogorov length scale has been reported by sun et al 2010 2013 for even higher turbulence level than the present study more extensive investigation on how intense turbulence can limit oma size can be very useful especially for modeling purposes 5 conclusions the labsfloc 2 system and digital microscopy are utilized to study settling velocities of omas and their corresponding floc structures consistent with previous studies droplet omas and flake solid omas have been observed however we further show that these different omas are formed primarily due to the stickiness level of mineral clay and they also lead to different settling velocities for low stickiness kaolinite clay oil participation generates droplet omas and the resulting settling velocity is about a factor 2 smaller than the pure kaolinte flocs on the other hand for high stickiness bentonite clay oil participation produces flack solid omas and the corresponding settling velocity is slightly larger about 25 than the pure bentonite flocs for the mixed kaolinite bentonite omas the resulting settling velocity is about 70 larger than the pure kaolinite bentonite flocs while it is clear that the more dominant effect is due to oil interacting with more cohesive bentonite the presence of kaolinite appears to also help increasing the settling velocity by forming denser kaolinite bentonite microflocs since the bentonite clay is one of the most common mineral particles in natural environments its role in absorbing oil forming omas and influencing the fate of oil need to be incorporated in future modeling efforts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

18111,nitrous oxide is a powerful greenhouse gas and its emissions from single reservoirs have been extensively studied however it still remains unclear about nitrous oxide emission patterns in cascade reservoirs in this study nitrous oxide emissions from cascade hydropower reservoirs were investigated using the thin boundary layer model in the heavily dammed upper mekong river meanwhile sediment denitrification for nitrous oxide production was analysed using the stable isotope method and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method our results demonstrated that nitrous oxide emissions 0 47 1 08 μg m 2h 1 in the upper mekong river were much lower than the global mean level 19 60 μg m 2h 1 but were increased by dam constructions nitrous oxide emissions exhibited an increase trend along the flow direction in the cascade reservoirs sediment accumulation by dams supplied sufficient nitrogen substrates and organic carbon creating hotspots of denitrification at the transition zone in reservoirs as the elevation decreased the increase in temperature enhanced microbial denitrification at the active zone and thereby increased nitrous oxide production with the prolonged residence time this study advanced our knowledge on nitrous oxide emissions from cascade hydropower systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrous oxide mekong river cascade reservoirs denitrification elevation 1 introduction nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential nearly 300 times that of carbon dioxide greatly contributing to stratospheric ozone destruction and global warming effects solomon 2007 current concentration of atmospheric nitrous oxide reaches 324 2 ppb which is approximately 20 higher than the pre industrial level allen et al 2014 rivers are considered as important sources of nitrous oxide and have received considerable attention beaulieu et al 2011 laverman et al 2010 yu et al 2013 it was estimated that more than 0 68 tg yr 1 of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs can be converted to nitrous oxide through denitrification in global river networks equivalent to 10 of the global anthropogenic nitrous oxide emission rate beaulieu et al 2011 a projected doubling of nitrate concentration by 2050 would cause riverine nitrous oxide emissions to further increase by about 40 turner et al 2016 river hydrology often affects environmental factors water temperature dissolved oxygen nutrient supply and hydraulic residence time exerting a strong influence on denitrification and thereby nitrous oxide emissions yu et al 2013 quick et al 2016 quick et al 2016 conducted column and large scale flume experiments and established a predictive link between stream geomorphology hydrodynamics and nitrous oxide emissions hence the variation of river hydrology may alter nitrous oxide emissions from rivers in the past decades many rivers worldwide have been intensively dammed for a variety of purposes including hydropower production flood management water supply and navigation moran et al 2018 over 70 000 large dams have been built and more dams are under construction planned or proposed maavara et al 2015 many of these dams are built in a cascade configuration especially in large rivers grumbine and xu 2011 hydropower generated by these dams has been considered to be green energy however there has been an ongoing scientific debate over the role of hydropower in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere there is a prevailing viewpoint that greenhouse gas emissions tarnish the green credentials of hydropower giles 2006 hu and cheng 2013 urged to assess greenhouse gas budgets of hydropower reservoirs in china after dam constructions rivers are converted into lentic reservoirs greatly modifying the fluvial regime by decreasing flow velocity increasing hydraulic residence time and trapping sediments together with nitrogen maeck et al 2013 this potentially alters nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and thereby nitrous oxide emissions along the river continuum nitrous oxide emissions in dammed rivers have been extensively studied but they mainly focused on single reservoirs beaulieu et al 2014 musenze et al 2014a zhu et al 2013 guérin et al 2008 for example beaulieu et al 2014 studied nitrous oxide emissions in a temperate reservoir and found that denitrification in the hypolimnion functioned as a small nitrous oxide sink during the stratified period while the reservoir was a nitrous oxide source on an annual time scale musenze et al 2014a demonstrated that there was a switch from weak nitrous oxide sinks in spring to strong sources for the rest of the year in three subtropical freshwater reservoirs in australia nitrous oxide emissions from cascade reservoirs are being received concerns liang et al 2019 however the spatial patterns of nitrous oxide emissions in cascade reservoirs and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear as flow velocity decreases after dam constructions suspended particles settle down and potentially supply nitrogen substrates and carbon sources for nitrous oxide production meanwhile nitrous oxide production is mainly mediated by microbes in aquatic systems kuypers et al 2018 as the river system moves downstream water temperature increases following the elevation decrease which potentially enhance microbial nitrous oxide production hence we hypothesized that nitrous oxide emissions exhibited an increase trend along the flow direction in cascade hydropower reservoirs to test this hypothesis we investigated nitrous oxide emissions from cascade hydropower reservoirs the objectives were to 1 identify nitrous oxide emission patterns in cascade hydropower reservoirs 2 reveal the main drivers for the nitrous oxide emission patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the upper mekong river which has been heavily dammed for hydropower production the mekong river one of the largest rivers in the world originates from the tibetan plateau and discharges into south china sea it has a length of 4909 km a watershed area of 760 000 km2 and a mean annual discharge of 457 km3 at a rate of 14 500 m3 s 1 shi et al 2017 in the upper mekong basin there is a small catchment with little disturbances from tributaries and human activities as of 2016 six dams had been built for hydropower production on the mainstream of the upper mekong river fig 1 these dams are gongguoqiao ggq xiaowan xw manwan mw dachaoshan dcs nuozhadu nzd and jinghong jh the locations of these dams are shown in fig 1 and the main features of these cascade reservoirs are presented in table 1 meanwhile there is an unregulated river as the control nujiang river which flows in parallel to the upper mekong river in the same region the unique study site will be beneficial to studying nitrous oxide emission patterns in cascade hydropower reservoirs fig 1 2 2 sample collection and analysis two field surveys were conducted in september 2016

fig 1 sampling in each reservoir was mainly carried out in the lacustrine zone meanwhile nitrous oxide emissions from the nujiang river n1 n9 sites in fig 1 were investigated for comparison with the upper mekong river according to the results of the 2016 survey field survey in the single reservoir was conducted in jh reservoir in 2017 samples were collected at 8 sites from the riverine zone at the tail of jh reservoir to the lacustrine zone at the front of the dam and the distance between sampling sites was about 8 km at each site sediment samples were collected randomly in triplicate using an ekman grab sampler and homogenized completely then half of each homogenized sediment sample was kept frozen in the dark for the analyses of total nitrogen organic carbon grain size and microbial abundance and the other half was treated immediately to measure denitrification potentials in the laboratory part of each sample was taken randomly for analyses in triplicate sediment total nitrogen

malvern co untied kingdom 2 3 sediment denitrification rate measurements nitrous oxide is a byproduct of nitrification and denitrification kuypers et al 2018 nitrification is likely slow relative to denitrification in the upper mekong river fig s1 hence we analysed denitrification process here to clarify nitrous emission patterns in cascade reservoirs sediment denitrification potentials were measured using the 15n tracer method with membrane inlet mass spectrometer zhang et al 2012 an et al 2001 fresh sediment samples were mixed and homogenized with field water at a ratio of 1 5 and then bubbled with pure helium for 20 min the mixtures were filled into 12 ml exetainer vials 839 w labco uk without bubbles which was then immediately sealed with butylrubber septa and screw caps tightly

sediment grain size d 50 showed a gradual decrease trend in the jh reservoir sediment total nitrogen and organic carbon increased from 0 10 to 1 80 mg g 1 at the tail of the reservoir to the maximum of 1 57 and 18 0 mg g 1 and finally decreased to 1 22 and 5 76 mg g 1 at the front of the dam respectively fig 2c sediment grain size gradually decreased from 12 6 μm at the tail of the reservoir to 6 8 μm at the front of the dam fig 2d 3 2 nitrous oxide fluxes at air water interfaces compared with the upstream channel nitrous oxide emissions from downstream cascade reservoirs were enhanced and showed a gradual increase along the flow direction nitrous oxide fluxes gradually increased from 0 47 μg m 2h 1 in the upstream channel to 1 08 μg m 2h 1 in the jh reservoir fig 3 a in contrast nitrous oxide emissions showed no significant differences between sites on the nujiang river p 0 05 which were 0 72 1 02 μg m 2h 1 fig 3b inside the reservoir nitrous oxide emissions at the tail of the reservoir were less than the downstream area where there were no significant differences between sites p 0 05 in the jh reservoir nitrous oxide fluxes were 0 59 0 80 μg m 2h 1 at the tail of the reservoir and they increased to 1 00 1 05 μg m 2h 1 at the downstream area fig 3c 3 3 sediment denitrification potentials denitrification potential in sediments was low at 0 38 μg kg 1h 1 in the upstream channel and exhibited a general increase trend in the downstream reservoirs along the flow direction reaching 15 80 μg kg 1h 1 in the jh reservoir fig 4 a inside the reservoir there was a peak of sediment denitrification potential at the transition zone in the jh reservoir the denitrification potential increased from 2 15 μg kg 1h 1 at the tail to the maximum of 21 59 μg kg 1h 1 at the transition zone and finally decreased to 6 92 μg kg 1h 1 at the front of the dam fig 4b 3 4 denitrifier abundance sediment denitrifiers were distributed non uniformly along the upper mekong river which were abundant in the downstream cascade reservoirs but scarce in the upstream channel the denitrifier reached 0 18 106 0 74 106 gene copies per gram of sediment in the downstream reservoirs but only 0 01 106 gene copies per gram of sediment were detected in the upstream channel fig 5 a inside the reservoir the distribution of sediment denitrifiers exhibited a similar pattern to dentrification potentials figs 5b and 4b in the jh reservoir the denitrifier abundance increased from 0 80 106 gene copies per gram of sediment at the tail of the reservoir to the maximum of 1 10 106 at the transition zone and then decreased to 0 69 106 gene copies per gram of sediment at the front of the dam fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological alteration and nutrient accumulation by dams rivers continuously transport terrestrial substances to oceans which is essential to driving biogeochemical processes in river coastal systems beaulieu et al 2014 borges et al 2018 dams convert rivers into lentic reservoirs with subsequent decrease in flow velocity increase in hydraulic residence time and suspended particle settlement maeck et al 2013 the flux of terrestrial sediment to global coastal ocean was estimated to be reduced by 26 due to dam constructions syvitski et al 2005 particulate organic matters and soluble organic matters absorbed by particles will settle in reservoirs in this study the contents of total nitrogen and organic carbon in the reservoir sediment were higher than the upstream channel fig 2a the upper mekong river has a small rocky catchment fig 1 with limited impacts of tributaries on the mainstream meanwhile the flow was jointly regulated by cascade reservoirs without the occurrences of frequent drawdown events as the flow velocity decreases coarse particles easily settle down while fine particles can travel a long way downstream tang et al 2018 yi et al 2017 leading to a general decrease in grain size along the flow direction in both the inter and inner reservoirs fig 2b and d compared with coarse particles fine particles often have stronger sorption ability because of the larger surface area in a unit mass xia et al 2009 pan et al 2013 manohar et al 2002 as a result the contents of total nitrogen and organic carbon in sediments generally increased from the upstream channel to the downstream reservoirs fig 2a and from the tail of the reservoir to the area adjacent to the front of the dam fig 2c the data deviation at the mw fig 2a was possibly attributed to the disturbances induced by severe sand mining activities in the reservoir fig s2 in the supporting information the decreases of sediment total nitrogen and organic carbon at the front of the dam fig 2c might be caused by the discharge via hydropower stations the residence time of the upper mekong river was estimated to be less than 0 07 years before cascade dam constructions while it was prolonged to 5 72 years after cascade dam constructions table 1 hence dam constructions increased river hydraulic residence time and trapped nitrogen and organic carbon within riverine sediments which potentially alter nitrogen transformations and nitrous oxide emissions in rivers 4 2 regulation of sediment denitrification by cascade dams denitrification is a microbe mediated process which reduces nitrate and ultimately produces nitrogen gas through a series of intermediate gaseous nitrogen oxide products which can leak nitrous oxide beaulieu et al 2011 the majority of denitrifiers are facultative aerobic heterotrophs which need organic carbon to satisfy energy to maintain life gómez alday et al 2014 wang et al 2014 hence the availability of nitrogen substrates and organic carbon often act as two main limiting factors of denitrification in aquatic systems kim et al 2016 zarnetske et al 2011 trauth et al 2018 for example zarnetske et al 2011 demonstrated that the rate of denitrification was more than double that under elevated dissolved organic carbon conditions in riverine riparian zones in unregulated river systems with natural flow regimes rivers mainly act as pipes for nitrogen transport from terrestrial systems to lakes or coastal systems with limited nitrogen transformations because of the short residence time of nitrogen substrates and organic matters as a result weak denitrification fig 4a and poor denitrifiers fig 5a in sediments were detected in the upstream channel prolonged hydraulic residence time associated with dams enhanced the accumulation of total nitrogen and organic carbon within riverine sediments this provided suitable substrates and environmental conditions to enhance denitrification in the sediments the sediment denitrification rate fig 4a and denitrifier abundances fig 5a in cascade reservoirs were relatively higher than the upstream channel this was further supported by the results in the jh reservoir under flow regulations by the dam nitrogen and organic carbon accumulated and created the hotspot of denitrification at the transition zone in the jh reservoir the denitrification potential rate fig 4b and denitrifier abundance fig 5b exhibited similar spatial patterns to the contents of sediment total nitrogen and organic carbon fig 2c from the tail of the reservoir to the front of the dam in addition the availability of oxygen might be another contributor to the spatial heterogeneity of denitrification inside the reservoir as oxygen was consumed with the flow the anoxic oxic transition may occur at the transition zone which is favourable to denitrification this needs further studies in future to analyse oxygen profiles at the sediment water interface by collecting intact sediment cores shang et al 2013 4 3 spatial heterogeneity of nitrous oxide emissions in cascade reservoirs in the dammed upper mekong river the enhanced sediment denitrification could increase nitrous oxide production and emissions we have detected higher fluxes of nitrous oxide from the water to the atmosphere in cascade reservoirs than the upstream river channel fig 3a as the river system moves downstream the increased water temperature fig s3 enhanced microbe mediated denitrification for nitrous oxide production as a result nitrous oxide emissions exhibited a gradual increase trend along the flow direction in the cascade reservoirs fig 3a although there is also a temperature gradient along the natural river continuum without reservoirs suspended particles rarely settle in the running river to supply nitrogen substrates and organic carbon for nitrous oxide production thus we did not detect the increase trend of nitrous oxide emissions along the undammed nujiang river but found no significant differences between sites along the river p 0 05 fig 3b hence we consider it is the general rule for nitrous oxide emissions in cascade reservoirs since sediment retention and temperature gradient are the features of cascade reservoirs which is also supported by nitrous oxide emissions from cascade reservoirs on the mainstream of the wujiang river china liang et al 2019 unlike nitrous oxide the increase trend of methane emissions was not detected according to our previous study in the cascade reservoirs shi et al 2017 it is possibly attributed to the higher sensitivity of denitrifiers to temperature than methanogens this needs further studies in future using other molecular biology techniques such as dna rna based stable isotope probing dumont and murrell 2005 in cascade reservoirs the huge overlying water may also contribute to nitrous oxide emissions from the surface water however we did not observe the correlation between nitrous oxide fluxes with the storage capacity in these cascade reservoirs future studies are needed to quantify the exact contribution of nitrous oxide production in the overlying water to net nitrous oxide fluxes from the reservoir inside the reservoir nitrous oxide emissions increased from the tail of the reservoir and reached the maximum at the hotspot of denitrification at the transition zone but maintained constant in the downstream area where the sediment denitrification decreased fig 3c this is because the released nitrous oxide was homogenized with the flow during the diffusion compared with reservoirs in other river systems 19 60 μg m 2h 1 deemer et al 2016a b the cascade hydropower reservoirs in the upper mekong river emit much less nitrous oxide to the atmosphere 0 47 1 08 μg m 2h 1 different landscapes store different amounts of organic matters in soils and vegetation and the potential for gas production and loss varies from site to site reservoirs that submerge peat lands often emit more greenhouse gases than those built in canyons which have thin soil layers and no peat deposits the upper mekong river has a small rocky catchment with little soil fig 1 the relatively low amounts of submerged organic matters potentially caused the lower nitrous oxide emissions 5 conclusions in this study we investigated nitrous oxide emissions from cascade reservoirs in the upper mekong river which has been heavily dammed for hydropower production the main findings are as follows 1 cascade hydropower dams increased nitrous oxide emissions from rivers 2 nitrous oxide emissions exhibited an increase trend along the flow direction in cascade reservoirs 3 sediment accumulation by dams supplied sufficient nitrogen substrates and organic carbon creating hotspots of denitrification for nitrous oxide production in reservoirs 4 nitrous oxide emissions in the upper

18111,nitrous oxide is a powerful greenhouse gas and its emissions from single reservoirs have been extensively studied however it still remains unclear about nitrous oxide emission patterns in cascade reservoirs in this study nitrous oxide emissions from cascade hydropower reservoirs were investigated using the thin boundary layer model in the heavily dammed upper mekong river meanwhile sediment denitrification for nitrous oxide production was analysed using the stable isotope method and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method our results demonstrated that nitrous oxide emissions 0 47 1 08 μg m 2h 1 in the upper mekong river were much lower than the global mean level 19 60 μg m 2h 1 but were increased by dam constructions nitrous oxide emissions exhibited an increase trend along the flow direction in the cascade reservoirs sediment accumulation by dams supplied sufficient nitrogen substrates and organic carbon creating hotspots of denitrification at the transition zone in reservoirs as the elevation decreased the increase in temperature enhanced microbial denitrification at the active zone and thereby increased nitrous oxide production with the prolonged residence time this study advanced our knowledge on nitrous oxide emissions from cascade hydropower systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrous oxide mekong river cascade reservoirs denitrification elevation 1 introduction nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential nearly 300 times that of carbon dioxide greatly contributing to stratospheric ozone destruction and global warming effects solomon 2007 current concentration of atmospheric nitrous oxide reaches 324 2 ppb which is approximately 20 higher than the pre industrial level allen et al 2014 rivers are considered as important sources of nitrous oxide and have received considerable attention beaulieu et al 2011 laverman et al 2010 yu et al 2013 it was estimated that more than 0 68 tg yr 1 of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs can be converted to nitrous oxide through denitrification in global river networks equivalent to 10 of the global anthropogenic nitrous oxide emission rate beaulieu et al 2011 a projected doubling of nitrate concentration by 2050 would cause riverine nitrous oxide emissions to further increase by about 40 turner et al 2016 river hydrology often affects environmental factors water temperature dissolved oxygen nutrient supply and hydraulic residence time exerting a strong influence on denitrification and thereby nitrous oxide emissions yu et al 2013 quick et al 2016 quick et al 2016 conducted column and large scale flume experiments and established a predictive link between stream geomorphology hydrodynamics and nitrous oxide emissions hence the variation of river hydrology may alter nitrous oxide emissions from rivers in the past decades many rivers worldwide have been intensively dammed for a variety of purposes including hydropower production flood management water supply and navigation moran et al 2018 over 70 000 large dams have been built and more dams are under construction planned or proposed maavara et al 2015 many of these dams are built in a cascade configuration especially in large rivers grumbine and xu 2011 hydropower generated by these dams has been considered to be green energy however there has been an ongoing scientific debate over the role of hydropower in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere there is a prevailing viewpoint that greenhouse gas emissions tarnish the green credentials of hydropower giles 2006 hu and cheng 2013 urged to assess greenhouse gas budgets of hydropower reservoirs in china after dam constructions rivers are converted into lentic reservoirs greatly modifying the fluvial regime by decreasing flow velocity increasing hydraulic residence time and trapping sediments together with nitrogen maeck et al 2013 this potentially alters nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and thereby nitrous oxide emissions along the river continuum nitrous oxide emissions in dammed rivers have been extensively studied but they mainly focused on single reservoirs beaulieu et al 2014 musenze et al 2014a zhu et al 2013 guérin et al 2008 for example beaulieu et al 2014 studied nitrous oxide emissions in a temperate reservoir and found that denitrification in the hypolimnion functioned as a small nitrous oxide sink during the stratified period while the reservoir was a nitrous oxide source on an annual time scale musenze et al 2014a demonstrated that there was a switch from weak nitrous oxide sinks in spring to strong sources for the rest of the year in three subtropical freshwater reservoirs in australia nitrous oxide emissions from cascade reservoirs are being received concerns liang et al 2019 however the spatial patterns of nitrous oxide emissions in cascade reservoirs and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear as flow velocity decreases after dam constructions suspended particles settle down and potentially supply nitrogen substrates and carbon sources for nitrous oxide production meanwhile nitrous oxide production is mainly mediated by microbes in aquatic systems kuypers et al 2018 as the river system moves downstream water temperature increases following the elevation decrease which potentially enhance microbial nitrous oxide production hence we hypothesized that nitrous oxide emissions exhibited an increase trend along the flow direction in cascade hydropower reservoirs to test this hypothesis we investigated nitrous oxide emissions from cascade hydropower reservoirs the objectives were to 1 identify nitrous oxide emission patterns in cascade hydropower reservoirs 2 reveal the main drivers for the nitrous oxide emission patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the upper mekong river which has been heavily dammed for hydropower production the mekong river one of the largest rivers in the world originates from the tibetan plateau and discharges into south china sea it has a length of 4909 km a watershed area of 760 000 km2 and a mean annual discharge of 457 km3 at a rate of 14 500 m3 s 1 shi et al 2017 in the upper mekong basin there is a small catchment with little disturbances from tributaries and human activities as of 2016 six dams had been built for hydropower production on the mainstream of the upper mekong river fig 1 these dams are gongguoqiao ggq xiaowan xw manwan mw dachaoshan dcs nuozhadu nzd and jinghong jh the locations of these dams are shown in fig 1 and the main features of these cascade reservoirs are presented in table 1 meanwhile there is an unregulated river as the control nujiang river which flows in parallel to the upper mekong river in the same region the unique study site will be beneficial to studying nitrous oxide emission patterns in cascade hydropower reservoirs fig 1 2 2 sample collection and analysis two field surveys were conducted in september 2016

fig 1 sampling in each reservoir was mainly carried out in the lacustrine zone meanwhile nitrous oxide emissions from the nujiang river n1 n9 sites in fig 1 were investigated for comparison with the upper mekong river according to the results of the 2016 survey field survey in the single reservoir was conducted in jh reservoir in 2017 samples were collected at 8 sites from the riverine zone at the tail of jh reservoir to the lacustrine zone at the front of the dam and the distance between sampling sites was about 8 km at each site sediment samples were collected randomly in triplicate using an ekman grab sampler and homogenized completely then half of each homogenized sediment sample was kept frozen in the dark for the analyses of total nitrogen organic carbon grain size and microbial abundance and the other half was treated immediately to measure denitrification potentials in the laboratory part of each sample was taken randomly for analyses in triplicate sediment total nitrogen

malvern co untied kingdom 2 3 sediment denitrification rate measurements nitrous oxide is a byproduct of nitrification and denitrification kuypers et al 2018 nitrification is likely slow relative to denitrification in the upper mekong river fig s1 hence we analysed denitrification process here to clarify nitrous emission patterns in cascade reservoirs sediment denitrification potentials were measured using the 15n tracer method with membrane inlet mass spectrometer zhang et al 2012 an et al 2001 fresh sediment samples were mixed and homogenized with field water at a ratio of 1 5 and then

rivers 4 2 regulation of sediment denitrification by cascade dams denitrification is a microbe mediated process which reduces nitrate and ultimately produces nitrogen gas through a series of intermediate gaseous nitrogen oxide products which can leak nitrous oxide beaulieu et al 2011 the majority of denitrifiers are facultative aerobic heterotrophs which need organic carbon to satisfy energy to maintain life gómez alday et al 2014 wang et al 2014 hence the availability of nitrogen substrates and organic carbon often act as two main limiting factors of denitrification in aquatic systems kim et al 2016 zarnetske et al 2011 trauth et al 2018 for example zarnetske et al 2011 demonstrated that the rate of denitrification was more than double that under elevated dissolved organic carbon conditions in riverine riparian zones in unregulated river systems with natural flow regimes rivers mainly act as pipes for nitrogen transport from terrestrial systems to lakes or coastal systems with limited nitrogen transformations because of the short residence time of nitrogen substrates and organic matters as a result weak denitrification fig 4a and poor denitrifiers fig 5a in sediments were detected in the upstream channel prolonged hydraulic residence time associated with dams enhanced the accumulation of total nitrogen and organic carbon within riverine sediments this provided suitable substrates and environmental conditions to enhance denitrification in the sediments the sediment denitrification rate fig 4a and denitrifier abundances fig 5a in cascade reservoirs were relatively higher than the upstream channel this was further supported by the results in the jh reservoir under flow regulations by the dam nitrogen and organic carbon accumulated and created the hotspot of denitrification at the transition zone in the jh reservoir the denitrification potential rate fig 4b and denitrifier abundance fig 5b exhibited similar spatial patterns to the contents of sediment total nitrogen and organic carbon fig 2c from the tail of the reservoir to the front of the dam in addition the availability of oxygen might be another contributor to the spatial heterogeneity of denitrification inside the reservoir as oxygen was consumed with the flow the anoxic oxic transition may occur at the transition zone which is favourable to denitrification this needs further studies in future to analyse oxygen profiles at the sediment water interface by collecting intact sediment cores shang et al 2013 4 3 spatial heterogeneity of nitrous oxide emissions in cascade reservoirs in the dammed upper mekong river the enhanced sediment denitrification could increase nitrous oxide production and emissions we have detected higher fluxes of nitrous oxide from the water to the atmosphere in cascade reservoirs than the upstream river channel fig 3a as the river system moves downstream the increased water temperature fig s3 enhanced microbe mediated denitrification for nitrous oxide production as a result nitrous oxide emissions exhibited a gradual increase trend along the flow direction in the cascade reservoirs fig 3a although there is also a temperature gradient along the natural river continuum without reservoirs suspended particles rarely settle in the running river to supply nitrogen substrates and organic carbon for nitrous oxide production thus we did not detect the increase trend of nitrous oxide emissions along the undammed nujiang river but found no significant differences between sites along the river p 0 05 fig 3b hence we consider it is the general rule for nitrous oxide emissions in cascade reservoirs since sediment retention and temperature gradient are the features of cascade reservoirs which is also supported by nitrous oxide emissions from cascade reservoirs on the mainstream of the wujiang river china liang et al 2019 unlike nitrous oxide the increase trend of methane emissions was not detected according to our previous study in the cascade reservoirs shi et al 2017 it is possibly attributed to the higher sensitivity of denitrifiers to temperature than methanogens this needs further studies in future using other molecular biology techniques such as dna rna based stable isotope probing dumont and murrell 2005 in cascade reservoirs the huge overlying water may also contribute to nitrous oxide emissions from the surface water however we did not observe the correlation between nitrous oxide fluxes with the storage capacity in these cascade reservoirs future studies are needed to quantify the exact contribution of nitrous oxide production in the overlying water to net nitrous oxide fluxes from the reservoir inside the reservoir nitrous oxide emissions increased from the tail of the reservoir and reached the maximum at the hotspot of denitrification at the transition zone but maintained constant in the downstream area where the sediment denitrification decreased fig 3c this is because the released nitrous oxide was homogenized with the flow during the diffusion compared with reservoirs in other river systems 19 60 μg m 2h 1 deemer et al 2016a b the cascade hydropower reservoirs in the upper mekong river emit much less nitrous oxide to the atmosphere 0 47 1 08 μg m 2h 1 different landscapes store different amounts of organic matters in soils and vegetation and the potential for gas production and loss varies from site to site reservoirs that submerge peat lands often emit more greenhouse gases than those built in canyons which have thin soil layers and no peat deposits the upper mekong river has a small rocky catchment with little soil fig 1 the relatively low amounts of submerged organic matters potentially caused the lower nitrous oxide emissions 5 conclusions in this study we investigated nitrous oxide emissions from cascade reservoirs in the upper mekong river which has been heavily dammed for hydropower production the main findings are as follows 1 cascade hydropower dams increased nitrous oxide emissions from rivers 2 nitrous oxide emissions exhibited an increase trend along the flow direction in cascade reservoirs 3 sediment accumulation by dams supplied sufficient nitrogen substrates and organic carbon creating hotspots of denitrification for nitrous oxide production in reservoirs 4 nitrous oxide emissions in the upper mekong river were much lower than other riverine systems due to the small rocky catchment with little soil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18112,we use numerical simulations to study the possible spatiotemporal effects of brine release from five desalination plants located along the israeli mediterranean coastline it is commonly believed that salinity anomalies associated with brine discharge from desalination plants causes effects which are confined to an area of several hundreds of meters from the discharge outfall we show that discharging brine using diffusers produces small but robust salinity anomalies that propagate tens of kilometers as density currents dcs in contrast premixing the brine with power plant cooling water compensates the negative buoyancy and prevents their generation the propagating dcs can impact coastal water dynamics by increasing the velocities and transports in alongshore and downslope directions the spreading and trajectories of the dcs was strongly influenced by seasonal stratification in winter due to a mixed water column the dcs were relatively focused and propagate downslope while in the summer they are confined to a narrow band along the coastline our model results highlight the possibility that brine discharge might have a large scale non negligible effect on shelf circulation than previously considered further studies are needed to assess the environmental dynamical and ecological effects of desalination brine propagation especially in the far field keywords desalination brine density currents diffusers far field shelf circulation 1 introduction a dependable supply of drinking water is becoming a critical issue for modern cities threats emanating from climate change such as hotter conditions combined with longer droughts in some regions trenberth 2011 fauchereau et al 2003 and growing populations are putting pressure on many fresh water supplies consequently these supplies are no longer reliable as is evident from the water crises that have occurred in cape town south africa sao paulo brazil and mexico city welch 2018 more and more countries such as those around the arabian gulf lattemann and höpner 2008 the mediterranean sea lattemann et al 2009 the red sea hoepner and lattemann 2002 the us california cooley and ajami 2014 china zheng et al 2014 and australia giurco et al 2014 are now securing their water supplies through the installation and operation of seawater desalination plants it is estimated that the current production of desalination plants worldwide is 95 million m3 of fresh water per day jones et al 2019 the major by product of desalination is a highly saline brine that is often discharged back to the sea depending on the discharge location discharge method and the ambient oceanographic conditions this may affect the marine environment roberts et al 2010 monitoring programs and field based ecological studies often focus on the near field in the dilution zone directly around the outfalls where the relatively high salinity anomalies are easily detected above the ambient variability these high salinity anomalies have an impact on marine biota including e g planktonic microbial communities drami et al 2011 seagrasses garrote moreno et al 2014 benthic communities del pilar ruso et al 2015 belkin et al 2017 frank et al 2019 amphipods de la ossa carretero et al 2016 and marine invertebrate recruitment clark et al 2018 in order to minimize the ecological effects in the near field desalination plant outfalls have been designed to optimize mixing and dilution of the brine with the ambient waters e g using diffusers pre mixing with nearby power plant cooling water to encourage a rapid reduction of salinity anomalous values in the immediate discharge area bleninger and jirka 2008 therefore plumes that have been detected hundreds of meters from the outfall have a salinity anomaly 0 5 psμ above background levels roberts et al 2010 in the far field environmental field monitoring struggles to detect the brine plume salinity anomalies because they have been diluted to levels that are within the background salinity variability ayala et al 2015 despite the absence of clear measurable high salinity anomalies and the assumed negligible direct ecological effects such salinity anomalies are significant from a dynamical perspective and therefore may still have an impact on the marine environment one way that brine discharged from desalination plants may affect the far field marine environment is through their propagation as density gravity currents hereafter dcs dcs occur naturally due to processes that reduce the buoyancy of surface water such as surface cooling e g biton et al 2008 evaporation e g pattiaratchi et al 2011 ice formation e g ohshima et al 2013 and increased turbidity e g katz et al 2015 which lead to denser near surface waters compared to adjacent deeper waters in the near field the denser waters sink flowing down the slope due to the force of gravity symonds and gardiner garden 1984 killworth 1983 gordan et al 1993 in the far field due to the earth s rotation the dc veers until it flows along the slope in a quasi geostrophic balance price and o neil baringer 1994 emms 1997 while it propagates the high density anomalous signal is diluted and the volume of the plume increases due to the entrainment of the less dense ambient waters e g biton et al 2008 much like naturally occurring dcs that form over many continental shelves ivanov et al 2004 durrieru de madron et al 2005 the brine released from desalination plants is typically denser than the ambient oceanic water due to its higher salinity and therefore sinks along the sea bottom in the down slope direction there are many examples in world oceans where small density salinity anomalies may propagate in the form of dcs to a considerable distance from their origin e g the mediterranean outflow bower et al 2002 the red sea outflow bower et al 2005 and the denmark strait overflow tanhua et al 2005 therefore despite the initial dilution of the brine signal from a desalination plant s outfall the plume may still maintain part of its properties and spread along the shelf as a dc affecting shelf circulation due to continuing hot and arid conditions in israel combined with the consequence of several drought years turco et al 2017 desalination has become a key technology for ensuring a reliable supply of freshwater there are five operational desalination plants along a short stretch of the israeli mediterranean coastline approximately 100 km long which currently discharge approximately 625 million m3 year 1 of desalination brines into the sea nowadays such a high concentration of desalination plants co located on a relatively narrow coastline is not unusual in arid regions and can be found on the red sea coasts of saudi arabia chowdhury and al zahrani 2015 the persian gulf lattemann and höpner 2008 and the canary islands gómez gotor et al 2018 this will probably become more common in other regions globally as well with the development of the desalination industry and the increase in water scarcity and population growth the israeli mediterranean shelf can thus act as a case study to investigate the far field effects on the marine environment of desalination brines discharged from multiple plants here we are using one year of realistic numerical simulations to investigate the far field propagation of the brine effluent discharged from multiple desalination plants along the israeli mediterranean continental shelf as far as we know our study is the first to explore the distribution of brine effluents from multiple desalination plants their possible connectivity and their effect on coastal dynamics we also investigate the sensitivity of the propagation of the brine to the different dilution methods used by the desalination plants existing along the israeli coastline we found that mixing the brine with power plant cooling water with ambient water salinity as is done at the desalination plants located at ashkelon and hadera is more effective at reducing possible far field dynamical effects when compared to the use of diffusers that are used in the ashdod palmachim and soreq desalination plants hereafter aps in particular diluting and warming the brine by premixing it with the power plant cooling water reduced the salinity anomalies and compensated almost completely for the negative buoyancy of the plume causing it to mostly propagate at the surface near the shore conversely when diffusers are used to dilute the brine salinity anomaly rapidly in the near field as in the case of aps the plume still maintains a negative buoyancy and propagates widely along the shelf in the form of dcs we show that the formed dcs increase the transport on the shelf in both the downslope and along slope directions in winter the dcs are relatively focused and propagate to greater distances and depths downslope while during summer they mainly propagate at shallower depths along the shoreline in a quasi geostrophic balanced flow the simulation showed that dcs from aps mix together to spread along the shelf as one intact plume indicating that one cannot consider the impacts of multiple adjacent desalination plants in isolation the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the israeli mediterranean shelf conditions and our methodology the results are presented and discussed in section 3 and we conclude in section 4 2 methods 2 1 background israeli shelf conditions the israeli shoreline runs north to south along the south eastern terminus of the mediterranean sea and is part of the coastal margins of the levantine basin it is fairly straight in the meridional direction from the gaza strip in the south to the lebanese border in the north with the exception of the carmel headland in the northern part of israel leading into haifa bay the continental shelf along the israeli shore is relatively narrow 10 20 km with a steep continental slope starting at around 80 100 m bottom depth fig 1 negligible runoff and rainfall inputs along with a high evaporation rate lead to relatively high salinity values hecht et al 1988 in the summer the water is highly stratified with sea surface temperatures reaching as high as 31 c and salinity values as high as 40 psμ during august during winter the shallow shelf water is well mixed by winter storms and surface cooling with minimal values for salinity of less than 39 psu due to freshening of the shelf water from increased precipitation and runoff contributions ben gai et al 1998 and the intrusion of atlantic modified water into the eastern mediterranean through the surface layer ozer et al 2017 kress et al 2014 the currents on the israeli shelf near the coast flow mainly in the along shelf direction following bathymetric lines with the dominant direction being northward rosentraub and brenner 2007 2 2 model description here we are simulating the propagation of brine effluent discharged from multiple desalination plants located along the israeli mediterranean coastline there are currently five large reverse osmosis desalination plants operating in israel located at ashkelon operating since 2005 palmachim 2007 hadera 2009 soreq 2013 and ashdod 2014 table 1 and fig 1 the plants produce brine as a byproduct with salinities as high as 80 psu approximately double the initial seawater salinities the plant at hadera premixes the desalination brine with cooling water from a nearby power plant releasing the discharges via the same outfalls located at the shore fig 2 d power plant cooling water is also used to dilute the brine at the ashkelon desalination plant however the discharges are not premixed in ashkelon the outfalls for the brine and cooling water are located adjacent to each other with mixing occurring in the near field fig 2a the plants at aps release brine via underwater diffusers located offshore at around the 20 m isobath fig 2b and c altogether the desalination plants discharge approximately 625 million m3 year 1 of brine into the eastern mediterranean sea the detailed characteristics of the brine and the cooling water discharges along the israeli coast that were input into the model simulations can be found in table 1 the physical modelling of the concentrated brines along the israeli coast and their interactions with the marine environment was conducted using the mike3 hd hydrodynamic oceanic circulation model by the danish hydraulic institute dhi dhi software packages have been extensively used around the world resulting in many peer reviewed publications addressing various aspects of physical biogeochemical and operational oceanography problems e g payandeh et al 2015 fourniotis and horsch 2015 mahanty et al 2016 bolaños et al 2014 pastor et al 2018 ranjbar and zaker 2018 the model solves the three dimensional incompressible reynolds average navier stokes equations subject to the boussinesq and hydrostatic pressure assumptions it contains the equations of continuity momentum temperature salinity and density with the closure problem solved using a turbulent closure scheme the main governing equations are provided in the appendix in this study the smagorinsky model was used to get the horizontal eddy viscosity smagorinsky 1963 in combination with a fixed vertical eddy viscosity of 0 001 m2 s 1 a flexible unstructured triangular mesh was used to capture the complex topography of the shoreline and simulate the outfall region at high resolution the model domain covered the entire israeli coast and extended further southward and northward following the coastline to the southern border of the gaza strip and northward to tyre lebanon respectively fig 1 as this study focuses on shelf processes a cut off depth of 300 m is used the mesh size varied from a maximum area of 10 000 m2 within a 1 km radius around the location of each of the outfalls equivalent to a length scale of 100 m to approximately 180 km2 beyond the 80 m isobath along the vertical in the upper 180 m there are 22 sigma layers of varying thickness below 180 m depth there are 3 z layers of 40 m each the initial conditions and the open boundary conditions for salinity and temperature were taken from the aegean levantine eddy resolving model alermo skliris et al 2007 a spin up simulation of 12 days was performed to generate initial conditions for the sea level height and current velocities the model domain has three open boundaries at the north west and south each boundary was forced daily with temperature salinity current velocity profiles and sea level elevation atmospheric forcing conditions are applied at the surface every 3 h including wind stress precipitation and evaporation taken from an eastern mediterranean weather forecasting model skiron kallos et al 1997 the heat exchange components with the atmosphere including the latent heat sensible heat shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes were also taken from skiron and applied every 3 h 2 3 model runs two simulations namely bgrd and desal were conducted using forcing data for the year 2015 bgrd is used to study the coastal circulation under natural conditions with the addition of discharges of the cooling water from power plants along the israeli coast fig 1 while desal is used to investigate the impact of the desalination discharge brine from the five plants along the israeli coast by adding them to the bgrd setup the simulations used initial and boundary conditions as described in section 3 1 the characteristics of the different discharges as accounted explicitly in the simulations can be found in table 1 where the locations of the cooling and desalination seawater intakes and their outfalls can be viewed in figs 1 and 2 both the intakes and outfalls used a volume rate of m3s 1 to withdraw and discharge water into the model in order to track the spreading of the brines passive tracers with initial concentrations of 1 mg l were added to all of the desalination brine discharges in desal the passive tracer can be considered a dye that is added to the brine which enables us to track the spatial propagation of brine plumes from each desalination plant outfall and their trajectories over time as well as investigate the possible interactions between the adjacent brine discharges using passive tracers to track specific parcels of water is a widely used method and is provided as a complementary tool in the dhi hydrodynamical model for that specific purpose a cutoff of 0 0005 mg l for the tracer concentration was selected above this cutoff value the tracer s concentrations showed good correlation with the salinity anomalies with a spatial mean of 0 99 indicating that the tracer is following the brine plume in all simulations the output was captured at 12 h intervals 2 4 model validation the results of the desal simulation were compared to satellite sea surface temperature sst extracted from four horizontal sections along the model domain in addition to comparisons made with temperature salinity and current velocities measured at two long term coastal monitoring stations near ashkelon and hadera locations of the sections and the monitoring stations are indicated in fig 1 in all cases the comparisons with the observations are reasonably good albeit somewhat weaker velocities are found in the ashkelon site when compared to the observations specifically the seasonality and magnitude of the sst and the stratification conditions are well captured by the model when compared to satellite data and temperature data from two coastal ctds respectively the model accounts for the freshening of coastal waters during winter but underestimates the high salinities that are measured during summer more details on the comparisons of the model results with the observations can be found in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion in the near field the maximums of the annual means of the differences between the desal and bgrd runs that are greater than 0 5 psu are confined to approximately 2 km from the outfalls fig 2 this result is in good agreement with numerous field observations made over the years near the outfalls of the desalination plants along the israeli coast that were made within the framework of their compliance monitoring programs pointing to similarly restricted areas around the outfalls that exhibit salinity values higher than background levels einav et al 2002 safrai and zask 2008 drami et al 2011 frank et al 2019 kress et al 2019 however unlike the limited capabilities of field observations the simulations allow us to assess the far field spreading of desalination brines fig 3 thus according to fig 3 relatively low modelled salinity anomalies 0 05 psu that are difficult to observe in the field spread widely over the israeli continental shelf while such low salinity anomalies might not be significant from an ecological point of view they may be important from a dynamical perspective the aerial extents of the modelled desalination brine plumes are somewhat different from one desalination plant to another particularly the brines released from aps spread more widely than the brines released from hadera and ashkelon in addition the brines also differ in their level of propagation in the water column fig 3 these differences can be partially attributed to the intensities of the ambient current and to the vicinity of the outfalls to marine infrastructures e g hadera and ashkelon fig 2a d and as based on our simulation are mainly related to the discharge method i e pre dilution with power plant cooling water hadera released adjacent to power plant cooling water ashkelon or the use of diffusers aps 3 1 discharges through diffusers aps one difficulty in assessing far field spatiotemporal effects of desalination brines is that such low salinity anomalies as stated above can hardly be distinguished from the background salinity variation here using numerical passive tracers we were able to follow the trajectories of desalination brines spreading over the israeli shelf section 3 2 as indicated in fig 3 the brine discharged from the desalination plants in aps which are released by underwater diffusers located within 10 km of each other propagate together indicating a strong connectivity between these plants particularly during summer unlike hadera and ashkelon where brine is mixed with cooling water the brines of aps are negatively buoyant and therefore the maximum modelled salinities occur exclusively in the bottom layer fig 3 figs 4 6 display seasonal summer and winter mean values of the simulated seawater property anomalies along the cross shore sections located 1 km fig 4 and 5 km figs 5 and 6 northward of the soreq desalination plant the dimensions of the propagating brine plumes discharged at aps are well captured by our defined tracer concentration cutoff the high salinity anomalies are generally related to the maximal along slope velocity anomalies fig 4a d suggesting that the brines are driven by the excess of salinity density above the ambient values and therefore propagate in the form of dcs the spatial dimensions of the simulated plume in the far field are somewhat surprising having a lens shape covering most of the 10 km offshore and can be as high as 20 m above the bottom fig 6a middle the along slope velocity anomalies are strongest nearest to the outfalls however they are persistent on the shelf further away figs 4 6 above the plume region and close to the shore there are negative velocity anomalies probably indicating a return flow that is balancing the sinking descending of the propagating plume and its entrainment of the ambient water e g fig 4d from the calculated along slope and downslope depth integrated volume transport calculation figs 7 and 8 and the cross sectional plots figs 4 6 the following general picture of the propagating dcs emerges in the near field the desalination brine descends downslope in approximately the cross shelf direction during the descent of the dcs the high salinity plume increases in volume due to entrainment processes fig 8b while the salinity anomaly and tracer concentration are diluted and decrease in value in the far field the propagation of the brine is strongly affected by the seasonal stratification of the water column during summer the brine descends through a stratified water column and entrains warmer water from shallower areas due to the positive cross shore temperature gradient fig s5 as a result in the far field the brines are characterized by warmer and saltier water propagating at shallower depths further alongshore compared to winter e g fig 4a and b as shown in fig 9 these findings correspond with recent monitoring program data demonstrate a non negligible far field signal of the propagating brine extending as a near bottom saltier and warmer water mass during the spring and summer months at least to several kilometers away from the outfalls of palmachim and sorek kress et al 2019 the temperature anomalies are significant and decrease from 0 6 c 1 km north of the soreq outfall fig 4b to 0 2 c 5 km away fig 6b much of the entrainment occurs in the near field as the plumes descend to the 30 m isobath where the mean depth integrated transport reaches a maximum of 970 m3 s 1 fig 8c from this depth the dense plume veers northward in the along slope direction fig 7b hence the sharp reduction in the downslope flow fig 8c and propagates in a quasi geostrophic equilibrium between buoyancy and the coriolis forces therefore during summer relatively high transport rates in the along slope direction are confined to a narrow strip between the 20 m and 50 m isobaths fig 8c while maximal downslope transport values are restricted to the areas close to the outfalls and are quite negligible elsewhere fig 7a the summer integrated along slope transport fig 8d has two local maxima along the coast due to the enhanced entrainment that occurs near the outfalls first at ashdod and then at palmachim and soreq these are quickly reduced downstream or further northward by losses to descending detachment of water parcels from the main plume attainment of the neutral buoyancy level or whenever the simulated tracer concentration is diluted to below the threshold value because the plumes from the different sources propagate in the far field mainly in the along slope direction and approximately at the same depths there is a relatively strong connectivity between the three outfalls this results in cumulative along slope transports clearly seen in the case of aps fig 8d the modelled plume of aps maintains some of its coherent structure as far as 70 km northward of soreq near hadera fig 6a however at this distance the dynamic effect of the propagating brine is negligible and the salinity anomalies are small overall during summer the propagation of the dcs affects the transport along much of the length of the israeli coast from ashdod to hadera fig 7b and 8b d during summer the maximal velocity anomalies at the plume s core are somewhat greater than 1 5 cm s 1 within the plume area 1 km north of the soreq diffuser fig 4d and decreases to 0 75 cm s 1 5 km north of soreq fig 6d while these anomalies may seem minor they are robust and represent a considerable increase to the background velocities up to 100 more in the 1 km section and 60 more in the 5 km section it is worth mentioning that the background velocities in the shallow shelf areas alternate between the positive and negative in the along slope direction e g fig s4a and therefore the mean velocities are relatively small during the winter the brine plumes preserve some of their signal and propagate as dcs despite the vigorous mechanical mixing caused by winter storms and convective vertical mixing resulting from the net heat loss to the atmosphere there is a negative cross shelf temperature gradient fig s5b and therefore the plume continuously entrains the colder ambient water at shallow depths while the plume core salinity and density anomalies decrease therefore in the far field the plume is characterized by colder and saltier water than the surrounding ambient water fig 4b additionally a quasi geostrophically balanced flow like the one found during summer could not be reached and the plume propagates in both the along slope and downslope directions fig 7 nevertheless despite the entrainment processes the plume descends to greater depths before it reaches its neutral buoyancy level fig 8a c indeed during winter significant transport with a mean of around 900 m3 s 1 can be found down to 80 m and beyond fig 8c additionally unlike summer the transport associated with the propagation of brine is restricted to a narrower coastline stretching from ashdod in the south to approximately 30 km north of soreq fig 7 however within this area the along slope transport is larger fig 8d and spreads over a greater range of depths than during the summer it should be noted that the background along slope velocities are significantly stronger in winter than in summer fig s5d and thus the relative contribution of the desalination brine generated dcs to the along slope velocities is smaller the maximal velocity anomalies within the plume area are approximately 1 cm s 1 1 km north of the soreq diffuser fig 4d and decreases to around 0 7 cm s 1 5 km north of soreq fig 5d which represents an increase to the background velocities of up to 13 and 6 respectively 3 2 mixing the brine with cooling water ashkelon and hadera generally the results of the desal simulation show that mixing the brines of ashkelon and hadera desalination plants with the cooling water from the adjacent power plants proves to be much more effective in reducing the dynamical impacts of the brine discharge than in the cases of aps where underwater diffusers are employed at hadera the simulated brine is premixed with the cooling water that is warmer by 6 c than the ambient coastal water with a ratio of 1 18 during summer the discharged water is positively buoyant fig s6c and therefore the hotter and saltier brine plume propagates northward near the surface and close to the coastline fig s6 the addition of the brine also somewhat compensated for the along slope excess velocities related to the propagation of the cooling water which therefore decreased by approximately 0 5 cm s 1 fig 10 d during the winter the situation is similar but it is less apparent in the density field due to the existing unstable stratification conditions fig s6c nevertheless a core of saltier and warmer water associated with the mixed discharged water which is less dense than the surrounding water is visible nearshore fig s6 in the case of the ashkelon desalination plant unlike hadera the brine is released directly from the shore near the cooling water outfall in the near field up to 1 km from the location of the outfalls a mixed behavior is observed fig 11 and figs s7 s8 part of the brine that mixed efficiently with the cooling water becomes a positively buoyant plume that propagates at the surface and near the shore as in hadera while the rest of the brine that is only partially mixed with the cooling water creates a denser plume that propagates near the bottom in the form of dcs as in the case of aps indeed in the near field the propagations of the two plumes are associated with relatively significant along slope velocity anomalies which increase by 2 cm s 1 in the case of the brine propagating as dcs and decrease by more than 2 cm s 1 in the near surface alongshore current fig 11 d yet both modelled velocity and density anomalies decrease quickly with increasing distance from the outfalls fig 11 and become negligible in the far field figs 5 and 6 in this case the dcs propagating from ashkelon which mix with the cooling water are warmer less dense and reach their neutral buoyancy level at shallower depths than the dcs generated from aps at a distance of 1 km northward from the ashkelon desalination plant outfall the mean dc plume is warmer by 1 c during summer fig s7b and by 0 5 c during winter fig 11b as such despite their higher salinities the brine reaches its neutral buoyancy level at 10 m and 20 m bottom depth during summer and winter respectively fig 11 and fig s7 at greater depth the temperature and salinity anomalies associated with the brine plume are still apparent fig 11 but their combined effect on the density field is negligible fig 11c further away downstream from the outfall entrainment processes reduce the density anomaly even more until it practically disappears or does not affect the shelf circulation fig 5 overall the use of cooling water to dilute the brine is found to be quite an effective practice in reducing the spatial extent of the brine plume propagation and its impact on shelf circulation compared to the use of underwater diffusers furthermore it seems that pre mixing the brine with the cooling water further reduces the velocities and temperature anomalies of the cooling water plume 3 3 caveats our findings somewhat challenge the previous ecological assessments that showed no detectable ecological impacts in sites several kilometers from the desalination brine outfalls e g einav et al 2002 garrote moreno et al 2014 belkin et al 2017 lykkebo petersen et al 2019 frank et al 2019 given that our findings are mostly based on a modeling study this should be clarified notably the reasonable comparison of our model results with existing continuous measurements along the israeli coast supplementary information near the outfalls e g frank et al 2019 and in the far field e g fig 9 give some confidence that our findings are realistic particularly recent monitoring program data demonstrate a non negligible far field signal of the propagating brine extending as a near bottom saltier and warmer water mass during the spring and summer months at least to several kilometers away from the outfalls of palmachim and sorek kress et al 2019 as was independently predicted by our model fig 9 though this evidence highly supports our model results a clear validation to the simulated propagating desalination brine plumes in the far field is not provided as much as such observational evidence may be desirable and could have solidified our findings tracking the propagating brine in the far field demands a detailed high resolution spatial temporal survey in particular observing the highly seasonal nature of the brine propagation effect is only possible using continuous long term measurements such measurements are highly costly and time consuming and unfortunately are not available for the studied area and to the best of our knowledge at no other sites where desalination brines are discharged around the globe giving a detailed closure 3d view of the oceanic circulation hydrodynamic models are powerful tools to study different dynamical processes including density currents that can fill knowledge gaps in places where measurements hardly exist or very difficult to obtain the presented behavior of propagating density currents relies on solid physical background which is well studied in natural systems section 1 these propagating density currents are normally initiated by naturally occurring density anomalies that are much smaller than those associated with desalination brines in comparison to ambient coastal water section 1 and references therein we express our hope that our interesting results which highlight previously overlooked possible larger scale non negligible effects of the brine discharges from multiple sources on shelf circulation will be followed by observational studies that will confirm or refute our findings and help to further assess the environmental dynamical and ecological effects of desalination brine discharge in the far field 4 conclusions we used a realistic 3d hydrodynamic model of the israeli mediterranean shelf to investigate the propagation of the desalination brine effluents discharged from multiple outfalls located along the israeli mediterranean coastline and their possible impacts on the coastal circulation we show that the discharge method has a large impact on the near and far field behavior of the brine plume mixing the brine with power plant cooling water offsets the negative buoyancy of the brine resulting in an overall positively buoyant plume that has only a minor effect on shelf circulation in contrast the brine discharged from diffusers lead to the development of robust dcs which despite entrainment of surrounding waters still had an impact on shelf circulation far away from their discharge sites the brine plumes released by diffusers propagate in the form of dcs and influence far field circulation by increasing down and along slope volume transport and velocities along large sections of the israeli shelf the spreading of the brines and their relative importance to the shelf dynamics is highly seasonal and is dependent on the stratification conditions that exist on the shelf specifically during winter the brine spreads in both the along slope and downslope directions due to the entrainment in a well mixed water column while under stratified conditions that are prevalent in summer the plume remains at shallower depth and propagates further along the shelf despite the higher transports found in winter its relative contribution to the naturally occurring transports associated with storms and shelf convection processes during this season is small in contrast during the stratified conditions that exist in summer downslope transports rarely occur under natural conditions and therefore the additional transport contribution of the brines is more significant interestingly we also found that the propagation of the brine as dcs in summer causes changes in the near bottom temperature which could have ecological implications such as an increase in sediment oxygen demand of ca 5 per 0 5 c increase in temperature e g thamdrup et al 1998 previous findings indicated that the major threats to the marine environment posed by the desalination industry are associated with the effects of the high salinity levels on the marine biota and associated ecosystems in the vicinity of the brine outfalls or the near field e g einav et al 2002 garrote moreno et al 2014 belkin et al 2017 lykkebo petersen et al 2019 frank et al 2019 some studies have suggested that the impacts of brine discharges on a basin scale are only minor because the oceanographic fluxes from natural processes far exceed the fluxes associated with freshwater extraction by the desalination plants smith et al 2007 roberts 2015 roberts 2015 further suggested that even with future growth in the desalination industry this will not change due to these reasons most research on the impacts of brine discharge on the marine environment focus on the near field where acute exposure to high salinity levels exists additionally environmental regulations normally demand that salinity anomalies associated with the brine discharges be reduced to background levels within a restricted mixing zone in the near field e g safrai and zask 2008 as such a great deal of research has been undertaken to optimize desalination outfall discharge methods e g multiport diffusers and discharge angles to maximize mixing and the rapid dilution of the plume jirka 2008 bashitialshaaer et al 2015 abessi and roberts 2014 2018 based on our simulations the brine discharges from desalination plants with diffusers spread widely along the israeli shelf affecting the shelf circulation such a relatively large scale effect is caused by only minor yet robust salinity anomalies that are considered unimportant from an environmental point of view indeed while these low salinity anomalies are unlikely to have a direct ecological impact they affect the dynamics over the israeli shelf as shown here and therefore could indirectly affect the marine ecosystem on a much larger scale than previously considered the propagation of the brine in the form of dcs increases the offshore and along shore water exchange of the israeli shallow shelf as such they act to reduce the residence time of seawater and dissolved chemical components such as nutrients on the shelf as a result shelf water productivity that relies to a great extent on the supply of recycled nutrients from the sea bottom may decrease where the spreading of dcs along the sea bottom could trap the nutrients released from the sediments preventing mixing to the upper part of the water column short circuiting the benthic pelagic nutrient cycle of coastal waters the main reason the brine spreads so vastly increasing from a small scale phenomenon with only 10 8 m3 s 1 released at the diffuser outfalls from aps to its downslope yearly mean peak of around 1434 m3 s 1 fig 8c is associated with entrainment processes similar to other countries the desalination industry in israel is subject to strict regulation and uses either diffusers at the outfalls or dilutes the brines with cooling water before discharging it into the sea section 3 here we have shown that while diluting the brine with cooling water is quite effective at preventing the spread of dcs the use of diffusers leads to far field changes in the shelf dynamics due to the robust dcs that are generated a close look at the yearly mean integrated downslope volume flux versus depth fig 8c reveals that the off shelf transport rate increases by approximately 52 times its initial total discharge rate near the diffusers which are located between 20 m and 26 m depth and from there increases only by a factor of 2 5 until reaching its maximum at 35 m depth the significant increase in the volume transport rate in the near field in the vicinity of the outfall is probably associated with the mixing promoted by the diffusers creating a much larger volume of slightly higher salinity that spreads to the far field indeed avoiding the rapid dilution in the near field will expose the marine environment to acute salinity levels but it will also probably significantly reduce its spreading in the far field such a tradeoff between the severity of the salinity anomalies and the spreading scales of brine somewhat challenge the idea that rapid near field dilution in order to obtain lowest possible salinity anomalies for disposal of desalination brines is the optimal method for the least impact on the marine environment mainly because the environmental effects in the far field haven t been studied yet desalination is becoming a critical part of water security worldwide and operating multiple plants on the same coastal shelf is likely to become more prevalent making the israeli desalination industry a good case study for estimating future scenarios and global trends our results indicate that diffusers despite becoming a popular discharge method are not as effective as premixing brine with power plant cooling water in reducing the generation of dcs this study highlights possible far field effects that these dcs have on shelf circulation which to the best of our knowledge have not been thoroughly investigated yet further study of the dynamical effects of brine discharge in the far field particularly with respect to its indirect influences on the marine ecology is required this may lead to the development of new regulations and monitoring programs to

18112,we use numerical simulations to study the possible spatiotemporal effects of brine release from five desalination plants located along the israeli mediterranean coastline it is commonly believed that salinity anomalies associated with brine discharge from desalination plants causes effects which are confined to an area of several hundreds of meters from the discharge outfall we show that discharging brine using diffusers produces small but robust salinity anomalies that propagate tens of kilometers as density currents dcs in contrast premixing the brine with power plant cooling water compensates the negative buoyancy and prevents their generation the propagating dcs can impact coastal water dynamics by increasing the velocities and transports in alongshore and downslope directions the spreading and trajectories of the dcs was strongly influenced by seasonal stratification in winter due to a mixed water column the dcs were relatively focused and propagate downslope while in the summer they are confined to a narrow band along the coastline our model results highlight the possibility that brine discharge might have a large scale non negligible effect on shelf circulation than previously considered further studies are needed to assess the environmental dynamical and ecological effects of desalination brine propagation especially in the far field keywords desalination brine density currents diffusers far field shelf circulation 1 introduction a dependable supply of drinking water is becoming a critical issue for modern cities threats emanating from climate change such as hotter conditions combined with longer droughts in some regions trenberth 2011 fauchereau et al 2003 and growing populations are putting pressure on many fresh water supplies consequently these supplies are no longer reliable as is evident from the water crises that have occurred in cape town south africa sao paulo brazil and mexico city welch 2018 more and more countries such as those around the arabian gulf lattemann and höpner 2008 the mediterranean sea lattemann et al 2009 the red sea hoepner and lattemann 2002 the us california cooley and ajami 2014 china zheng et al 2014 and australia giurco et al 2014 are now securing their water supplies through the installation and operation of seawater desalination plants it is estimated that the current production of desalination plants worldwide is 95 million m3 of fresh water per day jones et al 2019 the major by product of desalination is a highly saline brine that is often discharged back to the sea depending on the discharge location discharge method and the ambient oceanographic conditions this may affect the marine environment roberts et al 2010 monitoring programs and field based ecological studies often focus on the near field in the dilution zone directly around the outfalls where the relatively high salinity anomalies are easily detected above the ambient variability these high salinity anomalies have an impact on marine biota including e g planktonic microbial communities drami et al 2011 seagrasses garrote moreno et al 2014 benthic communities del pilar ruso et al 2015 belkin et al 2017 frank et al 2019 amphipods de la ossa carretero et al 2016 and marine invertebrate recruitment clark et al 2018 in order to minimize the ecological effects in the near field desalination plant outfalls have been designed to optimize mixing and dilution of the brine with the ambient waters e g using diffusers pre mixing with nearby power plant cooling water to encourage a rapid reduction of salinity anomalous values in the immediate discharge area bleninger and jirka 2008 therefore plumes that have been detected hundreds of meters from the outfall have a salinity anomaly 0 5 psμ above background levels roberts et al 2010 in the far field environmental field monitoring struggles to detect the brine plume salinity anomalies because they have been diluted to levels that are within the background salinity variability ayala et al 2015 despite the absence of clear measurable high salinity anomalies and the assumed negligible direct ecological effects such salinity anomalies are significant from a dynamical perspective and therefore may still have an impact on the marine environment one way that brine discharged from desalination plants may affect the far field marine environment is through their propagation as density gravity currents hereafter dcs dcs occur naturally due to processes that reduce the buoyancy of surface water such as surface cooling e g biton et al 2008 evaporation e g pattiaratchi et al 2011 ice formation e g ohshima et al 2013 and increased turbidity e g katz et al 2015 which lead to denser near surface waters compared to adjacent deeper waters in the near field the denser waters sink flowing down the slope due to the force of gravity symonds and gardiner garden 1984 killworth 1983 gordan et al 1993 in the far field due to the earth s rotation the dc veers until it flows along the slope in a quasi geostrophic balance price and o neil baringer 1994 emms 1997 while it propagates the high density anomalous signal is diluted and the volume of the plume increases due to the entrainment of the less dense ambient waters e g biton et al 2008 much like naturally occurring dcs that form over many continental shelves ivanov et al 2004 durrieru de madron et al 2005 the brine released from desalination plants is typically denser than the ambient oceanic water due to its higher salinity and therefore sinks along the sea bottom in the down slope direction there are many examples in world oceans where small density salinity anomalies may propagate in the form of dcs to a considerable distance from their origin e g the mediterranean outflow bower et al 2002 the red sea outflow bower et al 2005 and the denmark strait overflow tanhua et al 2005 therefore despite the initial dilution of the brine signal from a desalination plant s outfall the plume may still maintain part of its properties and spread along the shelf as a dc affecting shelf circulation due to continuing hot and arid conditions in israel combined with the consequence of several drought years turco et al 2017 desalination has become a key technology for ensuring a reliable supply of freshwater there are five operational desalination plants along a short stretch of the israeli mediterranean coastline approximately 100 km long which currently discharge approximately 625 million m3 year 1 of desalination brines into the sea nowadays such a high concentration of desalination plants co located on a relatively narrow coastline is not unusual in arid regions and can be found on the red sea coasts of saudi arabia chowdhury and al zahrani 2015 the persian gulf lattemann and höpner 2008 and the canary islands gómez gotor et al 2018 this will probably become more common in other regions globally as well with the development of the desalination industry and the increase in water scarcity and population growth the israeli mediterranean shelf can thus act as a case study to investigate the far field effects on the marine environment of desalination brines discharged from multiple plants here we are using one year of realistic numerical simulations to investigate the far field propagation of the brine effluent discharged from multiple desalination plants along the israeli mediterranean continental shelf as far as we know our study is the first to explore the distribution of brine effluents from multiple desalination plants their possible connectivity and their effect on coastal dynamics we also investigate the sensitivity of the propagation of the brine to the different dilution methods used by the desalination plants existing along the israeli coastline we found that mixing the brine with power plant cooling water with ambient water salinity as is done at the desalination plants located at ashkelon and hadera is more effective at reducing possible far field dynamical effects when compared to the use of diffusers that are used in the ashdod palmachim and soreq desalination plants hereafter aps in particular diluting and warming the brine by premixing it with the power plant cooling water reduced the salinity anomalies and compensated almost completely for the negative buoyancy of the plume causing it to mostly propagate at the surface near the shore conversely when diffusers are used to dilute the brine salinity anomaly rapidly in the near field as in the case of aps the plume still maintains a negative buoyancy and propagates widely along the shelf in the form of dcs we show that the formed dcs increase the transport on the shelf in both the downslope and along slope directions in winter the dcs are relatively focused and propagate to greater distances and depths downslope while during summer they mainly propagate at shallower depths along the shoreline in a quasi geostrophic balanced flow the simulation showed that dcs from aps mix together to spread along the shelf as one intact plume indicating that one cannot consider the impacts of multiple adjacent desalination plants in isolation the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the israeli mediterranean shelf conditions and our methodology the results are presented and discussed in section 3 and we conclude in section 4 2 methods 2 1 background israeli shelf conditions the israeli shoreline runs north to south along the south eastern terminus of the mediterranean sea and is part of the coastal margins of the levantine basin it is fairly straight in the meridional direction from the gaza strip in the south to the lebanese border in the north with the exception of the carmel headland in the northern part of israel leading into haifa bay the continental shelf along the israeli shore is relatively narrow 10 20 km with a steep continental slope starting at around 80 100 m bottom depth fig 1 negligible runoff and rainfall inputs along with a high evaporation rate lead to relatively high salinity values hecht et al 1988 in the summer the water is highly stratified with sea surface temperatures reaching as high as 31 c and salinity values as high as 40 psμ during august during winter the shallow shelf water is well mixed by winter storms and surface cooling with minimal values for salinity of less than 39 psu due to freshening of the shelf water from increased precipitation and runoff contributions ben gai et al 1998 and the intrusion of atlantic modified water into the eastern mediterranean through the surface layer ozer et al 2017 kress et al 2014 the currents on the israeli shelf near the coast flow mainly in the along shelf direction following bathymetric lines with the dominant direction being northward rosentraub and brenner 2007 2 2 model description here we are simulating the propagation of brine effluent discharged from multiple desalination plants located along the israeli mediterranean coastline there are currently five large reverse osmosis desalination plants operating in israel located at ashkelon operating since 2005 palmachim 2007 hadera 2009 soreq 2013 and ashdod 2014 table 1 and fig 1 the plants produce brine as a byproduct with salinities as high as 80 psu approximately double the initial seawater salinities the plant at hadera premixes the desalination brine with cooling water from a nearby power plant releasing the discharges via the same outfalls located at the shore fig 2 d power plant cooling water is also used to dilute the brine at the ashkelon desalination plant however the discharges are not premixed in ashkelon the outfalls for the brine and cooling water are located adjacent to each other with mixing occurring in the near field fig 2a the plants at aps release brine via underwater diffusers located offshore at around the 20 m isobath fig 2b and c altogether the desalination plants discharge approximately 625 million m3 year 1 of brine into the eastern mediterranean sea the detailed characteristics of the brine and the cooling water discharges along the israeli coast that were input into the model simulations can be found in table 1 the physical modelling of the concentrated brines along the israeli coast and their interactions with the marine environment was conducted using the mike3 hd hydrodynamic oceanic circulation model by the danish hydraulic institute dhi dhi software packages have been extensively used around the world resulting in many peer reviewed publications addressing various aspects of physical biogeochemical and operational oceanography problems e g payandeh et al 2015 fourniotis and horsch 2015 mahanty et al 2016 bolaños et al 2014 pastor et al 2018 ranjbar and zaker 2018 the model solves the three dimensional incompressible reynolds average navier stokes equations subject to the boussinesq and hydrostatic pressure assumptions it contains the equations of continuity momentum temperature salinity and density with the closure problem solved using a turbulent closure scheme the main governing equations are provided in the appendix in this study the smagorinsky model was used to get the horizontal eddy viscosity smagorinsky 1963 in combination with a fixed vertical eddy viscosity of 0 001 m2 s 1 a flexible unstructured triangular mesh was used to capture the complex topography of the shoreline and simulate the outfall region at high resolution the model domain covered the entire israeli coast and extended further southward and northward following the coastline to the southern border of the gaza strip and northward to tyre lebanon respectively fig 1 as this study focuses on shelf processes a cut off depth of 300 m is used the mesh size varied from a maximum area of 10 000 m2 within a 1 km radius around the location of each of the outfalls equivalent to a length scale of 100 m to approximately 180 km2 beyond the 80 m isobath along the vertical in the upper 180 m there are 22 sigma layers of varying thickness below 180 m depth there are 3 z layers of 40 m each the initial conditions and the open boundary conditions for salinity and temperature were taken from the aegean levantine eddy resolving model alermo skliris et al 2007 a spin up simulation of 12 days was performed to generate initial conditions for the sea level height and current velocities the model domain has three open boundaries at the north west and south each boundary was forced daily with temperature salinity current velocity profiles and sea level elevation atmospheric forcing conditions are applied at the surface every 3 h including wind stress precipitation and evaporation taken from an eastern mediterranean weather forecasting model skiron kallos et al 1997 the heat exchange components with the atmosphere including the latent heat sensible heat shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes were also taken from skiron and applied every 3 h 2 3 model runs two simulations namely bgrd and desal were conducted using forcing data for the year 2015 bgrd is used to study the coastal circulation under natural conditions with the addition of discharges of the cooling water from power plants along the israeli coast fig 1 while desal is used to investigate the impact of the desalination discharge brine from the five plants along the israeli coast by adding them to the bgrd setup the simulations used initial and boundary conditions as described in section 3 1 the characteristics of the different discharges as accounted explicitly in the simulations can be found in table 1 where the locations of the cooling and desalination seawater intakes and their outfalls can be viewed in figs 1 and 2 both the intakes and outfalls used a volume rate of m3s 1 to withdraw and discharge water into the model in order to track the spreading of the brines passive tracers with initial concentrations of 1 mg l were added to all of the desalination brine discharges in desal the passive tracer can be considered a dye that is added to the brine which enables us to track the spatial propagation of brine plumes from each desalination plant outfall and their trajectories over time as well as investigate the possible interactions between the adjacent brine discharges using passive tracers to track specific parcels of water is a widely used method and is provided as a complementary tool in the dhi hydrodynamical model for that specific purpose a cutoff of 0 0005 mg l for the tracer concentration was selected above this cutoff value the tracer s concentrations showed good correlation with the salinity anomalies with a spatial mean of 0 99 indicating that the tracer is following the brine plume in all simulations the output was captured at 12 h intervals 2 4 model validation the results of the desal simulation were compared to satellite sea surface temperature sst extracted from four horizontal sections along the model domain in addition to comparisons made with temperature salinity and current velocities measured at two long term coastal monitoring stations near ashkelon and hadera locations of the sections and the monitoring stations are indicated in fig 1 in all cases the comparisons with the observations are reasonably good albeit somewhat weaker velocities are found in the ashkelon site when compared to the observations specifically the seasonality and magnitude of the sst and the stratification conditions are well captured by the model when compared to satellite data and temperature data from two coastal ctds respectively the model accounts for the freshening of coastal waters during winter but underestimates the high salinities that are measured during summer more details on the comparisons of the model results with the observations can be found in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion in the near field the maximums of the annual means of the differences between the desal and bgrd runs that are greater than 0 5 psu are confined to approximately 2 km from the outfalls fig 2 this result is in good agreement with numerous field observations made over the years near the outfalls of the desalination plants along the israeli coast that were made within the framework of their compliance monitoring programs pointing to similarly restricted areas around the outfalls that exhibit salinity values higher than background levels einav et al 2002 safrai and zask 2008 drami et al 2011 frank et al 2019 kress et al 2019 however unlike the limited capabilities of field observations the simulations allow us to assess the far field spreading of desalination brines fig 3 thus according to fig 3 relatively low modelled salinity anomalies 0 05 psu that are difficult to observe in the field spread widely over the israeli continental shelf while such low salinity anomalies might not be significant from an ecological point of view they may be important from a dynamical perspective the aerial extents of the modelled desalination brine plumes are somewhat different from one desalination plant to another particularly the brines released from aps spread more widely than the brines released from hadera and ashkelon in addition the brines also differ in their level of propagation in the water column fig 3 these differences can be partially attributed to the intensities of the ambient current and to the vicinity of the outfalls to marine infrastructures e g hadera and ashkelon fig 2a d and as based on our simulation are mainly related to the discharge method i e pre dilution with power plant cooling water hadera released adjacent to power plant cooling water ashkelon or the use of diffusers aps 3 1 discharges through diffusers aps one difficulty in assessing far field spatiotemporal effects of desalination brines is that such low salinity anomalies as stated above can hardly be distinguished from the background salinity variation here using numerical passive tracers we were able to follow the trajectories of desalination brines spreading over the israeli shelf section 3 2 as indicated in fig 3 the brine discharged from the desalination plants in aps which are released by underwater diffusers located within 10 km of each other propagate together indicating a strong connectivity between these plants particularly during summer unlike hadera and ashkelon where brine is mixed with cooling water the brines of aps are negatively buoyant and therefore the maximum modelled salinities occur exclusively in the bottom layer fig 3 figs 4 6 display seasonal summer and winter mean values of the simulated seawater property anomalies along the cross shore sections located 1 km fig 4 and 5 km figs 5 and 6 northward of the soreq desalination plant the dimensions of the propagating brine plumes discharged at aps are well captured by our defined tracer concentration cutoff the high salinity anomalies are generally related to the maximal along slope velocity anomalies fig 4a d suggesting that the brines are driven by the excess of salinity density above the ambient values and therefore propagate in the form of dcs the spatial dimensions of the simulated plume in the far field are somewhat surprising having a lens shape covering most of the 10 km offshore and can be as high as 20 m above the bottom fig 6a middle the along slope velocity anomalies are strongest nearest to the outfalls however they are persistent on the shelf further away figs 4 6 above the plume region and close to the shore there are negative velocity anomalies probably indicating a return flow that is balancing the sinking descending of the propagating plume and its entrainment of the ambient water e g fig 4d from the calculated along slope and downslope depth integrated volume transport calculation figs 7 and 8 and the cross sectional plots figs 4 6 the following general picture of the propagating dcs emerges in the near field the desalination brine descends downslope in approximately the cross shelf direction during the descent of the dcs the high salinity plume increases in volume due to entrainment processes fig 8b while the salinity anomaly and tracer concentration are diluted and decrease in value in the far field the propagation of the brine is strongly affected by the seasonal stratification of the water column during summer the brine descends through a stratified water column and entrains warmer water from shallower areas due to the positive cross shore temperature gradient fig s5 as a result in the far field the brines are characterized by warmer and saltier water propagating at shallower depths further alongshore compared to winter e g fig 4a and b as shown in fig 9 these findings correspond with recent monitoring program data demonstrate a non negligible far field signal of the propagating brine extending as a near bottom saltier and warmer water mass during the spring and summer months at least to several kilometers away from the outfalls of palmachim and sorek kress et al 2019 the temperature anomalies are significant and decrease from 0 6 c 1 km north of the soreq outfall fig 4b to 0 2 c 5 km away fig 6b much of the entrainment occurs in the near field as the plumes descend to the 30 m isobath where the mean depth integrated transport reaches a maximum of 970 m3 s 1 fig 8c from this depth the dense plume veers northward in the along slope direction fig 7b hence the sharp reduction in the downslope flow fig 8c and propagates in a quasi geostrophic equilibrium between buoyancy and the coriolis forces therefore during summer relatively high transport rates in the along slope direction are confined to a narrow strip between the 20 m and 50 m isobaths fig 8c while maximal downslope transport values are restricted to the areas close to the outfalls and are quite negligible elsewhere fig 7a the summer integrated along slope transport fig 8d has two local maxima along the coast due to the enhanced entrainment that occurs near the outfalls first at ashdod and then at palmachim and soreq these are quickly reduced downstream or further northward by losses to descending detachment of water parcels from the main plume attainment of the neutral buoyancy level or whenever the simulated tracer concentration is diluted to below the threshold value because the plumes from the different sources propagate in the far field mainly in the along slope direction and approximately at the same depths there is a relatively strong connectivity between the three outfalls this results in cumulative along slope transports clearly seen in the case of aps fig 8d the modelled plume of aps maintains some of its coherent structure as far as 70 km northward of soreq near hadera fig 6a however at this distance the dynamic effect of the propagating brine is negligible and the salinity anomalies are small overall during summer the propagation of the dcs affects the transport along much of the length of the israeli coast from ashdod to hadera fig 7b and 8b d during summer the maximal velocity anomalies at the plume s core are somewhat greater than 1 5 cm s 1 within the plume area 1 km north of the soreq diffuser fig 4d and decreases to 0 75 cm s 1 5 km north of soreq fig 6d while these anomalies may seem minor they are robust and represent a considerable increase to the background velocities up to 100 more in the 1 km section and 60 more in the 5 km section it is worth mentioning that the background velocities in the shallow shelf areas alternate between the positive and negative in the along slope direction e g fig s4a and therefore the mean velocities are relatively small during the winter the brine plumes preserve some of their signal and propagate as dcs despite the vigorous mechanical mixing caused by winter storms and convective vertical mixing resulting from the net heat loss to the atmosphere there is a negative cross shelf temperature gradient fig s5b and therefore the plume continuously entrains the colder ambient water at shallow depths while the plume core salinity and density anomalies decrease therefore in the far field the plume is characterized by colder and saltier water than the surrounding ambient water fig 4b additionally a quasi geostrophically balanced flow like the one found during summer could not be reached and the plume propagates in both the along slope and downslope directions fig 7 nevertheless despite the entrainment processes the plume descends to greater depths before it reaches its neutral buoyancy level fig 8a c indeed during winter significant transport with a mean of around 900 m3 s 1 can be found down to 80 m and beyond fig 8c additionally unlike summer the transport associated with the propagation of brine is restricted to a narrower coastline stretching from ashdod in the south to approximately 30 km north of soreq fig 7 however within this area the along slope transport is larger fig 8d and spreads over a greater range of depths than during the summer it should be noted that the background along slope velocities are significantly stronger in winter than in summer fig s5d and thus the relative contribution of the desalination brine generated dcs to the along slope velocities is smaller the maximal velocity anomalies within the plume area are approximately 1 cm s 1 1 km north of the soreq diffuser fig 4d and decreases to around 0 7 cm s 1 5 km north of soreq fig 5d which represents an increase to the background velocities of up to 13 and 6 respectively 3 2 mixing the brine with cooling water ashkelon and hadera generally the results of the desal simulation show that mixing the brines of ashkelon and hadera desalination plants with the cooling water from the adjacent power plants proves to be much more effective in reducing the dynamical impacts of the brine discharge than in the cases of aps where underwater diffusers are employed at hadera the simulated brine is premixed with the cooling water that is warmer by 6 c than the ambient coastal water with a ratio of 1 18 during summer the discharged water is positively buoyant fig s6c and therefore the hotter and saltier brine plume propagates northward near the surface and close to the coastline fig s6 the addition of the brine also somewhat compensated for the along slope excess velocities related to the propagation of the cooling water which therefore decreased by approximately 0 5 cm s 1 fig 10 d during the winter the situation is similar but it is less apparent in the density field due to the existing unstable stratification conditions fig s6c nevertheless a core of saltier and warmer water associated with the mixed discharged water which is less dense than the surrounding water is visible nearshore fig s6 in the case of the ashkelon desalination plant unlike hadera the brine is released directly from the shore near the cooling water outfall in the near field up to 1 km from the location of the outfalls a mixed behavior is observed fig 11 and figs s7 s8 part of the brine that mixed efficiently with the cooling water becomes a positively buoyant plume that propagates at the surface and near the shore as in hadera while the rest of the brine that is only partially mixed with the cooling water creates a denser plume that propagates near the bottom in the form of dcs as in the case of aps indeed in the near field the propagations of the two plumes are associated with relatively significant along slope velocity anomalies which increase by 2 cm s 1 in the case of the brine propagating as dcs and decrease by more than 2 cm s 1 in the near surface alongshore current fig 11 d yet both modelled velocity and density anomalies decrease quickly with increasing distance from the outfalls fig 11 and become negligible in the far field figs 5 and 6 in this case the dcs propagating from ashkelon which mix with the cooling water are warmer less dense and reach their neutral buoyancy level at shallower depths than the dcs generated from aps at a distance of 1 km northward from the ashkelon desalination plant outfall the mean dc plume is warmer by 1 c during summer fig s7b and by 0 5 c during winter fig 11b as such despite their higher salinities the brine reaches its neutral buoyancy level at 10 m and 20 m bottom depth during summer and winter respectively fig 11 and fig s7 at greater depth the temperature and salinity anomalies associated with the brine plume are still apparent fig 11 but their combined effect on the density field is negligible fig 11c further away downstream from the outfall entrainment processes reduce the density anomaly even more until it practically disappears or does not affect the shelf circulation fig 5 overall the use of cooling water to dilute the brine is found to be quite an effective practice in reducing the spatial extent of the brine plume propagation and its impact on shelf circulation compared to the use of underwater diffusers furthermore it seems that pre mixing the brine with the cooling water further reduces the velocities and temperature anomalies of the cooling water plume 3 3 caveats our findings somewhat challenge the previous ecological assessments that showed no detectable ecological impacts in sites several kilometers from the desalination brine outfalls e g einav et al 2002 garrote moreno et al 2014 belkin et al 2017 lykkebo petersen et al 2019 frank et al 2019 given that our findings are mostly based on a modeling study this should be clarified notably the reasonable comparison of our model results with existing continuous measurements along the israeli coast supplementary information near the outfalls e g frank et al 2019 and in the far field e g fig 9 give some confidence that our findings are realistic particularly recent monitoring program data demonstrate a non negligible far field signal of the propagating brine extending as a near bottom saltier and warmer water mass during the spring and summer months at least to several kilometers away from the outfalls of palmachim and sorek kress et al 2019 as was independently predicted by our model fig 9 though this evidence highly supports our model results a clear validation to the simulated propagating desalination brine plumes in the far field is not provided as much as such observational evidence may be desirable and could have solidified our findings tracking the propagating brine in the far field demands a detailed high resolution spatial temporal survey in particular observing the highly seasonal nature of the brine propagation effect is only possible using continuous long term measurements such measurements are highly costly and time consuming and unfortunately are not available for the studied area and to the best of our knowledge at no other sites where desalination brines are discharged around the globe giving a detailed closure 3d view of the oceanic circulation hydrodynamic models are powerful tools to study different dynamical processes including density currents that can fill knowledge gaps in places where measurements hardly exist or very difficult to obtain the presented behavior of propagating density currents relies on solid physical background which is well studied in natural systems section 1 these propagating density currents are normally initiated by naturally occurring density anomalies that are much smaller than those associated with desalination brines in comparison to ambient coastal water section 1 and references therein we express our hope that our interesting results which highlight previously overlooked possible larger scale non negligible effects of the brine discharges from multiple sources on shelf circulation will be followed by observational studies that will confirm or refute our findings and help to further assess the environmental dynamical and ecological effects of desalination brine discharge in the far field 4 conclusions we used a realistic 3d hydrodynamic model of the israeli mediterranean shelf to investigate the propagation of the desalination brine effluents discharged from multiple outfalls located along the israeli mediterranean coastline and their possible impacts on the coastal circulation we show that the discharge method has a large impact on the near and far field behavior of the brine plume mixing the brine with power plant cooling water offsets the negative buoyancy of the brine resulting in an overall positively buoyant plume that has only a minor effect on shelf circulation in contrast the brine discharged from diffusers lead to the development of robust dcs which despite entrainment of surrounding waters still had an impact on shelf circulation far away from their discharge sites the brine plumes released by diffusers propagate in the form of dcs and influence far field circulation by increasing down and along slope volume transport and velocities along large sections of the israeli shelf the spreading of the brines and their relative importance to the shelf dynamics is highly seasonal and is dependent on the stratification conditions that exist on the shelf specifically during winter the brine spreads in both the along slope and downslope directions due to the entrainment in a well mixed water column while under stratified conditions that are prevalent in summer the plume remains at shallower depth and propagates further along the shelf despite the higher transports found in winter its relative contribution to the naturally occurring transports associated with storms and shelf convection processes during this season is small in contrast during the stratified conditions that exist in summer downslope transports rarely occur under natural conditions and therefore the additional transport contribution of the brines is more significant interestingly we also found that the propagation of the brine as dcs in summer causes changes in the near bottom temperature which could have ecological implications such as an increase in sediment oxygen demand of ca 5 per 0 5 c increase in temperature e g thamdrup et al 1998 previous findings indicated that the major threats to the marine environment posed by the desalination industry are associated with the effects of the high salinity levels on the marine biota and associated ecosystems in the vicinity of the brine outfalls or the near field e g einav et al 2002 garrote moreno et al 2014 belkin et al 2017 lykkebo petersen et al 2019 frank et al 2019 some studies have suggested that the impacts of brine discharges on a basin scale are only minor because the oceanographic fluxes from natural processes far exceed the fluxes associated with freshwater extraction by the desalination plants smith et al 2007 roberts 2015 roberts 2015 further suggested that even with future growth in the desalination industry this will not change due to these reasons most research on the impacts of brine discharge on the marine environment focus on the near field where acute exposure to high salinity levels exists additionally environmental regulations normally demand that salinity anomalies associated with the brine discharges be reduced to background levels within a restricted mixing zone in the near field e g safrai and zask 2008 as such a great deal of research has been undertaken to optimize desalination outfall discharge methods e g multiport diffusers and discharge angles to maximize mixing and the rapid dilution of the plume jirka 2008 bashitialshaaer et al 2015 abessi and roberts 2014 2018 based on our simulations the brine discharges from desalination plants with diffusers spread widely along the israeli shelf affecting the shelf circulation such a relatively large scale effect is caused by only minor yet robust salinity anomalies that are considered unimportant from an environmental point of view indeed while these low salinity anomalies are unlikely to have a direct ecological impact they affect the dynamics over the israeli shelf as shown here and therefore could indirectly affect the marine ecosystem on a much larger scale than previously considered the propagation of the brine in the form of dcs increases the offshore and along shore water exchange of the israeli shallow shelf as such they act to reduce the residence time of seawater and dissolved chemical components such as nutrients on the shelf as a result shelf water productivity that relies to a great extent on the supply of recycled nutrients from the sea bottom may decrease where the spreading of dcs along the sea bottom could trap the nutrients released from the sediments preventing mixing to the upper part of the water column short circuiting the benthic pelagic nutrient cycle of coastal waters the main reason the brine spreads so vastly increasing from a small scale phenomenon with only 10 8 m3 s 1 released at the diffuser outfalls from aps to its downslope yearly mean peak of around 1434 m3 s 1 fig 8c is associated with entrainment processes similar to other countries the desalination industry in israel is subject to strict regulation and uses either diffusers at the outfalls or dilutes the brines with cooling water before discharging it into the sea section 3 here we have shown that while diluting the brine with cooling water is quite effective at preventing the spread of dcs the use of diffusers leads to far field changes in the shelf dynamics due to the robust dcs that are generated a close look at the yearly mean integrated downslope volume flux versus depth fig 8c reveals that the off shelf transport rate increases by approximately 52 times its initial total discharge rate near the diffusers which are located between 20 m and 26 m depth and from there increases only by a factor of 2 5 until reaching its maximum at 35 m depth the significant increase in the volume transport rate in the near field in the vicinity of the outfall is probably associated with the mixing promoted by the diffusers creating a much larger volume of slightly higher salinity that spreads to the far field indeed avoiding the rapid dilution in the near field will expose the marine environment to acute salinity levels but it will also probably significantly reduce its spreading in the far field such a tradeoff between the severity of the salinity anomalies and the spreading scales of brine somewhat challenge the idea that rapid near field dilution in order to obtain lowest possible salinity anomalies for disposal of desalination brines is the optimal method for the least impact on the marine environment mainly because the environmental effects in the far field haven t been studied yet desalination is becoming a critical part of water security worldwide and operating multiple plants on the same coastal shelf is likely to become more prevalent making the israeli desalination industry a good case study for estimating future scenarios and global trends our results indicate that diffusers despite becoming a popular discharge method are not as effective as premixing brine with power plant cooling water in reducing the generation of dcs this study highlights possible far field effects that these dcs have on shelf circulation which to the best of our knowledge have not been thoroughly investigated yet further study of the dynamical effects of brine discharge in the far field particularly with respect to its indirect influences on the marine ecology is required this may lead to the development of new regulations and monitoring programs to take into account the far field impacts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

18113,the coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando is a two stage process for nitrogen removal and resource recovery in the first ammonia is oxidized to nitrite in an aerobic bioreactor in the second oxidation of polyhydroxyalkanoate pha drives reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide n2o which is stripped for use as a biogas oxidant because ammonia oxidation is well studied tests of cando to date have focused on n2o production in anaerobic anoxic sequencing batch reactors in these reactors nitrogen is provided as nitrite pha is produced from acetate or other dissolved cod and pha oxidation is coupled to n2o production from nitrite in a pilot scale study n2o recovery was affected by cod n ratio total cycle time and relative time periods for pha synthesis and n2o production in follow up bench scale studies different reactor cycle times were used to investigate these operational parameters increasing cod n ratio improved nitrite removal and increased biosolids concentration shortening the anaerobic phase prevented fermentation of pha and improved its utilization efficient pha synthesis and utilization in the anaerobic phase correlated with high n2o production in the anoxic phase shortening the anoxic phase prevented reduction of n2o to n2 by shortening both phases total cycle time was reduced from 24 to 12 h this optimized operation enabled increased biomass concentrations increased n2o yields from 71 to 87 increased n loading rates from 0 1 to 0 25 kg n m3 d and shorter hydraulic residence times from 10 to 2 days long term changes in

enabled significant improvements in process loading and operational stability 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot scale reactor setup and operation a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a volume of 6 m3 and a total liquid volume of 1 5 m3 was established at delta diablo wastewater treatment plant antioch ca usa the reactor was fed a stock solution of sodium acetate and acetic acid ph 4 0 cod 4 5 g l and effluent from a nitritation reactor treated anaerobic digester centrate east bay municipal utility district and project partners 2017 containing 1 1 g no2 n l or a surrogate nitrified centrate

type sensor unisense denmark was used for dissolved n2o monitoring the pilot scale nitrous denitritation sbr was inoculated with 150 l 10 v v of returned activated sludge from delta diablo then operated for 315 days acetate was added as a pulse at the start of each operational cycle to initiate the anaerobic phase nitrite was added as a pulse at the end of the anaerobic phase to initiate the anoxic phase and air stripping enabled recovery of dissolved n2o at the end of each cycle fig 1 during start up the reactor was operated for 60 days without settling to select for n2o producing microorganisms table s1 the initial cod n input ratio g cod as acetate g n as nitrite was set at five 150 mg cod l and 30 mg n l to concentrate biomass a settle decant step was added before discharge of effluent the cycle time was changed to 24 h and the cod n input ratio was decreased to 3 stable operation began on day 164 period i and the aeration period was extended to 3 h in period ii the duration of the anaerobic phase was reduced to 7 h and remained at that level for the duration of the experiment the pilot reactor experienced two significant perturbations due to upsets in the upstream nitritation reactor on days 61 72 and 107 113 inefficient upstream nitritation resulted in high levels of ammonium and low concentrations of nitrite in the influent to the nitrous denitritation sbr on days 251 257 a process control issue in the upstream nitritation reactor resulted in high concentrations of nitrate in the influent to the nitrous denitritation sbr when these upset periods were detected a surrogate nitrified centrate was fed to the denitritation reactor in lieu of influent from the nitritation reactor this switch in the influent feed enabled operational continuity while the nitritation reactor recovered from process upsets 2 2 bench scale reactor setup and operation to explore the effects of different operational and design variables two 5 l bench scale nitrous denitritation sbrs sbr 1 and sbr 2 each with a total liquid volume of 4 l were fed nitrite rich effluent from a bench scale nitritation sbr that in turn was fed anaerobic digester centrate from delta diablo the nitrite rich effluent contained 1100 mg l no2 n 60 mg l nh4 n 30 mg l no3 n and a soluble cod of 200 mg l the operational cycle was similar to that of the pilot scale reactor with a 21 5 h reaction phase 2 h stripping phase 20 min settle and 10 min of decant during the react phase sbr 1 had a 12 h anaerobic phase and a 9 5 h anoxic phase sbr 2 had an 8 h anaerobic phase and a 13 5 h anoxic phase both reactors were operated at an hrt of 4 days and a solid retention time srt of 60 days a solution of sodium acetate and acetic acid 3 g cod l ph 5 0 was used as the carbon source for denitritation the ph of the both reactors was maintained at 7 5 by automatic addition of 1 m hcl the same decoupled feeding strategy as the pilot scale sbr for acetate and nitrite

using an in situ probe in both the pilot and follow up bench scale studies in the pilot scale reactor n2o in the gas phase was found to be present at levels less than equilibrium and gas mixing was insufficient preventing use of measured n 2 o aq for calculation of n2o conversion efficiencies and yields this issue was corrected in follow up bench scale studies using well mixed reactors and small headspace volumes that were only flushed during periods of stripping independent measurements of gas and liquid phase n2o concentrations confirmed equilibrium conditions within both reactors

oxide production performance of the pilot scale reactor and the bench scale reactors was monitored and compared during long term operation in the pilot scale sbr mlvss was stable at 2750 410 mg l and average dissolved n2o at the end of the anoxic phase was 6 3 mg n l occasional overdose of polyamide based coagulant resulted in the release of organic particulates from the upstream centrifuge which passed through the nitritation reactor as a result coagulated organic particulates were transferred into the nitrous denitritation reactor together with nitrite at the end of each anaerobic phase increasing the cod n input ratio while simultaneously loading the reactor with organic carbon and nitrogen preventing the desired decoupling of carbon and nitrogen inputs needed for pha and n2o production scherson et al 2013 2014 gao et al 2017 a settling tank was then added to remove the coagulated solids in the nitrified centrate production of n2o was unstable and an upstream nitrate perturbation days 250 260 likely also contributed to the low n2o yields after switching to a surrogate nitrified centrate feed on day 258 and decreasing the anaerobic period to 7 h n2o production increased dramatically fig s4 and table s1 on day 305 nitrogen loading was doubled to 2 0 kg n m3 d and aqueous n2o concentration further increased to 35 mg n l because of time constraints on the pilot study follow up bench scale studies were performed these studies focused on the impacts of the relative lengths of the anaerobic and anoxic periods the two sbrs were inoculated with the pilot scale reactor biomass and operated with similar start up conditions but with different anaerobic phase durations after 30 days of operation both reactors reached mlvss levels exceeding 3 000 mg l and performance of the two reactors differed dramatically during operation with a 12 h anaerobic phase sbr 1 was similar to the pilot reactor with transient production of n2o fig 2 a the average nitrite removal efficiency was 94 12 n 150 from day 100 250 wildly fluctuating n2o production was observed with average yield below 30 residual nitrite was partly decanted and discharged after settling and partly carried over to the next cycle in sbr 1 to ensure sufficient reducing equivalents were available for nitrite reduction to n2o acetate input was increased while keeping nitrite input constant on day 300 resulting in a cod n input ratio increase from 3 0 to 3 5 improved nitrite removal efficiency 96 2 n 150 was observed from day 300 to day 450 with statistical significance student s t test p 1 25 10 8 after a further increase in cod n ratio n2o production resumed on day 370 but the n2o yield continued to fluctuate sbr 2 was operated for 600 days and achieved stable n2o production during operation with an 8 h anaerobic phase fig 2b after 90 days of startup mlvss levels reached 3000 mg l n2o production was unstable during startup but the rate of nitrogen removal rate was stable at 95 n2o production stabilized after 150 days of operation from day 150 300 the average nitrogen removal rate was 96 6 n 150 with an n2o yield of 70 16 n 45 similarly the input ratio of cod n was increased from 3 0 to 3 5 from day 300 onwards to ensure sufficient electron donor for nitrite removal as a result the average nitrogen removal rate increased to 98 3 n 150 from day 350 500 a statistically significant improvement over days 150 300 student s t test p 1 25 10 8 in addition this change in sbr 2 supported greater biomass accumulation a near doubling of mlvss occurred with measured values approaching 6 000 mg l fig s8 table 1 the elevated biomass levels that resulted from increased cod n input ratios led to an increase in anaerobic acetate uptake from 45 mgcod l h to 114 mgcod l h whereas the specific acetate uptake rates remained constant from 0 015 to 0 018 mgcod ac mgcod vss h this enabled further shortening of the anaerobic phase to 7 h and shortening of the anoxic phase to 4 h decreasing total cycle time to 12 h and enabling an increase in n2o yield to 87 on days 535 600 table 1 compares key operational parameters for the three sbrs in all cases a decrease in anaerobic phase duration resulted in more efficient and stable n2o production after switching to a 12 h cycle with a 4 h anaerobic phase sbr 2 achieved high volumetric nitrogen loading rates 0 25 kg n m3 d with efficient n2o production decreasing the cycle time from 24 h to 12 h resulted in a 50 decrease in hrt i e from 4 days to 2 days 3 2 pha utilization and denitritation polyhydroxyalkanoate pha granules provide the reducing power needed to drive reduction of nitrite to n2o scherson et al 2014 accumulation of pha depends upon the relative rates of pha polymerization and depolymerization arias et al 2013 fig 3 illustrates changes in pha levels for two intensively sampled operational cycles in the pilot reactor for a 11 h anaerobic phase and a total cycle time of 24 h fig 3a pha levels increased for the first 8 h then declined for hours 8 11 likely due to decay during the subsequent 13 h anoxic phase pha levels continued to decrease due to decay and also due to oxidation of phb by nitrite with coupled reduction of nitrite to n2o residual nitrite was partly wasted and partly carried over to the anaerobic phase of the subsequent cycle where the added acetate drove complete denitrification to n2 rather than n2o the observed pha utilization efficiency was 20 gcod gn ratio a very large value reflecting inefficient use of pha for n2o production over many cycles however production and consumption of n2o was observed suggesting that shortening of the anoxic period could limit pha consumption and improve recovery of n2o fig s2 accordingly the anaerobic phase was decreased to 7 h and a pha utilization efficiency of 3 9 gcod pha gn no2 was obtained fig 3b as dissolved n2o levels increased to 13 mg n l the conversion yield of acetate to pha in cod units improved to 70 to maintain a constant cycle time the anoxic phase was extended to 13 5 h under these conditions nitrite removal efficiency increased to 96 but residual nitrite persisted and was carried over to the next operational cycle the impacts of a shortened anaerobic period and a shortened anoxic period were further evaluated and compared over an extended period of operation in bench scale reactors sbr 1 and sbr 2 both reactors were initially operated at the same hrt and cycle time but sbr 1 was subject to a longer anaerobic phase 12 h than sbr 2 8 h then 4 h the extended anaerobic period evaluated in sbr 1 selected for unstable operational performance whereas the shortened anaerobic period evaluated in sbr 2 selected for both a stable community and stable long term performance in sbr 1 three distinct patterns of nitrite consumption were observed fig s3 as the microbial community changed in the first fig s3a nitrite residual from the anoxic phase carried over into the anaerobic phase of the next cycle as in the pilot reactor in the second fig s3b nitrite was reduced sequentially to n2o then n2 in the anoxic phase and these steps were coupled to pha accumulation pha consumption and cell growth in the third fig s3c nitrite residual was eliminated with complete acetate assimilation during the anaerobic phase similar to sbr 2 described below the negative impact of residual nitrite led to unstable n2o production during long term operation of sbr 1 fig 2a in sbr 2 a stable pattern similar to the third pattern of sbr 1 emerged after 200 days of operation fig s3d acetate was incorporated into pha during the anaerobic phase with efficient and stable n2o production in the anoxic phase acetate uptake and pha synthesis was driven by oxidation of glycogen fig 4 a similar study implicated denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms as likely n2o producers zeng et al 2003 the conversion yield of acetate to pha was 93 during the anaerobic phase when nitrite was added at peak pha levels nitrite removal efficiency was 94 and n2o yield reached 74 fig s3d efficient utilization of pha was achieved as the consumption ratio of pha to nitrite reached 2 4 gcod gn n2o was stripped by air and recovered at peak concentration after increasing the cod n input ratio rapid pha accumulation was accompanied by increased biomass concentrations suggesting the feasibility of a shortened anaerobic phase simultaneously though the elongated anoxic phase that resulted after nitrite depletion resulted in further reduction of n2o to n2 decreasing n2o yield before stripping accordingly on day 520 the duration of the anaerobic and the anoxic phases were reduced to 5 h apiece in a 12 h cycle fig 4b n2o yield increased from 43 to 87 and the volumetric loading rate of nitrogen doubled reaching 0 25 kg n m3 d decreasing the operational cycle in sbr 2 to from 24 h to 12 h minimized pha fermentation during the anoxic phase and improved pha utilization efficiency to 2 4 gcod pha gn no2 fig 4 the bench scale testing thus successfully addressed the concern of pha insufficiency encountered during pilot scale testing comparing pha synthesis and utilization for nitrous denitritation from all three systems studied a positive linear correlation was observed between pha synthesized per acetate mol c mol c at the end of anaerobic phase and n2o yield during anoxic phase anova f 1 7 84 78 p 0 001 with an r2 of 0 92 fig 5 minimizing pha fermentation improves the pha ac ratio a gradual increase in n2o production accompanied improved efficiency of carbon storage was shown from pilot scale to bench scale sbr 1 and sbr 2 the linear relationship predicts that as the pha ac ratio approaches 1 7 n2o production from nitrite approaches 100 a similar linear correlation between efficiency of carbon storage as pha and n2o accumulation for mixed heterotrophic denitrifying cultures has been previously reported liu et al 2015 notably the pha ac ratio exceeded one in sbr 2 as the monitored pha included both hb and hv monomers the hv monomers derive from glycogen as expected based upon the known biochemical pathways of gaos a proposed model and experimental observations reported pha ac ratios ranging from 1 65 to 1 91 for gaos filipe et al 2001 zeng et al 2002 this ratio may thus be a good indicator of the relative abundance of denitrifying gaos the efficiency of carbon utilization and capacity for n2o production across systems with different microbial community structures 3 3 mechanisms of n2o production and consumption the timing of nitrite addition had a significant impact on n2o production as shown in fig 3 shortening the anaerobic phase to coincide with peak pha significantly improved n2o production the expression of nirs was observed immediately after nitrite addition fig 3c which exhibited an immediate tenfold increase in transcript abundance when acetate levels decreased to zero reduction of nitrite to n2o was coupled to pha oxidation further reduction of n2o to n2 may have been limited by competition for reducing equivalents or nitrous oxide reductase may have been inhibited due to high levels of inhibitory free nitrous acid fna richardson et al 2009 as nitrite was consumed and fna levels fell from 2 to 0 8 μg n l anthonisen et al 1976 inhibition of nitrous oxide reduction may have been alleviated enabling production of n2 zhou et al 2008 similar observations of cascading denitrification reactions inhibitory intermediates and competition for electrons have been reported especially under electron donor limited conditions pan et al 2013 wang et al 2018 diverse microbial communities were selected by the operating conditions of the nitrous denitritation reactors in the pilot scale reactor bacteria from the families comamonadaceae xanthomonadaceae and zoogloeaceae were enriched and identified by 16s amplicon sequencing a stable community structure established by day 194 coinciding with a stable pattern of n2o production the dominant genus was a diaphorobacter strain woo 2017 d nitroreducens and d polyhydroxybutyrativorans both have the genes required for denitrification and for pha synthesis and degradation tabrez khan and hiraishi 2002 zuo et al 2015 perturbations in the microbial communities correlated with upsets in upstream nitritation and operational changes fig 6 a a significant change in the relative abundance of paracoccus occurred on day 257 likely due to an increase in nitrate in the feed paracoccus denitrificans is a facultative denitrifier possessing both nitrate and nitrite reductase and respiratory nitrate reductase nap is preferentially expressed under carbon or nutrient limiting conditions blaszczyk 1993 sears et al 1997 paracoccus also possesses genes for both pha synthase and depolymerase gao et al 2001 thauera species are heterotrophic denitrifiers philipp and schink 2012 that can accumulate pha in full scale wastewater treatment plants oshiki et al 2008 they became more prevalent when the influent was switched to surrogate nitrified centrate and persisted when the influent was switched back to effluent from the nitritation reactor among the identified n2o producing candidates diaphorobacter possesses nirk genes encoding for nitrite reductase whereas thauera and comamonas possess nirs genes heylen et al 2006 paracoccus has both nirs and nirk genes therefore nirs primers were able to track the expression of nitrite reductase encoding genes in the pilot scale denitritation sbr when its microbial community contained mainly thauera and paracoccus the nirs primer nirscd3af nirsr3cd used in this study has been widely used for pure cultures including paracoccus as well as for environmental samples throbäck et al 2004 kandeler et al 2006 wei et al 2015 the expression of nirk genes on the other hand showed no significant change over time moreover thauera comamonas and paracoccus species were known to have genes encoding for nitrous oxide reductase hoeren et al 1993 liu et al 2013 throbäck et al 2004 they might contribute to reduction of n2o to nitrogen gas during an extended anoxic phase sbr 1 was inoculated with a seed from the pilot scale reactor over its 500 days of operation the bacterial community experienced significant shifts in composition thauera that was likely transferred from the pilot scale sbr dominated sbr 1 on day 351 constituting 43 of the 16s rdna clones fig s5a other potential n2o producing microorganisms including diaphorobacter and paracocus were detected while both sbr 1 and sbr 2 were seeded by the pilot reactor the operational mode in sbr 2 selected against persistence of thauera fig 6b and selected in favor of an uncultured defluviicoccus related strain which comprised a majority of the 16s rdna clones detected fig s5b the relative abundance of the defluviicoccus related strain rhodospirillaceae family was stable at 37 39 for days 494 587 full length 16s rrna clone library results for dominant denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in the sbr showed only 92 similarity to defluviicoccus vanus cluster i fig s7 the closest match with a 99 similarity is to a sequence from an uncultured defluviicoccus clone recently designated as the sole member of cluster iv mcilroy et al 2009 to date none of the defluviicoccus related gaos have genes for complete denitrification cluster i defluviicoccus related gaos were reportedly able to reduce nitrate but not nitrite wang et al 2008 according to a recent metagenomic study wang et al 2014 cluster ii defluviicoccus related gaos reportedly lack dissimilatory denitrification genes addition of nitrite for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is postulated to suppress growth of gaos tayà et al 2013 in this study however defluviicoccus cluster iv were enriched and became dominant and the reactor produced n2o under stable operating conditions it thus appears likely that these organisms are responsible for carbon storage and for nitrous denitritation but additional studies are needed to confirm such phenotype within cluster iv defluviicoccus gaos have been previously implicated in the production of n2o zeng et al 2003 relatively shorter anaerobic phase in sbr 2 enriched for bacteria with more rapid acetate uptake where gao exhibited competitive advantages with glycogen driven acetate uptake and pha synthesis as shown in the nmds plot of fig 7 two distinct clusters reveal that the microbial communities of the pilot scale reactor differed significantly from those of bench scale sbr 2 on a two dimensional ordination stress 0 10 r2 0 94 as expected the inoculum of the pilot scale bioreactor and that of sbr 2 clustered at different locations shifts in community structure of the bench scale reactor after transferring an inoculum from the pilot scale reactor are also evident overlaying the key operational parameters as vectors an increase in the duration of anaerobic phase correlated negatively with n2o yields table s3 moreover the microbial communities in the pilot scale sbr day288 304 and bench scale sbr 2 day103 587 shifted towards clusters with a higher n2o yield likely due to the shortened anaerobic phase and increased nitrogen loading fig 7 other factors not assessed in this study could be associated with the observed shifts in community structure 3 4 application of cando in sidestream nitrogen removal the highest volumetric nitrogen loading rate achieved to date for cando is 0 25 kg n m3 d the maximum loading rate attained for sbr 2 in this study this value is comparable to other sidestream treatment processes such as anammox but needs validation at pilot scale the benefits of cando as a shortcut nitrogen removal process include a reduced aeration requirement savings in reducing equivalents reduction in biosolid production and potential for energy recovery gao et al 2014 a recent stoichiometry study has verified the low biomass yield that results from alternating consumption and storage of organic carbon in cando wang et al 2020 additional cando pilot scale testing is needed now with the benefit of hindsight provided by this study we note that many of the unexpected operational issues that resulted in operational upsets originated in the upstream pilot scale nitritation reactor e g polymer addition centrifuge performance ph control do control this calls for more attention to upstream process control in general performance of the nitritation stage is also an issue common to other shortcut nitrogen removal processes a significant operational cost is the cost of carbon source e g sodium acetate acetic acid for pilot scale testing such costs can potentially be reduced by using primary effluent in full scale applications weißbach et al 2018b such a system needs evaluation at pilot scale a final challenge is low energy recovery of dissolved n2o for example by application of membrane based stripping weißbach et al 2018a this too requires evaluation at pilot scale 4 conclusions a key insight from this work is the finding that the relative duration of anaerobic and anoxic phases is crucial to efficient n2o production especially important is management of pha a key electron storage compound scheduling of nitrite addition to coincide with peak pha accumulation ensures efficient use of reducing equivalents for nitrite reduction to n2o long term operation of bench scale reactors with different anaerobic anoxic schedules enriched for distinctive microorganisms with different patterns of pha accumulation and denitritation shortening of the anaerobic and anoxic phases improved yield and enabled stable production of n2o at both pilot and bench scale declaration of competing interest

18113,the coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando is a two stage process for nitrogen removal and resource recovery in the first ammonia is oxidized to nitrite in an aerobic bioreactor in the second oxidation of polyhydroxyalkanoate pha drives reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide n2o which is stripped for use as a biogas oxidant because ammonia oxidation is well studied tests of cando to date have focused on n2o production in anaerobic anoxic sequencing batch reactors in these reactors nitrogen is provided as nitrite pha is produced from acetate or other dissolved cod and pha oxidation is coupled to n2o production from nitrite in a pilot scale study n2o recovery was affected by cod n ratio total cycle time and relative time periods for pha synthesis and n2o production in follow up bench scale studies different reactor cycle times were used to investigate these operational parameters increasing cod n ratio improved nitrite removal and increased biosolids concentration shortening the anaerobic phase prevented fermentation of pha and improved its utilization efficient pha synthesis and utilization in the anaerobic phase correlated with high n2o production in the anoxic phase shortening the anoxic phase prevented reduction of n2o to n2 by shortening both phases total cycle time was reduced from 24 to 12 h this optimized operation enabled increased biomass concentrations increased n2o yields from 71 to 87 increased n loading rates from 0 1 to 0 25 kg n m3 d and shorter hydraulic residence times from 10 to 2 days long term changes in operational performance for the different bioreactor systems tested were generally similar despite significant differences in microbial community structure long term operation at short anaerobic phases selected for a glycogen accumulating community dominated by a defluviicoccus related strain graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digester centrate denitritation nitrous oxide

last century fowler et al 2013 release of reactive nitrogen from wastewater into natural water bodies can stimulate eutrophication and create oxygen depleted zones selman et al 2008 conventional nitrogen removal processes need significant energy input for aeration require reducing power and generate large amount of waste biosolids for disposal these issues can be addressed through shortcut nitrogen removal processes in which ammonium is oxidized to nitrite and nitrite is reduced to dinitrogen gas n2 with either heterotrophic or autotrophic denitrifiers adopting the nitrogen cycle nomenclature of weißbach et al 2017 nitritation accompanied by heterotrophic denitritation to n2 can decrease aeration requirements by 25 and demand for organic carbon reducing equivalents by 40 hellinga et al 1998 autotrophic denitritation such as anammox can further decrease demand for organic carbon to zero lackner et al 2014 due to process control issues however shortcut nitrogen removal processes can release more nitrous oxide n2o than conventional processes massara et al 2017 the coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando was developed to remove nitrogen from wastewater and produce n2o in a controlled manner for energy recovery scherson et al 2013 2014 the process involves two reactors in the first high concentrations of ammonia typically present in anaerobic digestate are oxidized to nitrite in the second nitrite is reduced to n2o nitrous denitritation advantages of cando over conventional nitrogen removal include 1 a 60 decrease in demand for organic electron donor whether it be wastewater organic matter used to produce methane or purchased organic substrate such as methanol 2 limiting nitrite reduction to n2o thereby decreasing biosolids production by 60 as compared to nitrate reduction to n2 gao et al 2014 and reducing associated costs of transport and disposal and 3 use of n2o as an oxidant for combustion of biogas methane yields more heat δhc 1219 kj mol ch4 than combustion with oxygen δhc 890 kj mol ch4 increasing by 6 7 the power output achieved per unit of methane oxidized in a combustion engine scherson et al 2014 the source of carbon used to provide electrons for nitrous denitritation is flexible a research team at the technical university of munich used multiple dosages of primary effluent as the carbon source for nitrous denitritation weißbach et al 2018b another team at northwestern university used a mixture of acetate and propionate to enrich for denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms enabling simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal gao et al 2017 promising results from bench scale studies led to a cando scale up aiming to 1 evaluate process stability 2 identify potential interferences

digester centrate 1 g no2 n l produced by a pilot scale nitritation reactor treating anaerobic digester centrate 1 5 g tkn l on occasion the nitritation reactor was subject to upsets that carried over to the nitrous denitritation reactor and affected its performance during these upset periods a surrogate nitrified centrate was fed to the nitrous denitritation reactor until process control was re established after completion of the pilot study follow up bench scale studies were initiated to improve and optimize process performance these studies gave deeper insight into process operations and enabled significant improvements in process loading and operational stability 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot scale reactor setup and operation a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a volume of 6 m3 and a total liquid volume of 1 5 m3 was established at delta diablo wastewater treatment plant antioch ca usa the reactor was fed a stock solution of sodium acetate and acetic acid ph 4 0 cod 4 5 g l and effluent from a nitritation reactor treated anaerobic digester centrate east bay municipal utility district and project partners 2017 containing 1 1 g no2 n l or a surrogate nitrified centrate containing 1 g no2 n l scherson et al 2013 reactor ph was maintained at 8 0 by automated addition of hydrochloric acid based on readings from a self cleaning flat ph probe cole parmer il usa in situ probes were installed to monitor concentrations of dissolved reactive nitrogen species a uv vis spectrophotometer s can uv lyser uv austria was used to monitor nitrite and nitrate an industrial clark type sensor unisense denmark was used for dissolved n2o monitoring the pilot scale nitrous denitritation sbr was inoculated with 150 l 10 v v of returned activated sludge from delta diablo then operated for 315 days acetate was added as a pulse at the start of each operational cycle to initiate the anaerobic phase nitrite was added as a pulse at the end of the anaerobic phase to initiate the anoxic phase and air stripping enabled recovery of dissolved n2o at the end of each cycle fig 1 during start up the reactor was operated for 60 days without settling to select for n2o producing microorganisms table s1 the initial cod n input ratio g cod as acetate g n as nitrite was set at five 150 mg cod l and 30 mg n l to concentrate biomass a settle decant step was added before discharge of effluent the cycle time was changed to 24 h and the cod n input ratio was decreased to 3 stable operation began on day 164 period i and the aeration period was extended to 3 h in period ii the duration of the anaerobic phase was reduced to 7 h and remained at that level for the duration of the experiment the pilot reactor experienced two significant perturbations due to upsets in the upstream nitritation reactor on days 61 72 and 107 113 inefficient upstream nitritation resulted in high levels of ammonium and low concentrations of nitrite in the influent to the nitrous denitritation sbr on days 251 257 a process control issue in the upstream nitritation reactor resulted in high concentrations of nitrate in the influent to the nitrous denitritation sbr when these upset periods were detected a surrogate nitrified centrate was fed to the denitritation reactor in lieu of influent from the nitritation reactor this switch in the influent feed enabled operational continuity while the nitritation reactor recovered from process upsets 2 2 bench scale reactor setup and operation to explore the effects of different operational and design variables two 5 l bench scale nitrous denitritation sbrs sbr 1 and sbr 2 each with a total liquid volume of 4 l were fed nitrite rich effluent from a bench scale nitritation sbr that in turn was fed anaerobic digester centrate from delta diablo the nitrite rich effluent contained 1100 mg l no2 n 60 mg l nh4 n 30 mg l no3 n and a soluble cod of 200 mg l the operational cycle was similar to that of the pilot scale reactor with a 21 5 h reaction phase 2 h stripping phase 20 min settle and 10 min of decant during the react phase sbr 1 had a 12 h anaerobic phase and a 9 5 h anoxic phase sbr 2 had an 8 h anaerobic phase and a 13 5 h anoxic phase both reactors were operated at an hrt of 4 days and a solid retention time srt of 60 days a solution of sodium acetate and acetic acid 3 g cod l ph 5 0 was used as the carbon source for denitritation the ph of the both reactors was maintained at 7 5 by automatic addition of 1 m hcl the same decoupled feeding strategy as the pilot scale sbr for acetate and nitrite was used to enrich for n2o producing bacteria in the bench scale reactors 2 3 chemical analysis of water and biomass samples water samples from the pilot scale reactor were filtered through 0 45 μm

using an in situ probe in both the pilot and follow up bench scale studies in the pilot scale reactor n2o in the gas phase was found to be present at levels less than equilibrium and gas mixing was insufficient preventing use of measured n 2 o aq for calculation of n2o conversion efficiencies and yields this issue was corrected in follow up bench scale studies using well mixed reactors and small headspace volumes that were only flushed during periods of stripping independent measurements of gas and liquid phase n2o concentrations confirmed equilibrium conditions within both reactors accordingly n2o conversion efficiencies and yields estimated using henry s constant hn2o 2 4 10 2 m bar 1 are only reported for the bench scale reactors 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term nitrous oxide production performance of the pilot scale reactor and the bench scale reactors was monitored and compared during long term operation in the pilot scale sbr mlvss was stable at 2750 410 mg l and average dissolved n2o at the end of the anoxic phase was 6 3 mg n l occasional overdose of polyamide based coagulant resulted in the release of organic particulates from the upstream centrifuge which passed through the nitritation reactor as a result coagulated organic particulates were transferred into the nitrous denitritation reactor together with nitrite at the end of each anaerobic phase increasing the cod n input ratio while simultaneously loading the reactor with organic carbon and nitrogen preventing the desired decoupling of carbon and nitrogen inputs needed for pha and n2o production scherson et al 2013 2014 gao et al 2017 a settling tank was then added to remove the coagulated solids in the nitrified centrate production of n2o was unstable and an upstream nitrate perturbation days 250 260 likely also contributed to the low n2o yields after switching to a surrogate nitrified centrate feed on day 258 and decreasing the anaerobic period to 7 h n2o production increased dramatically fig s4 and table s1 on day 305 nitrogen loading was doubled to 2 0 kg n m3 d and aqueous n2o concentration further increased to 35 mg n l because of time constraints on the pilot study follow up bench scale studies were performed these studies focused on the impacts of the relative lengths of the anaerobic and anoxic periods the two sbrs were inoculated with the pilot scale reactor biomass and operated with similar start up conditions but with different anaerobic phase durations after 30 days of operation both reactors reached mlvss levels exceeding 3 000 mg l and performance of the two reactors differed dramatically during operation with a 12 h anaerobic phase sbr 1 was similar to the pilot reactor with transient production of n2o fig 2 a the average nitrite removal efficiency was 94 12 n 150 from day 100 250 wildly fluctuating n2o production was observed with average yield below 30 residual nitrite was partly decanted and discharged after settling and partly carried over to the next cycle in sbr 1 to ensure sufficient reducing equivalents were available for nitrite reduction to n2o acetate input was increased while keeping nitrite input constant on day 300 resulting in a cod n input ratio increase from 3 0 to 3 5 improved nitrite removal efficiency 96 2 n 150 was observed from day 300 to day 450 with statistical significance student s t test p 1 25 10 8 after a further increase in cod n ratio n2o production resumed on day 370 but the n2o yield continued to fluctuate sbr 2 was operated for 600 days and achieved stable n2o production during operation with an 8 h anaerobic phase fig 2b after 90 days of startup mlvss levels reached 3000 mg l n2o production was unstable during startup but the rate of nitrogen removal rate was stable at 95 n2o production stabilized after 150 days of operation from day 150 300 the average nitrogen removal rate was 96 6 n 150 with an n2o yield of 70 16 n 45 similarly the input ratio of cod n was increased from 3 0 to 3 5 from day 300 onwards to ensure sufficient electron donor for nitrite removal as a result the average nitrogen removal rate increased to 98 3 n 150 from day 350 500 a statistically significant improvement over days 150 300 student s t test p 1 25 10 8 in addition this change in sbr 2 supported greater biomass accumulation a near doubling of mlvss occurred with measured values approaching 6 000 mg l fig s8 table 1 the elevated biomass levels that resulted from increased cod n input ratios led to an increase in anaerobic acetate uptake from 45 mgcod l h to 114 mgcod l h whereas the specific acetate uptake rates remained constant from 0 015 to 0 018 mgcod ac mgcod vss h this enabled further shortening of the anaerobic phase to 7 h and shortening of the anoxic phase to 4 h decreasing total cycle time to 12 h and enabling an increase in n2o yield to 87 on days 535 600 table 1 compares key operational parameters for the three sbrs in all cases a decrease in anaerobic phase duration resulted in more efficient and stable n2o production after switching to a 12 h cycle with a 4 h anaerobic phase sbr 2 achieved high volumetric nitrogen loading rates 0 25 kg n m3 d with efficient n2o production decreasing the cycle time from 24 h to 12 h resulted in a 50 decrease in hrt i e from 4 days to 2 days 3 2 pha utilization and denitritation polyhydroxyalkanoate pha granules provide the reducing power needed to drive reduction of nitrite to n2o scherson et al 2014 accumulation of pha depends upon the relative rates of pha polymerization and depolymerization arias et al 2013 fig 3 illustrates changes in pha levels for two intensively sampled operational cycles in the pilot reactor for a 11 h anaerobic phase and a total cycle time of 24 h fig 3a pha levels increased for the first 8 h then declined for hours 8 11 likely due to decay during the subsequent 13 h anoxic phase pha levels continued to decrease due to decay and also due to oxidation of phb by nitrite with coupled reduction of nitrite to n2o residual nitrite was partly wasted and partly carried over to the anaerobic phase of the subsequent cycle where the added acetate drove complete denitrification to n2 rather than n2o the observed pha utilization efficiency was 20 gcod gn ratio a very large value reflecting inefficient use of pha for n2o production over many cycles however production and consumption of n2o was observed suggesting that shortening of the anoxic period could limit pha consumption and improve recovery of n2o fig s2 accordingly the anaerobic phase was decreased to 7 h and a pha utilization efficiency of 3 9 gcod pha gn no2 was obtained fig 3b as dissolved n2o levels increased to 13 mg n l the conversion yield of acetate to pha in cod units improved to 70 to maintain a constant cycle time the anoxic phase was extended to 13 5 h under these conditions nitrite removal efficiency increased to 96 but residual nitrite persisted and was carried over to the next operational cycle the impacts of a shortened anaerobic period and a shortened anoxic period were further evaluated and compared over an extended period of operation in bench scale reactors sbr 1 and sbr 2 both reactors were initially operated at the same hrt and cycle time but sbr 1 was subject to a longer anaerobic phase 12 h than sbr 2 8 h then 4 h the extended anaerobic period evaluated in sbr 1 selected for unstable operational performance whereas the shortened anaerobic period evaluated in sbr 2 selected for both a stable community and stable long term performance in sbr 1 three distinct patterns of nitrite consumption were observed fig s3 as the microbial community changed in the first fig s3a nitrite residual from the anoxic phase carried over into the anaerobic phase of the next cycle as in the pilot reactor in the second fig s3b nitrite was reduced sequentially to n2o then n2 in the anoxic phase and these steps were coupled to pha accumulation pha consumption and cell growth in the third fig s3c nitrite residual was eliminated with complete acetate assimilation during the anaerobic phase similar to sbr 2 described below the negative impact of residual nitrite led to unstable n2o production during long term operation of sbr 1 fig 2a in sbr 2 a stable pattern similar to the third pattern of sbr 1 emerged after 200 days of operation fig s3d acetate was incorporated into pha during the anaerobic phase with efficient and stable n2o production in the anoxic phase acetate uptake and pha synthesis was driven by oxidation of glycogen fig 4 a similar study implicated denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms as likely n2o producers zeng et al 2003 the conversion yield of acetate to pha was 93 during the anaerobic phase when nitrite was added at peak pha levels nitrite removal efficiency was 94 and n2o yield reached 74 fig s3d efficient utilization of pha was achieved as the consumption ratio of pha to nitrite reached 2 4 gcod gn n2o was stripped by air and recovered at peak concentration after increasing the cod n input ratio rapid pha accumulation was accompanied by increased biomass concentrations suggesting the feasibility of a shortened anaerobic phase simultaneously though the elongated anoxic phase that resulted after nitrite depletion resulted in further reduction of n2o to n2 decreasing n2o yield before stripping accordingly on day 520 the duration of the anaerobic and the anoxic phases were reduced to 5 h apiece in a 12 h cycle fig 4b n2o yield increased from 43 to 87 and the volumetric loading rate of nitrogen doubled reaching 0 25 kg n m3 d decreasing the operational cycle in sbr 2 to from 24 h to 12 h minimized pha fermentation during the anoxic phase and improved pha utilization efficiency to 2 4 gcod pha gn no2 fig 4 the bench scale testing thus successfully addressed the concern of pha insufficiency encountered during pilot scale testing comparing pha synthesis and utilization for nitrous denitritation from all three systems studied a positive linear correlation was observed between pha synthesized per acetate mol c mol c at the end of anaerobic phase and n2o yield during anoxic phase anova f 1 7 84 78 p 0 001 with an r2 of 0 92 fig 5 minimizing pha fermentation improves the pha ac ratio a gradual increase in n2o production accompanied improved efficiency of carbon storage was shown from pilot scale to bench scale sbr 1 and sbr 2 the linear relationship predicts that as the pha ac ratio approaches 1 7 n2o production from nitrite approaches 100 a similar linear correlation between efficiency of carbon storage as pha and n2o accumulation for mixed heterotrophic denitrifying cultures has been previously reported liu et al 2015 notably the pha ac ratio exceeded one in sbr 2 as the monitored pha included both hb and hv monomers the hv monomers derive from glycogen as expected based upon the known biochemical pathways of gaos a proposed model and experimental observations reported pha ac ratios ranging from 1 65 to 1 91 for gaos filipe et al 2001 zeng et al 2002 this ratio may thus be a good indicator of the relative abundance of denitrifying gaos the efficiency of carbon utilization and capacity for n2o production across systems with different microbial community structures 3 3 mechanisms of n2o production and consumption the timing of nitrite addition had a significant impact on n2o production as shown in fig 3 shortening the anaerobic phase to coincide with peak pha significantly improved n2o production the expression of nirs was observed immediately after nitrite addition fig 3c which exhibited an immediate tenfold increase in transcript abundance when acetate levels decreased to zero reduction of nitrite to n2o was coupled to pha oxidation further reduction of n2o to n2 may have been limited by competition for reducing equivalents or nitrous oxide reductase may have been inhibited due to high levels of inhibitory free nitrous acid fna richardson et al 2009 as nitrite was consumed and fna levels fell from 2 to 0 8 μg n l anthonisen et al 1976 inhibition of nitrous oxide reduction may have been alleviated enabling production of n2 zhou et al 2008 similar observations of cascading denitrification reactions inhibitory intermediates and competition for electrons have been reported especially under electron donor limited conditions pan et al 2013 wang et al 2018 diverse microbial communities were selected by the operating conditions of the nitrous denitritation reactors in the pilot scale reactor bacteria from the families comamonadaceae xanthomonadaceae and zoogloeaceae were enriched and identified by 16s amplicon sequencing a stable community structure established by day 194 coinciding with a stable pattern of n2o production the dominant genus was a diaphorobacter strain woo 2017 d nitroreducens and d polyhydroxybutyrativorans both have the genes required for denitrification and for pha synthesis and degradation tabrez khan and hiraishi 2002 zuo et al 2015 perturbations in the microbial communities correlated with upsets in upstream nitritation and operational changes fig 6 a a significant change in the relative abundance of paracoccus occurred on day 257 likely due to an increase in nitrate in the feed paracoccus denitrificans is a facultative denitrifier possessing both nitrate and nitrite reductase and respiratory nitrate reductase nap is preferentially expressed under carbon or nutrient limiting conditions blaszczyk 1993 sears et al 1997 paracoccus also possesses genes for both pha synthase and depolymerase gao et al 2001 thauera species are heterotrophic denitrifiers philipp and schink 2012 that can accumulate pha in full scale wastewater treatment plants oshiki et al 2008 they became more prevalent when the influent was switched to surrogate nitrified centrate and persisted when the influent was switched back to effluent from the nitritation reactor among the identified n2o producing candidates diaphorobacter possesses nirk genes encoding for nitrite reductase whereas thauera and comamonas possess nirs genes heylen et al 2006 paracoccus has both nirs and nirk genes therefore nirs primers were able to track the expression of nitrite reductase encoding genes in the pilot scale denitritation sbr when its microbial community contained mainly thauera and paracoccus the nirs primer nirscd3af nirsr3cd used in this study has been widely used for pure cultures including paracoccus as well as for environmental samples throbäck et al 2004 kandeler et al 2006 wei et al 2015 the expression of nirk genes on the other hand showed no significant change over time moreover thauera comamonas and paracoccus species were known to have genes encoding for nitrous oxide reductase hoeren et al 1993 liu et al 2013 throbäck et al 2004 they might contribute to reduction of n2o to nitrogen gas during an extended anoxic phase sbr 1 was inoculated with a seed from the pilot scale reactor over its 500 days of operation the bacterial community experienced significant shifts in composition thauera that was likely transferred from the pilot scale sbr dominated sbr 1 on day 351 constituting 43 of the 16s rdna clones fig s5a other potential n2o producing microorganisms including diaphorobacter and paracocus were detected while both sbr 1 and sbr 2 were seeded by the pilot reactor the operational mode in sbr 2 selected against persistence of thauera fig 6b and selected in favor of an uncultured defluviicoccus related strain which comprised a majority of the 16s rdna clones detected fig s5b the relative abundance of the defluviicoccus related strain rhodospirillaceae family was stable at 37 39 for days 494 587 full length 16s rrna clone library results for dominant denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in the sbr showed only 92 similarity to defluviicoccus vanus cluster i fig s7 the closest match with a 99 similarity is to a sequence from an uncultured defluviicoccus clone recently designated as the sole member of cluster iv mcilroy et al 2009 to date none of the defluviicoccus related gaos have genes for complete denitrification cluster i defluviicoccus related gaos were reportedly able to reduce nitrate but not nitrite wang et al 2008 according to a recent metagenomic study wang et al 2014 cluster ii defluviicoccus related gaos reportedly lack dissimilatory denitrification genes addition of nitrite for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is postulated to suppress growth of gaos tayà et al 2013 in this study however defluviicoccus cluster iv were enriched and became dominant and the reactor produced n2o under stable operating conditions it thus appears likely that these organisms are responsible for carbon storage and for nitrous denitritation but additional studies are needed to confirm such phenotype within cluster iv defluviicoccus gaos have been previously implicated in the production of n2o zeng et al 2003 relatively shorter anaerobic phase in sbr 2 enriched for bacteria with more rapid acetate uptake where gao exhibited competitive advantages with glycogen driven acetate uptake and pha synthesis as shown in the nmds plot of fig 7 two distinct clusters reveal that the microbial communities of the pilot scale reactor differed significantly from those of bench scale sbr 2 on a two dimensional ordination stress 0 10 r2 0 94 as expected the inoculum of the pilot scale bioreactor and that of sbr 2 clustered at different locations shifts in community structure of the bench scale reactor after transferring an inoculum from the pilot scale reactor are also evident overlaying the key operational parameters as vectors an increase in the duration of anaerobic phase correlated negatively with n2o yields table s3 moreover the microbial communities in the pilot scale sbr day288 304 and bench scale sbr 2 day103 587 shifted towards clusters with a higher n2o yield likely due to the shortened anaerobic phase and increased nitrogen loading fig 7 other factors not assessed in this study could be associated with the observed shifts in community structure 3 4 application of cando in sidestream nitrogen removal the highest volumetric nitrogen loading rate achieved to date for cando is 0 25 kg n m3 d the maximum loading rate attained for sbr 2 in this study this value is comparable to other sidestream treatment processes such as anammox but needs validation at pilot scale the benefits of cando as a shortcut nitrogen removal process include a reduced aeration requirement savings in reducing equivalents reduction in biosolid production and potential for energy recovery gao et al 2014 a recent stoichiometry study has verified the low biomass yield that results from alternating consumption and storage of organic carbon in cando wang et al 2020 additional cando pilot scale testing is needed now with the benefit of hindsight provided by this study we note that many of the unexpected operational issues that resulted in operational upsets originated in the upstream pilot scale nitritation reactor e g polymer addition centrifuge performance ph control do control this calls for more attention to upstream process control in general performance of the nitritation stage is also an issue common to other shortcut nitrogen removal processes a significant operational cost is the cost of carbon source e g sodium acetate acetic acid for pilot scale testing such costs can potentially be reduced by using primary effluent in full scale applications weißbach et al 2018b such a system needs evaluation at pilot scale a final challenge is low energy recovery of dissolved n2o for example by application of membrane based stripping weißbach et al 2018a this too requires evaluation at pilot scale 4 conclusions a key insight from this work is the finding that the relative duration of anaerobic and anoxic phases is crucial to efficient n2o production especially important is management of pha a key electron storage compound scheduling of nitrite addition to coincide with peak pha accumulation ensures efficient use of reducing equivalents for nitrite reduction to n2o long term operation of bench scale reactors with different anaerobic anoxic schedules enriched for distinctive microorganisms with different patterns of pha accumulation and denitritation shortening of the anaerobic and anoxic phases improved yield and enabled stable production of n2o at both pilot and bench scale declaration of competing interest

18114,ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa as well as complete ammonia oxidizers comammox aerobically catalyze ammonia oxidation which plays essential roles in riverine nitrogen cycle however performances of these ammonia oxidizers in high elevation river sediments have rarely been documented this study investigated the abundance community and activity of ammonia oxidizers in five high elevation rivers of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp comammox were dominant ammonia oxidizers in 23 of studied samples and the clade b was principal comammox type amoa gene abundances of aoa and aob in these high elevation rivers were comparable to those in low elevation rivers however in contrast to most studied low elevation rivers aob amoa gene abundance outnumbered aoa in 92 samples which might be caused by the lower temperature and more intense solar radiation of the qtp potential nitrification rates pnrs ranged from 0 02 to 2 95 nmol n h 1 g 1 dry sediment ammonia concentration was the limiting factor to pnrs at some sites and when ammonia was not limiting the pnr ammonia ratio was greater at higher temperatures there was no apparent variation in ammonia oxidizer community compositions along the elevation gradient due to the high elevation 2687 to 4223 m of our entire study area however compared with low elevation rivers the lower temperature huge diurnal temperature change and lower nutrient conditions in the qtp rivers shaped distinctive communities for ammonia oxidizers the unique community characteristics were significantly correlated to pnrs these results suggest that ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation rivers have adapted to high elevation conditions more research should be conducted to study their adaptation mechanisms and their roles in riverine nitrogen cycle graphical abstract image 1 keywords the qinghai tibet plateau high elevation rivers ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa comammox nitrospira cold adaptation distance decay 1 introduction nitrification is the biological oxidation of ammonia into nitrate and plays essential roles in the global nitrogen and carbon cycles alves et al 2018 ammonia oxidation is the first and rate limiting step in nitrification and has long been thought to be exclusively mediated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob stahl and de la torre 2012 however this perception was overturned with the isolation and characterization of the first ammonia oxidizing archaeon nitrosopumilus maritimus in 2005 demonstrating that certain archaeon is also capable of oxidizing ammonia into nitrite könneke et al 2005 since then ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa have been observed to be abundantly present in natural systems and play primary roles in the nitrification of many terrestrial marine and geothermal environments de la torre et al 2008 francis et al 2005 leininger et al 2006 martens habbena et al 2015 notably recent research demonstrates that several nitrospira species the long recognized nitrite oxidizers can accomplish complete ammonia oxidation nh3 no3 daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 subsequent molecular surveys indicated the widespread presence of complete ammonia oxidizers comammox in many terrestrial habitats xia et al 2018a compared with other ecosystems less research has been conducted on aerobic ammonia oxidizers in river systems according to public databases only approximately 5 4 of existing aoa sequences were attributed to river and lake systems biller et al 2012 comammox have rarely been involved in existing studies on ammonia oxidizers of river systems moreover previous studies on riverine ammonia oxidizers mainly focused on low elevation regions and rarely explored high elevation habitats xia et al 2018b such a situation does not match the significance of nitrification in high elevation rivers baron et al 2009 that are the world s water towers and the sources for over 50 of the global rivers diaz et al 2003 in general substrate concentration and ph are considered as key environmental factors that significantly affect ammonia oxidizer communities and nitrification in natural environments gubry rangin et al 2011 martens habbena et al 2009 although these factors appear to be not tightly correlated to elevation they may also be significant in controlling the biogeography and activity of ammonia oxidizers in high elevation habitats besides thermodynamic properties of aoa are found to be different from those of aob stahl and de la torre 2012 taylor et al 2017 and varied responses to temperature change are also observed among different aoa and aob phylotypes avrahami et al 2003 horak et al 2013 qin et al 2015 for example according to amoa gene surveys nitrosospira cluster 3a like aob is dominant at high temperatures but cluster 1 represents the major aob population at low temperatures avrahami et al 2003 these differences could allow ammonia oxidizers to adapt to distinct habitats with a wide range of temperatures stahl and de la torre 2012 including the polar systems and antarctic oceans with subzero temperatures alves et al 2013 kalanetra et al 2009 moreover high elevation regions are characterized by intensive solar radiation and uv intensity blumthaler et al 1997 that have stronger inhibitory effects on the activity of aoa than aob horak et al 2018 it has been shown that freshwater aoa species were especially sensitive to short wavelength light while aob were much less affected french et al 2012 however there is as yet little understanding of how these elevation related environmental variables might collectively affect the distribution community and activity of ammonia oxidizes in river systems at high elevations the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is the highest and most extensive highland in the world its average elevation is higher than 4000 m above sea level and the mean annual air temperature is 1 7 c xia et al 2019 in this study we investigated the abundance and diversity of aoa aob and comammox amoa genes which infers the functional role of ammonia oxidizer communities in sediments from five rivers along an elevation gradient of the qtp ammonia oxidation rates were also determined to evaluate the nitrification activity of ammonia oxidizers in high elevation river sediments finally we examined the relationships between ammonia oxidizer phylotypes ammonia oxidation rates and key environmental variables across high elevation and low elevation river sediments to identify major factors that control the community composition and activity of ammonia oxidizer in river systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and physicochemical property analysis elevation of our study area ranges from 2687 to 4223 m and the latitude lies between 29 18 and 34 94 n in this study sampling work of the yellow river source region was conducted twice during july 2016 summer and may 2017 spring respectively and the other four rivers were sampled during july 2016 ten sampling sites were selected in the yellow river source region of which seven sites were in the main channel and the others were in tributaries fig 1 there were two sampling sites in both the yarlung zangbo river and the nu river and one sampling site was selected in each of the remaining two rivers overall a total of 26 samples were collected in these five rivers during each sampling period triplicate surface sediment 0 10 cm samples were collected at each site using 100 ml syringes part of each sample was temporarily stored at 15 c in a vehicle mounted refrigerator fyl ys 30l china and then stored at 80 c in the laboratory for further dna extraction sediment samples used for nitrification rate analysis were transported to the laboratory on ice within 72 h elevation latitude longitude and air pressure of sampling sites were recorded and temperature of corresponding overlying water was measured the solar radiation intensity was estimated based on observations from meteorological stations on the qtp according to the china meteorological administration in the laboratory sediment samples were carefully and adequately homogenized before further analysis nh4 n and nox no2 no3 n were extracted with 1m kcl at a ratio of 1 5 wt wt wet sediment kcl solution and then their concentrations were determined colorimetrically using an autoanalyzer 3 bran luebbe france organic carbon and total nitrogen contents were determined with methods employed in our previous research xia et al 2019 sedimentary organic nitrogen son content was obtained by subtracting inorganic nitrogen nh4 nox from total nitrogen content sediment ph was measured using a mettler toledo sg23 sevengo duo ph meter with the sediment water ratio wt wt being 1 5 particle size distributions of sediment samples were analyzed with a microtrac s3500 laser particles size analyzer montgomeryville pa usa 2 2 dna extraction and quantification of amoa genes with qpcr and mpn pcr methods for each sample approximately 350 mg of homogenized wet sediment was used for dna extraction with fastdna spin kit for soil qbiogene carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions primer pairs arch amoaf arch amoar francis et al 2005 and amoa 1f amoa 1r rotthauwe et al 1997 were respectively used to estimate aoa and aob amoa gene abundances through qpcr assays the amplification was performed in triplicate on a c1000 thermal cycler bio rad ca usa more information on primer pairs and amplification conditions is available in table s1 melting curve analysis was executed at the end of each qpcr run to check the specificity of amplification products to construct the standard curve a ten fold dilution series of known amount of plasmids containing amoa genes were used as the standard standard curves for archaeal and bacterial amoa genes spanned from 1 05 102 to 1 05 107 copies and from 1 24 102 to 1 24 107 copies per assay respectively amplification efficiencies ranged from 85 2 to 90 3 for archaeal amoa gene and from 90 2 to 90 4 for bacterial amoa gene and r 2 of all amplifications were higher than 98 comammox species formed two monophyletic sister clades which are referred to as clade a com a and clade b com b and could be retrieved by primer pairs of comaa 244f comaa 659r and comab 244f comab 659r respectively pjevac et al 2017 however these primer pairs produced non specific amplicons in our qpcr experiments to avoid such a quantification error most probable number mpn pcr method was employed to estimate com a and com b amoa gene abundances briefly extracted dna was serially diluted by a factor of 10 and then amplified in triplicate available information on reaction mixtures and amplification conditions are shown in table s1 five μl of the amplicons was visualized on agarose gels 1 tae stained with gold view nucleic acid stain sbs genetech china presences of dna bands corresponding to the expected size were considered as positive results and negative controls without dna template were added to check potential dna contamination finally the comammox amoa gene abundance was enumerated using the cochran tables leininger et al 2006 in the meanwhile aoa and aob abundances of three randomly selected samples were also determined using the mpn pcr method it was found that both abundances of aoa and aob determined through qpcr were approximately 100 times higher than those through mpn pcr therefore when compared with comammox abundance both abundances of aoa and aob were divided by 100 herein the abundance comparison was based on amoa gene copies 2 3 amplification sequencing and sequence analysis of aoa and aob amoa genes duplicate aoa and aob amoa gene amplicons were obtained from each selected sampling site using the afore mentioned primer pairs then these amplicons were sequenced by an illumina miseq pe300 sequencing platform san diego ca usa detailed information on the sites subjected to sequencing analysis is shown in table 1 sequence reads with the same barcode were assigned to each corresponding sample the reads were pre processed and merged by trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 and flash salzberg and magoč 2011 the uparse pipeline implementing usearch v10 edgar 2013 was used for otu table construction sequences were first inputted into the uparse pipeline for dereplication and discard of singletons then the unique sequences were de novo clustered with a 95 identify threshold and the chimeras were simultaneously removed finally the uparse was employed to map all sequences to the representative otu sequences at a 95 identity threshold and the sequences failing to map were discarded subsequently each otu was assigned to a specific taxonomy using reference nucleotide data sets generated from the fungene repository fish et al 2013 all sequences reported in this study were deposited in ncbi short read archive sra under the bioproject accession number prjna556763 2 4 determination of potential nitrification rates pnrs for sediment samples when sediment samples arrived at our laboratory pnrs were determined within 24 h using a chlorate inhibition method briefly 5 g of fresh sediment was added into a series of 120 ml serum vials containing 20 ml phosphate buffer solution nacl 8 0 g l 1 kcl 0 2 g l 1 na2hpo4 0 2 g l 1 and nah2po4 0 2 g l 1 ph 7 4 zhou et al 2015 then the serum vials were amended with nh4cl to a final concentration of 0 1 mg n l 1 which was close to the ammonia ammonia ammonium if not otherwise indicated concentration in sediment porewater data not shown here potassium chlorate was added into serum vials with the final concentration being 10 mm to inhibit the oxidation of nitrite into nitrate kurola et al 2005 and then these vials were capped by silicone rubber septa and crimp sealed with aluminum closures subsequently a specific volume of headspace air was drawn out of the serum vials with syringes to simulate the corresponding in situ air pressures sterile sediment was simultaneously incubated to deduct abiotic ammonia oxidation these vials were incubated in the dark at in situ temperature for 0 25 h 1 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h with the shaking speed of 190 rpm and they were performed in triplicate produced nitrite was extracted with 5 ml of 2m kcl solution at each sampling point and was determined with the autoanalyzer 3 pnrs were calculated from the linear increase of no2 in suspensions over the whole incubation period as shown in fig s1 2 5 statistical analysis observed otu richness and shannon index for aoa and aob communities were calculated with mothur software schloss et al 2009 based on a 95 similarity alves et al 2018 taxonomies of the representative otu sequences were further determined by constructing phylogenetic trees using mega v7 0 stecher et al 2016 with reference sequences obtained from the ncbi database geographic distances between sampling sites were calculated by r package of geosphere v1 5 7 hijmans et al 2017 environmental factors were pre filtered through vif cca function of the vegan package v2 5 4 oksanen et al 2013 and the variables with vif 5 were removed to avoid the collinearity issues in this study after vif cca filtration temperature ph son content c n ratio silt proportion and coarse sand proportion were retained then environmental distance matrix and bray curtis dissimilarity matrixes of aoa and aob communities were calculated for the mantel analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova using the vegan package the mantel analysis and permanova were conducted to quantify the degree to which local environmental and spatial factors could explain the bray curtis distances among samples the dissimilarities of aoa and aob communities between our studied high elevation rivers and the reported low elevation rivers as well as other cold environments were exhibited by principal coordinates analysis pcoa plots based on weighted unifrac distances calculated with the mothur software spearman correlation and paired sample t tests were conducted with the statistical product and service solutions 21 0 software spss at significance level of p 0 05 spearman correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between environmental factors and abundances community diversities and community compositions of ammonia oxidizers paired sample t tests were used to statistically evaluate differences in physicochemical factors ammonia oxidizer abundance alpha diversity index and pnr of the yellow river source region between the summer and spring effects of local environmental and spatial factors elevation and latitude on distribution of ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation rivers were explored with redundancy analysis rda in canoco version 4 5 for windows braak and smilauer 2002 with a monte carlo test with 999 permutations and unrestricted permutations under a reduced model 3 results 3 1 physicochemical properties of the sediment samples during our sampling periods water temperature of sampling sites ranged from 7 2 to 19 9 c table s2 which was significantly correlated to elevation r 0 46 p 0 05 n 26 but not to latitude p 0 143 n 26 table s3 sediment samples were under alkaline conditions and their ph values fluctuated from 7 15 to 9 44 average ammonia ammonia ammonium and nox no2 no3 concentrations were 11 95 and 0 69 mg n kg 1 dry sediment respectively son content varied over a wide range between 0 09 and 2 53 g n kg 1 dry sediment which was significantly correlated with ammonia concentration and ph values r 0 80 and 0 47 respectively p 0 05 n 26 sediment samples were mainly composed of coarse particles with sand grains 20 2000 μm accounting for 50 100 no significant relationship was found between physicochemical properties of sediment samples and elevation within our study area p 0 2 n 26 additionally no significant seasonal fluctuation in the sediment physicochemical properties was found in the yellow river source region p 0 05 n 20 3 2 abundance of ammonia oxidizers in the sediment samples according to the qpcr assay aoa amoa gene abundance ranged from 2 23 104 to 4 95 107 copies g 1 dry sediment and aob amoa gene abundance lay between 4 32 104 and 1 31 108 copies g 1 dry sediment fig 2 a aob amoa gene abundance was higher than aoa copies g 1 dry sediment in 24 out of all 26 samples with aob amoa aoa amoa gene abundance ratios ranging from 0 9 to 45 6 according to mpn pcr methods com a and com b were found in 10 and 20 sediment samples respectively fig 2b with the highest comammox amoa gene abundance com a plus com b reaching 2 02 105 copies g 1 dry sediment comammox were dominant ammonia oxidizers in 6 of the 26 samples when aoa and aob amoa gene abundances were corrected through dividing by 100 to ameliorate biases introduced by different quantification methods fig 2c among these sediment samples none of ammonia oxidizer amoa gene abundance was significantly correlated with elevation and neither were their amoa gene abundance ratios aob aoa ratios or comammox aoa aob ratios table s3 according to the rda results fig s2 com a was isolated from the other three types of ammonia oxidizers in the sediment suggesting a unique environmental niche for such ammonia oxidizers son content ph and particle size distribution rather than water temperature exerted marked effects on the abundance of ammonia oxidizers in our study area these marked effects were further supported by results of the spearman correlation analysis table s3 likewise this analysis indicated that none of ammonia oxidizer abundance was significantly correlated with temperature table s3 in contrast aob aoa ratios significantly decreased with increasing temperature but no significant relationship was found between comammox aoa aob ratios and temperature 3 3 taxonomic classification and alpha diversities of aoa and aob communities to avoid the biases introduced by sequencing depth the obtained aoa and aob amoa gene libraries were resampled with the attainment of a maximal number of reads finally a total of 9393 aoa and 5926 aob amoa sequences were retained for each sample based on a 95 similarity 62 and 106 unique amoa otus were obtained for aoa and aob communities respectively with their library coverages in each sample being higher than 99 9 table 1 according to the amoa phylogenetic trees fig s3a the majority 91 6 of aoa sequences were affiliated to the nitrososphaera cluster followed by nitrosopumilus 8 3 and nitrosotalea 0 1 table s4 the dominant aob amoa otu types were affiliated to 9 clusters within the nitrosospira clade fig s3b comprising 95 3 of all aob amoa sequences nitrosospira like aob were mainly composed of cluster 3b 34 1 and cluster 9 33 5 table s5 while cluster 6 3 0 accounted for the largest proportion in the nitrosomonas clade aoa community compositions were significantly linked to ph and son content in the sediment samples table s6 and fig s4 either lower ph or higher son content facilitated a greater proportion of nitrososphaera like aoa moreover many aob community compositions were also evidently correlated to son content fig s5a abundance of the cluster c3b increased with son content fig s5b in contrast both abundances of c6 and c9 clusters significantly decreased with increasing son content figs s5c d however unlike aoa community no apparent differentiation in aob community was observed with varying ph values additionally among the sampling sites no marked differentiation in aoa and aob community compositions was observed along the elevation or temperature gradient observed amoa otu richness ranged from 16 to 45 per sample for aoa community and from 11 to 48 per sample for aob community table 1 and fig s6 both amoa otu richness and shannon index of aoa community significantly decreased with higher elevation table s7 fig 3 a and fig 3c along the latitude gradient these indices displayed significant unimodal patterns with their minimum values at the mid latitudes of our study region fig 3b and d in addition there was a general trend albeit not statistically significant p 0 09 toward lower aob amoa otu richness at higher elevations fig 3e like aoa the minimal aob otu richness along the latitude gradient was also observed at the mid latitudes fig 3f different from aoa table s7 aob otu richness significantly increased with ammonia and son contents fig 3g and h and table s8 moreover within our study area neither aoa nor aob community otu richness was significantly related to water temperature p 0 05 3 4 dissimilarities of aoa and aob communities among the sediment samples pcoa for aoa and aob community dissimilarities was conducted based on bray curtis distances the first two axes of pcoa plots explained 62 8 and 42 6 of the aoa and aob community variations respectively fig 4 a and b axis 1 of aoa pcoa explained 38

pearson r 0 69 p 0 01 fig 4e these findings were in agreement with the results of the permanova which revealed that son content and ph were the most explanatory factors for aoa community dissimilarities r2 0 20 and r2 0 19 respectively table 2 for aob community pcoa axis 1 was significantly correlated with son and ph pearson r 0 59 and 0 42 respectively p 0 05 fig 4d and f similarly the results of the permanova also indicated that son appeared to have the most significant explanations for aob community dissimilarities r2 0 12 p 0 05 other than local environmental factors negative relationships were found between elevation distances and bray curtis dissimilarity matrixes of aoa and aob communities according to the mantel test p 0 05 table s9 different from geographic distances the elevational distance matrix was not significantly correlated with the environmental factor matrix additionally when controlling for effects of water temperature in the partial mantel test aoa and aob community similarities still significantly decreased with increasing elevation distances p 0 05 moreover when the whole data was separated into different seasons similarities of aoa and aob communities were significantly decreased with increasing geographic distances no matter in spring or summer fig s7 this was further confirmed by results of the mantel test in summer r 0 28 p 0 013 for aoa r 0 24 p 0 0213 for aob and spring r 0 84 p 0 001 for aoa r 0 71 p 0 004 for aob 3 5 pnrs in the sediment samples pnrs in the five high elevation rivers ranged from 0 02 to 2 95 nmol n h 1 g 1 dry sediment fig 5 pnrs in the yellow river source region were significantly higher in summer 1 18 nmol n g 1 h 1 on average than those in spring 0 22 nmol n g 1 h 1 p 0 01 among the studied samples no significant variation was found for pnrs along the elevation or latitude gradient p 0 10 pnrs were significantly correlated with ph ammonia concentration and son content r 0 65 0 48 and 0 45 respectively table s3 moreover pnrs were significantly increased with increasing in aoa and aob amoa gene abundances p 0 01 no significant relationship was observed between comammox abundance and pnrs furthermore pnrs were apparently correlated to axis 1 p 0 06 and axis 2 p 0 05 values of the aoa community dissimilarity pcoa fig s8 and the pnr distance matrix was significantly linked to bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of aoa community according to results of the mantel test r 0 22 p 0 034 n 20 pnrs were also positively correlated to the total abundance of aob nitrosospira cluster 1 and cluster 4 as well as the respective abundance of cluster 3b and cluster 9 fig s9 4 discussion 4 1 unique community structures of ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation river sediments there was no apparent difference in ammonia oxidizer community compositions along the elevation gradient table s4 and table s5 due to the high elevation 2687 to 4223 m of our entire study area however when the data of low elevation rivers 800 m was considered we found marked difference in the major ammonia oxidizer populations between high elevation and low elevation rivers for example nitrososphaera like aoa overwhelmingly dominated in the five high elevation rivers and their relative proportions were much higher than those in low elevation rivers elevation is 40 m table s10 table s11 in contrast the relative abundance of nitrosopumilus aoa were higher in low elevation rivers than the five high elevation rivers table s11 and fig s10 low elevation rivers with relatively lower proportions of nitrosopumilus such as the tiaoxi river 13 0 table s11 were more closely clustered with the five high elevation rivers 8 0 in the pcoa plot fig 6 a compared with aoa aob community in the five high elevation rivers was more distinct from that in low elevation rivers fig 6b nitrosospira like aob were most abundant in the qtp river sediments and within the nitrosospira clade cluster 3b 34 1 and cluster 9 33 5 were the two most dominant groups table s5 in contrast their relative proportions were much lower in low elevation rivers cluster 3b 4 4 and cluster 9 8 7 table s12 it has been reported that nitrosospira amoa cluster 9 could only be detected in habitats with low ammonia concentrations avrahami et al 2003 in this study its relative proportion was much higher than nitrosomonas amoa cluster 6 2 98 another oligotrophic aob group koops et al 2006 that was more abundant in low elevation rivers table s12 nitrosospira cluster 1 and cluster 4 that totally accounted for 18 5 of all aob amoa sequences these two lineages were grouped with known psychrophilic aob species fig s3b that have been reported to be prevalent at 4 10 c but completely disappear at higher temperatures avrahami et al 2003 urakawa et al 2015 these psychrophilic populations predominated the coeur d alene river with elevation of 800 m and temperature of 5 6 c 97 3 table s12 in contrast their relative abundance was much lower in other low elevation river sediments 0 6 5 elevation 40 m table s12 4 2 factors affecting community structures and distribution patterns of ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation river sediments ph ammonia concentration and the factors related to elevation jointly shaped the unique community structures for aoa and aob in the five high elevation rivers it might be the alkaline sediment condition that allows nitrososphaera like aoa to be the dominant aoa group in this study just as observed in previous research alves et al 2018 higher proportions of nitrososphaera in the five high elevation rivers than low elevation rivers might benefit from the cold condition of the qtp it has been reported that some species of nitrososphaera have higher abundance at lower temperatures tourna et al 2008 as for aob community the dominance of cluster 3b table s5 might partially benefit from its strong tolerance to temperature variation avrahami et al 2003 the rivers in the qtp are generally characterized by great diurnal temperature variations besides species of cluster 3b could immediately regain their activity after addition of fresh ammonium to a starved culture bollmann et al 2005 this characteristic might also contribute to its dominance in these high elevation rivers that suffer from long frozen periods and thus induced fluctuating ammonia availability furthermore increasing elevation distance between sampling sites significantly decreased corresponding community similarities of aoa and aob table s9 such an elevational influence was more possibly explained by its induced physical isolation of sampling sites and subsequently incurred dispersal limitation for aoa and aob rather than the effects of environmental changes induced by elevation variation table s9 that is this is more related to the possibility that past divergence and diversification of microbial communities are inherited by the genetic isolation due to spatial separation much similar to the roles of geographic distance in ammonia oxidizer community variations of paddy soils hu et al 2015 this is the first report regarding the distance decay pattern for community similarity of ammonia oxidizers in rivers sediments com b abundance was higher than com a in at least 66 of sediment samples in these high elevation rivers fig 2b in this study dominance of com a was mainly observed under colder conditions of the spring fig 2b combined with the dominance of com b in low elevation rivers xia et al 2018a this suggests that temperature potentially played significant roles in the niche separation of these two comammox groups regarding aoa and aob it is widely accepted that aoa are generally predominant in low nutrient environments while aob grow faster under conditions with high ammonia concentration martens habbena et al 2009 aoa amoa gene abundance was found to be higher than aob in the sediment of several chinese rivers zhou et al 2015 and the santa fe river kim et al 2016a in this study sedimentary ammonia concentration 0 92 47 6 mg n kg 1 was lower than or within its ranges 2 5 79 3 mg n kg 1 of the afore mentioned rivers therefore it could be expected that aoa would also be the dominant ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation rivers however contrary to our expectation aob amoa gene abundance outnumbered aoa in 92 samples such a discrepancy could partially result from the cold condition in the qtp because aob aoa ratios significantly decreased with increasing temperature however it has been shown that aoa are the dominant ammonia oxidizers in many other cold environments at low elevations such as arctic soils alves et al 2013 and antarctic coastal waters kalanetra et al 2009 the disparity between this and previous studies suggests that additional characteristics specific to high elevation habitats play an important role in shaping ammonia oxidizing population structure one key feature of the high elevation regions is enhanced solar radiation and uv intensity blumthaler et al 1997 solar radiation intensity of our sampling sites ranged from 21 1 to 25 7 mj m 2 d 1 positively linked to elevation p 0 05 n 26 zhang et al 2019 intense solar radiation has stronger inhibitory effects on the activity of aoa than aob horak et al 2018 notably it has been shown that freshwater aoa species were especially sensitive to short wavelength light while aob were much less affected french et al 2012 in addition the activity of some aoa populations was also found to be affected by the light induced oxidative stresses kim et al 2016b tolar et al 2016 although sediment environment in most cases is not directly exposed to sunlight suspended particles in the overlying water as the main source of aquatic sediments tend to suffer from strong solar radiation at high elevations moreover some research has demonstrated that aob activity would recover from solar radiation inhibition in the dark environment while only partial recovery was observed for aoa merbt et al 2012 this indicates that when aoa on suspended particles finally settled in the sediment environment inhibition effects of solar radiation on their activities would last thus it is attempting to speculate that the lower relative abundance of aoa in high elevation aquatic systems is associated with their sensitivity to intense solar radiation however the isolation and characterization of additional ammonia oxidizers representing ecotypes from high elevation habitats will be essential to further explore how these environmental factors related to their physiology 4 3 comparison of the pnrs of this study with those in low elevation river sediments although both aoa and aob amoa gene abundances were comparable between high elevation and low elevation river sediments table s13 average pnr 0 55 nmol n h 1 g 1 in the five high elevation river sediments was much lower than that in low elevation river sediments such as the santa fe river 3 87 nmol n h 1 g 1 kim et al 2016a and several chinese rivers approximately 2 30 nmol n h 1 g 1 zhou et al 2015 those pnr measurements in low elevation river sediments used nh4 incubation methods where a large amount of nh4 was added to a sample for example the amended ammonia concentration in the santa fe river was 46 7 mg l 1 kim et al 2016a under ammonia limiting conditions the nh4 incubation method would increase the pnr of the sample by the addition of an excessive amount of substrate as a consequence overestimating the in situ rate the k m half saturation constant values of terrestrial aoa and aob species 5 100 μm total ammonia kits et al 2017 are comparable to the low end of ammonia concentrations in our sampling sties 65 μm suggesting that aoa may be ammonia limited at these in situ concentrations thus a low ammonia concentration 100 μg n l 1 that was within its in situ concentration range in sediment porewater was amended for pnr measurement in this study in contrast many published pnrs in low elevation river sediments with excessive additions of substrate are likely overestimates another possible source of error in experimentally determined pnr originates from the difference between the in situ temperature and the incubation temperature for pnr measurement the typical q10 values of aoa isolates are in the range of 2 3 qin et al 2014 and it has been shown that some natural assemblages of ammonia oxidizers are sensitive to temperature variation with the q10 values between 1 7 and 3 4 horak et al 2018 thus in order to avoid the possible biases induced by the effect of incubation temperature all samples for pnr measurement were incubated under in situ temperatures in this study the relationships between pnr and ammonia concentration and temperature reveal that both these two key environmental variables influenced the pnrs in the five high elevation rivers fig 7 when ammonia concentration was relatively low 7 2 mg kg 1 the increased temperature did not accelerate the pnr fig 7 suggesting that nitrification activity was mainly controlled by substrate availability in ammonia limited area when ammonia is not limiting positive linear correlations between pnr and ammonia concentration p 0 05 were found in high elevation river sediments and these correlation slopes pnr nh4 ratios were markedly affected by temperature fig 7 in the low temperature sites average t 13 2 c we found that despite the large difference between the highest and lowest ammonia concentrations 45 mg n kg 1 there was only a marginal increase in the pnrs in contrast pnrs appeared to be much more sensitive to ammonia concentration variation in the high temperature sites average t 17 1 c moreover the highest pnrs 2 0 3 0 nmol n g 1 h 1 in the five high elevation rivers fig 7 were comparable with those in the santa fe river kim et al 2016a and in several chinese rivers zhou et al 2015 the seasonal variations in nitrification were investigated in the yellow river source region significantly higher pnrs were observed in the summer than in the spring p 0 01 despite the comparable or even higher ammonia concentrations were available in spring indicating that temperature rather than substrate concentration exerts major control on pnrs in this river furthermore just as observed in arctic soils alves et al 2013 pnrs in the five high elevation rivers were significantly affected by community structures of ammonia oxidizers fig s8 and fig s9 as for aob community both abundances of its two most principal groups nitrospira cluster 3b and cluster 9 were significantly correlated to pnrs figs s9a and s9c moreover pnrs increased with elevated abundance of the psychrophilic group nitrospira cluster 1 and cluster 4 fig s9b as discussed above it was mainly the three groups that incurred evident dissimilarities in aob community between the five high elevation rivers and low elevation ones furthermore aoa community dissimilarities were significantly correlated to pnrs fig s8 in summary these results together indicate the potential adaptation of ammonia oxidizers in river systems to high elevation conditions of the qtp 5 conclusions performances of aoa aob and comammox in high elevation rivers are of significance to the nitrification in these rivers however related studies are much scarce this study explored the abundance community and activity of ammonia oxidizes in five high elevation rivers of the qtp several conclusions can be drawn as follows compared with low elevation rivers the lower nutrient colder environments and more intense solar radiation conditions in the qtp rivers shaped distinctive community compositions and distribution patterns for ammonia oxidizers moreover ammonia concentration and temperature markedly affected the potential nitrification rates pnrs no apparent variation in ammonia oxidizer community compositions was observed along the elevation gradient due to the high elevation of our entire study area however increasing elevation distance between sampling sites significantly decreased community similarities of aoa and aob such an effect was mainly caused by the dispersal limitation due to physical isolation in these high elevation rivers the unique community structures of ammonia oxidizers were significantly correlated to pnrs under conditions with higher temperatures and ammonia concentrations ammonia oxidizers had comparable nitrification activity in the qtp rivers with those in low elevation rivers these results suggest that these ammonia oxidizers potentially have adapted to high elevation conditions of the qtp further research should be conducted to study the roles of ammonia oxidizers in the nitrogen cycle of this zone moreover under global climate warming the community structures and activity of ammonia oxidizers in high elevation rivers might change which deserves a further study declaration of competing interest the

18114,ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa as well as complete ammonia oxidizers comammox aerobically catalyze ammonia oxidation which plays essential roles in riverine nitrogen cycle however performances of these ammonia oxidizers in high elevation river sediments have rarely been documented this study investigated the abundance community and activity of ammonia oxidizers in five high elevation rivers of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp comammox were dominant ammonia oxidizers in 23 of studied samples and the clade b was principal comammox type amoa gene abundances of aoa and aob in these high elevation rivers were comparable to those in low elevation rivers however in contrast to most studied low elevation rivers aob amoa gene abundance outnumbered aoa in 92 samples which might be caused by the lower temperature and more intense solar radiation of the qtp potential nitrification rates pnrs ranged from 0 02 to 2 95 nmol n h 1 g 1 dry sediment ammonia concentration was the limiting factor to pnrs at some sites and when ammonia was not limiting the pnr ammonia ratio was greater at higher temperatures there was no apparent variation in ammonia oxidizer community compositions along the elevation gradient due to the high elevation 2687 to 4223 m of our entire study area however compared with low elevation rivers the lower temperature huge diurnal temperature change and lower nutrient conditions in the qtp rivers shaped distinctive communities for ammonia oxidizers the unique community characteristics were significantly correlated to pnrs these results suggest that ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation rivers have adapted to high elevation conditions more research should be conducted to study their adaptation mechanisms and their roles in riverine nitrogen cycle graphical abstract image 1 keywords the qinghai tibet plateau high elevation rivers ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa comammox nitrospira cold adaptation distance decay 1 introduction nitrification is the biological oxidation of ammonia into nitrate and plays essential roles in the global nitrogen and carbon cycles alves et al 2018 ammonia oxidation is the first and rate limiting step in nitrification and has long been thought to be exclusively mediated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob stahl and de la torre 2012 however this perception was overturned with the isolation and characterization of the first ammonia oxidizing archaeon nitrosopumilus maritimus in 2005 demonstrating that certain archaeon is also capable of oxidizing ammonia into nitrite könneke et al 2005 since then ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa have been observed to be abundantly present in natural systems and play primary roles in the nitrification of many terrestrial marine and geothermal environments de la torre et al 2008 francis et al 2005 leininger et al 2006 martens habbena et al 2015 notably recent research demonstrates that several nitrospira species the long recognized nitrite oxidizers can accomplish complete ammonia oxidation nh3 no3 daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 subsequent molecular surveys indicated the widespread presence of complete ammonia oxidizers comammox in many terrestrial habitats xia et al 2018a compared with other ecosystems less research has been conducted on aerobic ammonia oxidizers in river systems according to public databases only approximately 5 4 of existing aoa sequences were attributed to river and lake systems biller et al 2012 comammox have rarely been involved in existing studies on ammonia oxidizers of river systems moreover previous studies on riverine ammonia oxidizers mainly focused on low elevation regions and rarely explored high elevation habitats xia et al 2018b such a situation does not match the significance of nitrification in high elevation rivers baron et al 2009 that are the world s water towers and the sources for over 50 of the global rivers diaz et al 2003 in general substrate concentration and ph are considered as key environmental factors that significantly affect ammonia oxidizer communities and nitrification in natural environments gubry rangin et al 2011 martens habbena et al 2009 although these factors appear to be not tightly correlated to elevation they may also be significant in controlling the biogeography and activity of ammonia oxidizers in high elevation habitats besides thermodynamic properties of aoa are found to be different from those of aob stahl and de la torre 2012 taylor et al 2017 and varied responses to temperature change are also observed among different aoa and aob phylotypes avrahami et al 2003 horak et al 2013 qin et al 2015 for example according to amoa gene surveys nitrosospira cluster 3a like aob is dominant at high temperatures but cluster 1 represents the major aob population at low temperatures avrahami et al 2003 these differences could allow ammonia oxidizers to adapt to distinct habitats with a wide range of temperatures stahl and de la torre 2012 including the polar systems and antarctic oceans with subzero temperatures alves et al 2013 kalanetra et al 2009 moreover high elevation regions are characterized by intensive solar radiation and uv intensity blumthaler et al 1997 that have stronger inhibitory effects on the activity of aoa than aob horak et al 2018 it has been shown that freshwater aoa species were especially sensitive to short wavelength light while aob were much less affected french et al 2012 however there is as yet little understanding of how these elevation related environmental variables might collectively affect the distribution community and activity of ammonia oxidizes in river systems at high elevations the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is the highest and most extensive highland in the world its average elevation is higher than 4000 m above sea level and the mean annual air temperature is 1 7 c xia et al 2019 in this study we investigated the abundance and diversity of aoa aob and comammox amoa genes which infers the functional role of ammonia oxidizer communities in sediments from five rivers along an elevation gradient of the qtp ammonia oxidation rates were also determined to evaluate the nitrification activity of ammonia oxidizers in high elevation river sediments finally we examined the relationships between ammonia oxidizer phylotypes ammonia oxidation rates and key environmental variables across high elevation and low elevation river sediments to identify major factors that control the community composition and activity of ammonia oxidizer in river systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and physicochemical property analysis elevation of our study area ranges from 2687 to 4223 m and the latitude lies between 29 18 and 34 94 n in this study sampling work of the yellow river source region was conducted twice during july 2016 summer and may 2017 spring respectively and the other four rivers were sampled during july 2016 ten sampling sites were selected in the yellow river source region of which seven sites were in the main channel and the others were in tributaries fig 1 there were two sampling sites in both the yarlung zangbo river and the nu river and one sampling site was selected in each of the remaining two rivers overall a total of 26 samples were collected in these five rivers during each sampling period triplicate surface sediment 0 10 cm samples were collected at each site using 100 ml syringes part of each sample was temporarily stored at 15 c in a vehicle mounted refrigerator fyl ys 30l china and then stored at 80 c in the laboratory for further dna extraction sediment samples used for nitrification rate analysis were transported to the laboratory on ice within 72 h elevation latitude longitude and air pressure of sampling sites were recorded and temperature of corresponding overlying water was measured the solar radiation intensity was estimated based on observations from meteorological stations on the qtp according to the china meteorological administration in the laboratory sediment samples were carefully and adequately homogenized before further analysis nh4 n and nox no2 no3 n were extracted with 1m kcl at a ratio of 1 5 wt wt wet sediment kcl solution and then their concentrations were determined colorimetrically using an autoanalyzer 3 bran luebbe france organic carbon and total nitrogen contents were determined with methods employed in our previous research xia et al 2019 sedimentary organic nitrogen son content was obtained by subtracting inorganic nitrogen nh4 nox from total nitrogen content sediment ph was measured using a mettler toledo sg23 sevengo duo ph meter with the sediment water ratio wt wt being 1 5 particle size distributions of sediment samples were analyzed with a microtrac s3500 laser particles size analyzer montgomeryville pa usa 2 2 dna extraction and quantification of amoa genes with qpcr and mpn pcr methods for each sample approximately 350 mg of homogenized wet sediment was used for dna extraction with fastdna spin kit for soil qbiogene carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions primer pairs arch amoaf arch amoar francis et al 2005 and amoa 1f amoa 1r rotthauwe et al 1997 were respectively used to estimate aoa and aob amoa gene abundances through qpcr assays the amplification was performed in triplicate on a c1000 thermal cycler bio rad ca usa more information on primer pairs and amplification conditions is available in table s1 melting curve analysis was executed at the end of each qpcr run to check the specificity of amplification products to construct the standard curve a ten fold dilution series of known amount of plasmids containing amoa genes were used as the standard standard curves for archaeal and bacterial amoa genes spanned from 1 05 102 to 1 05 107 copies and from 1 24 102 to 1 24 107 copies per assay respectively amplification efficiencies ranged from 85 2 to 90 3 for archaeal amoa gene and from 90 2 to 90 4 for bacterial amoa gene and r 2 of all amplifications were higher than 98 comammox species formed two monophyletic sister clades which are referred to as clade a com a and clade b com b and could be retrieved by primer pairs of comaa 244f comaa 659r and comab 244f comab 659r respectively pjevac et al 2017 however these primer pairs produced non specific amplicons in our qpcr experiments to avoid such a quantification error most probable number mpn pcr method was employed to estimate com a and com b amoa gene abundances briefly extracted dna was serially diluted by a factor of 10 and then amplified in triplicate available information on reaction mixtures and amplification conditions are shown in table s1 five μl of the amplicons was visualized on agarose gels 1 tae stained with gold view nucleic acid stain sbs genetech china presences of dna bands corresponding to the expected size were considered as positive results and negative controls without dna template were added to check potential dna contamination finally the comammox amoa gene abundance was enumerated using the cochran tables leininger et al 2006 in the meanwhile aoa and aob abundances of three randomly selected samples were also determined using the mpn pcr method it was found that both abundances of aoa and aob determined through qpcr were approximately 100 times higher than those through mpn pcr therefore when compared with comammox abundance both abundances of aoa and aob were divided by 100 herein the abundance comparison was based on amoa gene copies 2 3 amplification sequencing and sequence analysis of aoa and aob amoa genes duplicate aoa and aob amoa gene amplicons were obtained from each selected sampling site using the afore mentioned primer pairs then these amplicons were sequenced by an illumina miseq pe300 sequencing platform san diego ca usa detailed information on the sites subjected to sequencing analysis is shown in table 1 sequence reads with the same barcode were assigned to each corresponding sample the reads were pre processed and merged by trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 and flash salzberg and magoč 2011 the uparse pipeline implementing usearch v10 edgar 2013 was used for otu table construction sequences were first inputted into the uparse pipeline for dereplication and discard of singletons then the unique sequences were de novo clustered with a 95 identify threshold and the chimeras were simultaneously removed finally the uparse was employed to map all sequences to the representative otu sequences at a 95 identity threshold and the sequences failing to map were discarded subsequently each otu was assigned to a specific taxonomy using reference nucleotide data sets generated from the fungene repository fish et al 2013 all sequences reported in this study were deposited in ncbi short read archive sra under the bioproject accession number prjna556763 2 4 determination of potential nitrification rates pnrs for sediment samples when sediment samples arrived at our laboratory pnrs were determined within 24 h using a chlorate inhibition method briefly 5 g of fresh sediment was added into a series of 120 ml serum vials containing 20 ml phosphate buffer solution nacl 8 0 g l 1 kcl 0 2 g l 1 na2hpo4 0 2 g l 1 and nah2po4 0 2 g l 1 ph 7 4 zhou et al 2015 then the serum vials were amended with nh4cl to a final concentration of 0 1 mg n l 1 which was close to the ammonia ammonia ammonium if not otherwise indicated concentration in sediment porewater data not shown here potassium chlorate was added into serum vials with the final concentration being 10 mm to inhibit the oxidation of nitrite into nitrate kurola et al 2005 and then these vials were capped by silicone rubber septa and crimp sealed with aluminum closures subsequently a specific volume of headspace air was drawn out of the serum vials with syringes to simulate the corresponding in situ air pressures sterile sediment was simultaneously incubated to deduct abiotic ammonia oxidation these vials were incubated in the dark at in situ temperature for 0 25 h 1 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h with the shaking speed of 190 rpm and they were performed in triplicate produced nitrite was extracted with 5 ml of 2m kcl solution at each sampling point and was determined with the autoanalyzer 3 pnrs were calculated from the linear increase of no2 in suspensions over the whole incubation period as shown in fig s1 2 5 statistical analysis observed otu richness and shannon index for aoa and aob communities were calculated with mothur software schloss et al 2009 based on a 95 similarity alves et al 2018 taxonomies of the representative otu sequences were further determined by constructing phylogenetic trees using mega v7 0 stecher et al 2016 with reference sequences obtained from the ncbi database geographic distances between sampling sites were calculated by r package of geosphere v1 5 7 hijmans et al 2017 environmental factors were pre filtered through vif cca function of the vegan package v2 5 4 oksanen et al 2013 and the variables with vif 5 were removed to avoid the collinearity issues in this study after vif cca filtration temperature ph son content c n ratio silt proportion and coarse sand proportion were retained then environmental distance matrix and bray curtis dissimilarity matrixes of aoa and aob communities were calculated for the mantel analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova using the vegan package the mantel analysis and permanova were conducted to quantify the degree to which local environmental and spatial factors could explain the bray curtis distances among samples the dissimilarities of aoa and aob communities between our studied high elevation rivers and the reported low elevation rivers as well as other cold environments were exhibited by principal coordinates analysis pcoa plots based on weighted unifrac distances calculated with the mothur software spearman correlation and paired sample t tests were conducted with the statistical product and service solutions 21 0 software spss at significance level of p 0 05 spearman correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between environmental factors and abundances community diversities and community compositions of ammonia oxidizers paired sample t tests were used to statistically evaluate differences in physicochemical factors ammonia oxidizer abundance alpha diversity index and pnr of the yellow river source region between the summer and spring effects of local environmental and spatial factors elevation and latitude on distribution of ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation rivers were explored with redundancy analysis rda in canoco version 4 5 for windows braak and smilauer 2002 with a monte carlo test with 999 permutations and unrestricted permutations under a reduced model 3 results 3 1 physicochemical properties of the sediment samples during our sampling periods water temperature of sampling sites ranged from 7 2 to 19 9 c table s2 which was significantly correlated to elevation r 0 46 p 0 05 n 26 but not to latitude p 0 143 n 26 table s3 sediment samples were under alkaline conditions and their ph values fluctuated from 7 15 to 9 44 average ammonia ammonia ammonium and nox no2 no3 concentrations were 11 95 and 0 69 mg n kg 1 dry sediment respectively son content varied over a wide range between 0 09 and 2 53 g n kg 1 dry sediment which was significantly correlated with ammonia concentration and ph values r 0 80 and 0 47 respectively p 0 05 n 26 sediment samples were mainly composed of coarse particles with sand grains 20 2000 μm accounting for 50 100 no significant relationship was found between physicochemical properties of sediment samples and elevation within our study area p 0 2 n 26 additionally no significant seasonal fluctuation in the sediment physicochemical properties was found in the yellow river source region p 0 05 n 20 3 2 abundance of ammonia oxidizers in the sediment samples according to the qpcr assay aoa amoa gene abundance ranged from 2 23 104 to 4 95 107 copies g 1 dry sediment and aob amoa gene abundance lay between 4 32 104 and 1 31 108 copies g 1 dry sediment fig 2 a aob amoa gene abundance was higher than aoa copies g 1 dry sediment in 24 out of all 26 samples with aob amoa aoa amoa gene abundance ratios ranging from 0 9 to 45 6 according to mpn pcr methods com a and com b were found in 10 and 20 sediment samples respectively fig 2b with the highest comammox amoa gene abundance com a plus com b reaching 2 02 105 copies g 1 dry sediment comammox were dominant ammonia oxidizers in 6 of the 26 samples when aoa and aob amoa gene abundances were corrected through dividing by 100 to ameliorate biases introduced by different quantification methods fig 2c among these sediment samples none of ammonia oxidizer amoa gene abundance was significantly correlated with elevation and neither were their amoa gene abundance ratios aob aoa ratios or comammox aoa aob ratios table s3 according to the rda results fig s2 com a was isolated from the other three types of ammonia oxidizers in the sediment suggesting a unique environmental niche for such ammonia oxidizers son content ph and particle size distribution rather than water temperature exerted marked effects on the abundance of ammonia oxidizers in our study area these marked effects were further supported by results of the spearman correlation analysis table s3 likewise this analysis indicated that none of ammonia oxidizer abundance was significantly correlated with temperature table s3 in contrast aob aoa ratios significantly decreased with increasing temperature but no significant relationship was found between comammox aoa aob ratios and temperature 3 3 taxonomic classification and alpha diversities of aoa and aob communities to avoid the biases introduced by sequencing depth the obtained aoa and aob amoa gene libraries were resampled with the attainment of a maximal number of reads finally a total of 9393 aoa and 5926 aob amoa sequences were retained for each sample based on a 95 similarity 62 and 106 unique amoa otus were obtained for aoa and aob communities respectively with their library coverages in each sample being higher than 99 9 table 1 according to the amoa phylogenetic trees fig s3a the majority 91 6 of aoa sequences were affiliated to the nitrososphaera cluster followed by nitrosopumilus 8 3 and nitrosotalea 0 1 table s4 the dominant aob amoa otu types were affiliated to 9 clusters within the nitrosospira clade fig s3b comprising 95 3 of all aob amoa sequences nitrosospira like aob were mainly composed of cluster 3b 34 1 and cluster 9 33 5 table s5 while cluster 6 3 0 accounted for the largest proportion in the nitrosomonas clade aoa community compositions were significantly linked to ph and son content in the sediment samples table s6 and fig s4 either lower ph or higher son content facilitated a greater proportion of nitrososphaera like aoa moreover many aob community compositions were also evidently correlated to son content fig s5a abundance of the cluster c3b increased with son content fig s5b in contrast both abundances of c6 and c9 clusters significantly decreased with increasing son content figs s5c d however unlike aoa community no apparent differentiation in aob community was observed with varying ph values additionally among the sampling sites no marked differentiation in aoa and aob community compositions was observed along the elevation or temperature gradient observed amoa otu richness ranged from 16 to 45 per sample for aoa community and from 11 to 48 per sample for aob community table 1 and fig s6 both amoa otu richness and shannon index of aoa community significantly decreased with higher elevation table s7 fig 3 a and fig 3c along the latitude gradient these indices displayed significant unimodal patterns with their minimum values at the mid latitudes of our study region fig 3b and d in addition there was a general trend albeit not statistically significant p 0 09 toward lower aob amoa otu richness at higher elevations fig 3e like aoa the minimal aob otu richness along the latitude gradient was also observed at the mid latitudes fig 3f different from aoa table s7 aob otu richness significantly increased with ammonia and son contents fig 3g and h and table s8 moreover within our study area neither aoa nor aob community otu richness was significantly related to water temperature p 0 05 3 4 dissimilarities of aoa and aob communities among the sediment samples pcoa for aoa and aob community dissimilarities was conducted based on bray curtis distances the first two axes of pcoa plots explained 62 8 and 42 6 of the aoa and aob community variations respectively fig 4 a and b axis 1 of aoa pcoa explained 38 9 of the aoa community variations son content was the strongest factors significantly linked to the axis 1 pearson r 0 60 p 0 01 fig 4c and ph had the most significant relationship with the axis 2 pearson r 0 69 p 0 01 fig 4e these findings were in agreement with the results of the permanova which revealed that son content and ph were the most explanatory factors for aoa community dissimilarities r2 0 20 and r2 0 19 respectively table 2 for aob community pcoa axis 1 was significantly correlated with son and ph pearson r 0 59 and 0 42 respectively p 0 05 fig 4d and f similarly the results of the permanova also indicated that son appeared to have the most significant explanations for aob community dissimilarities r2 0 12 p 0 05 other than local environmental factors negative relationships were found between elevation distances and bray curtis dissimilarity matrixes of aoa and aob communities according to the mantel test p 0 05 table s9 different from geographic distances the elevational distance matrix was not significantly correlated with the environmental factor matrix additionally when controlling for effects of water temperature in the partial mantel test aoa and aob community similarities still significantly decreased with increasing elevation distances p 0 05 moreover when the whole data was separated into different seasons similarities of aoa and aob communities were significantly decreased with increasing geographic distances no matter in spring or summer fig s7 this was further confirmed by results of the mantel test in summer r 0 28 p 0 013 for aoa r 0 24 p 0 0213 for aob and spring r 0 84 p 0 001 for aoa r 0 71 p 0 004 for aob 3 5 pnrs in the sediment samples pnrs in the five high elevation rivers ranged from 0 02 to 2 95 nmol n h 1 g 1 dry sediment fig 5 pnrs in the yellow river source region were significantly higher in summer 1 18 nmol n g 1 h 1 on average than those in spring 0 22 nmol n g 1 h 1 p 0 01 among the studied samples no significant variation was found for pnrs along the elevation or latitude gradient p 0 10 pnrs were significantly correlated with ph ammonia concentration and son content r 0 65 0 48 and 0 45 respectively table s3 moreover pnrs were significantly increased with increasing in aoa and aob amoa gene abundances p 0 01 no significant relationship was observed between comammox abundance and pnrs furthermore pnrs were apparently correlated to axis 1 p 0 06 and axis 2 p 0 05 values of the aoa community dissimilarity pcoa fig s8 and the pnr distance matrix was significantly linked to bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of aoa community according to results of the mantel test r 0 22 p 0 034 n 20 pnrs were also positively correlated to the total abundance of aob nitrosospira cluster 1 and cluster 4 as well as the respective abundance of cluster 3b and cluster 9 fig s9 4 discussion 4 1 unique community structures of ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation river sediments there was no apparent difference in ammonia oxidizer community compositions along the elevation gradient table s4 and table s5 due to the high elevation 2687 to 4223 m of our entire study area however when the data of low elevation rivers 800 m was considered we found marked difference in the major ammonia oxidizer populations between high elevation and low elevation rivers for example nitrososphaera like aoa overwhelmingly dominated in the five high elevation rivers and their relative proportions were much higher than those in low elevation rivers elevation is 40 m table s10 table s11 in contrast the relative abundance of nitrosopumilus aoa were higher in low elevation rivers than the five high elevation rivers table s11 and fig s10 low elevation rivers with relatively lower proportions of nitrosopumilus such as the tiaoxi river 13 0 table s11 were more closely clustered with the five high elevation rivers 8 0 in the pcoa plot fig 6 a compared with aoa aob community in the five high elevation rivers was more distinct from that in low elevation rivers fig 6b nitrosospira like aob were most abundant in the qtp river sediments and within the nitrosospira clade cluster 3b 34 1 and cluster 9 33 5 were the two most dominant groups table s5 in contrast their relative proportions were much lower in low elevation rivers cluster 3b 4 4 and cluster 9 8 7 table s12 it has been reported that nitrosospira amoa cluster 9 could only be detected in habitats with low ammonia concentrations avrahami et al 2003 in this study its relative proportion was much higher than nitrosomonas amoa cluster 6 2 98 another oligotrophic aob group koops et al 2006 that was more abundant in low elevation rivers table s12 nitrosospira cluster 1 and cluster 4 that totally accounted for 18 5 of all aob amoa sequences these two lineages were grouped with known psychrophilic aob species fig s3b that have been reported to be prevalent at 4 10 c but completely disappear at higher temperatures avrahami et al 2003 urakawa et al 2015 these psychrophilic populations predominated the coeur d alene river with elevation of 800 m and temperature of 5 6 c 97 3 table s12 in contrast their relative abundance was much lower in other low elevation river sediments 0 6 5 elevation 40 m table s12 4 2 factors affecting community structures and distribution patterns of ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation river sediments ph ammonia concentration and the factors related to elevation jointly shaped the unique community structures for aoa and aob in the five high elevation rivers it might be the alkaline sediment condition that allows nitrososphaera like aoa to be the dominant aoa group in this study just as observed in previous research alves et al 2018 higher proportions of nitrososphaera in the five high elevation rivers than low elevation rivers might benefit from the cold condition of the qtp it has been reported that some species of nitrososphaera have higher abundance at lower temperatures tourna et al 2008 as for aob community the dominance of cluster 3b table s5 might partially benefit from its strong tolerance to temperature variation avrahami et al 2003 the rivers in the qtp are generally characterized by great diurnal temperature variations besides species of cluster 3b could immediately regain their activity after addition of fresh ammonium to a starved culture bollmann et al 2005 this characteristic might also contribute to its dominance in these high elevation rivers that suffer from long frozen periods and thus induced fluctuating ammonia availability furthermore increasing elevation distance between sampling sites significantly decreased corresponding community similarities of aoa and aob table s9 such an elevational influence was more possibly explained by its induced physical isolation of sampling sites and subsequently incurred dispersal limitation for aoa and aob rather than the effects of environmental changes induced by elevation variation table s9 that is this is more related to the possibility that past divergence and diversification of microbial communities are inherited by the genetic isolation due to spatial separation much similar to the roles of geographic distance in ammonia oxidizer community variations of paddy soils hu et al 2015 this is the first report regarding the distance decay pattern for community similarity of ammonia oxidizers in rivers sediments com b abundance was higher than com a in at least 66 of sediment samples in these high elevation rivers fig 2b in this study dominance of com a was mainly observed under colder conditions of the spring fig 2b combined with the dominance of com b in low elevation rivers xia et al 2018a this suggests that temperature potentially played significant roles in the niche separation of these two comammox groups regarding aoa and aob it is widely accepted that aoa are generally predominant in low nutrient environments while aob grow faster under conditions with high ammonia concentration martens habbena et al 2009 aoa amoa gene abundance was found to be higher than aob in the sediment of several chinese rivers zhou et al 2015 and the santa fe river kim et al 2016a in this study sedimentary ammonia concentration 0 92 47 6 mg n kg 1 was lower than or within its ranges 2 5 79 3 mg n kg 1 of the afore mentioned rivers therefore it could be expected that aoa would also be the dominant ammonia oxidizers in the five high elevation rivers however contrary to our expectation aob amoa gene abundance outnumbered aoa in 92 samples such a discrepancy could partially result from the cold condition in the qtp because aob aoa ratios significantly decreased with increasing temperature however it has been shown that aoa are the dominant ammonia oxidizers in many other cold environments at low elevations such as arctic soils alves et al 2013 and antarctic coastal waters kalanetra et al 2009 the disparity between this and previous studies suggests that additional characteristics specific to high elevation habitats play an important role in shaping ammonia oxidizing population structure one key feature of the high elevation regions is enhanced solar radiation and uv intensity blumthaler et al 1997 solar radiation intensity of our sampling sites ranged from 21 1 to 25 7 mj m 2 d 1 positively linked to elevation p 0 05 n 26 zhang et al 2019 intense solar radiation has stronger inhibitory effects on the activity of aoa than aob horak et al 2018 notably it has been shown that freshwater aoa species were especially sensitive to short wavelength light while aob were much less affected french et al 2012 in addition the activity of some aoa populations was also found to be affected by the light induced oxidative stresses kim et al 2016b tolar et al 2016 although sediment environment in most cases is not directly exposed to sunlight suspended particles in the overlying water as the main source of aquatic sediments tend to suffer from strong solar radiation at high elevations moreover some research has demonstrated that aob activity would recover from solar radiation inhibition in the dark environment while only partial recovery was observed for aoa merbt et al 2012 this indicates that when aoa on suspended particles finally settled in the sediment environment inhibition effects of solar radiation on their activities would last thus it is attempting to speculate that the lower relative abundance of aoa in high elevation aquatic systems is associated with their sensitivity to intense solar radiation however the isolation and characterization of additional ammonia oxidizers representing ecotypes from high elevation habitats will be essential to further explore how these environmental factors related to their physiology 4 3 comparison of the pnrs of this study with those in low elevation river sediments although both aoa and aob amoa gene abundances were comparable between high elevation and low elevation river sediments table s13 average pnr 0 55 nmol n h 1 g 1 in the five high elevation river sediments was much lower than that in low elevation river sediments such as the santa fe river 3 87 nmol n h 1 g 1 kim et al 2016a and several chinese rivers approximately 2 30 nmol n h 1 g 1 zhou et al 2015 those pnr measurements in low elevation river sediments used nh4 incubation methods where a large amount of nh4 was added to a sample for example the amended ammonia concentration in the santa fe river was 46 7 mg l 1 kim et al 2016a under ammonia limiting conditions the nh4 incubation method would increase the pnr of the sample by the addition of an excessive amount of substrate as a consequence overestimating the in situ rate the k m half saturation constant values of terrestrial aoa and aob species 5 100 μm total ammonia kits et al 2017 are comparable to the low end of ammonia concentrations in our sampling sties 65 μm suggesting that aoa may be ammonia limited at these in situ concentrations thus a low ammonia concentration 100 μg n l 1 that was within its in situ concentration range in sediment porewater was amended for pnr measurement in this study in contrast many published pnrs in low elevation river sediments with excessive additions of substrate are likely overestimates another possible source of error in experimentally determined pnr originates from the difference between the in situ temperature and the incubation temperature for pnr measurement the typical q10 values of aoa isolates are in the range of 2 3 qin et al 2014 and it has been shown that some natural assemblages of ammonia oxidizers are sensitive to temperature variation with the q10 values between 1 7 and 3 4 horak et al 2018 thus in order to avoid the possible biases induced by the effect of incubation temperature all samples for pnr measurement were incubated under in situ temperatures in this study the relationships between pnr and ammonia concentration and temperature reveal that both these two key environmental variables influenced the pnrs in the five high elevation rivers fig 7 when ammonia concentration was relatively low 7 2 mg kg 1 the increased temperature did not accelerate the pnr fig 7 suggesting that nitrification activity was mainly controlled by substrate availability in ammonia limited area when ammonia is not limiting positive linear correlations between pnr and ammonia concentration p 0 05 were found in high elevation river sediments and these correlation slopes pnr nh4 ratios were markedly affected by temperature fig 7 in the low temperature sites average t 13 2 c we found that despite the large difference between the highest and lowest ammonia concentrations 45 mg n kg 1 there was only a marginal increase in the pnrs in contrast pnrs appeared to be much more sensitive to ammonia concentration variation in the high temperature sites average t 17 1 c moreover the highest pnrs 2 0 3 0 nmol n g 1 h 1 in the five high elevation rivers fig 7 were comparable with those in the santa fe river kim et al 2016a and in several chinese rivers zhou et al 2015 the seasonal variations in nitrification were investigated in the yellow river source region significantly higher pnrs were observed in the summer than in the spring p 0 01 despite the comparable or even higher ammonia concentrations were available in spring indicating that temperature rather than substrate concentration exerts major control on pnrs in this river furthermore just as observed in arctic soils alves et al 2013 pnrs in the five high elevation rivers were significantly affected by community structures of ammonia oxidizers fig s8 and fig s9 as for aob community both abundances of its two most principal groups nitrospira cluster 3b and cluster 9 were significantly correlated to pnrs figs s9a and s9c moreover pnrs increased with elevated abundance of the psychrophilic group nitrospira cluster 1 and cluster 4 fig s9b as discussed above it was mainly the three groups that incurred evident dissimilarities in aob community between the five high elevation rivers and low elevation ones furthermore aoa community dissimilarities were significantly correlated to pnrs fig s8 in summary these results together indicate the potential adaptation of ammonia oxidizers in river systems to high elevation conditions of the qtp 5 conclusions performances of aoa aob and comammox in high elevation rivers are of significance to the nitrification in these rivers however related studies are much scarce this study explored the abundance community and activity of ammonia oxidizes in five high elevation rivers of the qtp several conclusions can be drawn as follows compared with low elevation rivers the lower nutrient colder environments and more intense solar radiation conditions in the qtp rivers shaped distinctive community compositions and distribution patterns for ammonia oxidizers moreover ammonia concentration and temperature markedly affected the potential nitrification rates pnrs no apparent variation in ammonia oxidizer community compositions was observed along the elevation gradient due to the high elevation of our entire study area however increasing elevation distance between sampling sites significantly decreased community similarities of aoa and aob such an effect was mainly caused by the dispersal limitation due to physical isolation in these high elevation rivers the unique community structures of ammonia oxidizers were significantly correlated to pnrs under conditions with higher temperatures and ammonia concentrations ammonia oxidizers had comparable nitrification activity in the qtp rivers with those in low elevation rivers these results suggest that these ammonia oxidizers potentially have adapted to high elevation conditions of the qtp further research should be conducted to study the roles of ammonia oxidizers in the nitrogen cycle of this zone moreover under global climate warming the community structures and activity of ammonia oxidizers in high elevation rivers might change which deserves a further study declaration of competing interest the
