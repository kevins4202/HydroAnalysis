11640,managed aquifer recharge mar and in particular recharge by direct injection into the aquifer through wells or boreholes allows for a series of very interesting solutions to solve various technical and environmental problems related to management of the urban water cycle these problems include the overexploitation of water resources marine intrusion or contamination of groundwater by irrigation returns the island of gran canaria presents several of these problems thus the feasibility of implementing a recharge system has been studied to provide a solution to some of them using a resource of great potential such as reclaimed water a detailed characterization of groundwater quality in the study area was carried out complemented by a field campaign with water sampling from the surrounding catchments in situ analysis and subsequent laboratory analysis specifically an mbr treatment with disinfection is proposed where the final conclusions indicate that this is a technically and economically viable project innovative in its application on islands a priori with an acceptable productive recharge capacity possibly scalable after the experimental phase and extrapolable to other locations with similar conditions in addition it presents a set of important environmental benefits with respect to conservation of and improvement of the state of the groundwater bodies in the studied area as well contributing to knowledge of and research into water management in volcanic lands and islands graphical abstract image 1 keywords managed aquifer recharge climate change water availability regenerated water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the management of water resources is one of the main political socioeconomic and environmental problems facing mankind today cruz pérez et al 2022 the scarcity of these resources means that they must be managed as efficiently and sustainably as possible to guarantee the needs of the population and future generations vargas amelin and pindado 2014 in terms of management there is a technique that is still in the research and development phase even though it has been known since ancient times pulido bosch and sbih 1995 this technique is the managed aquifer recharge mar dillon 2005 based on altering the hydrological cycle by increasing the natural recharge of groundwater through human intervention guaranteeing the storage of water of a certain quality in the aquifers dewandel et al 2021 managed artificial recharge mar of aquifers allows water to be deliberately introduced into the ground thereby extending the life of a valuable resource such as water as well as helping to combat drought and high demand for groundwater jódar et al 2022 mar systems using treated or reclaimed water have been developed extensively in the united states for example in orange county in california plumlee et al 2022 in spain interesting projects have been developed in recent years such as the hydraulic barrier of the llobregat aquifer in catalonia ortuño et al 2012 in the specific case of the canary islands theoretical studies have been carried out but at present there are no real mar projects underway naranjo ayala 2008 ortiz villalobos 2012 internationally mar systems have been developed especially in arid areas with low rainfall salinized soils and water besser et al 2021 it is clear that climate change will aggravate the water situation in arid and semiarid areas of the world so reducing water demand and closing the water cycle becomes vital in countries such as tunisia hamed et al 2022 furthermore the proliferation of irrigated crops and the importance of tourism in the mediterranean area besser and hamed 2021 may affect groundwater hydrochemistry ncibi et al 2022 positioning mar as a groundwater quality recovery technique among the advantages of an mar model the following should be highlighted as fundamental in the context of application i it reduces the overexploitation of aquifers by guaranteeing a higher recharge rate than the natural one so that groundwater extraction becomes a more sustainable process abd elaty et al 2022 ii it allows combating sources of contamination through marine intrusion by creating water barriers that progressively improve their quality and help to protect the resources of the aquifer itself ortuño et al 2012 iii it serves to improve the quality of reclaimed water contributing to better resource management yuan et al 2017 and iv it functions as a permanent storage system without losses due to evapotranspiration and without the use of surface infrastructures to store water kagabu et al 2020 these four advantages have great hydrological repercussions on gran canaria the island s aquifer in general suffers from major overexploitation caused mainly by agriculture and to a lesser extent by the increase in population and tourism demands overexploitation has also caused the aquifer to be affected to varying degrees by pollution of marine cruz fuentes et al 2014 or anthropic origin ruiz garcía et al 2019 which affects a large part of the island s coastal areas mar is an innovative solution for gran canaria for a number of reasons since the 1960s the demand for water resources for agriculture the increase in population the development of tourism and industrial activity has led to continuous overexploitation of the island s aquifer resulting in a significant drop in piezometric levels especially in the bodies of water close to the coast custodio et al 2016 the loss of groundwater quality and the scarcity of resources due to the climatic conditions of semiarid regions means that the water cycle which does not include the use of reclaimed water is unsustainable over time cruz pérez et al 2022 in the canary islands the response to this problem has been to promote nonconventional sources of water resources such as seawater desalination gómez gotor et al 2018 this pattern of managed artificial recharge is postulated as a solution for other arid parts of the world gale 2005 that are heavily dependent on desalination and have diminished groundwater resources such as in qatar mohieldeen et al 2021 the recovery of quantitative and qualitative water status in gran canaria is far from meeting the objectives of the water framework directive which for groundwater bodies are the following eu 2000 a to prevent or limit the entry of pollutants and to avoid deterioration of water bodies b to protect improve and regenerate water bodies and ensure a balance between abstraction and recharge and c to reverse significant and sustained trends in the increased concentration of any pollutant derived from human activity one of the main disadvantages of implementing an mar system is having the necessary quantity and quality of resources with sufficient availability in time and guaranteed supply without reducing the resources allocated for other consumptive uses hasan et al 2019 in particular in spain reclaimed water is relegated to last place in regard to using it to recharge aquifers since its environmental use is not defined with priority being given to other uses such as agriculture or recreation ricart et al 2019 this article examines the managed recharge of aquifers through the use of deep recharge devices or deep wells reusing reclaimed water based on various previous studies the suitability of both the situation and location and the recharge device to be designed is assessed to implement a managed aquifer recharge system with the greatest possible guarantee of success the main objective of this initiative is to improve the quality of groundwater with secondary objectives being the prevention of contamination by salinization and underground storage for its recovery for agricultural irrigation 1 1 study area the feasibility study presented in this article is located on the island of gran canaria which belongs to the archipelago of the canary islands fig 1 an outermost european region belonging to spain the existing purification and regeneration treatments geographical situation existing hydraulic infrastructure availability of water resources environmental impacts and hydrogeological characteristics were evaluated by choosing a specific area for the study this information was cross referenced with maps of groundwater bodies on the island of gran canaria using geographic information systems gis from this information four potential areas for the study were obtained the tenoya wastewater treatment plant wwtp was chosen as an interesting location and case study for the development of an experimental pilot plant fig 2 the tenoya wwtp is located in the municipality of las palmas de gran canaria and has fewer than 5000 equivalent inhabitants and an average flow of 900 1000 m3 day during the study and field work the plant was in the execution phase for technical upgrading previous studies indicate that there is great potential in the use of reclaimed water on the island where only 12 8 hm³ is consumed with a forecast increase to 20 hm³ in the coming years ciagc 2013 in the wetter northern region only 2 6 hm³ is consumed which represents only 30 of the installed production capacity in this region in tenoya demand is small mainly agricultural with a monthly average of 24 000 m³ month compared to the wwtp tenoya s capacity of approximately 45 000 m³ month furthermore the availability of the resource is greater in the wet season than in the summer the water quality of the tenoya wwtp would require tertiary treatments to comply with direct recharge in accordance with the national regulations of rd 1620 2007 boe 2007 the main characteristics that position the tenoya wwtp as a place of great interest for implementation of an experimental pilot system are the following i it is a small wwtp with a newly commissioned treatment system which guarantees sufficient quality conditions for recharge with reclaimed water ii it is located in an area where agricultural irrigation with reclaimed water is not very widespread iii it is located in a hydrological basin in the north of the island with favorable climatic characteristics with a high natural recharge in the summit area iv there are a number of groundwater catchments in the surrounding area that have brackish water quality and therefore require desalination equipment in their operation v the neighboring catchments of the aquifer are abandoned or are being exploited for uses other than for human consumption so there are no health problems from a sanitary point of view vi there is no major competition or stress for reclaimed water ensuring its availability for recharge vii there is an underwater outfall that allows the treatment plant to work safely against uncontrolled spills which improves its operation and production and vii the quality of the groundwater shows signs of salinization and in general is of poorer quality than the recharge water no physical or chemical interactions between the recharge water and the native waters of the aquifer have been specified this project represents a solution that makes better use of resources through the joint use of available resources and it entails significant environmental benefits in the recharged aquifer specifically an mbr treatment with disinfection is proposed that would guarantee the quality requirements 5 2 for aquifer recharge by direct injection of the national regulation rd 1620 2007 boe 2007 the system would be paid for by the water administration due to the environmental purpose and the need to demonstrate its operation this is a free aquifer exploited by wells with desalination plants where the rest of the wells are abandoned the saturated zone is located in the fractured phonolitic formation with variable transmissivities according to spa 15 1975 the transmissivity is 5 10 m2 d exceptionally reaching 25 m2 d with a storage coefficient of 0 01 0 1 occasionally reaching 0 5 exploitation flow rates are also variable ranging from 2 to 10 l s on the other hand pumping tests carried out by the spanish geological and mining institute in the phonolites obtained transmissivities of 60 100 m2 d and 30 m2 d the most frequent showing that transmissivities of 25 30 m2 d are not so exceptional in the phonolites naranjo ayala 2008 the groundwater is brackish with high mineralization due to the high residence time endogenous co2 emanations and saline upwellings caused by pumping furthermore the waters in the area to be recharged are mainly sodium chloride with conductivities above 3500 μs cm and chlorides 700 mg l 2 methodology previous studies conducted in the area made it possible to know the state of the target aquifer and provided the basic information necessary for subsequent design of the deep recharge device among the studies carried out the following can be highlighted 2 1 hydrogeological study very relevant conclusions were drawn in this section in general the main subway flow follows the preferential drainage lines particularly that of the tenoya ravine where the largest number of groundwater abstractions are located in this groundwater body on the island of gran canaria there are 10 groundwater bodies martín rodríguez and cabrera santana 2013 and here we are specifically studying water body number es70gc003 which has 64 groundwater extraction wells and the volume of water extracted is 3 hm3 year ciagc 2013 a hydrogeological study entailed an important series of works both cabinet and field during a campaign conducted in 2014 an important bibliographic compilation miteco 1975 naranjo ayala 2008 santamarta 2013 and documentation on the study area ciagc 2013 were carried out including an inventory of water points in the study area analysis of piezometric evolution and a conceptual interpretation of the functioning of the subway flow the state of the groundwater in the coastal aquifer of the tenoya ravine shows a brackish water quality highly mineralized due to different processes and the presence of endogenous co2 emissions making it unsuitable for human consumption they were characterized as sodium chloride with high magnesium and bicarbonate contents a field campaign was carried out to take samples from the inventory of water points in the recharge area of the tenoya ravine mainly wells between 2013 and 2014 supplemented with data available from 2010 onwards to increase the amount of data in the coastal aquifer environment fig 3 the campaigns consisted of sampling with in situ analysis with a multiparametric probe conductivity temperature ph and dissolved oxygen and laboratory water analysis of basic parameters cl so4 hco3 co3 no3 na mg ca k ph ec no2 sio2 tds sar nh4 p b cu fe mn zn hardness the main hydrogeochemical characteristics of the study area 2010 2014 campaign were as follows conductivity ec variable in the range of 3500 6000 us cm chloride cl variable in the range of 700 1300 mg l sulphate so4 variable in the range of 250 350 mg l nitrate no4 variable in the range of 20 100 mg l and bicarbonate hco3 800 1300

especially in the years of most intensive exploitation and ionic ratios rna rk rmg rca rso4 rcl rcl rhco3 in comparison with the chloride content rcl with no possible processes of contamination by marine intrusion being detected the aquifer has suffered a significant drop in levels in recent decades and is currently found in the intended area at approximately 40 50 m deep and between 0 and 3 m above sea level depending on the state of exploitation in the study area the hydraulic gradient is practically null forming a wide region from the coastal area to several kilometers inland the saturated thickness in the area was estimated to be greater than 100 m the operating regime of the exploitations has decreased in recent years although they continue to produce distortions in this coastal zone regarding the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer the transmissivities and specific flow rates were determined to be higher than those estimated for the phonolitic formation according to the spa 15 results which could indicate a significant degree of fracturing in general there has been a significant decrease in active catchments in the last 10 15 years and it is common to find many abandoned wells in this ravine emilio custodio et al 2015 active farms have associated brackish water desalination plants with reverse osmosis treatments in most cases with low production yields all the nearest surrounding catchments use water for agricultural use which is an advantage from the point of view of sanitary control sharip et al 2012 2 2 climatological and water balance study the average annual rainfall in the basin studied in the series of years 1964 2006 is 354 mm year which means an average annual volume of 48 5 hm3 year according to other studies cabrera et al 2013 natural recharge is estimated at 9 16 of the total volume of precipitation somewhat lower than the 20 foreseen in the hydrological planning which occurs mainly in the upper and middle zones with very little infiltration in the coastal zone with recharge volumes estimated at 1 4 hm³ year 2 3 geological study from the available lithological columns the structure and geometry of the aquifer were conceptually deduced the main geological formations of the basin were differentiated and the main geotechnical characteristics were estimated for the design of the boreholes this work corroborated that the aquifer under injection is mainly formed by phonolites with different degrees of fracturing and the upper materials in the ravine surface zone are mainly recent sedimentary deposits with variable thicknesses along the stream fig 4 the phonolitic formation is the one that presents the saturated zone in the coastal aquifer over older more impermeable alkaline basalts the tenoya ravine has superficial outcrops and is estimated to be approximately 200 m thick with multiple strata of scoriaceous levels and diaclastic rock with a thickness varying between 2 and 20 m with a slight dip towards the sea and different degrees of fracturing and permeability the majority of the materials are competent and well supported in the wells drilled at the top of the formation are more recent permeable and not very compact materials mainly sedimentary and alluvial deposits in the gully bed area geological information is limited with only a few stratigraphic columns from boreholes in the area from the data collected in the geological and hydrogeological studies the starting parameters for the borehole of the recharge device were selected the basic formulation of well hydraulics villanueva and iglesias 1984 was used to design the borehole a lack of knowledge of the exact characteristics of the point where drilling would be carried out in the initial phase of the project created uncertainty therefore different hypotheses were considered table 1 mainly varying the hydraulic parameters of transmissivity 100 10 m2 day and aquifer thickness 200 100 m with these data different theoretical calculations have been used to define the basic design parameters for the design of the asr device which are summarized as follows the recharge capacity was estimated using thiem s formula modified for the consideration of the rises in the injection well in the free aquifer both considering jacob s upwards correction 15 saturated thickness and without it several simulations were carried out varying the transmissivity 10 100 m2 day and the radius of influence 10 and 500 m it has been observed that for transmissivities greater than 50 m2 day the theoretical admitted flow rates for the case study exceed the daily production of reclaimed water from the tenoya wwtp and that for transmissivities greater than 25 m2 day specific flow rates would be obtained that are greater than 0 25 l s m which is a recommended reference value fernández escalante 2010 so a single recharge borehole would be sufficient in this case the recharge pressure is limited to a maximum ascent of 35 5 m with respect to the static piezometric level inside the borehole and without the ascents being high or reaching the borehole head in this case study there is also a wide safety margin with respect to the theoretical allowable pressure to avoid hydraulic fracture pressure in the water formation safety gradients of 0 12 0 2 atm m have been considered e custodio 2000 clogging is the most limiting factor in the design of the device for the theoretical calculation an approximation has been made of the total ascent due to the head losses produced by the recharge in the well estimated using jacob s formulation in the variable regime plus those produced by clogging over time this estimate only considers the physical clogging due to deposition of suspended material on the filtering zone considering an unfavorable suspended solids content of 5 mg l the permeability of the sediment deposit is considered to be invariant over time with a conservative value of 0 01 m day with the fixed design data of maximum rise within the borehole and a fixed transmissivity of 50 m2 day different simulations were carried out for different time periods of continuous recharge 7 15 30 45 and 60 days and with different recharge flow rates to determine the total rises and compare the clogging ratios with reference values the results obtained showed less clogging for a design without gravel packs and total lift levels within the set limit for flows below approximately 800 m³ day however only for flows below 200 m³ day are acceptable clogging ratios of 0 01 m day obtained jeong et al 2018 conditioned by the suspended solids content considered the refuelling time determines the maximum duration of each refuelling cycle before refurbishment of the device is required to restore injectivity it has been determined with the same theoretical approach as the clogging ratio for different flow rates the time in which the total ascent including clogging reaches the maximum limit of limited ascent inside the well of 35 5 m above the static level is obtained the results indicate that for flow rates of less than 500 m³ day the cycles would be more than 295 days allowing for approximately a single action each year the extraction or recovery capacity was calculated using jacob s formulation for a variable regime to obtain the pumping duration that does not produce drops of more than 15 m as this would affect the proposed pumping chamber the results obtained for a transmissivity of 50 m2 day and a storage coefficient of 0 01 show that for flows of less than 600 m³ d the drops are admissible with a continuous pumping of 72 h however recovery is not a priority objective of the device but rather a guarantee of maintenance and cleaning to prevent clogging so that for short cleaning pumping 0 30 min an extraction flow rate of approximately 1000 m³ d would be acceptable for this purpose it is recommended that the extraction flow rate is higher than the injection flow rate 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemical study based on the hydrochemical analysis it was possible to compare the groundwater from the catchments bordering the project area and the reclaimed water to be used as recharge water table 2 this comparison verified the better quality of the recharge water with respect to the original aquifer water and assessed their possible interaction from the results obtained in this study the brackish composition of the waters was corroborated and the main facies was the sodium chloride type it was observed that salinity increases depending on the dynamic or static state of the catchments since canary wells are partially penetrating in the saturated zone causing an increase in salinity when dynamic pumping levels are maintained continuously with respect to static levels during periods of inactivity in extraction this phenomenon occurs due to saline upwelling cones from deeper water herrera and custodio 2003 this could indicate that there are saline upwellings from interphase mixing waters however no evidence of marine intrusion was observed from the spatial representations and ion ratios performed 3 2 mar given that deep recharge experiences are different depending on their location an evaluation of alternatives among the different existing devices was proposed according to the literature consulted jeong et al 2018 ousrhire and ghafiri 2022 managed artificial recharge systems by deep wells or boreholes are typically used in areas where the use of surface systems is inadequate either because there is little space for the implementation of surface systems or because the aquifers are not highly transmissive or have alternating permeable and impermeable layers fernández escalante 2010 therefore the selected technique was aquifer storage and recovery asr due to the orography of the canary islands surface recharge such as the floodwater spreading method fsm jahangirzadeh and ghanbarzadeh lak 2021 is more complicated to install in these islands due to insufficient land available for its implementation and the depth of the water table because the high cost of asr hampers its use a recent study in kansas ensured that low cost wells installed with direct push dp technology can present a cost effective and efficient alternative for asr projects in unconsolidated near surface aquifers liu et al 2016 the investment costs for the development of the project are estimated to be between 385 00 and 770 000 million euros depending on possible variations in geological conditions the annual operating and maintenance costs are estimated at 40 000 euros for the recharge storage volume of 147 500 m³ year considering a useful life of 30 years a unit cost of 0 36 0 42 m³ is estimated by way of comparison hydrological planning includes the construction of regulating reservoirs with a capacity of 40 000 120 000 m³ with estimated investments of between 2 0 and 6 2 million euros in gran canaria the price of reclaimed water is 0 42 0 49 m³ while desalinated water is 0 59 0 70 m³ the asr devices are based on a borehole with a diameter of less than 1 m that can function as an injection borehole or as a water extraction borehole majumdar et al 2021 this versatility allows storage and recovery of the recharged water when necessary in addition it performs well against clogging allows periodic cleaning and improves the management of specific quality problems in the well missimer et al 2011 finally after the simulations were developed reasonable results were obtained slightly conservative and allowing good operation of the system as well as correct sizing of the equipment and elements to be installed the results obtained can be summarized as follows i recharge capacity 500 m³ day ii extraction capacity 1000 m³ day iii clogging rate 0 071 m day iv recharge times 295 days per cycle and v cleaning frequency daily subsequently the dimensions of the device to be executed were determined borehole depth drilling and casing diameter depth and length of the filtering zone and location of the pump the borehole is located in the northern part of the internal plot of the tenoya treatment plant for technical reasons of operability available power supply and remote control facilities less installation of transport pipes for recharge and extraction and protection against flooding fig 5 the discharge of the cleanings is facilitated by the return to the treatment plant there is a reservoir that allows additional regulation for the experimental phases of the pilot the location allows for a less extensive pizometric control network around the device by also taking advantage of existing wells that only use water for agricultural irrigation the final solution adopted was adapted to the planned installations of the tenoya wastewater treatment plant occupying the smallest possible surface area and with the necessary safety precautions guaranteeing easy execution and operation fig 6 three sets of elements of the system can be distinguished the borehole elements the recharge extraction installations and the aquifer control piezometers first the elements that make up the recharge borehole were designed pvc u casing and grids cementations with special chloride resistant grout surface grouting borehole closure head and the piezometric tube for control second the elements that would form part of the recharge installations were developed submersible pump flow control valve injection extraction column wellhead valves hydraulic conduits and control equipment fig 7 finally three control piezometers were designed around the aquifer to monitor the operation of the system the quality of the recharge water is very important in the application of depth techniques any deviation in the control parameters could cause complex contamination that would then need to be resolved and could possibly affect other users waterhouse et al 2020 in addition it is necessary to know its composition in depth to avoid possible unfavorable physicochemical interactions clogging processes or bacterial proliferation in the injection well escalante et al 2020 the waters were characterized to check their qualitative status in accordance with the maximum allowable values mav established in the spanish royal decree 1620 2007 boe 2007 for their intended use of aquifer recharge by direct injection these maximum allowable values are as follows i intestinal nematodes 1 egg 10 l ii escherichia coli 0 cfu 100 ml iii suspended solids 10 mg l iv turbidity 2 ntu and v nitrates 25 mg no3 l the requirements established for reuse in this specific instance are among the most restrictive regulated uses jodar abellan et al 2019 this guarantees water with very remarkable physicochemical microbiological and chemical conditions the required mavs were as follows i intestinal nematodes 1 egg 10 l ii e coli 0 cfu 100 ml iii suspended solids 10 mg l iv turbidity 2 unt v total nitrogen 10 mg n l and vi nitrates 25 mg no3 l although the regulations are very specific regarding groundwater quality ecology and microbiology are also of great importance in managed artificial recharge projects as they are altered by the soil moisture produced by recharge barba et al 2019 therefore based on the laboratory analyses studied and the existing forecasts table 2 it was determined that the quality of the reclaimed water expected from tenoya station could be used as recharge water currently monitoring water and ensuring that it is free of emerging pollutants eps is becoming vital in a world where an increasing number of chemicals are invading everyday life valhondo et al 2016 on the island of el hierro gasco cavero et al 2023 also located in the canary archipelago water samples were taken throughout the island to study the presence of 70 eps and although they were lower than expected there is concern that these types of contaminants must not reach the groundwater of the islands mar projects can quickly yield positive results an example of this is the aquifer of the plana de castellón garcía menéndez et al 2021 where almost 3 months after the start of water injection into the aquifer the piezometric level increased by approximately 3 5 m in addition this aquifer which has brackish water as is also the case in tenoya observed positive changes in its hydrochemistry by including oxic and nutrient rich water moreover a study conducted in cape town south africa simultaneously tested the recharge capacity of an infiltration method and an injection method which is the one proposed in this study finding that recharge by injection is more effective than recharge by infiltration the data showed that water storage in the aquifer increased by 6 mm3 with injection compared to the 4 mm3 provided by infiltration mauck and winter 2021 4 conclusions from the work carried out it can be concluded that these technologies may be technically feasible and innovative in their application in the canary islands a priori with an acceptable productive recharge capacity per device possibly scalable after the experimental phase and extrapolable to other locations with similar conditions however it would be advisable to carry out a more exhaustive study over a longer monitoring period to determine the evolution of the aquifer and the possible fluctuations in the chemical conditions of the reclaimed water from the wwtp in operation before developing the pilot in addition this work has important environmental benefits in terms of conservation and improvement of the status of the groundwater bodies in the area studied as well as a contribution to knowledge and research on water management in volcanic terrain and islands on the other hand in economic terms it can be a viable alternative especially when compared to other similar storage methods in short in the canary islands there is an urgent need to close the water cycle because the pressures on the aquifer are constantly increasing as it is a tourist area with a growing local population artificial recharge of the aquifer can therefore favour a quantitative and qualitative improvement in groundwater resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential

mohieldeen et al 2021 the recovery of quantitative and qualitative water status in gran canaria is far from meeting the objectives of the water framework directive which for groundwater bodies are the following eu 2000 a to prevent or limit the entry of pollutants and to avoid deterioration of water bodies b to protect improve and regenerate water bodies and ensure a balance between abstraction and recharge and c to reverse significant and sustained trends in the increased concentration of any pollutant derived from human activity one of the main disadvantages of implementing an mar system is having the necessary quantity and quality of resources with sufficient availability in time and guaranteed supply without reducing the resources allocated for other consumptive uses hasan et al 2019 in particular in spain reclaimed water is relegated to last place in regard to using it to recharge aquifers since its environmental use is not defined with priority being given to other uses such as agriculture or recreation ricart et al 2019 this article examines the managed recharge of aquifers through the use of deep recharge devices or deep wells reusing reclaimed water based on various previous studies the suitability of both the situation and location and the recharge device to be designed is assessed to implement a managed aquifer recharge system with the greatest possible guarantee of success the main objective of this initiative is to improve the quality of groundwater with secondary objectives being the prevention of contamination by salinization and underground storage for its recovery for agricultural irrigation 1 1 study area the feasibility study presented in this article is located on the island of gran canaria which belongs to the archipelago of the canary islands fig 1 an outermost european region belonging to spain the existing purification and regeneration treatments geographical situation existing hydraulic infrastructure availability of water resources environmental impacts and hydrogeological characteristics were evaluated by choosing a specific area for the study this information was cross referenced with maps of groundwater bodies on the island of gran canaria using geographic information systems gis from this information four potential areas for the study were obtained the tenoya wastewater treatment plant wwtp was chosen as an interesting location and case study for the development of an experimental pilot plant fig 2 the tenoya wwtp is located in the municipality of las palmas de gran canaria and has fewer than 5000 equivalent inhabitants and an average flow of 900 1000 m3 day during the study and field work the plant was in the execution phase for technical upgrading previous studies indicate that there is great potential in the use of reclaimed water on the island where only 12 8 hm³ is consumed with a forecast increase to 20 hm³ in the coming years ciagc 2013 in the wetter northern region only 2 6 hm³ is consumed which represents only 30 of the installed production capacity in this region in tenoya demand is small mainly agricultural with a monthly average of 24 000 m³ month compared to the wwtp tenoya s capacity of approximately 45 000 m³ month furthermore the availability of the resource is greater in the wet season than in the summer the water quality of the tenoya wwtp would require tertiary treatments to comply with direct recharge in accordance with the national regulations of rd 1620 2007 boe 2007 the main characteristics that position the tenoya wwtp as a place of great interest for implementation of an experimental pilot system are the following i it is a small wwtp with a newly commissioned treatment system which guarantees sufficient quality conditions for recharge with reclaimed water ii it is located in an area where agricultural irrigation with reclaimed water is not very widespread iii it is located in a hydrological basin in the north of the island with favorable climatic characteristics with a high natural recharge in the summit area iv there are a number of groundwater catchments in the surrounding area that have brackish water quality and therefore require desalination equipment in their operation v the neighboring catchments of the aquifer are abandoned or are being exploited for uses other than for human consumption so there are no health problems from a sanitary point of view vi there is no major competition or stress for reclaimed water ensuring its availability for recharge vii there is an underwater outfall that allows the treatment plant to work safely against uncontrolled spills which improves its operation and production and vii the quality of the groundwater shows signs of salinization and in general is of poorer quality than the recharge water no physical or chemical interactions between the recharge water and the native waters of the aquifer have been specified this project represents a solution that makes better use of resources through the joint use of available resources and it entails significant environmental benefits in the recharged aquifer specifically an mbr treatment with disinfection is proposed that would guarantee the quality requirements 5 2 for aquifer recharge by direct injection of the national regulation rd 1620 2007 boe 2007 the system would be paid for by the water administration due to the environmental purpose and the need to demonstrate its operation this is a free aquifer exploited by wells with desalination plants where the rest of the wells are abandoned the saturated zone is located in the fractured phonolitic formation with variable transmissivities according to spa 15 1975 the transmissivity is 5 10 m2 d exceptionally reaching 25 m2 d with a storage coefficient of 0 01 0 1 occasionally reaching 0 5 exploitation flow rates are also variable ranging from 2 to 10 l s on the other hand pumping tests carried out by the spanish geological and mining institute in the phonolites obtained transmissivities of 60 100 m2 d and 30 m2 d the most frequent showing that transmissivities of 25 30 m2 d are not so exceptional in the phonolites naranjo ayala 2008 the groundwater is brackish with high mineralization due to the high residence time endogenous co2 emanations and saline upwellings caused by pumping furthermore the waters in the area to be recharged are mainly sodium chloride with conductivities above 3500 μs cm and chlorides 700 mg l 2 methodology previous studies conducted in the area made it possible to know the state of the target aquifer and provided the basic information necessary for subsequent design of the deep recharge device among the studies carried out the following can be highlighted 2 1 hydrogeological study very relevant conclusions were drawn in this section in general the main subway flow follows the preferential drainage lines particularly that of the tenoya ravine where the largest number of groundwater abstractions are located in this groundwater body on the island of gran canaria there are 10 groundwater bodies martín rodríguez and cabrera santana 2013 and here we are specifically studying water body number es70gc003 which has 64 groundwater extraction wells and the volume of water extracted is 3 hm3 year ciagc 2013 a hydrogeological study entailed an important series of works both cabinet and field during a campaign conducted in 2014 an important bibliographic compilation miteco 1975 naranjo ayala 2008 santamarta 2013 and documentation on the study area ciagc 2013 were carried out including an inventory of water points in the study area analysis of piezometric evolution and a conceptual interpretation of the functioning of the subway flow the state of the groundwater in the coastal aquifer of the tenoya ravine shows a brackish water quality highly mineralized due to different processes and the presence of endogenous co2 emissions making it unsuitable for human consumption they were characterized as sodium chloride with high magnesium and bicarbonate contents a field campaign was carried out to take samples from the inventory of water points in the recharge area of the tenoya ravine mainly wells between 2013 and 2014 supplemented with data available from 2010 onwards to increase the amount of data in the coastal aquifer environment fig 3 the campaigns consisted of sampling with in situ analysis with a multiparametric probe conductivity temperature ph and dissolved oxygen and laboratory water analysis of basic parameters cl so4 hco3 co3 no3 na mg ca k ph ec no2 sio2 tds sar nh4 p b cu fe mn zn hardness the main hydrogeochemical characteristics of the study area 2010 2014 campaign were as follows conductivity ec variable in the range of 3500 6000 us cm chloride cl variable in the range of 700 1300 mg l sulphate so4 variable in the range of 250 350 mg l nitrate no4 variable in the range of 20 100 mg l and bicarbonate hco3 800 1300 mg l for 4 wells in the area 0061 cp 0158 tp 0778 tp and 5033 tp punctual analyses of the evolution of the basic parameters 2003 2013 2014 were also carried out indicating a worsening trend in quality especially in the years of most intensive exploitation and ionic ratios rna rk rmg rca rso4 rcl rcl rhco3 in comparison with the chloride content rcl with no possible processes of contamination by marine intrusion being detected the aquifer has suffered a significant drop in levels in recent decades and is currently found in the intended area at approximately 40 50 m deep and between 0 and 3 m above sea level depending on the state of exploitation in the study area the hydraulic gradient is practically null forming a wide region from the coastal area to several kilometers inland the saturated thickness in the area was estimated to be greater than 100 m the operating regime of the exploitations has decreased in recent years although they continue to produce distortions in this coastal zone regarding the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer the transmissivities and specific flow rates were determined to be higher than those estimated for the phonolitic formation according to the spa 15 results which could indicate a significant degree of fracturing in general there has been a significant decrease in active catchments in the last 10 15 years and it is common to find many abandoned wells in this ravine emilio custodio et al 2015 active farms have associated brackish water desalination plants with reverse osmosis treatments in most cases with low production yields all the nearest surrounding catchments use water for agricultural use which is an advantage from the point of view of sanitary control sharip et al 2012 2 2 climatological and water balance study the average annual rainfall in the basin studied in the series of years 1964 2006 is 354 mm year which means an average annual volume of 48 5 hm3 year according to other studies cabrera et al 2013 natural recharge is estimated at 9 16 of the total volume of precipitation somewhat lower than the 20 foreseen in the hydrological planning which occurs mainly in the upper and middle zones with very little infiltration in the coastal zone with recharge volumes estimated at 1 4 hm³ year 2 3 geological study from the available lithological columns the structure and geometry of the aquifer were conceptually deduced the main geological formations of the basin were differentiated and the main geotechnical characteristics were estimated for the design of the boreholes this work corroborated that the aquifer under injection is mainly formed by phonolites with different degrees of fracturing and the upper materials in the ravine surface zone are mainly recent sedimentary deposits with variable thicknesses along the stream fig 4 the phonolitic formation is the one that presents the saturated zone in the coastal aquifer over older more impermeable alkaline basalts the tenoya ravine has superficial outcrops and is estimated to be approximately 200 m thick with multiple strata of scoriaceous levels and diaclastic rock with a thickness varying between 2 and 20 m with a slight dip towards the sea and different degrees of fracturing and permeability the majority of the materials are competent and well supported in the wells drilled at the top of the formation are more recent permeable and not very compact materials mainly sedimentary and alluvial deposits in the gully bed area geological information is limited with only a few stratigraphic columns from boreholes in the area from the data collected in the geological and hydrogeological studies the starting parameters for the borehole of the recharge device were selected the basic formulation of well hydraulics villanueva and iglesias 1984 was used to design the borehole a lack of knowledge of the exact characteristics of the point where drilling would be carried out in the initial phase of the project created uncertainty therefore different hypotheses were considered table 1 mainly varying the hydraulic parameters of transmissivity 100 10 m2 day and aquifer thickness 200 100 m with these data different theoretical calculations have been used to define the basic design parameters for the design of the asr device which are summarized as follows the recharge capacity was estimated using thiem s formula modified for the consideration of the rises in the injection well in the free aquifer both considering jacob s upwards correction 15 saturated thickness and without it several simulations were carried out varying the transmissivity 10 100 m2 day and the radius of influence 10 and 500 m it has been observed that for transmissivities greater than 50 m2 day the theoretical admitted flow rates for the case study exceed the daily production of reclaimed water from the tenoya wwtp and that for transmissivities greater than 25 m2 day specific flow rates would be obtained that are greater than 0 25 l s m which is a recommended reference value fernández escalante 2010 so a single recharge borehole would be sufficient in this case the recharge pressure is limited to a maximum ascent of 35 5 m with respect to the static piezometric level inside the borehole and without the ascents being high or reaching the borehole head in this case study there is also a wide safety margin with respect to the theoretical allowable pressure to avoid hydraulic fracture pressure in the water formation safety gradients of 0 12 0 2 atm m have been considered e custodio 2000 clogging is the most limiting factor in the design of the device for the theoretical calculation an approximation has been made of the total ascent due to the head losses produced by the recharge in the well estimated using jacob s formulation in the variable regime plus those produced by clogging over time this estimate only considers the physical clogging due to deposition of suspended material on the filtering zone considering an unfavorable suspended solids content of 5 mg l the permeability of the sediment deposit is considered to be invariant over time with a conservative value of 0 01 m day with the fixed design data of maximum rise within the borehole and a fixed transmissivity of 50 m2 day different simulations were carried out for different time periods of continuous recharge 7 15 30 45 and 60 days and with different recharge flow rates to determine the total rises and compare the clogging ratios with reference values the results obtained showed less clogging for a design without gravel packs and total lift levels within the set limit for flows below approximately 800 m³ day however only for flows below 200 m³ day are acceptable clogging ratios of 0 01 m day obtained jeong et al 2018 conditioned by the suspended solids content considered the refuelling time determines the maximum duration of each refuelling cycle before refurbishment of the device is required to restore injectivity it has been determined with the same theoretical approach as the clogging ratio for different flow rates the time in which the total ascent including clogging reaches the maximum limit of limited ascent inside the well of 35 5 m above the static level is obtained the results indicate that for flow rates of less than 500 m³ day the cycles would be more than 295 days allowing for approximately a single action each year the extraction or recovery capacity was calculated using jacob s formulation for a variable regime to obtain the pumping duration that does not produce drops of more than 15 m as this would affect the proposed pumping chamber the results obtained for a transmissivity of 50 m2 day and a storage coefficient of 0 01 show that for flows of less than 600 m³ d the drops are admissible with a continuous pumping of 72 h however recovery is not a priority objective of the device but rather a guarantee of maintenance and cleaning to prevent clogging so that for short cleaning pumping 0 30 min an extraction flow rate of approximately 1000 m³ d would be acceptable for this purpose it is recommended that the extraction flow rate is higher than the injection flow rate 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemical study based on the hydrochemical analysis it was possible to compare the groundwater from the catchments bordering the project area and the reclaimed water to be used as recharge water table 2 this comparison verified the better quality of the recharge water with respect to the original aquifer water and assessed their possible interaction from the results obtained in this study the brackish composition of the waters was corroborated and the main facies was the sodium chloride type it was observed that salinity increases depending on the dynamic or static state of the catchments since canary wells are partially penetrating in the saturated zone causing an increase in salinity when dynamic pumping levels are maintained continuously with respect to static levels during periods of inactivity in extraction this phenomenon occurs due to saline upwelling cones from deeper water herrera and custodio 2003 this could indicate that there are saline upwellings from interphase mixing waters however no evidence of marine intrusion was observed from the spatial representations and ion ratios performed 3 2 mar given that deep recharge experiences are different depending on their location an evaluation of alternatives among the different existing devices was proposed according to the literature consulted jeong et al 2018 ousrhire and ghafiri 2022 managed artificial recharge systems by deep wells or boreholes are typically used in areas where the use of surface systems is inadequate either because there is little space for the implementation of surface systems or because the aquifers are not highly transmissive or have alternating permeable and impermeable layers fernández escalante 2010 therefore the selected technique was aquifer storage and recovery asr due to the orography of the canary islands surface recharge such as the floodwater spreading method fsm jahangirzadeh and ghanbarzadeh lak 2021 is more complicated to install in these islands due to insufficient land available for its implementation and the depth of the water table because the high cost of asr hampers its use a recent study in kansas ensured that low cost wells installed with direct push dp technology can present a cost effective and efficient alternative for asr projects in unconsolidated near surface aquifers liu et al 2016 the investment costs for the development of the project are estimated to be between 385 00 and 770 000 million euros depending on possible variations in geological conditions the annual operating and maintenance costs are estimated at 40 000 euros for the recharge storage volume of 147 500 m³ year considering a useful life of 30 years a unit cost of 0 36 0 42 m³ is estimated by way of comparison hydrological planning includes the construction of regulating reservoirs with a capacity of 40 000 120 000 m³ with estimated investments of between 2 0 and 6 2 million euros in gran canaria the price of reclaimed water is 0 42 0 49 m³ while desalinated water is 0 59 0 70 m³ the asr devices are based on a borehole with a diameter of less than 1 m that can function as an injection borehole or as a water extraction borehole majumdar et al 2021 this versatility allows storage and recovery of the recharged water when necessary in addition it performs well against clogging allows periodic cleaning and improves the management of specific quality problems in the well missimer et al 2011 finally after the simulations were developed reasonable results were obtained slightly conservative and allowing good operation of the system as well as correct sizing of the equipment and elements to be installed the results obtained can be summarized as follows i recharge capacity 500 m³ day ii extraction capacity 1000 m³ day iii clogging rate 0 071 m day iv recharge times 295 days per cycle and v cleaning frequency daily subsequently the dimensions of the device to be executed were determined borehole depth drilling and casing diameter depth and length of the filtering zone and location of the pump the borehole is located in the northern part of the internal plot of the tenoya treatment plant for technical reasons of operability available power supply and remote control facilities less installation of transport pipes for recharge and extraction and protection against flooding fig 5 the discharge of the cleanings is facilitated by the return to the treatment plant there is a reservoir that allows additional regulation for the experimental phases of the pilot the location allows for a less extensive pizometric control network around the device by also taking advantage of existing wells that only use water for agricultural irrigation the final solution adopted was adapted to the planned installations of the tenoya wastewater treatment plant occupying the smallest possible surface area and with the necessary safety precautions guaranteeing easy execution and operation fig 6 three sets of elements of the system can be distinguished the borehole elements the recharge extraction installations and the aquifer control piezometers first the elements that make up the recharge borehole were designed pvc u casing and grids cementations with special chloride resistant grout surface grouting borehole closure head and the piezometric tube for control second the elements that would form part of the recharge installations were developed submersible pump flow control valve injection extraction column wellhead valves hydraulic conduits and control equipment fig 7 finally three control piezometers were designed around the aquifer to monitor the operation of the system the quality of the recharge water is very important in the application of depth techniques any deviation in the control parameters could cause complex contamination that would then need to be resolved and could possibly affect other users waterhouse et al 2020 in addition it is necessary to know its composition in depth to avoid possible unfavorable physicochemical interactions clogging processes or bacterial proliferation in the injection well escalante et al 2020 the waters were characterized to check their qualitative status in accordance with the maximum allowable values mav established in the spanish royal decree 1620 2007 boe 2007 for their intended use of aquifer recharge by direct injection these maximum allowable values are as follows i intestinal nematodes 1 egg 10 l ii escherichia coli 0 cfu 100 ml iii suspended solids 10 mg l iv turbidity 2 ntu and v nitrates 25 mg no3 l the requirements established for reuse in this specific instance are among the most restrictive regulated uses jodar abellan et al 2019 this guarantees water with very remarkable physicochemical microbiological and chemical conditions the required mavs were as follows i intestinal nematodes 1 egg 10 l ii e coli 0 cfu 100 ml iii suspended solids 10 mg l iv turbidity 2 unt v total nitrogen 10 mg n l and vi nitrates 25 mg no3 l although the regulations are very specific regarding groundwater quality ecology and microbiology are also of great importance in managed artificial recharge projects as they are altered by the soil moisture produced by recharge barba et al 2019 therefore based on the laboratory analyses studied and the existing forecasts table 2 it was determined that the quality of the reclaimed water expected from tenoya station could be used as recharge water currently monitoring water and ensuring that it is free of emerging pollutants eps is becoming vital in a world where an increasing number of chemicals are invading everyday life valhondo et al 2016 on the island of el hierro gasco cavero et al 2023 also located in the canary archipelago water samples were taken throughout the island to study the presence of 70 eps and although they were lower than expected there is concern that these types of contaminants must not reach the groundwater of the islands mar projects can quickly yield positive results an example of this is the aquifer of the plana de castellón garcía menéndez et al 2021 where almost 3 months after the start of water injection into the aquifer the piezometric level increased by approximately 3 5 m in addition this aquifer which has brackish water as is also the case in tenoya observed positive changes in its hydrochemistry by including oxic and nutrient rich water moreover a study conducted in cape town south africa simultaneously tested the recharge capacity of an infiltration method and an injection method which is the one proposed in this study finding that recharge by injection is more effective than recharge by infiltration the data showed that water storage in the aquifer increased by 6 mm3 with injection compared to the 4 mm3 provided by infiltration mauck and winter 2021 4 conclusions from the work carried out it can be concluded that these technologies may be technically feasible and innovative in their application in the canary islands a priori with an acceptable productive recharge capacity per device possibly scalable after the experimental phase and extrapolable to other locations with similar conditions however it would be advisable to carry out a more exhaustive study over a longer monitoring period to determine the evolution of the aquifer and the possible fluctuations in the chemical conditions of the reclaimed water from the wwtp in operation before developing the pilot in addition this work has important environmental benefits in terms of conservation and improvement of the status of the groundwater bodies in the area studied as well as a contribution to knowledge and research on water management in volcanic terrain and islands on the other hand in economic terms it can be a viable alternative especially when compared to other similar storage methods in short in the canary islands there is an urgent need to close the water cycle because the pressures on the aquifer are constantly increasing as it is a tourist area with a growing local population artificial recharge of the aquifer can therefore favour a quantitative and

11641,assessing basin scale groundwater storage changes is often difficult when groundwater table data are scarce in this study we quantify the groundwater storage changes by using the wflow sbm hydrological model coupled with the modlow groundwater model in the data scarce area of the bandung groundwater basin indonesia the soil moisture storage change calculated by wflow sbm plus the groundwater storage change calculated by modflow is compared to the water storage change estimated by the grace satellite between 2005 and 2015 the calculated cross correlation coefficient is 0 502 and 62 1 of the simulated water storage change falls within grace s estimated uncertainty bounds the important context in the water storage comparison are grace temporally local time lags data gaps in grace datasets and differences in model seasonal performance and analyzed domain characteristics the two latter factors highlight the importance of considering local groundwater related information over large scale global datasets in basin scale groundwater storage change assessment based on the groundwater flow model the current predicament of groundwater abstraction in the bandung groundwater basin is highly unsustainable for future groundwater uses on average the groundwater storage in the study area is dwindling at the rate of 87 million m3 year between 2005 and 2018 dominantly a consequence of groundwater abstraction whose effect is rippled to further impact the whole groundwater flow regime agreed by the situation shown by the limited data the simulated groundwater table drawdown spatially is found to be locally and non uniformly distributed the capability of a one way coupled hydrological and groundwater model to investigate basin scale groundwater storage change with comparable estimates to the grace dataset unravel the opportunity of using such methods to estimate the behavior of future groundwater storage dynamics under the changing anthropogenic and

org 10 4121 4717831d 5f3c 4cbc a616 a7cb595de7ff 1 introduction groundwater is the world s most abundant freshwater resource on which nearly half of the total world s population depends as the source for drinking water supply and industrial uses oki and kanae 2006 however human dependencies on groundwater have vastly impacted the subsurface water tables and aquifer storage between 1960 and 2010 for example global groundwater depletion is estimated at no less than 7 trillion m3 due to various factors de graaf et al 2016 among those are anthropogenic activities which frequently act as the primary cause of storage depletion döll et al 2012 huo et al 2016 in many places practices of unsustainable groundwater use where groundwater abstraction exceeds its sustainable yield are constantly happening and difficult to control chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 wang et al 2019 dangar et al 2021 while the influence of anthropogenic factors on groundwater is strong the natural hydrological cycle also holds a key role in regulating aquifer status even without abstraction groundwater storage anomalies would still naturally occur due to the changing precipitation and soil moisture asoka and mishra 2020 the impact of climate change on the alteration of groundwater recharge has also been shown meixner et al 2016 tillman et al 2016 smerdon 2017 currently although precipitation intensity is generally increasing trenberth 2011 li et al 2019 the recharge to the groundwater is often found at a decreasing rate serrat capdevila et al 2007 holman et al 2009 dams et al 2012 with numerous factors involved in the process the impact of both anthropogenic and climatic factors on groundwater storage is commonly monitored via groundwater table measurements in recent times gravimetric satellite data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission are often used to observe the terrestrial water storage change its derived groundwater storage proportion is then commonly validated by available in situ measurements shen et al 2015 chen et al 2016 zhong et al 2018 grace data however are measured on a spatial resolution of a few hundred kilometers frappart and ramillien 2018 specifically at 1 1 although resampled data are available on a higher resolution of 0 5 0 5 as a result most groundwater storage related studies that rely on grace data are conducted in large basins such as the amazon pokhrel et al 2013 the colorado rahaman et al 2019 the upper nile shamsudduha et al 2017 and the heihe basins cao et al 2012 to investigate groundwater storage change in basins whose total area is significantly smaller than those of grace spatial resolution a grid size of 1 1 is equivalent to approximately 12 000 km2 along the equator another method is needed in bandung groundwater basin indonesia whose total area of 1699 km2 is a lot smaller than one grace grid estimating the water storage change through various modeling approaches results in uncertain outcomes rusli et al 2021 although grace estimates are found in agreement with the values determined from several methods the status of bandung basin groundwater storage change and its subsurface hydrological components remains unknown rusli et al 2021 in addition using time series groundwater level observation data to understand the trend dynamics and magnitude of groundwater storage change is hardly possible as the observation wells are neither designed spatially as part of a network nor they are temporally monitored frequently and regularly enough the spatial distribution of the data is not uniform across the basin most of the boreholes and measured groundwater table data are concentrated in the lower elevated area and hardly available in the mountainous area besides most of the data also have either incomplete information for example the lack of well construction details or missing periods of observation therefore to assess the groundwater storage status in the bandung groundwater basin a solution is required to tackle the data scarcity and spatial coverage challenges one approach is to use numerical modeling although studies on the comparison between grace data and modeling results are limited rateb et al 2020 it has been found useful as a platform to develop groundwater management strategies gaur et al 2011 lopez maldonado et al 2017 a groundwater model is capable to simulate groundwater storage dynamics with groundwater recharge as the surface boundary condition provided by hydrological modeling therefore in this study our objective is to simulate the water storage change in the data scarce area of the bandung groundwater basin by applying a one way model coupling between wflow sbm hydrological model schellekens et al 2020 and modflow groundwater model we validate our one way coupled model by comparing its output in terms of water storage change to grace estimates additionally we also investigate the current state of groundwater storage in the study area considering the changing climatic and anthropogenic situation 2 study area the selected study area is the bandung groundwater basin located in west java indonesia fig 1 the basin hydrogeological boundary is delineated under the law of the indonesian government on groundwater indonesia 2008 separated from the surface catchment boundary and determined by the office of energy and mineral resources esdm of the west java province considering the hydrogeological geological and groundwater hydraulics properties data for the bandung groundwater basin the surface catchment that largely coincides with its boundary is the upper citarum basin the water balance components in the upper citarum basin have been examined and the result of the estimation using various approaches ground observation remote sensing reanalysis data and hydrological simulation showed a wide range of uncertainties especially related to the subsurface processes such as groundwater storage change rusli et al 2021 to tackle this issue we have gathered more comprehensive data including from 18 observation wells 77 borehole data and 25 in situ slug test data whose locations are shown in fig 1 to construct a groundwater flow model of bandung groundwater basin 2 1 hydrogeological setting the hydrogeological data of the bandung groundwater basin is available through previous studies hutasoit 2009 taufiq et al 2017 especially one from rahiem 2020 the latter synthesized data from 189 geological boreholes although it was found that only less than half of the borehole data are complete and some are located outside the bandung groundwater basin this project still provides substantially useful insights into the lithological and geological profile of the study area fig 1 also shows the location of the borehole data which are located within the study area boundary orange circles fig 2 a show the graphical representation of the geophysical model through the north south cross section in the middle part of bandung groundwater basin adapted from hutasoit 2009 and rusli et al 2021 it consists of a three layers geological structure which consists of a shallow and deep sandy breccia and tuff mixed aquifer interspersed with layers of clayey aquitard sitting on a volcanic rock basement formation the two aquifers lithological structure the cibeureum formation is formed by partially consolidated volcanic deposits from the late pleistocene holocene age hutasoit 2009 in many locations the cibeureum formation is interspersed by layers of clay from the kosambi formation which is dominated by the lake deposits of consolidated clay from the holocene age cikapundung formation with a high degree of compacted volcanic deposits forms the basement of the basin on average the thickness of the upper aquifer and the scattered interspersing aquitard layers is 75 m and 30 m respectively the rock basement elevation is assumed constant at the elevation of 300 m above sea level according to the lowest borehole point 2 2 groundwater abstraction covering an area of 1699 km2 the bandung groundwater basin is inhabited by roughly 10 million people in late 2020 nearly 65 of the population fulfills their water demand from the groundwater equivalent to 150 million m3 of annual groundwater abstraction from the upper aquifer domestic groundwater abstraction unfortunately is allowed by law without any monitoring of that worsening the circumstances is the industrial groundwater pumping which was estimated at an average rate of 255 million m3 annually during the past 10 years abstracted from the deeper aquifer taufiq et al 2017 not only it has a higher abstraction volume but it is also more spatially concentrated as compared to domestic abstraction fig 2b shows a conceptualization of fluxes of domestic and industrial groundwater abstraction as well as the other groundwater fluxes in the study area the red and blue arrows indicate the outgoing and incoming flow from and to the model domain respectively the multi layer groundwater abstraction has seemingly caused vertical leakage among aquifers purple arrow identified previously through the high dichlorodifluoromethane cfc 12 tracing that reveals young groundwater in the upper layer of the deeper aquifers taufiq et al 2017 with all the above description the annual groundwater abstraction rates in this study are estimated from population density data and the simulated groundwater pumping volumes from previous studies taufiq et al 2017 rusli et al 2021 although the volume of annual groundwater abstraction is derivable from the information from previous studies the spatial distribution is indirectly available the indonesia geospatial database is utilized to determine the location of the domestic groundwater abstraction specifically the part of the bandung groundwater basin with land use of residential building and high rise buildings are merged as one unit of the domestic abstraction area shown in yellow in fig 1 for the industrial abstraction available location information from previous research that focused on the industrial activities in the upper citarum basin is used van ginkel 2016 validated by the data from the industrial abstraction report to esdm in 2017 and is shown in red in fig 1 2 3 data availability for model parameterization and calibration there are only 26 groundwater observation wells being consistently monitored within the basin although not regularly enough most of these observation wells suffer from several issues such as short data periods observation frequency and or data reliability at least 12 of the observation wells are situated very close to the surrounding abstraction wells this causes the observed groundwater level to be largely influenced by local drawdown especially those measuring the piezometric head from the deep aquifers considering the higher industrial abstraction intensity compared to the domestic ones despite these concerns the observation wells data are still used to assess the groundwater flow model simulation results fig 1 shows the location of the observation wells in which data were used for the groundwater flow model calibration we use the available measurement data in 2004 from the observation wells with depths of less than the interpolated upper aquifer thickness to be compared with the simulated phreatic groundwater level we also use the data of the observation wells that measure the piezometric head of the deep aquifers to validate the simulated groundwater head from the deeper layer of the model taking into account the local groundwater head drawdown for the transient simulation we add the soil moisture change calculated from the hydrological model to the simulated groundwater storage change and compare them to grace estimates to parameterize the groundwater flow model for the hydraulic conductivity values fieldwork was carried out twenty five locations fig 1 were selected where the horizontal hydraulic conductivity from the shallow soil layers between 5 and 10 m below the ground surface was measured using in situ slug tests soil samples were also taken to the laboratory for vertical hydraulic conductivity measurements and grain size analysis as the soil related data from the fieldwork are limited in terms of depths and numbers and the depths of the slug tests do not reach the deeper soil the parameters are later recalibrated by comparing the groundwater head simulation result with the observation data as described above intentionally the spatial distribution of the fieldwork points is designed to be more outspread compared to other data to get a better sense of the soil spatial variability twenty three validated pumping test reports are also reported by esdm to estimate the specific storage parameter and the hydraulic conductivity of the deep aquifer for the rest of the model parameterization the understanding of the geological structure of the basin is assumed reasonable as the reference du et al 2018 3 methodology 3 1 grace water storage change estimates 3 1 1 products and application the grace mission is a remote sensing satellite based mission that estimates the dynamic of terrestrial water storage change twsc based on the measurements of gravity anomalies frappart and ramillien 2018 practically twsc is a quantity of vertical water mass changes consisting of snow surface water soil moisture and groundwater storage in a unit of grace measurement grid of 1 1 due to its large measurement grid area grace related applied studies have been mostly conducted in large basins with reliable data thus its derived groundwater storage changes are compared to in situ water table measurements with a relatively similar spatial scale cao et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2013 shamsudduha et al 2017 rahaman et al 2019 in small basin applications the grace estimates spatial scaling uncertainty inflates a concern to tackle the issue there have been numerous efforts to downscale grace products to basin scale estimates miro and famiglietti 2018 yin et al 2018 chen et al 2019 verma and katpatal 2020 grace dataset statistical downscaling yin et al 2018 was applied in areas where the relationship between grace derived groundwater storage and evapotranspiration is strong in a highly groundwater dependent area like the bandung groundwater basin the groundwater storage change is influenced not only by evapotranspiration but also mostly by groundwater abstraction another method chen et al 2019 downscales grace to the resolution of 0 25 0 25 however it requires a lot of machine learning processing of numerous hydrological variables whose data are not available in the study area in this study we incorporate grace estimate uncertainty bounds nasa jpl 2019 as one approach to tackle the spatial scale uncertainty and validate our model simulation results with various grace products available the used version in this study is the jpl grace and grace fo mascon ocean ice and hydrology equivalent water height coastal resolution improvement cri filtered release 06 version 02 nasa jpl 2019 it is selected as it importantly incorporates the cri algorithm the grace grid that covers the study area has a long coastal line of the indian ocean along its southern border making the cri algorithm application relevant with the absence of snow and negligible surface water components in the study area the grace estimates of water storage change in the bandung groundwater basin should consist only of soil moisture and groundwater storage components equation 1 the groundwater storage component consists of the specific yield s y and specific storage s s components from the unconfined and confined aquifers respectively therefore in this study the grace twsc estimates are comparable with the sum of soil moisture change determined by the hydrological model of wflow sbm and groundwater storage change simulated using the groundwater model of modflow 1 δ water δ surfacewater 0 δ soilmoisture δ groundwater δ s s δ s y 3 1 2 grace dataset in bandung groundwater basin limitation and uncertainties a change in basin water storage results from the discrepancy between inflow and outflow in the bandung groundwater basin the only water inflow comes from rainfall and consequent groundwater recharge therefore we expect a strong consistency and correlation between the rainfall and the water storage change estimated in the study area in this study we use the chirps dataset funk et al 2015 for our rainfall estimate and grace along with the one way coupled model simulation result later on as the estimate for water storage change by comparison with the grace dataset the chirps dataset is available in a much higher spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 hence it offers a more detailed representation of rainfall across the bandung groundwater basin as the grace water storage change estimates cover a larger spatial domain its values are less sensitive to changes over smaller sub areas comparing both spatial coverages the bandung groundwater basin as the most upstream part of a larger watershed system has steeper slopes and higher elevation meanwhile the larger spatial domain covered by the grace grid partly also covers the lower elevated and more flat area downstream of the basin this results in discrepancies in the hydrological response to rainfall for example the smaller and steeper area of the bandung groundwater basin requires a shorter time to generate surface runoff compared to ones of the grace grid spatial domain the same things apply in the required time to adjust their water storage for that reason occasional lags in the timing of the grace water storage change signal compared to the timing of the chirps rainfall estimates are expected besides the expected difference in detecting changes using the two datasets we note some missing values in the grace dataset in the earlier period of our simulation between 2005 and 2015 as low as 9 8 of the data is missing the unavailable values fortunately do not appear in a prolonged continuous period however between 2016 and 2018 it increases to 52 8 which we judge as too poor of temporal coverage to be used as the benchmark for our simulation to tackle this issue we do not take into account the latter periods of the grace dataset when assessing the quality of our simulation 3 2 model setup 3 2 1 hydrological wflow sbm model setup and recharge estimates both river discharge and groundwater recharge are outputs of the hydrological model wflow sbm schellekens et al 2020 that has been set up previously rusli et al 2021 a high resolution model is first parameterized based upon point scale pedo transfer functions imhoff et al 2020 before being scaled to the designated model resolution the model assigned elevation is derived from the merit dem dataset yamazaki et al 2017 the soil related parameters daily interception calculation river network delineation and land use related parameters are set in a similar fashion to the previous studies rusli et al 2021 the same goes for model timestamps and kinematic wave iterations sub timesteps the model is forced with chirps rainfall funk et al 2015 and era5 derived potential evapotranspiration de bruin et al 2016 the simulation period is set from 2005 to 2018 with the actual simulation period being extended to one year before the designated period in order to diminish the effect of the initial condition uncertainty commonly known as the model warm up period yu et al 2019 the wflow sbm parameter that is directly related to the amount of water recharging the upper aquifer in the modflow model is maxleakage numerically it acts as the maximum threshold of water leaving the subsurface s unsaturated to the saturated zones a higher maxleakage parameter increases the recharge and decreases the surface water discharge by applying the maxleakage parameter to our previously built model rusli et al 2021 we simultaneously are able to compare two variables first the calculated discharge with the observation data secondly the simulated groundwater table from the groundwater model forced with the calculated recharge with the observed groundwater table according to previous studies focusing on the groundwater recharge quantification in the study area the annual recharge in the bandung groundwater basin is estimated between 300 and 450 mm hutasoit 2009 tirtomihardjo 2016 3 2 2 groundwater model setup we use the modflow python package developed by bakker et al 2016 to build our groundwater model modflow is an open source groundwater flow model distributed by the u s geological survey usgs and written using a modular object oriented design hughes et al 2017 these modular objects are packages assignable to the main model and simulations with applications that are independently unique from one case to another in this study we use modflow6 which solves the darcy three dimensional groundwater flow equation equation 2 using the control volume finite difference cvfd method langevin et al 2017 2 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s s s h t where k is the hydraulic conductivity in corresponding directions q s is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and sinks and s s represents the storage parameters of the porous material we discretize the study domain of the bandung groundwater basin vertically into a 3 layer model with each layer representing the upper aquifer the aquitard layer and the bottom aquifer that lays on the bedrock basement the horizontal grid size is set to 100 m 100 m generating 481 rows and 646 columns within the model domain the assigned surface elevation is derived from the merit dem dataset yamazaki et al 2017 identical to the wflow sbm model the initial k h for the upper aquifer are spatially interpolated from slug test data ranging between 0 15 and 0 35 m day depending on the location the k v are interpolated from the lab tests where soil samples were taken during the slug tests varying between 3 10 4 and 6 10 4 m day for the aquitard layer we assign a multiplication factor of 0 1 to both the k h and k v of the first layer for the bottom aquifer the k h and k v are interpolated from 23 pumping test reports ranging between 0 18 and 0 58 m day as both the first and third model layer are actually formed by the same geological formation the similarities between the initial k h are in fact encouraging the groundwater recharge is calculated from the wflow sbm simulation at a daily time step and then forced to the groundwater flow model the controls on the uptake and release from the elastic and water table storage the specific yield s y and the specific storage s s respectively are only applied during the transient simulation in equation 2 the s y takes over the s s when the calculated groundwater table is lower than the cell top elevation while the sieve analysis indicates very sandy soil and a low s y of 0 05 we initiate the s y at 0 2 to ease the model convergence the s s values are averaged from the pumping test reports documented by esdm resulting in a value of 8 7 10 3 m 1 the river paths are delineated using the arcgis hydrology toolset and parameterized using groundwater level observations data along the river the river depth is derived from the difference between the surface water level and the groundwater level observations we do not directly input the actual river depth as the grid size of 100 m 100 m is generally wider than the river itself the riverbed hydraulic conductance is determined via model calibration the groundwater abstraction is set according to estimates from our previous studies rusli et al 2021 increasing annually the spatial distribution of the abstraction wells as mentioned previously is assigned based on the land use map of the study area we use the groundwater flow simulation setup whose steps have been proven successful in previous studies karimi et al 2019 first steady state simulation is performed to obtain the initial condition for the period as early as 1990 second we used transient model spin up until 2004 to achieve dynamic steady state conditions the dynamic steady state condition is achieved when the groundwater state is relatively stable the model is simultaneously calibrated by comparing the simulated groundwater table elevation with the observation data we finally run the final simulation between 2005 and 2018 using the calculated head in 2004 as the initial condition using the calibrated parameters the model parameterization during the final simulation is set constant throughout the model run as adjusting model parameters in a shorter period to improve model output does not imply more reliable simulations rusli et al 2015 we believe that our approach to translating the interpretation of the groundwater basin s actual geophysical condition into the numerical groundwater flow model is the best strategy considering the lack of data availability further model complexification would be an effort that cannot be justified by data or observations this parsimonious modeling philosophy has been applied in other studies voss and soliman 2013 kumar et al 2019 liu and rahman 2022 where all implementations have been conducted under data scarcity conditions similar to the situation in our study area a previous study has also proved that the grace dataset is better compared to the simple aquifer system katpatal et al 2018 which is represented by our approach 3 2 3 coupling of wflow sbm and modflow model one way coupling of a hydrological and a groundwater flow model has been applied in many studies yuanyuan et al 2013 jing et al 2018 elliott et al 2022 in a one way coupling scheme two different simulations are run in separate software packages instead of being integrated into one fully coupled simulation haque et al 2021 in this study while the two models are coupled via the recharge variable the wflow sbm model is simulated in a separate environment from the modflow model each model is independently calibrated and validated the discharge simulated by the wflow sbm model is compared with the observed discharge while the groundwater model is calibrated using the groundwater level observation data in 2004 using dynamic steady state simulation the transient simulation of groundwater flow is calibrated by comparing the total water storage change which includes the groundwater storage change component with the grace estimates in calculating the total water storage change based on the one way coupled model simulation we sum the soil moisture change calculated from the hydrological simulation and the groundwater storage change calculated from the groundwater flow simulation the soil moisture calculation in the wflow sbm model involves two main partitions the unsaturated and the saturated stores of the shallow soil the unsaturated store includes the soil layer close to the root zone while the saturated store is the fluctuating shallow or perched groundwater table the s y part of the groundwater flow model both of the results are also temporally resampled from daily to monthly the groundwater storage change of the modflow simulation is on monthly timesteps although calculated in half daily sub timesteps the phreatic water table storage from the modflow simulation is still considered as the saturated zones in the wflow sbm model only involve the first 2 m of depth of soil the full methodologies used in this study are shown by the flowchart in fig 3 3 3 experimental design 3 3 1 wflow sbm modflow and one way coupled model calibration following up the wflow sbm model setup we calibrate the maxleakage parameter by optimizing the kge metric kling et al 2012 calculated based upon the simulated discharge compared to the discharge observation data additionally we also evaluate the quality of our simulation under the current setup to our previous results rusli et al 2021 by looking at the improvement of three metrics the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean square error rmse as well as the average discharge value between the observation and the simulation for the modflow model calibration we manually adjust the spatially varying hydraulic conductivity parameter which we evaluate using the determination coefficient r 2 calculated based upon the simulated water table elevation under the dynamic steady state condition and the observed groundwater table data we also assess the transient simulation by taking into account the simulated groundwater storage change in the total water storage change estimates and comparing it to the grace estimates pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate our one way coupled model simulation results by comparing the simulated water storage change estimates with the grace estimates spatial assessment metrics are not preferred as the spatial resolution of the two compared samples are hardly similar there are 163 337 grid cells in our one way coupled model while there are only 4 grace grids covering the same domain to tackle the pearson correlation coefficient s high sensitivity to outliers we also assess both estimates visually to avoid such issues in addition to that to take into account the grace measurement uncertainties we also quantify the percentage of feasible simulated water storage change estimates in this study the feasible simulated water storage change estimates are defined as the simulated water storage change results that fall within the range of grace uncertainty bounds provided alongside the grace water storage change estimates data nasa jpl 2019 the percentage is calculated by fractionating the number of feasible simulated water storage change estimates with the total number of available estimates during the simulation period 3 3 2 grace dataset screening regarding grace applicability to be used as the point of reference to our one way coupled model simulation we first evaluate the correlation between the chirps rainfall and the grace water storage change estimates the evaluation is done by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient between the two variables to take into account some grace limitations and uncertainties described in section 3 1 2 we apply two independent adjustments on the subject of the expected lags of the grace signals timing we use the cross correlation coefficient as the evaluation metric previous hydrological studies have attested to the use of such metric as it considers the time lag of the interaction among hydrological variables seo et al 2019 wang et al 2021 regarding the occasionally missing grace dataset we calculate both the r and cross correlation coefficient during only the period where the data are mostly complete e g between 2005 and 2015 in this way we ensure that we put sufficient consideration to the context of spatial resolution scaling and data quality and availability in comparing our water storage change simulation results to the grace estimates 3 4 groundwater storage change assessment using the calibrated modflow model we also assess the groundwater storage change in the bandung groundwater basin three exchange fluxes influence the groundwater flow regime in the study area the groundwater recharge the groundwater abstraction and the interaction between river baseflow and groundwater fig 2b the water fluxes between the groundwater and river baseflow are strongly controlled by the two most important budgets the groundwater recharge as the inflow and the groundwater abstraction as the outflow the trends of these two key components together with the groundwater storage are analyzed and quantified we also assess the groundwater storage change by plotting the groundwater table and the piezometric head fluctuation for the upper and the bottom aquifer respectively as the changes for both variables are spatially distributed we assess two values the average and the largest changes for each layer of the aquifers by analyzing the spatial distribution of the changes we can determine the impact of groundwater abstraction on the groundwater table profile and identify the occurrence of local drawdown 4 results 4 1 hydrology model calibration recharge estimates and soil moisture calculation in calibrating the wflow sbm model the kge values vary between 0 35 and 0 48 when the maxleakage parameter is set between 0 0 and 1 5 mm day there is however less than a 1 difference between the lowest and the highest kge under the maxleakage range of 0 9 and 2 0 mm day as all the calculated kge satisfy the suggested minimum value of 0 41 knoben et al 2019 we set the maxleakage parameter at 0 9 mm day taking into consideration the results of recharge estimates from previous studies hutasoit 2009 tirtomihardjo 2016 this maxleakage value results in an average annual recharge of 317 mm fig 4 plots the wflow sbm simulated discharge and the observation data compared to our previous study rusli et al 2021 incorporating the maxleakage parameter in the wflow sbm model clearly improves its performance it is quantitatively agreed by the improved kge nse and rmse metrics calculated using the hydroeval package hallouin 2019 the kge increases from previously 0 35 to currently 0 46 the nse improves from 0 76 to 0 58 and the rmse decreases from 94 15 m3 s to 90 78 m3 s the average observed discharge of 83 16 m3 s that was previously simulated at 113 57 m3 s now is more accurately simulated at 96 48 m3 s we further use the calculated recharge under these current sets of parameters as the driving force to the groundwater model simulation besides the groundwater recharge another result used from the wflow sbm model is the soil moisture it is calculated in a daily time step and is aggregated to a monthly time step before the changes are calculated the daily soil moisture estimated from the hydrological simulation under the current wflow sbm model setup is shown in fig 5 with the dynamic that is in agreement with the rainfall input 4 2 groundwater model calibration fig 6 a shows the comparison between the observed and the simulated groundwater table elevation based on the calibrated groundwater model with an r 2 of 0 895 for the lower aquifer the groundwater flow simulation also results in piezometric head values that are close to the observed values except in areas where local groundwater drawdown occurs it also indicates accurate initial parameter estimations the calibrated k h in the upper and bottom aquifers are within a range between 0 15 and 0 35 m day and between 0 14 and 0 46 m day respectively these values are very similar to the values measured from the fieldwork the optimum k h for the aquitard layer is between 0 017 and 0 039 m day for the vertical properties the optimum k v in the upper aquifer is between 3 10 3 and 6 10 3 m day which is one degree of magnitude higher than the values of the soil samples k v measured in the laboratory the anisotropy factor of 0 1 and 1 0 respectively are the most optimum for the aquitard and bottom aquifer the riverbed hydraulic conductance is at its optimum at 75 m2 day the river base elevation is also calibrated and normalized to its respective grids the calibrated river base elevation parameter of 23 5 m below the surface is validated by groundwater level elevations located near river streams the calibrated model led to groundwater level distribution shown in fig 6b it clearly reflects the influence of surface topography on the basin s groundwater flow direction the high groundwater table is higher along the basin s outside perimeter which is the location of mountainous areas on the surface and drops off towards the vast flat terrain in the center of the basin 4 3 screening result of the grace data fig 7 presents the time series plot between chirps monthly rainfall estimates and two estimates of water storage change the two water storage change estimates also represent two independent products 1 the one way coupled model based water storage change simulated in the spatial domain of the bandung groundwater basin and 2 the grace water storage change estimated for the spatial domain of the grace grid surrounding and including the bandung groundwater basin plus its uncertainty bounds as chirps rainfall estimates are available in a higher resolution than grace the rainfall estimates cover the same domain as the model based estimates and a smaller domain than the grace based estimates at the same time visually the fluctuations of the rainfall estimates are predominantly in agreement with both water storage change estimates dynamics although several discrepancies remain the seasonal patterns are well captured by the model during the dry season between april and september the values of both rainfall quantity and water storage changes generally fall in contrast during the rainy season between october and march all of the variables values appear to rise although the two water storage estimates often increase to different extents the discrepancies between the variables dynamics become more apparent after 2015 during this period as mentioned in section 3 1 2 the grace dataset contains several missing values with more detailed observation we can also see the expected small time lags of grace signal to the rainfall input compared to the simulated water storage change the pearson correlation coefficient between the input rainfall and grace estimates is calculated at 0 537 meanwhile the cross correlation coefficient is calculated at 0 601 with an optimum temporal shift of one time step this means that on average the grace based water storage change estimates are lagging by a month compared to the rainfall the pearson correlation coefficient between the rainfall data and the simulated total water storage on the other hand is higher compared to those with grace estimates calculated at 0 706 4 4 water storage change estimates the grace derived water storage change estimates including its uncertainty bounds and the one way coupled model based simulated water storage change are also shown in fig 7 the simulated water storage change equals the sum of the soil moisture storage changes calculated by the wflow sbm and the groundwater storage changes calculated by the modflow parallel to the rainfall visual assessment the two water storage change estimates show similar dynamics especially during the earlier period of the simulation between 2005 and 2015 likewise the timing between the two signals also seems to differ the grace estimates tend to rise or fall one month behind the simulation this is agreed by the previous cross correlation analysis between the rainfall and the grace estimates the peak magnitude on the other hand is arguably less consistent during some peak water storage changes the one way coupled model simulation generates higher values compared to the grace estimates a more comprehensive discussion on the matter is presented in section 5 2 on the whole focusing on the period between 2005 and 2015 and considering the uncertainty bounds due to different spatial scales of the analyzed measured domain 62 1 of the simulated water storage change is calculated within grace estimates uncertainty bounds with the pearson correlation coefficient of 0 502 4 5 groundwater storage change simulation focusing on the governing budgets over the groundwater flow regime as mentioned in section 3 3 fig 8 shows the simulated dynamic budgets of the groundwater recharge groundwater abstraction and groundwater storage changes in the bandung groundwater basin using the calculated values we are able to determine the overall status of certain groundwater budget trends during the simulation period the groundwater storage change is calculated at 0 14 mm day on average and its long term trend clearly indicates a sustained decline our results also suggest that the groundwater storage of the bandung groundwater basin is depleting at an average rate of 87 million m3 year groundwater storage depletion is reflected through dwindling groundwater tables fig 9 shows the time series of the average and largest groundwater head changes in both the unconfined and confined aquifers in the unconfined aquifer the water table elevation along the smaller upstreams locally rises as much as 5 cm year on average seemingly by gaining water from the river baseflow orange line in other locations especially the flat terrain area of the basin the water table elevation is slowly and steadily falling yellow line the maximum water table drawdown pink line is found near the center of the basin in the intersection between the domestic and industrial abstraction areas although a total water table decrease of 2 7 m does not seem significant it represents the whole grid size of 100 m 100 m the local drawdown around the associated abstraction well is theoretically much higher than the grid representative groundwater head decrease on the other hand in the confined aquifer where there are more concentrated and intense groundwater abstraction the groundwater head drawdown is found more profound than those in the unconfined layer there is a stark difference between the average and the maximum groundwater head drawdown in the unconfined aquifer fig 9 purple lines the fact that the maximum groundwater head drawdown is located under the industrial abstraction area indicates the severe effect of local drawdown in the confined aquifer however the average groundwater head changes of the confined aquifer are relatively similar to those of the unconfined aquifer discussed in section 5 4 5 discussion 5 1 assumptions and limitations of the simulations uncertainties and limitations are always present in hydrological research albeit from the quality of the input data measurements and calibration variables model structure and parameterization etc liu and gupta 2007 ahmadi and nasseri 2020 moges et al 2021 the fact that the bandung groundwater basin is a data scarce area and several assumptions have to be made throughout the research propagates the uncertainties to the research outcome in this study groundwater recharge is a very important variable as it couples the wflow sbm to the modflow model under a more ideal situation the wflow sbm model could be better calibrated by comparing the simulation results with direct recharge measurement previous studies have shown the benefit of using such an approach misstear et al 2009 dong et al 2021 however since recharge measurement data are not available we instead calibrate the hydrological model on the basis of river discharge comparison in addition to that for a catchment with relatively high annual rainfall like the bandung groundwater basin the uncertainties of the estimated recharge in terms of spread are found to be wider compared to ones with lower rainfall zhu et al 2020 this is however unavoidable considering the data availability there are also several assumptions made for the groundwater flow model parameterization and calibration the soil data including the hydraulic conductivities storage parameters and lithology profiles are mostly concentrated in a few locations while these properties in the more elevated areas are largely unknown for the global groundwater flow modeling this might not be an issue with the availability of global gridded hydrogeological datasets such as glhymps gleeson et al 2014 and its updated version of glhymps2 0 huscroft et al 2018 for regional groundwater flow models however using these data would not be scale wise fitting additional future field campaigns and in situ measurements could reduce the uncertainties in the groundwater model parameterization regarding the soil data for the aquifer properties the groundwater flow model is also calibrated in a steady state simulation as time series of groundwater level measurements are not available should the groundwater monitoring management has improved calibrating the groundwater flow model on transient simulation would strengthen the level of confidence and reliability of the simulation the assumption of negligible surface water storage components from the grace estimates could also be criticized see equation 1 within the grace grid covering the bandung groundwater basin there are three concentrated surface water reservoirs this could influence the grace estimation of the twsc especially considering the nature of the non uniform spatially distributed surface water that plays an important role in grace accuracy over the twsc estimates longuevergne et al 2013 in this study the surface water component is assumed negligible as they are located outside of the bandung groundwater basin despite still falling within the grace measurement grid their total surface area of less than 200 km2 is also assumed relatively insignificant compared to the grace grid size of approximately 12 000 km2 along the equator in future studies nonetheless there is an opportunity to incorporate their effects into the grace water storage estimates analysis 5 2 comparison between model simulation and grace in estimating water storage change the hydrological simulation using wflow sbm improves the results from previous studies rusli et al 2021 shown by the closer estimates of average simulated discharge to the observation and the improved kge kling et al 2012 nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and rmse the groundwater flow simulation has an r 2 of 0 895 between the simulated and observed water table elevation during model calibration the combination of two well grounded simulations increases the confidence in water storage change estimates calculated by the one way coupled models the visible time lags between the grace and model simulated water storage change estimates where grace estimates are mostly found to lag is not spotted for the first time this trend is also noticed in previous research salam et al 2020 neves et al 2020 ma et al 2021 some research found that the lag time ranges between two and four months hachborn et al 2017 rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 fatolazadeh and goïta 2021 and was spatially variable considering the seasonal pattern in the bandung groundwater basin the water storage change simulation tends to overestimate grace only during the wet seasons grey light hatched zones fig 7 and gives better results in dry seasons while its performance to detect seasonal trends has been evaluated in a number of studies getirana et al 2020 tangdamrongsub and šprlák 2021 research focusing on grace accuracy varying between different seasons is very limited additionally in this study the simulated water storage change is estimated in a basin where the slope is steeper and the elevation is higher compared to the larger area measured by grace the behavior of different responses in the water storage change during the wet seasons does make sense considering the respectively associated basin characteristics with all the above mentioned contexts involved the r between the simulation and grace estimates of 0 502 is considered acceptable as it is comparable with other basin scale research on the same topic yirdaw and snelgrove 2011 tang et al 2017 zhong et al 2018 liu et al 2020 jyolsna et al 2021 5 3 grace applicability to assess basin scale groundwater storage change the spatial scale difference between the grace measurements and the basin size as well as the local hydrological and hydrogeological properties is one of the key reasons behind the discrepancies in fig 7 although both lines represent the estimated water storage change they are measured simulated under different albeit overlaying domains the results in this paper are fully agreed with previous studies which show that despite having good agreement on water storage change estimates on a regional scale local data measurements are found to have higher variance in their values compared to grace dataset whose estimates are based on larger spatial domain zhang et al 2019 rzepecka and birylo 2020 li et al 2021 this highlights the importance of considering the spatial scale and local regional features when applying grace to assess basin scale groundwater storage changes in addition it is also important to recognize the dominant water storage component in the study area in the bandung groundwater basin the status of the soil moisture and the groundwater storage change according to the one way coupled model simulation are occasionally found in reverse the soil moisture storage sometimes decreases at the same time the groundwater storage increases this trend is also supported in other research pokhrel et al 2013 during periods when they are identified under the same state the water storage change is dominated by the change of the soil moisture component contributing up to 74 8 of the total water storage change therefore the signals captured by grace is contributed mostly by the water storage change in the shallow soil layer instead of the deeper saturated zones while both soil moisture and groundwater storage are considered the subsurface component of the water storage the term subsurface includes numerous spatial coverages from the root zones shallow vadose zones to the elastic and storage partitions of the groundwater system nevertheless in many basin scale data scarce areas where groundwater storage assessment is limited by the availability of direct observation data grace estimates are undeniably valuable rodell et al 2007 however although it could be utilized as an alternative tool to observe the groundwater storage general trend even on a basin scale domain skaskevych et al 2020 its spatial footprint should always be taken into account it covers the local contexts for example related to the existence of lakes reservoirs and coastal lines as well as the incorporated spatial characteristics variability slope elevation land use land cover etc within the measurement domain indeed general conclusions are derivable from grace estimates in regional scale basins abou zaki et al 2019 however the importance of local data when available should always be prioritized the hydrological attributes of the basin surrounding the measurement area could also impact the quality of grace estimation in this study for example the local impact of groundwater abstraction has to be detected from groundwater table measurements in observation wells near the abstraction wells grace estimates in comparison measure the storage changes on a much larger scale and are relatively insensitive to local groundwater table changes in fact it has been shown in previous studies that grace groundwater storage depletion often underestimates global hydrologic model output in heavily exploited aquifers rateb et al 2020 while both grace and modeling methods could be well quantified putting context and critical thinking in interpreting each estimate is indispensable 5 4 present status of bandung groundwater storage the result of the groundwater storage simulation fig 8 indicates unsustainable groundwater management involving many aspects from groundwater recharge to groundwater abstraction surprisingly the trend of the groundwater recharge is shown not to be falling which is in contrast to some of the previous research results of decreasing groundwater recharge under changing climates serrat capdevila et al 2007 holman et al 2009 dams et al 2012 however despite the positive gradient of the recharge regression line it is visually apparent that the recharge generally gets lower towards the end of the simulation period it is important to consider that 2010 was a significantly wet year with a high number of rainy days thus making the recharge constantly high throughout the year by removing the extreme wet year of 2010 in the groundwater recharge average calculation the trend of the recharge would reverse to a declining direction on the other hand the increasing groundwater abstraction is clearly indicated by the red bottom lines it constantly increases during the simulation period starting from an average equivalent of 0 48 mm day in 2005 to 0 76 mm day in 2018 in practice groundwater abstraction has been expanding not only in its volume but also in its flow rate and its spatial distribution in summary the combination of the changing groundwater recharge and groundwater abstraction drives groundwater storage depletion although several methods in separating climatic and anthropogenic factors to the groundwater storage changes have been developed wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 su et al 2022 our assessment clearly indicates the dominance of the human factor in the current groundwater storage depletion given the water demand situation in the bandung groundwater basin such groundwater exploitation might be unavoidable however active actions are still necessary to be taken in response to the currently depleting groundwater storage focusing on groundwater over abstraction it is very important to recognize the potential effect of multiple massive and multi layer groundwater abstractions they dwindle the groundwater table and to certain extents influence the regional groundwater flow regime wang et al 2019 directly spatially concentrated groundwater abstractions create local cones of depression sun et al 2011 indirectly groundwater abstraction from the deeper aquifers also impacts the groundwater table in the shallow aquifers as decreasing the groundwater head in lower aquifers means increasing the head gradient between aquifers zimmermann et al 2017 in the bandung groundwater basin specifically the interaction between the shallow and the deep aquifer through vertical flow leakage has even been identified previous results on high dichlorodifluoromethane cfc 12 tracing reveals young groundwater age from the groundwater samples taken in the upper layer of the deeper aquifers taufiq et al 2017 in our study such leakage is identifiable by the groundwater head changes of the confined aquifer under the industrial abstraction area fig 9 despite having spatially more concentrated and higher volumes of groundwater abstractions the average groundwater head decrease in the confined layer is relatively similar to one in the unconfined layer seemingly due to the potential leakage from the upper to the lower aquifer the dwindling groundwater tables from the upper aquifers also impact the flow characteristics exchanged between the groundwater and surface waters especially along the rivers the different gradient of groundwater storage depletion compared to the gradient of the increasing groundwater abstraction fig 8 indicates that the groundwater storage change processes cannot be explained solely by the dynamics of groundwater abstraction as they involve numerous feedback among variables associated in subsurface flows alarmingly based on the groundwater storage budget shown in fig 8 the withering groundwater storage rate is calculated at approximately 87 million m3 year the long term average groundwater storage change in the bandung groundwater basin has been negative since the beginning of the simulation the fact that the groundwater storage depletion rate is simulated in a comparable degree to both the groundwater abstraction increasing rate and the recharge decreasing rate combined signals a warning the combination of multiple groundwater table drawdowns as a consequence of human exploitation of groundwater has causal sequences on the groundwater flow regime in a bigger picture when it impacts the flow between the groundwater the river baseflow and the constant head boundaries under the currently increasing groundwater abstraction the negative trend of groundwater storage changes points out the unsustainable groundwater management policy in the bandung groundwater basin 6 conclusions in this study our objective is to quantify the basin scale water storage change in the bandung groundwater basin we achieve this by one way coupling of the hydrological model wflow sbm to the groundwater model modflow where groundwater recharge generated by the wflow sbm model simulation is used to drive the groundwater flow model the simulation result is compared to grace estimates including its uncertainty bounds with the simulation period between 2005 and 2015 the wflow sbm model is forced with chirps rainfall data and era5 derived potential evapotranspiration the groundwater flow model is parameterized using fieldwork based data we simulate the groundwater flow under changing recharge monthly and abstraction annually to assess the dynamics of the groundwater storage change to ensure consistency between the grace estimates and the rainfall data we filter out the periods after 2015 where several grace estimates are missing we also implement a cross correlation function in addition to the pearson correlation coefficient to take into account the expected signal time lag that occurred due to the spatial scale differences between the grace measurement and the one way coupled model domain this led to a cross correlation coefficient of 0 601 the combination of soil moisture storage change from wflow sbm and groundwater storage change from modflow is compared with the grace water storage change estimates visual comparison suggests good agreement between the two estimates with a cross correlation coefficient of 0 502 and 62 1 of the simulated water storage change falls within the grace estimates uncertainty bounds based on the groundwater flow model simulations the bandung groundwater basin storage is currently depleting at a rate of approximately 87 million m3 year our model simulations expose unsustainability of the current groundwater management further research on aquifers response to groundwater abstraction both locally and regionally and from both of the layers upper and lower aquifers

11641,assessing basin scale groundwater storage changes is often difficult when groundwater table data are scarce in this study we quantify the groundwater storage changes by using the wflow sbm hydrological model coupled with the modlow groundwater model in the data scarce area of the bandung groundwater basin indonesia the soil moisture storage change calculated by wflow sbm plus the groundwater storage change calculated by modflow is compared to the water storage change estimated by the grace satellite between 2005 and 2015 the calculated cross correlation coefficient is 0 502 and 62 1 of the simulated water storage change falls within grace s estimated uncertainty bounds the important context in the water storage comparison are grace temporally local time lags data gaps in grace datasets and differences in model seasonal performance and analyzed domain characteristics the two latter factors highlight the importance of considering local groundwater related information over large scale global datasets in basin scale groundwater storage change assessment based on the groundwater flow model the current predicament of groundwater abstraction in the bandung groundwater basin is highly unsustainable for future groundwater uses on average the groundwater storage in the study area is dwindling at the rate of 87 million m3 year between 2005 and 2018 dominantly a consequence of groundwater abstraction whose effect is rippled to further impact the whole groundwater flow regime agreed by the situation shown by the limited data the simulated groundwater table drawdown spatially is found to be locally and non uniformly distributed the capability of a one way coupled hydrological and groundwater model to investigate basin scale groundwater storage change with comparable estimates to the grace dataset unravel the opportunity of using such methods to estimate the behavior of future groundwater storage dynamics under the changing anthropogenic and

for drinking water supply and industrial uses oki and kanae 2006 however human dependencies on groundwater have vastly impacted the subsurface water tables and aquifer storage between 1960 and 2010 for example global groundwater depletion is estimated at no less than 7 trillion m3 due to various factors de graaf et al 2016 among those are anthropogenic activities which frequently act as the primary cause of storage depletion döll et al 2012 huo et al 2016 in many places practices of unsustainable groundwater use where groundwater abstraction exceeds its sustainable yield are constantly happening and difficult to control chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 wang et al 2019 dangar et al 2021 while the influence of anthropogenic factors on groundwater is strong the natural hydrological cycle also holds a key role in regulating aquifer status even without abstraction groundwater storage anomalies would still naturally occur due to the changing precipitation and soil moisture asoka and mishra 2020 the impact of climate change on the alteration of groundwater recharge has also been shown meixner et al 2016 tillman et al 2016 smerdon 2017 currently although precipitation intensity is generally increasing trenberth 2011 li et al 2019 the recharge to the groundwater is often found at a decreasing rate serrat capdevila et al 2007 holman et al 2009 dams et al 2012 with numerous factors involved in the process the impact of both anthropogenic and climatic factors on groundwater storage is commonly monitored via groundwater table measurements in recent times gravimetric satellite data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission are often used to observe the terrestrial water storage change its derived groundwater storage proportion is then commonly validated by available in situ measurements shen et al 2015 chen et al 2016 zhong et al 2018 grace data however are measured on a spatial resolution of a few hundred kilometers frappart and ramillien 2018 specifically at 1 1 although resampled data are available on a higher resolution of 0 5 0 5 as a result most groundwater storage related studies that rely on grace data are conducted in large basins such as the amazon pokhrel et al 2013 the colorado rahaman et al 2019 the upper nile shamsudduha et al 2017 and the heihe basins cao et al 2012 to investigate groundwater storage change in basins whose total area is significantly smaller than those of grace spatial resolution a grid size of 1 1 is equivalent to approximately 12 000 km2 along the equator another method is needed in bandung groundwater basin indonesia whose total area of 1699 km2 is a lot smaller than one grace grid estimating the water storage change through various modeling approaches results in uncertain outcomes rusli et al 2021 although grace estimates are found in agreement with the values determined from several methods the status of bandung basin groundwater storage change and its subsurface hydrological components remains unknown rusli et al 2021 in addition using time series groundwater level observation data to understand the trend dynamics and magnitude of groundwater storage change is hardly possible as the observation wells are neither designed spatially as part of a network nor they are temporally monitored frequently and regularly enough the spatial distribution of the data is not uniform across the basin most of the boreholes and measured groundwater table data are concentrated in the lower elevated area and hardly available in the mountainous area besides most of the data also have either incomplete information for example the lack of well construction details or missing periods of observation therefore to assess the groundwater storage status in the bandung groundwater basin a solution is required to tackle the data scarcity and spatial coverage challenges one approach is to use numerical modeling although studies on the comparison between grace data and modeling results are limited rateb et al 2020 it has been found useful as a platform to develop groundwater management strategies gaur et al 2011 lopez maldonado et al 2017 a groundwater model is capable to simulate groundwater storage dynamics with groundwater recharge as the surface boundary condition provided by hydrological modeling therefore in this study our objective is to simulate the water storage change in the data scarce area of the bandung groundwater basin by applying a one way model coupling between wflow sbm hydrological model schellekens et al 2020 and modflow groundwater model we validate our one way coupled model by comparing its output in terms of water storage change to grace estimates additionally we also investigate the current state of groundwater storage in the study area considering the changing climatic and anthropogenic situation 2 study area the selected study area is the bandung groundwater basin located in west java indonesia fig 1 the basin hydrogeological boundary is delineated under the law of the indonesian government on groundwater indonesia 2008 separated from the surface catchment boundary and determined by the office of energy and mineral resources esdm of the west java province considering the hydrogeological geological and groundwater hydraulics properties data for the bandung groundwater basin the surface catchment that largely coincides with its boundary is the upper citarum basin the water balance components in the upper citarum basin have been examined and the result of the estimation using various approaches ground observation remote sensing reanalysis data and hydrological simulation showed a wide range of uncertainties especially related to the subsurface processes such as groundwater storage change rusli et al 2021 to tackle this issue we have gathered more comprehensive data including from 18 observation wells 77 borehole data and 25 in situ slug test data whose locations are shown in fig 1 to construct a groundwater flow model of bandung groundwater basin 2 1 hydrogeological setting the hydrogeological data of the bandung groundwater basin is available through previous studies hutasoit 2009 taufiq et al 2017 especially one from rahiem 2020 the latter synthesized data from 189 geological boreholes although it was found that only less than half of the borehole data are complete and some are located outside the bandung groundwater basin this project still provides substantially useful insights into the lithological and geological profile of the study area fig 1 also shows the location of the borehole data which are located within the study area boundary orange circles fig 2 a show the graphical representation of the geophysical model through the north south cross section in the middle part of bandung groundwater basin adapted from hutasoit 2009 and rusli et al 2021 it consists of a three layers geological structure which consists of a shallow and deep sandy breccia and tuff mixed aquifer interspersed with layers of clayey aquitard sitting on a volcanic rock basement formation the two aquifers lithological structure the cibeureum formation is formed by partially consolidated volcanic deposits from the late pleistocene holocene age hutasoit 2009 in many locations the cibeureum formation is interspersed by layers of clay from the kosambi formation which is dominated by the lake deposits of consolidated clay from the holocene age cikapundung formation with a high degree of compacted volcanic deposits forms the basement of the basin on average the thickness of the upper aquifer and the scattered interspersing aquitard layers is 75 m and 30 m respectively the rock basement elevation is assumed constant at the elevation of 300 m above sea level according to the lowest borehole point 2 2 groundwater abstraction covering an area of 1699 km2 the bandung groundwater basin is inhabited by roughly 10 million people in late 2020 nearly 65 of the population fulfills their water demand from the groundwater equivalent to 150 million m3 of annual groundwater abstraction from the upper aquifer domestic groundwater abstraction unfortunately is allowed by law without any monitoring of that worsening the circumstances is the industrial groundwater pumping which was estimated at an average rate of 255 million m3 annually during the past 10 years abstracted from the deeper aquifer taufiq et al 2017 not only it has a higher abstraction volume but it is also more spatially concentrated as compared to domestic abstraction fig 2b shows a conceptualization of fluxes of domestic and industrial groundwater abstraction as well as the other groundwater fluxes in the study area the red and blue arrows indicate the outgoing and incoming flow from and to the model domain respectively the multi layer groundwater abstraction has seemingly caused vertical leakage among aquifers purple arrow identified previously through the high dichlorodifluoromethane cfc 12 tracing that reveals young groundwater in the upper layer of the deeper aquifers taufiq et al 2017 with all the above description the annual groundwater abstraction rates in this study are estimated from population density data and the simulated groundwater pumping volumes from previous studies taufiq et al 2017 rusli et al 2021 although the volume of annual groundwater abstraction is derivable from the information from previous studies the spatial distribution is indirectly available the indonesia geospatial database is utilized to determine the location of the domestic groundwater abstraction specifically the part of the bandung groundwater basin with land use of residential building and high rise buildings are merged as one unit of the domestic abstraction area shown in yellow in fig 1 for the industrial abstraction available location information from previous research that focused on the industrial activities in the upper citarum basin is used van ginkel 2016 validated by the data from the industrial abstraction report to esdm in 2017 and is shown in red in fig 1 2 3 data availability for model parameterization and calibration there are only 26 groundwater observation wells being consistently monitored within the basin although not regularly enough most of these observation wells suffer from several issues such as short data periods observation frequency and or data reliability at least 12 of the observation wells are situated very close to the surrounding abstraction wells this causes the observed groundwater level to be largely influenced by local drawdown especially those measuring the piezometric head from the deep aquifers considering the higher industrial abstraction intensity compared to the domestic ones despite these concerns the observation wells data are still used to assess the groundwater flow model simulation results fig 1 shows the location of the observation wells in which data were used for the groundwater flow model calibration we use the available measurement data in 2004 from the observation wells with depths of less than the interpolated upper aquifer thickness to be compared with the simulated phreatic groundwater level we also use the data of the observation wells that measure the piezometric head of the deep aquifers to validate the simulated groundwater head from the deeper layer of the model taking into account the local groundwater head drawdown for the transient simulation we add the soil moisture change calculated from the hydrological model to the simulated groundwater storage change and compare them to grace estimates to parameterize the groundwater flow model for the hydraulic conductivity values fieldwork was carried out twenty five locations fig 1 were selected where the horizontal hydraulic conductivity from the shallow soil layers between 5 and 10 m below the ground surface was measured using in situ slug tests soil samples were also taken to the laboratory for vertical hydraulic conductivity measurements and grain size analysis as the soil related data from the fieldwork are limited in terms of depths and numbers and the depths of the slug tests do not reach the deeper soil the parameters are later recalibrated by comparing the groundwater head simulation result with the observation data as described above intentionally the spatial distribution of the fieldwork points is designed to be more outspread compared to other data to get a better sense of the soil spatial variability twenty three validated pumping test reports are also reported by esdm to estimate the specific storage parameter and the hydraulic conductivity of the deep aquifer for the rest of the model parameterization the understanding of the geological structure of the basin is assumed reasonable as the reference du et al 2018 3 methodology 3 1 grace water storage change estimates 3 1 1 products and application the grace mission is a remote sensing satellite based mission that estimates the dynamic of terrestrial water storage change twsc based on the measurements of gravity anomalies frappart and ramillien 2018 practically twsc is a quantity of vertical water mass changes consisting of snow surface water soil moisture and groundwater storage in a unit of grace measurement grid of 1 1 due to its large measurement grid area grace related applied studies have been mostly conducted in large basins with reliable data thus its derived groundwater storage changes are compared to in situ water table measurements with a relatively similar spatial scale cao et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2013 shamsudduha et al 2017 rahaman et al 2019 in small basin applications the grace estimates spatial scaling uncertainty inflates a concern to tackle the issue there have been numerous efforts to downscale grace products to basin scale estimates miro and famiglietti 2018 yin et al 2018 chen et al 2019 verma and katpatal 2020 grace dataset statistical downscaling yin et al 2018 was applied in areas where the relationship between grace derived groundwater storage and evapotranspiration is strong in a highly groundwater dependent area like the bandung groundwater basin the groundwater storage change is influenced not only by evapotranspiration but also mostly by groundwater abstraction another method chen et al 2019 downscales grace to the resolution of 0 25 0 25 however it requires a lot of machine learning processing of numerous hydrological variables whose data are not available in the study area in this study we incorporate grace estimate uncertainty bounds nasa jpl 2019 as one approach to tackle the spatial scale uncertainty and validate our model simulation results with various grace products available the used version in this study is the jpl grace and grace fo mascon ocean ice and hydrology equivalent water height coastal resolution improvement cri filtered release 06 version 02 nasa jpl 2019 it is selected as it importantly incorporates the cri algorithm the grace grid that covers the study area has a long coastal line of the indian ocean along its southern border making the cri algorithm application relevant with the absence of snow and negligible surface water components in the study area the grace estimates of water storage change in the bandung groundwater basin should consist only of soil moisture and groundwater storage components equation 1 the groundwater storage component consists of the specific yield s y and specific storage s s components from the unconfined and confined aquifers respectively therefore in this study the grace twsc estimates are comparable with the sum of soil moisture change determined by the hydrological model of wflow sbm and groundwater storage change simulated using the groundwater model of modflow 1 δ water δ surfacewater 0 δ soilmoisture δ groundwater δ s s δ s y 3 1 2 grace dataset in bandung groundwater basin limitation and uncertainties a change in basin water storage results from the discrepancy between inflow and outflow in the bandung groundwater basin the only water inflow comes from rainfall and consequent groundwater recharge therefore we expect a strong consistency and correlation between the rainfall and the water storage change estimated in the study area in this study we use the chirps dataset funk et al 2015 for our rainfall estimate and grace along with the one way coupled model simulation result later on as the estimate for water storage change by comparison with the grace dataset the chirps dataset is available in a much higher spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 hence it offers a more detailed representation of rainfall across the bandung groundwater basin as the grace water storage change estimates cover a larger spatial domain its values are less sensitive to changes over smaller sub areas comparing both spatial coverages the bandung groundwater basin as the most upstream part of a larger watershed system has steeper slopes and higher elevation meanwhile the larger spatial domain covered by the grace grid partly also covers the lower elevated and more flat area downstream of the basin this results in discrepancies in the hydrological response to rainfall for example the smaller and steeper area of the bandung groundwater basin requires a shorter time to generate surface runoff compared to ones of the grace grid spatial domain the same things apply in the required time to adjust their water storage for that reason occasional lags in the timing of the grace water storage change signal compared to the timing of the chirps rainfall estimates are expected besides the expected difference in detecting changes using the two datasets we note some missing values in the grace dataset in the earlier period of our simulation between 2005 and 2015 as low as 9 8 of the data is missing the unavailable values fortunately do not appear in a prolonged continuous period however between 2016 and 2018 it increases to 52 8 which we judge as too poor of temporal coverage to be used as the benchmark for our simulation to tackle this issue we do not take into account the latter periods of the grace dataset when assessing the quality of our simulation 3 2 model setup 3 2 1 hydrological wflow sbm model setup and recharge estimates both river discharge and groundwater recharge are outputs of the hydrological model wflow sbm schellekens et al 2020 that has been set up previously rusli et al 2021 a high resolution model is first parameterized based upon point scale pedo transfer functions imhoff et al 2020 before being scaled to the designated model resolution the model assigned elevation is derived from the merit dem dataset yamazaki et al 2017 the soil related parameters daily interception calculation river network delineation and land use related parameters are set in a similar fashion to the previous studies rusli et al 2021 the same goes for model timestamps and kinematic wave iterations sub timesteps the model is forced with chirps rainfall funk et al 2015 and era5 derived potential evapotranspiration de bruin et al 2016 the simulation period is set from 2005 to 2018 with the actual simulation period being extended to one year before the designated period in order to diminish the effect of the initial condition uncertainty commonly known as the model warm up period yu et al 2019 the wflow sbm parameter that is directly related to the amount of water recharging the upper aquifer in the modflow model is maxleakage numerically it acts as the maximum threshold of water leaving the subsurface s unsaturated to the saturated zones a higher maxleakage parameter increases the recharge and decreases the surface water discharge by applying the maxleakage parameter to our previously built model rusli et al 2021 we simultaneously are able to compare two variables first the calculated discharge with the observation data secondly the simulated groundwater table from the groundwater model forced with the calculated recharge with the observed groundwater table according to previous studies focusing on the groundwater recharge quantification in the study area the annual recharge in the bandung groundwater basin is estimated between 300 and 450 mm hutasoit 2009 tirtomihardjo 2016 3 2 2 groundwater model setup we use the modflow python package developed by bakker et al 2016 to build our groundwater model modflow is an open source groundwater flow model distributed by the u s geological survey usgs and written using a modular object oriented design hughes et al 2017 these modular objects are packages assignable to the main model and simulations with applications that are independently unique from one case to another in this study we use modflow6 which solves the darcy three dimensional groundwater flow equation equation 2 using the control volume finite difference cvfd method langevin et al 2017 2 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s s s h t where k is the hydraulic conductivity in corresponding directions q s is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and sinks and s s represents the storage parameters of the porous material we discretize the study domain of the bandung groundwater basin vertically into a 3 layer model with each layer representing the upper aquifer the aquitard layer and the bottom aquifer that lays on the bedrock basement the horizontal grid size is set to 100 m 100 m generating 481 rows and 646 columns within the model domain the assigned surface elevation is derived from the merit dem dataset yamazaki et al 2017 identical to the wflow sbm model the initial k h for the upper aquifer are spatially interpolated from slug test data ranging between 0 15 and 0 35 m day depending on the location the k v are interpolated from the lab tests where soil samples were taken during the slug tests varying between 3 10 4 and 6 10 4 m day for the aquitard layer we assign a multiplication factor of 0 1 to both the k h and k v of the first layer for the bottom aquifer the k h and k v are interpolated from 23 pumping test reports ranging between 0 18 and 0 58 m day as both the first and third model layer are actually formed by the same geological formation the similarities between the initial k h are in fact encouraging the groundwater recharge is calculated from the wflow sbm simulation at a daily time step and then forced to the groundwater flow model the controls on the uptake and release from the elastic and water table storage the specific yield s y and the specific storage s s respectively are only applied during the transient simulation in equation 2 the s y takes over the s s when the calculated groundwater table is lower than the cell top elevation while the sieve analysis indicates very sandy soil and a low s y of 0 05 we initiate the s y at 0 2 to ease the model convergence the s s values are averaged from the pumping test reports documented by esdm resulting in a value of 8 7 10 3 m 1 the river paths are delineated using the arcgis hydrology toolset and parameterized using groundwater level observations data along the river the river depth is derived from the difference between the surface water level and the groundwater level observations we do not directly input the actual river depth as the grid size of 100 m 100 m is generally wider than the river itself the riverbed hydraulic conductance is determined via model calibration the groundwater abstraction is set according to estimates from our previous studies rusli et al 2021 increasing annually the spatial distribution of the abstraction wells as mentioned previously is assigned based on the land use map of the study area we use the groundwater flow simulation setup whose steps have been proven successful in previous studies karimi et al 2019 first steady state simulation is performed to obtain the initial condition for the period as early as 1990 second we used transient model spin up until 2004 to achieve dynamic steady state conditions the dynamic steady state condition is achieved when the groundwater state is relatively stable the model is simultaneously calibrated by comparing the simulated groundwater table elevation with the observation data we finally run the final simulation between 2005 and 2018 using the calculated head in 2004 as the initial condition using the calibrated parameters the model parameterization during the final simulation is set constant throughout the model run as adjusting model parameters in a shorter period to improve model output does not imply more reliable simulations rusli et al 2015 we believe that our approach to translating the interpretation of the groundwater basin s actual geophysical condition into the numerical groundwater flow model is the best strategy considering the lack of data availability further model complexification would be an effort that cannot be justified by data or observations this parsimonious modeling philosophy has been applied in other studies voss and soliman 2013 kumar et al 2019 liu and rahman 2022 where all implementations have been conducted under data scarcity conditions similar to the situation in our study area a previous study has also proved that the grace dataset is better compared to the simple aquifer system katpatal et al 2018 which is represented by our approach 3 2 3 coupling of wflow sbm and modflow model one way coupling of a hydrological and a groundwater flow model has been applied in many studies yuanyuan et al 2013 jing et al 2018 elliott et al 2022 in a one way coupling scheme two different simulations are run in separate software packages instead of being integrated into one fully coupled simulation haque et al 2021 in this study while the two models are coupled via the recharge variable the wflow sbm model is simulated in a separate environment from the modflow model each model is independently calibrated and validated the discharge simulated by the wflow sbm model is compared with the observed discharge while the groundwater model is calibrated using the groundwater level observation data in 2004 using dynamic steady state simulation the transient simulation of groundwater flow is calibrated by comparing the total water storage change which includes the groundwater storage change component with the grace estimates in calculating the total water storage change based on the one way coupled model simulation we sum the soil moisture change calculated from the hydrological simulation and the groundwater storage change calculated from the groundwater flow simulation the soil moisture calculation in the wflow sbm model involves two main partitions the unsaturated and the saturated stores of the shallow soil the unsaturated store includes the soil layer close to the root zone while the saturated store is the fluctuating shallow or perched groundwater table the s y part of the groundwater flow model both of the results are also temporally resampled from daily to monthly the groundwater storage change of the modflow simulation is on monthly timesteps although calculated in half daily sub timesteps the phreatic water table storage from the modflow simulation is still considered as the saturated zones in the wflow sbm model only involve the first 2 m of depth of soil the full methodologies used in this study are shown by the flowchart in fig 3 3 3 experimental design 3 3 1 wflow sbm modflow and one way coupled model calibration following up the wflow sbm model setup we calibrate the maxleakage parameter by optimizing the kge metric kling et al 2012 calculated based upon the simulated discharge compared to the discharge observation data additionally we also evaluate the quality of our simulation under the current setup to our previous results rusli et al 2021 by looking at the improvement of three metrics the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean square error rmse as well as the average discharge value between the observation and the simulation for the modflow model calibration we manually adjust the spatially varying hydraulic conductivity parameter which we evaluate using the determination coefficient r 2 calculated based upon the simulated water table elevation under the dynamic steady state condition and the observed groundwater table data we also assess the transient simulation by taking into account the simulated groundwater storage change in the total water storage change estimates and comparing it to the grace estimates pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate our one way coupled model simulation results by comparing the simulated water storage change estimates with the grace estimates spatial assessment metrics are not preferred as the spatial resolution of the two compared samples are hardly similar there are 163 337 grid cells in our one way coupled model while there are only 4 grace grids covering the same domain to tackle the pearson correlation coefficient s high sensitivity to outliers we also assess both estimates visually to avoid such issues in addition to that to take into account the grace measurement uncertainties we also quantify the percentage of feasible simulated water storage change estimates in this study the feasible simulated water storage change estimates are defined as the simulated water storage change results that fall within the range of grace uncertainty bounds provided alongside the grace water storage change estimates data nasa jpl 2019 the percentage is calculated by fractionating the number of feasible simulated water storage change estimates with the total number of available estimates during the simulation period 3 3 2 grace dataset screening regarding grace applicability to be used as the point of reference to our one way coupled model simulation we first evaluate the correlation between the chirps rainfall and the grace water storage change estimates the evaluation is done by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient between the two variables to take into account some grace limitations and uncertainties described in section 3 1 2 we apply two independent adjustments on the subject of the expected lags of the grace signals timing we use the cross correlation coefficient as the evaluation metric previous hydrological studies have attested to the use of such metric as it considers the time lag of the interaction among hydrological variables seo et al 2019 wang et al 2021 regarding the occasionally missing grace dataset we calculate both the r and cross correlation coefficient during only the period where the data are mostly complete e g between 2005 and 2015 in this way we ensure that we put sufficient consideration to the context of spatial resolution scaling and data quality and availability in comparing our water storage change simulation results to the grace estimates 3 4 groundwater storage change assessment using the calibrated modflow model we also assess the groundwater storage change in the bandung groundwater basin three exchange fluxes influence the groundwater flow regime in the study area the groundwater recharge the groundwater abstraction and the interaction between river baseflow and groundwater fig 2b the water fluxes between the groundwater and river baseflow are strongly controlled by the two most important budgets the groundwater recharge as the inflow and the groundwater abstraction as the outflow the trends of these two key components together with the groundwater storage are analyzed and quantified we also assess the groundwater storage change by plotting the groundwater table and the piezometric head fluctuation for the upper and the bottom aquifer respectively as the changes for both variables are spatially distributed we assess two values the average and the largest changes for each layer of the aquifers by analyzing the spatial distribution of the changes we can determine the impact of groundwater abstraction on the groundwater table profile and identify the occurrence of local drawdown 4 results 4 1 hydrology model calibration recharge estimates and soil moisture calculation in calibrating the wflow sbm model the kge values vary between 0 35 and 0 48 when the maxleakage parameter is set between 0 0 and 1 5 mm day there is however less than a 1 difference between the lowest and the highest kge under the maxleakage range of 0 9 and 2 0 mm day as all the calculated kge satisfy the suggested minimum value of 0 41 knoben et al 2019 we set the maxleakage parameter at 0 9 mm day taking into consideration the results of recharge estimates from previous studies hutasoit 2009 tirtomihardjo 2016 this maxleakage value results in an average annual recharge of 317 mm fig 4 plots the wflow sbm simulated discharge and the observation data compared to our previous study rusli et al 2021 incorporating the maxleakage parameter in the wflow sbm model clearly improves its performance it is quantitatively agreed by the improved kge nse and rmse metrics calculated using the hydroeval package hallouin 2019 the kge increases from previously 0 35 to currently 0 46 the nse improves from 0 76 to 0 58 and the rmse decreases from 94 15 m3 s to 90 78 m3 s the average observed discharge of 83 16 m3 s that was previously simulated at 113 57 m3 s now is more accurately simulated at 96 48 m3 s we further use the calculated recharge under these current sets of parameters as the driving force to the groundwater model simulation besides the groundwater recharge another result used from the wflow sbm model is the soil moisture it is calculated in a daily time step and is aggregated to a monthly time step before the changes are calculated the daily soil moisture estimated from the hydrological simulation under the current wflow sbm model setup is shown in fig 5 with the dynamic that is in agreement with the rainfall input 4 2 groundwater model calibration fig 6 a shows the comparison between the observed and the simulated groundwater table elevation based on the calibrated groundwater model with an r 2 of 0 895 for the lower aquifer the groundwater flow simulation also results in piezometric head values that are close to the observed values except in areas where local groundwater drawdown occurs it also indicates accurate initial parameter estimations the calibrated k h in the upper and bottom aquifers are within a range between 0 15 and 0 35 m day and between 0 14 and 0 46 m day respectively these values are very similar to the values measured from the fieldwork the optimum k h for the aquitard layer is between 0 017 and 0 039 m day for the vertical properties the optimum k v in the upper aquifer is between 3 10 3 and 6 10 3 m day which is one degree of magnitude higher than the values of the soil samples k v measured in the laboratory the anisotropy factor of 0 1 and 1 0 respectively are the most optimum for the aquitard and bottom aquifer the riverbed hydraulic conductance is at its optimum at 75 m2 day the river base elevation is also calibrated and normalized to its respective grids the calibrated river base elevation parameter of 23 5 m below the surface is validated by groundwater level elevations located near river streams the calibrated model led to groundwater level distribution shown in fig 6b it clearly reflects the influence of surface topography on the basin s groundwater flow direction the high groundwater table is higher along the basin s outside perimeter which is the location of mountainous areas on the surface and drops off towards the vast flat terrain in the center of the basin 4 3 screening result of the grace data fig 7 presents the time series plot between chirps monthly rainfall estimates and two estimates of water storage change the two water storage change estimates also represent two independent products 1 the one way coupled model based water storage change simulated in the spatial domain of the bandung groundwater basin and 2 the grace water storage change estimated for the spatial domain of the grace grid surrounding and including the bandung groundwater basin plus its uncertainty bounds as chirps rainfall estimates are available in a higher resolution than grace the rainfall estimates cover the same domain as the model based estimates and a smaller domain than the grace based estimates at the same time visually the fluctuations of the rainfall estimates are predominantly in agreement with both water storage change estimates dynamics although several discrepancies remain the seasonal patterns are well captured by the model during the dry season between april and september the values of both rainfall quantity and water storage changes generally fall in contrast during the rainy season between october and march all of the variables values appear to rise although the two water storage estimates often increase to different extents the discrepancies between the variables dynamics become more apparent after 2015 during this period as mentioned in section 3 1 2 the grace dataset contains several missing values with more detailed observation we can also see the expected small time lags of grace signal to the rainfall input compared to the simulated water storage change the pearson correlation coefficient between the input rainfall and grace estimates is calculated at 0 537 meanwhile the cross correlation coefficient is calculated at 0 601 with an optimum temporal shift of one time step this means that on average the grace based water storage change estimates are lagging by a month compared to the rainfall the pearson correlation coefficient between the rainfall data and the simulated total water storage on the other hand is higher compared to those with grace estimates calculated at 0 706 4 4 water storage change estimates the grace derived water storage change estimates including its uncertainty bounds and the one way coupled model based simulated water storage change are also shown in fig 7 the simulated water storage change equals the sum of the soil moisture storage changes calculated by the wflow sbm and the groundwater storage changes calculated by the modflow parallel to the rainfall visual assessment the two water storage change estimates show similar dynamics especially during the earlier period of the simulation between 2005 and 2015 likewise the timing between the two signals also seems to differ the grace estimates tend to rise or fall one month behind the simulation this is agreed by the previous cross correlation analysis between the rainfall and the grace estimates the peak magnitude on the other hand is arguably less consistent during some peak water storage changes the one way coupled model simulation generates higher values compared to the grace estimates a more comprehensive discussion on the matter is presented in section 5 2 on the whole focusing on the period between 2005 and 2015 and considering the uncertainty bounds due to different spatial scales of the analyzed measured domain 62 1 of the simulated water storage change is calculated within grace estimates uncertainty bounds with the pearson correlation coefficient of 0 502 4 5 groundwater storage change simulation focusing on the governing budgets over the groundwater flow regime as mentioned in section 3 3 fig 8 shows the simulated dynamic budgets of the groundwater recharge groundwater abstraction and groundwater storage changes in the bandung groundwater basin using the calculated values we are able to determine the overall status of certain groundwater budget trends during the simulation period the groundwater storage change is calculated at 0 14 mm day on average and its long term trend clearly indicates a sustained decline our results also suggest that the groundwater storage of the bandung groundwater basin is depleting at an average rate of 87 million m3 year groundwater storage depletion is reflected through dwindling groundwater tables fig 9 shows the time series of the average and largest groundwater head changes in both the unconfined and confined aquifers in the unconfined aquifer the water table elevation along the smaller upstreams locally rises as much as 5 cm year on average seemingly by gaining water from the river baseflow orange line in other locations especially the flat terrain area of the basin the water table elevation is slowly and steadily falling yellow line the maximum water table drawdown pink line is found near the center of the basin in the intersection between the domestic and industrial abstraction areas although a total water table decrease of 2 7 m does not seem significant it represents the whole grid size of 100 m 100 m the local drawdown around the associated abstraction well is theoretically much higher than the grid representative groundwater head decrease on the other hand in the confined aquifer where there are more concentrated and intense groundwater abstraction the groundwater head drawdown is found more profound than those in the unconfined layer there is a stark difference between the average and the maximum groundwater head drawdown in the unconfined aquifer fig 9 purple lines the fact that the maximum groundwater head drawdown is located under the industrial abstraction area indicates the severe effect of local drawdown in the confined aquifer however the average groundwater head changes of the confined aquifer are relatively similar to those of the unconfined aquifer discussed in section 5 4 5 discussion 5 1 assumptions and limitations of the simulations uncertainties and limitations are always present in hydrological research albeit from the quality of the input data measurements and calibration variables model structure and parameterization etc liu and gupta 2007 ahmadi and nasseri 2020 moges et al 2021 the fact that the bandung groundwater basin is a data scarce area and several assumptions have to be made throughout the research propagates the uncertainties to the research outcome in this study groundwater recharge is a very important variable as it couples the wflow sbm to the modflow model under a more ideal situation the wflow sbm model could be better calibrated by comparing the simulation results with direct recharge measurement previous studies have shown the benefit of using such an approach misstear et al 2009 dong et al 2021 however since recharge measurement data are not available we instead calibrate the hydrological model on the basis of river discharge comparison in addition to that for a catchment with relatively high annual rainfall like the bandung groundwater basin the uncertainties of the estimated recharge in terms of spread are found to be wider compared to ones with lower rainfall zhu et al 2020 this is however unavoidable considering the data availability there are also several assumptions made for the groundwater flow model parameterization and calibration the soil data including the hydraulic conductivities storage parameters and lithology profiles are mostly concentrated in a few locations while these properties in the more elevated areas are largely unknown for the global groundwater flow modeling this might not be an issue with the availability of global gridded hydrogeological datasets such as glhymps gleeson et al 2014 and its updated version of glhymps2 0 huscroft et al 2018 for regional groundwater flow models however using these data would not be scale wise fitting additional future field campaigns and in situ measurements could reduce the uncertainties in the groundwater model parameterization regarding the soil data for the aquifer properties the groundwater flow model is also calibrated in a steady state simulation as time series of groundwater level measurements are not available should the groundwater monitoring management has improved calibrating the groundwater flow model on transient simulation would strengthen the level of confidence and reliability of the simulation the assumption of negligible surface water storage components from the grace estimates could also be criticized see equation 1 within the grace grid covering the bandung groundwater basin there are three concentrated surface water reservoirs this could influence the grace estimation of the twsc especially considering the nature of the non uniform spatially distributed surface water that plays an important role in grace accuracy over the twsc estimates longuevergne et al 2013 in this study the surface water component is assumed negligible as they are located outside of the bandung groundwater basin despite still falling within the grace measurement grid their total surface area of less than 200 km2 is also assumed relatively insignificant compared to the grace grid size of approximately 12 000 km2 along the equator in future studies nonetheless there is an opportunity to incorporate their effects into the grace water storage estimates analysis 5 2 comparison between model simulation and grace in estimating water storage change the hydrological simulation using wflow sbm improves the results from previous studies rusli et al 2021 shown by the closer estimates of average simulated discharge to the observation and the improved kge kling et al 2012 nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and rmse the groundwater flow simulation has an r 2 of 0 895 between the simulated and observed water table elevation during model calibration the combination of two well grounded simulations increases the confidence in water storage change estimates calculated by the one way coupled models the visible time lags between the grace and model simulated water storage change estimates where grace estimates are mostly found to lag is not spotted for the first time this trend is also noticed in previous research salam et al 2020 neves et al 2020 ma et al 2021 some research found that the lag time ranges between two and four months hachborn et al 2017 rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 fatolazadeh and goïta 2021 and was spatially variable considering the seasonal pattern in the bandung groundwater basin the water storage change simulation tends to overestimate grace only during the wet seasons grey light hatched zones fig 7 and gives better results in dry seasons while its performance to detect seasonal trends has been evaluated in a number of studies getirana et al 2020 tangdamrongsub and šprlák 2021 research focusing on grace accuracy varying between different seasons is very limited additionally in this study the simulated water storage change is estimated in a basin where the slope is steeper and the elevation is higher compared to the larger area measured by grace the behavior of different responses in the water storage change during the wet seasons does make sense considering the respectively associated basin characteristics with all the above mentioned contexts involved the r between the simulation and grace estimates of 0 502 is considered acceptable as it is comparable with other basin scale research on the same topic yirdaw and snelgrove 2011 tang et al 2017 zhong et al 2018 liu et al 2020 jyolsna et al 2021 5 3 grace applicability to assess basin scale groundwater storage change the spatial scale difference between the grace measurements and the basin size as well as the local hydrological and hydrogeological properties is one of the key reasons behind the discrepancies in fig 7 although both lines represent the estimated water storage change they are measured simulated under different albeit overlaying domains the results in this paper are fully agreed with previous studies which show that despite having good agreement on water storage change estimates on a regional scale local data measurements are found to have higher variance in their values compared to grace dataset whose estimates are based on larger spatial domain zhang et al 2019 rzepecka and birylo 2020 li et al 2021 this highlights the importance of considering the spatial scale and local regional features when applying grace to assess basin scale groundwater storage changes in addition it is also important to recognize the dominant water storage component in the study area in the bandung groundwater basin the status of the soil moisture and the groundwater storage change according to the one way coupled model simulation are occasionally found in reverse the soil moisture storage sometimes decreases at the same time the groundwater storage increases this trend is also supported in other research pokhrel et al 2013 during periods when they are identified under the same state the water storage change is dominated by the change of the soil moisture component contributing up to 74 8 of the total water storage change therefore the signals captured by grace is contributed mostly by the water storage change in the shallow soil layer instead of the deeper saturated zones while both soil moisture and groundwater storage are considered the subsurface component of the water storage the term subsurface includes numerous spatial coverages from the root zones shallow vadose zones to the elastic and storage partitions of the groundwater system nevertheless in many basin scale data scarce areas where groundwater storage assessment is limited by the availability of direct observation data grace estimates are undeniably valuable rodell et al 2007 however although it could be utilized as an alternative tool to observe the groundwater storage general trend even on a basin scale domain skaskevych et al 2020 its spatial footprint should always be taken into account it covers the local contexts for example related to the existence of lakes reservoirs and coastal lines as well as the incorporated spatial characteristics variability slope elevation land use land cover etc within the measurement domain indeed general conclusions are derivable from grace estimates in regional scale basins abou zaki et al 2019 however the importance of local data when available should always be prioritized the hydrological attributes of the basin surrounding the measurement area could also impact the quality of grace estimation in this study for example the local impact of groundwater abstraction has to be detected from groundwater table measurements in observation wells near the abstraction wells grace estimates in comparison measure the storage changes on a much larger scale and are relatively insensitive to local groundwater table changes in fact it has been shown in previous studies that grace groundwater storage depletion often underestimates global hydrologic model output in heavily exploited aquifers rateb et al 2020 while both grace and modeling methods could be well quantified putting context and critical thinking in interpreting each estimate is indispensable 5 4 present status of bandung groundwater storage the result of the groundwater storage simulation fig 8 indicates unsustainable groundwater management involving many aspects from groundwater recharge to groundwater abstraction surprisingly the trend of the groundwater recharge is shown not to be falling which is in contrast to some of the previous research results of decreasing groundwater recharge under changing climates serrat capdevila et al 2007 holman et al 2009 dams et al 2012 however despite the positive gradient of the recharge regression line it is visually apparent that the recharge generally gets lower towards the end of the simulation period it is important to consider that 2010 was a significantly wet year with a high number of rainy days thus making the recharge constantly high throughout the year by removing the extreme wet year of 2010 in the groundwater recharge average calculation the trend of the recharge would reverse to a declining direction on the other hand the increasing groundwater abstraction is clearly indicated by the red bottom lines it constantly increases during the simulation period starting from an average equivalent of 0 48 mm day in 2005 to 0 76 mm day in 2018 in practice groundwater abstraction has been expanding not only in its volume but also in its flow rate and its spatial distribution in summary the combination of the changing groundwater recharge and groundwater abstraction drives groundwater storage depletion although several methods in separating climatic and anthropogenic factors to the groundwater storage changes have been developed wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 su et al 2022 our assessment clearly indicates the dominance of the human factor in the current groundwater storage depletion given the water demand situation in the bandung groundwater basin such groundwater exploitation might be unavoidable however active actions are still necessary to be taken in response to the currently depleting groundwater storage focusing on groundwater over abstraction it is very important to recognize the potential effect of multiple massive and multi layer groundwater abstractions they dwindle the groundwater table and to certain extents influence the regional groundwater flow regime wang et al 2019 directly spatially concentrated groundwater abstractions create local cones of depression sun et al 2011 indirectly groundwater abstraction from the deeper aquifers also impacts the groundwater table in the shallow aquifers as decreasing the groundwater head in lower aquifers means increasing the head gradient between aquifers zimmermann et al 2017 in the bandung groundwater basin specifically the interaction between the shallow and the deep aquifer through vertical flow leakage has even been identified previous results on high dichlorodifluoromethane cfc 12 tracing reveals young groundwater age from the groundwater samples taken in the upper layer of the deeper aquifers taufiq et al 2017 in our study such leakage is identifiable by the groundwater head changes of the confined aquifer under the industrial abstraction area fig 9 despite having spatially more concentrated and higher volumes of groundwater abstractions the average groundwater head decrease in the confined layer is relatively similar to one in the unconfined layer seemingly due to the potential leakage from the upper to the lower aquifer the dwindling groundwater tables from the upper aquifers also impact the flow characteristics exchanged between the groundwater and surface waters especially along the rivers the different gradient of groundwater storage depletion compared to the gradient of the increasing groundwater abstraction fig 8 indicates that the groundwater storage change processes cannot be explained solely by the dynamics of groundwater abstraction as they involve numerous feedback among variables associated in subsurface flows alarmingly based on the groundwater storage budget shown in fig 8 the withering groundwater storage rate is calculated at approximately 87 million m3 year the long term average groundwater storage change in the bandung groundwater basin has been negative since the beginning of the simulation the fact that the groundwater storage depletion rate is simulated in a comparable degree to both the groundwater abstraction increasing rate and the recharge decreasing rate combined signals a warning the combination of multiple groundwater table drawdowns as a consequence of human exploitation of groundwater has causal sequences on the groundwater flow regime in a bigger picture when it impacts the flow between the groundwater the river baseflow and the constant head boundaries under the currently increasing groundwater abstraction the negative trend of groundwater storage changes points out the unsustainable groundwater management policy in the bandung groundwater basin 6 conclusions in this study our objective is to quantify the basin scale water storage change in the bandung groundwater basin we achieve this by one way coupling of the hydrological model wflow sbm to the groundwater model modflow where groundwater recharge generated by the wflow sbm model simulation is used to drive the groundwater flow model the simulation result is compared to grace estimates including its uncertainty bounds with the simulation period between 2005 and 2015 the wflow sbm model is forced with chirps rainfall data and era5 derived potential evapotranspiration the groundwater flow model is parameterized using fieldwork based data we simulate the groundwater flow under changing recharge monthly and abstraction annually to assess the dynamics of the groundwater storage change to ensure consistency between the grace estimates and the rainfall data we filter out the periods after 2015 where several grace estimates are missing we also implement a cross correlation function in addition to the pearson correlation coefficient to take into account the expected signal time lag that occurred due to the spatial scale differences between the grace measurement and the one way coupled model domain this led to a cross correlation coefficient of 0 601 the combination of soil moisture storage change from wflow sbm and groundwater storage change from modflow is compared with the grace water storage change estimates visual comparison suggests good agreement between the two estimates with a cross correlation coefficient of 0 502 and 62 1 of the simulated water storage change falls within the grace estimates uncertainty bounds based on the groundwater flow model simulations the bandung groundwater basin storage is currently depleting at a rate of approximately 87 million m3 year our model simulations expose unsustainability of the current groundwater management further research on aquifers response to groundwater abstraction both locally and regionally and from both of the layers upper and lower aquifers

11642,micro and nano plastics mnps have been considered one of the major emerging contaminants that require immediate attention their potential impact on the natural ecosystems is yet to be understood especially their associations with other contaminants like heavy metals and organisms essential for the sustenance of life i e microbes microplastics mps also act as sources and carriers of pollutants similar to macro and mesoplastics that leach harmful chemicals such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps endocrine disruptive chemicals edcs etc they also behave like super sponge materials which adsorb microbes such as antibiotic resistance bacteria arbs and coronavirus making their concentration much higher than the ambient environment among these microbes heavy metal resistance mrgs and antibiotic resistance genes args carry immense significance the present study provides an in depth review analysis of the works published related to the association of mps to heavy metals and args 1526 articles were investigated after the dataset was subjected to a three stage screening process a scientometric analysis revealing details about the most productive and influential journals co authorship details most influential publications most cited keywords and most active countries in the research domain was conducted this provided significant information regarding various aspects of the published works of literature subsequently a qualitative discussion was carried out wherein a detailed discussion with regard to the trends in research on sub areas in the broad domain was conducted this resulted in identifying the gaps in the available literature which paved the way for providing a framework for future research through this study it is

extensive plastic use worldwide has led to a significant amount of its accumulation in the natural environment in fact plastic debris has become a major concern owing to its persistent nature and the ecological impacts that they possess selvam et al 2021 vivekanand et al 2021 they come in different morphologies and their continuous degradation through various environmental stressors into smaller particles of sizes 5 mm are termed mps alimi et al 2018 hebner and maurer jones 2020 chen et al 2021a these environmental stressors include the disintegration of primary mps of larger sizes kang et al

significantly contributed to the accumulation of mps in the natural ecosystem selvam et al 2021 some mps possess a great risk to human health as they have the ability to enrich persistent compounds like organics and heavy metals rochman et al 2013a 2013b wang et al 2015 qiao et al 2019 the hydrophobicity and higher specific surface areas of the mps form the primary reasons for their enhanced adsorptive capacity of both organics and inorganics li et al 2021c in addition to this complex microorganisms co exist on the mps creating an environment known as plastisphere zettler et al 2013 pinto et al 2019 these microbes are responsible for the various bio geochemical process occurring within aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems however these mps have the ability to change the structure and functioning of these microbes resulting in the disruption of the ecological functions of the ecosystems additionally mps absorb cleaning agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds qacs at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp there was a 331 increase in the bulk load of qacs compared to before the covid 19 pandemic chronic low dosages of qacs may have adverse environmental effects including acute toxicity and the development of antimicrobial resistance amr mohapatra et al 2023 there have been debates about the mps being potential vectors to different pollutants however there is no denying that they are excellent bio accumulators to different persistent contaminants at higher trophic levels such as fish zooplanktons and clams in the aquatic environment xu et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 jin et al 2018 and plants in the terrestrial ecosystem fishes often mistake mps for food and consume them as mps can trap algae or other materials mimicking as food and thus mps get accumulated in their guts finally entering their circulatory system jin et al 2018 mps not only affect aquatic animals physically and mechanically but also cause retardation in the reproductive processes block the production of enzymes and enhance oxidative stresses in them jeong et al 2016 jovanović 2017 rodriguez seijo et al 2017 zantis et al 2021 concerns about mnps are many first these polymers leak edcs in a manner akin to that of macroplastics second edcs are concentrated in mps at levels greater than those typically seen in the environment because they behave as molecular sponges ding et al 2021 a number of substances including phthalates like bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and dibutyl phthalate dbp per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas and bisphenol a bpa and its various analogues that are frequently used in the manufacturing of everyday goods including food and beverage packaging materials pose threats to both aquatic and terrestrial lives vandenberg 2021 likewise in the terrestrial ecosystem the mps start getting accumulated in the root zone of the plants these then start translocating through the shoots eventually reaching the fruits vegetables and leaves furthermore other terrestrial animals such as invertebrates also ingest mps resulting in interference with the natural hormonal functioning fertility behavioral changes impact on growth and development and other biological processes maradonna et al 2022 xu et al 2020 there have been reports of popular marine plastics containing highly hydrophobic organic pollutants hocs high microplastic sorption capability suggests the significance of mp associated hoc transmission in the marine environment when human beings and other higher trophic animals consume these aquatic and terrestrial organisms the resulting bioaccumulation of toxic compounds including trace heavy metals marks in higher associated carcinogenic risks alimba et al 2021 kumar et al 2022 another important source for mps is the wastewater treatment plants wwtps the use of various cosmetic products in our daily life has imparted large scale deposition of mps in the wwtps and it is growing each year the massive use of antibiotics in our households has led to the growth of arb gs karkman et al 2018 zhang et al 2021c effective removal of args is highly essential as it may hinder our immune system by being resistant to antibiotics it has been proven through several studies that the aerobic digestion of sludges possesses high efficacy in removing the args from the ww systems due to the swift elimination of volatile solids vs and narrow ranges of plausible args hosts jang et al 2015 also the aerobically digested sludges of the wwtps are utilized for soil conditioning purposes owing to their high nutritional values furthermore they are also used as composts in many areas for improving soil fertility eventually entering the local environment bondarczuk et al 2016 chen et al 2016 however with the growing presence of mps in the wwtps the efficacy of aerobic sludge digestion has become uncertain recent studies have indicated an increment in oxidative stress and alteration in the microbial structure due to the presence of mps thereby hindering the digestion process wu et al 2019 seeley et al 2020 moreover mps pertaining to their high surface area can provide the perfect niche for the adsorption of contaminants joo et al 2021 and the proliferation of arbs gaur et al 2023 kaur et al 2022 further studies have revealed the fate of mps in the wwtps on the sludge digestion process and have found that mps deteriorate the efficacy of the entire process zhang et al 2021c as seen from the studies conducted by researchers worldwide there has been a slight inclination toward the specific emerging domain relating to the association of mps with heavy metals and args recently however the studies have been scattered and proper documentation of the research in a single entity is missing the bibliometric analysis provides a piece of in depth knowledge of the research carried out on a specific domain thereby illustrating the trends in research and the potential gaps remaining to be explored however a systematic approach in exploring the works carried out in the past needs to be done rather than a subjective approach which leads to ambiguities keeping this in mind the present review process has been conducted through a systematic approach covering the following objectives a analysis of the prevailing topics related to mps heavy metals args and their interactions b a quantitative analysis depicting the quantum of research carried out in the research domain and finally c a qualitative analysis pointing out the trends in the research area and identifying the significant gaps in the available literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 bibliographic search the present bibliometric research was carried out employing the prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis technique the technique comprises four distinct levels a identifying b screening c eligibility and d inclusive criteria conducted in three stages as shown in fig 1 the first stage comprises identifying a reliable search engine for the literature sample and entering the most relevant keywords to the research domain in the present study scopus was chosen as the search engine in view of its diversified range of journal availability and more recently published works compared to other search engines dash and kalamdhad 2021 the keywords entered in scopus for the current research are a cumulative of 2169 documented results were initially extracted following which the sample size was subjected to screening the entire dataset was screened for different inclusive criteria i e firstly only articles published in journals were selected while those published in conference proceedings and book chapters were excluded this was done because journal articles provide a better representation of the research in any domain than any other form of publication in addition to this the subject areas which fell under the immediate scope of the study were considered as seen in fig s1 categorizing the articles into different sub areas furthermore the articles published only in english which is a common medium of communication were considered finally the duplicity of the published articles selected was removed such that there is no overlapping in the final dataset once the final dataset was selected it was ensured that appropriate use of the boolean operators was made for the search of the articles a final dataset comprising of 1672 published articles was selected for the bibliometric analyses 2 2 synopsis of the literature sample since the first study in 2011 the published literature has ranged between the years 2011 2023 with an exponentially increasing pattern over the years fig s1a the highest number of publications has come up in the last year i e in 2022 thereby suggesting the growing importance and inclination of researchers worldwide towards this domain of research given this trend it is expected that significant contributions in this area from various authors will appear in the future moreover the subject areas under which the published articles were classified indicate that environmental science accounts for nearly half of the published articles thereby contributing most to the research domain fig s1b this is followed by pharmacology toxicology and pharmaceutics agricultural and biological sciences and chemistry in almost equal proportions thereby providing us with information regarding the dominating field in the research area therefore there exists tremendous scope for researchers specializing in these areas to work in the research domain 2 3 quantitative analyses quantitative assessments or scientometric analyses were carried out using vosviewer as the platform vosviewer provides an excellent representation of the results obtained for better interpretation of the results to the readers it provides results through a network of data the nodal densities and the closeness of which correspond to the relative closeness among each parameter considered for the analyses in addition the tool also encompasses several aspects of data mining the details of which are given by hosseini et al 2018 the present study employs vosviewer to fulfill three objectives i e a loading the extracted datasets b computation analyses and visualization of the effects of different journals scholars and countries active in the research domain and d understanding the distribution of keywords and their correlations in the research domain 2 4 qualitative analyses once the scientometric analyses are carried out it is important that we understand the past and current trends in research in the domain therefore qualitative analyses are carried out on the available literature to understand the past research that has been carried out to better understand the trends in research this will help in identifying the available gaps in research which will further enable us to provide future directions in research to the particular research domain 3 results of quantitative analysis 3 1 mapping of journal sources the mapping of the journal sources involved in the research domain may be visualized in fig s2 and table 1 a minimum of 5 publications and 50 citations were chosen as the screening criteria 31 journals met the criteria which were then transferred to the vosviewer platform for better visualizations since all information may not be interpretable through fig s2 it was important that a detailed assessment report of the available journal sources contributing to the research area be provided in the network representation the nodal sizes indicate the quantum of publication from that journal and the colors of the clusters and the connecting lines indicate the relative closeness of the journals in this domain from fig s2 and tables 1 and it was seen that the journals science of the total environment journal of hazardous materials environmental pollution chemosphere ecotoxicology and environmental safety and marine pollution bulletin are among the most productive journals in this research domain with significant contributions coming from each of them in addition to this six clusters were observed for the journals each cluster depicting the relative closeness of the types of publications for instance chemosphere and aquatic toxicology were seen to publish manuscripts of similar nature this indicates the association of different journals in the publication of articles furthermore the density of the connecting lines joining the different nodes also indicates the journals that are most connected to each other apart from the density visualization table 1 provides five important statistical parameters that provide relevant information regarding the significance of each journal in the research domain it is important here to note that the most productive journal having the maximum number of publications need not be the most influential one possessing the highest average normalized citations for example the journal science of the total environment is the most productive among all journals publishing manuscripts in this area however soil biology and biochemistry has the highest average normalized citations thus becoming the most influential one this is followed by journal of hazardous materials environmental research chemical engineering journal gondwana research environmental toxicology water research environmental science and technology chemosphere science of the total environment scientific reports and environment international all having scores of more than 1 0 some of the journals may not own a higher number of publications however do possess significant contributions toward research in the research domain 3 2 keywords analysis keywords provide a comprehensive idea about the research that goes around a particular domain su and lee 2010 a network of keywords is therefore essential to identify the inter relationship between them based on the recommendations by hosseini et al 2018 and oraee et al 2017 the most frequently used author keywords were identified through the fractional counting technique in vosviewer with a minimum of 20 occurrences 34 keywords were identified as shown in table 2 and their network visualization was obtained fig s3 as expected the most frequent keyword used by the authors was microplastic followed by microplastic and heavy metals each having more than 50 counting additionally 5 clusters were obtained from the network analysis depicting the inter associations between the keywords cluster 1 red color shows studies related to mps primarily concentrating on the toxicity characteristics in marine animals such as molluscs martyniuk et al 2023 and zebrafish the emphasis was given to the bacterial growth of mps mostly polyethylene and polystyrene likewise cluster 2 yellow color shows studies related to the adsorption of heavy metals in mps while cluster 3 green color reveals studies on args on the plastisphere cluster 4 violet color indicates studies carried out on the oxidative stress of different heavy metals present in the mps while cluster 5 blue color shows studies on the biodegradation of nanoplastics nps and their molecular gene expressions so overall the network of keywords reveals the different types of studies that have been carried out in the past on this particular research domain 3 3 analysis of co authors co authorship analysis provides information regarding the mutual collaborations among researchers worldwide which helps improve their productivity and never makes them feel left out or isolated hosseini et al 2018 the present study provides data regarding the various co authors working actively in the research domain for the scientometric analysis a benchmark of having 20 publications and 100 citations was set in vosviewer to identify the most productive and influential authors in the field a cumulative of 57 authors emerged having the highest scholarly impact in the research domain their network association may be visualized in wherein it can be seen that all authors have been categorized into 5 clusters based on the similarities in their research among the authors zhang y wang j and wang y were found to be the most productive each having more than 80 articles however zhang s was found to be the most influential with the highest average normalized citations i e 2 12 other influential authors include huang y sun y and wang c with scores more than 1 5 in addition all scholars were found to be highly collaborative in their research as is seen from the high density of the nodal connecting lines 3 4 highly cited publications citations provide information regarding the importance of the research in that particular domain as it provides evidence of the number of researchers following that article in the present study articles having a minimum of 200 citations were selected which resulted in 56 out of 1672 published works table s2 avio et al 2015 were found to be the most influential article with the maximum citations to its name this was followed by brennecke et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 lei et al 2018 mahon et al 2017 wang et al 2017 kirstein et al 2016 de witte et al 2014 l lu et al 2018 and della torre et al 2014 each having at least 400 citations while the first three articles focus primarily on the effects of mps on the marine ecosystem including the bioaccumulation effects on different aquatic organisms mahon et al 2017 were among the first to study the effects of mps on the treatment processes of sewage sludges in a wastewater treatment plant likewise wang et al 2017 reported on the mps in surficial sediments in beijing providing details regarding the composition texture and nature of mps present in them he was also among the first to report the interactions of mps with the heavy metals present in the soil samples while the first studies on the effects of mps on the args removal process have been reported in 2016 bondarczuk et al 2016 chen et al 2016 few researchers have studied this area karkman et al 2018 yang et al 2019 gu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c furthermore all literature reported is more recently published and has started to grow significantly in the research domain 3 5 countries active in the research domain with a limit set to a minimum of 10 publications and 200 citations the scientometric analysis revealed 31 countries that are the most active in the research domain nearly 50 of the articles have been affiliated with one country i e china which has roughly 10 times the number of articles published by the immediate successor i e the united states table s3 this shows the volume of research being carried out by china in the research domain today china is the highest plastic producer in the world and battles a large plastic waste problem liu et al 2022 significant amounts of plastics in every form enter the oceans and other water bodies studies on mps have therefore become a hot topic of research in china however when it comes to publishing some of the most influential articles belgium tops the chart with the highest average normalized citation score 1 43 followed by mexico 1 43 hong kong 1 41 united kingdom 1 40 netherlands 1 40 australia 1 37 and malaysia 1 33 observing fig s5 it may be clearly seen that all the countries have been categorized into four clusters based on the research they carry out the nodal lines also clearly indicate that all countries are highly interlinked to each other clearly indicating that the mp problem is truly a global issue and not limited to any locality or country and that all countries must come together and strive for mutual collaborative research and their implementation to make our planet a better place 3 6 major organizations actively involved in the research domain while analyzing the database for a minimum of 5 articles and 30 citations from each organization laboratory 62 organizations were found to contribute the most in the research domain fig s6 and table s4 the university of chinese academy of sciences beijing china has the most number of documents pertaining to the research in the field of mps followed by 21 more chinese universities occupying 2nd to 22nd positions not a single university outside china could make up to the top 20 most active organizations contributing to the research domain in addition more than 80 of the articles were affiliated to some organization in china indicating the vast contributions from it this is primarily attributed to the growing concerns about plastic pollution in china as it is the highest producer of plastic waste in the world these plastics eventually affect the water bodies significantly disrupting the ecological balance in the aquatic ecosystems 4 qualitative discussion post scientometric analyses a detailed qualitative analysis was carried out identifying the current trends in the research domain followed by identification of the research gaps in the available literature and finally providing a guide to future research the details of the section are discussed as follows 4 1 past and current trends in research fig 2 shows a timeline of the research carried out in the research domain of the association of mps with microbes and heavy metals as seen from the figure the first call for research in this area was coined in 2011 by harrison et al 2011 wherein the authors coined for research on the association between marine micro organisms and synthetic thermoplastics entering the oceans the authors gave thrust to working on the effects of mps on bacteria archaea and picoeukaryotes surviving on the coastal sediments and acting as a key reference to the sustenance of life in the oceans thereafter several studies have been published in this area by different authors worldwide currently researchers talked about the synergistic effect of toxicity caused by environmental pollutants loaded in mnps and their human health impacts dusza et al 2023 sun et al 2022 khan and jia 2023 zhou et al 2022 focused on the information gap in the type of bacteria in biofilms generated on contaminated mps in heavy metal and antibiotics contaminated sewage they also demonstrated that increased selective pressure is exerted on bacterial populations by metals antibacterial agents and antibiotics and that this pressure encourages the co selection of resistance genes heavy metals pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polybrominated diethers pbds polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs and perfluorinated alkyl substances pfas have all been reported to aggressively adsorb on the surface of mps it has been discovered that weathering of mps can boost the antibiotic sorption capacity by up to 171 stapleton et al 2023 yet in another study the largest concentration of mps 14 9 items g and args 6 24 108 copies g were found in chicken faeces suggesting that chicken farms may be the main source of the co distribution of mps and args and coexist in agricultural systems yu et al 2023 the entire published dataset can be categorized into three categories based on the sub areas of research in the domain a detailed description of each sub sections is provided as follows 4 1 1 microplastics in soil sediment environment mps play a significant role in altering the bacterial functions in the soil and surficial sediments of water bodies the first study was carried out by harrison et al 2014 where the authors concluded that bacterial colonies can be rapidly formed within the low density polyethylene ldpe mps with indications for the formation of bacterial assemblages specific to a particular plastisphere ling et al 2017 reported the ubiquitous presence of mps in the coastal floor sediments with a vast majority of the mps present as large microfilaments these mps occur at significant concentrations and carry the immense potential for ingestion by aquatic organisms the elemental and chemical characterizations have been provided in detail through xrf studies turner 2017 further associations of the sediment column have revealed that microbes isolated from the sediment column have been successfully tested for the biodegradation of the mps their growth kinetics have been reported by auta et al 2018 similar studies on mp degradation through bacterial isolation from the sediments were also carried out nanthini devi et al 2021 other investigations include understanding the aging dynamics of mps in the sediments chen et al 2021b wherein it was observed that the mps subjected to varying anoxic oxic conditions in the bottom sediments aged the most providing a basis for the engineered optimizations of mp degradation process it has been seen that ph plays a dominant role in the plastisphere bacterial communities in sediments li et al 2021a there have been many published articles where researchers have attempted to understand the impacts of mps on soil fertility agricultural productivity through the effects on the microbial community in the soil affecting the nutrient cycle of the soil as well as the toxicity effects of heavy metals blöcker et al 2020 dong et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 gao et al 2021 guo et al 2021 li et al 2021b 2021d ng et al 2021 rong et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 4 1 2 microplastics in aquatic ecosystem the studies on the effects of mps on aquatic ecosystems include toxicological studies that include the biomarkers for potential toxicity including neuro toxicity and cardiovascular toxicity among different plants and animals avio et al 2015 karami et al 2016 2017 heindler et al 2017 sleight et al 2017 barboza et al 2018 espinosa et al 2018 granby et al 2018 ji et al 2018 jin et al 2018 lei et al 2018 rainieri et al 2018 salvaggio et al 2019 bhagat et al 2021 limonta et al 2021 parra et al 2021 sun et al 2021 teng et al 2021 huang et al 2022 ingestion of mps mazurais et al 2015 gene exchange studies in aquatic ecosystems arias andres et al 2018 abundance of mps in ocean bohdan 2022 and degradation transformation of hms by mps zhang et al 2021b these studies provide detailed insights into the association of mps with different macrobenthic aquatic communities and how they alter the natural processes of the entire ecosystems which include rivers oceans and wetlands 4 1 3 microplastics and heavy metals studies on the association of mps with heavy metals started with the spatial variability chemical characterization composition surface textures and their associated interactions abbasi et al 2017 wang et al 2017 dobaradaran et al 2018 vedolin et al 2018 mohsen et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 ta and babel 2020 this was followed by the sorption behavior adsorption desorption of mps with regard to heavy metals turner and holmes 2015 wang et al 2015 2020b kedzierski et al 2018 mao et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zou et al 2020 lin et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 the final set of studies primarily focused on the sorption effects of the heavy metals on various aquatic animals and their toxicological effects upon long term exposure lu et al 2018 borges ramírez et al 2021 gonzález fernández et al 2021 selvam et al 2021 sheng et al 2021 xu et al 2021 4 1 4 microplastics and microbes args the associations of args and microbes with mps started with understanding the biogeochemistry of the plastisphere which were the first reported studies in the sub domain of research amaral zettler et al 2015 foulon et al 2016 gonzález pleiter et al 2021 szabó et al 2021 these studies primarily focused on next gen dna sequencing to understand the microbial characterization of the mps this helped in determining the microbial communities prevailing within the plastisphere to better understand their interactions with mps with respect to different aspects such as mp degradation another important aspect covered by the researchers is the studies concerning the microbial associations with mps i e the args and metal resistant genes the first major breakthrough was provided by yang et al 2019 who were the first to find that the size of the mps actually does not have any influence on the density and diversity of the resistant genes both metal and antibiotic resistant they also observed that the metal resistant genes had significantly higher abundances than the args and postulated an important observation plastics being a reservoir for both types of resistant genes lu et al 2019 studied on the distribution of the args in an aquatic ecosystem concerning mps and water columns the authors concluded that the distribution and diversification of args on mps were much higher compared to the water column in the order of 103 they too reported mps acting as arg reservoirs furthermore studies were carried out on the fate and impact of args on mps in different systems such as soil lu et al 2020 yan et al 2020 ding et al 2021 wang et al 2021a water bodies wang et al 2020a hu et al 2021 sewage sludges and wastewater treatment plants dai et al 2020 wang et al 2020c 2021b 2021c cui et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a 2021c zhao et al 2021 and landfills shi et al 2020 2021 su et al 2021 all studies cite the negative effects of the args on the various natural functions due to the interferences of the mps 4 2 gaps in the available literature and a way forward the present literature dataset clearly suggests that the research area is relatively new and only a handful of research has been reported there lies immense scope for future research in this domain fig 3 presents a framework connecting the present research to the future some of the aspects that need to be addressed in the future are listed as follows firstly we see that the studies on the associations of heavy metals and mps have been primarily focused on the soil sediment systems even on water bodies there is limited evidence where the water column or the wastewater systems have been taken into account therefore there exists a considerable gap in research on this aspect and water and wastewater systems may be taken into consideration in the future furthermore it is observed that the mps in conjunction with the args and the heavy metal resistant genes hmrgs have been studied primarily focusing on the sewage sludges however these sludges after digestion are applied on land as compost or organic manure hence there is every possibility that the mps along with args and hmrgs may affect the soil conditioning process and thereby reduce the efficacy of the manure in enhancing soil fertility research in this direction is highly encouraged in addition there is limited evidence of literature on the fate and transport of these mps associated with args and hmrgs this is particularly essential due to the dynamics of the transport mechanisms of the emerging contaminants rendering them extremely vulnerable to increasing their toxicity levels in various environmental ecosystems there are very few studies on the availability of heavy metals in different forms the available fractions of the heavy metals are still unclear therefore research in this direction cannot be ignored finally there were no studies revealing the bioaccumulation potential of the args and hmrgs associated with mps it is important to have a clear idea regarding the effects of these contaminants when they pass on to higher trophic levels therefore future research in this direction is highly recommended 5 concluding remarks keeping in view the united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs which call for a unified approach towards protecting the planet from any contamination either present or emerging it is important to understand the growing importance of studies on mnps that are emerging as possible future contaminants therefore a holistic and comprehensive approach to reviewing published articles to gain a deep understanding of the various research being conducted worldwide is essential the present study provides the readers with a detailed analysis of all the works carried out on this emerging subject a total of 689 articles were analyzed after the due screening process and the following key observations were noted there is emerging importance of this research domain which is confirmed through the growing number of published articles over the years especially in the recent past the scientometric analysis provided us with significant information regarding several aspects such as the most productive and influential journals frequently used keywords authorship details publications carrying the most significant and the countries that have actively contributed to the research in the domain science of the total environment was found to be the most productive journal whereas chemical engineering journal was found to be the most influential one maximum publications were seen to have been contributed by china with more than five times the numbers obtained for the next country and seven times for the third nation post scientometric analysis a qualitative discussion was conducted the past and current trends in the research were discussed that provided ideas with which various researchers worldwide have proceeded with their research through the sub domains in addition to this the gaps in the available research were identified and future directives were given that will help in further research while the current review is limited to the literature sample extracted from scopus there may exist some uncertainty if we consider other search engines as well furthermore the screening was done to accommodate those articles which are most perceived however overall this review article will provide substantial information and knowledge regarding the dynamics of the published literature in this research domain and will prove consequential to all readers and researchers current and future worldwide who wish to undertake research in this area due to their large surface area and high adsorption abilities mnps introduce different contaminants into the environment and living organisms the most frequent impact in animals plants and or microbes is synergistic enhancement the information on the behavior of mnps in a different environment is inconsistent and the cytotoxic properties of mnp loaded contaminants and their toxicity pathway are poorly known therefore it is important for academicians to focus more on illustrating how composite pollutants move and interact in the ecosystem funding the authors declare that no funds grants or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

11642,micro and nano plastics mnps have been considered one of the major emerging contaminants that require immediate attention their potential impact on the natural ecosystems is yet to be understood especially their associations with other contaminants like heavy metals and organisms essential for the sustenance of life i e microbes microplastics mps also act as sources and carriers of pollutants similar to macro and mesoplastics that leach harmful chemicals such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps endocrine disruptive chemicals edcs etc they also behave like super sponge materials which adsorb microbes such as antibiotic resistance bacteria arbs and coronavirus making their concentration much higher than the ambient environment among these microbes heavy metal resistance mrgs and antibiotic resistance genes args carry immense significance the present study provides an in depth review analysis of the works published related to the association of mps to heavy metals and args 1526 articles were investigated after the dataset was subjected to a three stage screening process a scientometric analysis revealing details about the most productive and influential journals co authorship details most influential publications most cited keywords and most active countries in the research domain was conducted this provided significant information regarding various aspects of the published works of literature subsequently a qualitative discussion was carried out wherein a detailed discussion with regard to the trends in research on sub areas in the broad domain was conducted this resulted in identifying the gaps in the available literature which paved the way for providing a framework for future research through this study it is expected that the readers will be exposed to a summary of the overall research that has been conducted to date and the manuscript will act as a guide for future research graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics nanoplastics antibiotic resistance bacteria and genes heavy metals antimicrobial resistance data availability i have attached all data along with the manuscript 1 introduction extensive plastic use worldwide has led to a significant amount of its accumulation in the natural environment in fact plastic debris has become a major concern owing to its persistent nature and the ecological impacts that they possess selvam et al 2021 vivekanand et al 2021 they come in different morphologies and their continuous degradation through various environmental stressors into smaller particles of sizes 5 mm are termed mps alimi et al 2018 hebner and maurer jones 2020 chen et al 2021a these environmental stressors include the disintegration of primary mps of larger sizes kang et al 2015 lusher et al 2015 rummel et al 2016 akhbarizadeh et al 2019 hebner and maurer jones 2020 selvam et al 2021 degradation through photo oxidation uv radiation and biological transformation by microorganisms de sá et al 2018 akhbarizadeh et al 2019 ali et al 2019 feng et al 2019 aslam et al 2020 ferreira et al 2020 of all the industries the pharmaceutical paint and cosmetics industries have significantly contributed to the accumulation of mps in the natural ecosystem selvam et al 2021 some mps possess a great risk to human health as they have the ability to enrich persistent compounds like organics and heavy metals rochman et al 2013a 2013b wang et al 2015 qiao et al 2019 the hydrophobicity and higher specific surface areas of the mps form the primary reasons for their enhanced adsorptive capacity of both organics and inorganics li et al 2021c in addition to this complex microorganisms co exist on the mps creating an environment known as plastisphere zettler et al 2013 pinto et al 2019 these microbes are responsible for the various bio geochemical process occurring within aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems however these mps have the ability to change the structure and functioning of these microbes resulting in the disruption of the ecological functions of the ecosystems additionally mps absorb cleaning agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds qacs at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp there was a 331 increase in the bulk load of qacs compared to before the covid 19 pandemic chronic low dosages of qacs may have adverse environmental effects including acute toxicity and the development of antimicrobial resistance amr mohapatra et al 2023 there have been debates about the mps being potential vectors to different pollutants however there is no denying that they are excellent bio accumulators to different persistent contaminants at higher trophic levels such as fish zooplanktons and clams in the aquatic environment xu et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 jin et al 2018 and plants in the terrestrial ecosystem fishes often mistake mps for food and consume them as mps can trap algae or other materials mimicking as food and thus mps get accumulated in their guts finally entering their circulatory system jin et al 2018 mps not only affect aquatic animals physically and mechanically but also cause retardation in the reproductive processes block the production of enzymes and enhance oxidative stresses in them jeong et al 2016 jovanović 2017 rodriguez seijo et al 2017 zantis et al 2021 concerns about mnps are many first these polymers leak edcs in a manner akin to that of macroplastics second edcs are concentrated in mps at levels greater than those typically seen in the environment because they behave as molecular sponges ding et al 2021 a number of substances including phthalates like bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and dibutyl phthalate dbp per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas and bisphenol a bpa and its various analogues that are frequently used in the manufacturing of everyday goods including food and beverage packaging materials pose threats to both aquatic and terrestrial lives vandenberg 2021 likewise in the terrestrial ecosystem the mps start getting accumulated in the root zone of the plants these then start translocating through the shoots eventually reaching the fruits vegetables and leaves furthermore other terrestrial animals such as invertebrates also ingest mps resulting in interference with the natural hormonal functioning fertility behavioral changes impact on growth and development and other biological processes maradonna et al 2022 xu et al 2020 there have been reports of popular marine plastics containing highly hydrophobic organic pollutants hocs high microplastic sorption capability suggests the significance of mp associated hoc transmission in the marine environment when human beings and other higher trophic animals consume these aquatic and terrestrial organisms the resulting bioaccumulation of toxic compounds including trace heavy metals marks in higher associated carcinogenic risks alimba et al 2021 kumar et al 2022 another important source for mps is the wastewater treatment plants wwtps the use of various cosmetic products in our daily life has imparted large scale deposition of mps in the wwtps and it is growing each year the massive use of antibiotics in our households has led to the growth of arb gs karkman et al 2018 zhang et al 2021c effective removal of args is highly essential as it may hinder our immune system by being resistant to antibiotics it has been proven through several studies that the aerobic digestion of sludges possesses high efficacy in removing the args from the ww systems due to the swift elimination of volatile solids vs and narrow ranges of plausible args hosts jang et al 2015 also the aerobically digested sludges of the wwtps are utilized for soil conditioning purposes owing to their high nutritional values furthermore they are also used as composts in many areas for improving soil fertility eventually entering the local environment bondarczuk et al 2016 chen et al 2016 however with the growing presence of mps in the wwtps the efficacy of aerobic sludge digestion has become uncertain recent studies have indicated an increment in oxidative stress and alteration in the microbial structure due to the presence of mps thereby hindering the digestion process wu et al 2019 seeley et al 2020 moreover mps pertaining to their high surface area can provide the perfect niche for the adsorption of contaminants joo et al 2021 and the proliferation of arbs gaur et al 2023 kaur et al 2022 further studies have revealed the fate of mps in the wwtps on the sludge digestion process and have found that mps deteriorate the efficacy of the entire process zhang et al 2021c as seen from the studies conducted by researchers worldwide there has been a slight inclination toward the specific emerging domain relating to the association of mps with heavy metals and args recently however the studies have been scattered and proper documentation of the research in a single entity is missing the bibliometric analysis provides a piece of in depth knowledge of the research carried out on a specific domain thereby illustrating the trends in research and the potential gaps remaining to be explored however a systematic approach in exploring the works carried out in the past needs to be done rather than a subjective approach which leads to ambiguities keeping this in mind the present review process has been conducted through a systematic approach covering the following objectives a analysis of the prevailing topics related to mps heavy metals args and their interactions b a quantitative analysis depicting the quantum of research carried out in the research domain and finally c a qualitative analysis pointing out the trends in the research area and identifying the significant gaps in the available literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 bibliographic search the present bibliometric research was carried out employing the prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis technique the technique comprises four distinct levels a identifying b screening c eligibility and d inclusive criteria conducted in three stages as shown in fig 1 the first stage comprises identifying a reliable search engine for the literature sample and entering the most relevant keywords to the research domain in the present study scopus was chosen as the search engine in view of its diversified range of journal availability and more recently published works compared to other search engines dash and kalamdhad 2021 the keywords entered in scopus for the current research are a cumulative of 2169 documented results were initially extracted following which the sample size was subjected to screening the entire dataset was screened for different inclusive criteria i e firstly only articles published in journals were selected while those published in conference proceedings and book chapters were excluded this was done because journal articles provide a better representation of the research in any domain than any other form of publication in addition to this the subject areas which fell under the immediate scope of the study were considered as seen in fig s1 categorizing the articles into different sub areas furthermore the articles published only in english which is a common medium of communication were considered finally the duplicity of the published articles selected was removed such that there is no overlapping in the final dataset once the final dataset was selected it was ensured that appropriate use of the boolean operators was made for the search of the articles a final dataset comprising of 1672 published articles was selected for the bibliometric analyses 2 2 synopsis of the literature sample since the first study in 2011 the published literature has ranged between the years 2011 2023 with an exponentially increasing pattern over the years fig s1a the highest number of publications has come up in the last year i e in 2022 thereby suggesting the growing importance and inclination of researchers worldwide towards this domain of research given this trend it is expected that significant contributions in this area from various authors will appear in the future moreover the subject areas under which the published articles were classified indicate that environmental science accounts for nearly half of the published articles thereby contributing most to the research domain fig s1b this is followed by pharmacology toxicology and pharmaceutics agricultural and biological sciences and chemistry in almost equal proportions thereby providing us with information regarding the dominating field in the research area therefore there exists tremendous scope for researchers specializing in these areas to work in the research domain 2 3 quantitative analyses quantitative assessments or scientometric analyses were carried out using vosviewer as the platform vosviewer provides an excellent representation of the results obtained for better interpretation of the results to the readers it provides results through a network of data the nodal densities and the closeness of which correspond to the relative closeness among each parameter considered for the analyses in addition the tool also encompasses several aspects of data mining the details of which are given by hosseini et al 2018 the present study employs vosviewer to fulfill three objectives i e a loading the extracted datasets b computation analyses and visualization of the effects of different journals scholars and countries active in the research domain and d understanding the distribution of keywords and their correlations in the research domain 2 4 qualitative analyses once the scientometric analyses are carried out it is important that we understand the past and current trends in research in the domain therefore qualitative analyses are carried out on the available literature to understand the past research that has been carried out to better understand the trends in research this will help in identifying the available gaps in research which will further enable us to provide future directions in research to the particular research domain 3 results of quantitative analysis 3 1 mapping of journal sources the mapping of the journal sources involved in the research domain may be visualized in fig s2 and table 1 a minimum of 5 publications and 50 citations were chosen as the screening criteria 31 journals met the criteria which were then transferred to the vosviewer platform for better visualizations since all information may not be interpretable through fig s2 it was important that a detailed assessment report of the available journal sources contributing to the research area be provided in the network representation the nodal sizes indicate the quantum of publication from that journal and the colors of the clusters and the connecting lines indicate the relative closeness of the journals in this domain from fig s2 and tables 1 and it was seen that the journals science of the total environment journal of hazardous materials environmental pollution chemosphere ecotoxicology and environmental safety and marine pollution bulletin are among the most productive journals in this research domain with significant contributions coming from each of them in addition to this six clusters were observed for the journals each cluster depicting the relative closeness of the types of publications for instance chemosphere and aquatic toxicology were seen to publish manuscripts of similar nature this indicates the association of different journals in the publication of articles furthermore the density of the connecting lines joining the different nodes also indicates the journals that are most connected to each other apart from the density visualization table 1 provides five important statistical parameters that provide relevant information regarding the significance of each journal in the research domain it is important here to note that the most productive journal having the maximum number of publications need not be the most influential one possessing the highest average normalized citations for example the journal science of the total environment is the most productive among all journals publishing manuscripts in this area however soil biology and biochemistry has the highest average normalized citations thus becoming the most influential one this is followed by journal of hazardous materials environmental research chemical engineering journal gondwana research environmental toxicology water research environmental science and technology chemosphere science of the total environment scientific reports and environment international all having scores of more than 1 0 some of the journals may not own a higher number of publications however do possess significant contributions toward research in the research domain 3 2 keywords analysis keywords provide a comprehensive idea about the research that goes around a particular domain su and lee 2010 a network of keywords is therefore essential to identify the inter relationship between them based on the recommendations by hosseini et al 2018 and oraee et al 2017 the most frequently used author keywords were identified through the fractional counting technique in vosviewer with a minimum of 20 occurrences 34 keywords were identified as shown in table 2 and their network visualization was obtained fig s3 as expected the most frequent keyword used by the authors was microplastic followed by microplastic and heavy metals each having more than 50 counting additionally 5 clusters were obtained from the network analysis depicting the inter associations between the keywords cluster 1 red color shows studies related to mps primarily concentrating on the toxicity characteristics in marine animals such as molluscs martyniuk et al 2023 and zebrafish the emphasis was given to the bacterial growth of mps mostly polyethylene and polystyrene likewise cluster 2 yellow color shows studies related to the adsorption of heavy metals in mps while cluster 3 green color reveals studies on args on the plastisphere cluster 4 violet color indicates studies carried out on the oxidative stress of different heavy metals present in the mps while cluster 5 blue color shows studies on the biodegradation of nanoplastics nps and their molecular gene expressions so overall the network of keywords reveals the different types of studies that have been carried out in the past on this particular research domain 3 3 analysis of co authors co authorship analysis provides information regarding the mutual collaborations among researchers worldwide which helps improve their productivity and never makes them feel left out or isolated hosseini et al 2018 the present study provides data regarding the various co authors working actively in the research domain for the scientometric analysis a benchmark of having 20 publications and 100 citations was set in vosviewer to identify the most productive and influential authors in the field a cumulative of 57 authors emerged having the highest scholarly impact in the research domain their network association may be visualized in wherein it can be seen that all authors have been categorized into 5 clusters based on the similarities in their research among the authors zhang y wang j and wang y were found to be the most productive each having more than 80 articles however zhang s was found to be the most influential with the highest average normalized citations i e 2 12 other influential authors include huang y sun y and wang c with scores more than 1 5 in addition all scholars were found to be highly collaborative in their research as is seen from the high density of the nodal connecting lines 3 4 highly cited publications citations provide information regarding the importance of the research in that particular domain as it provides evidence of the number of researchers following that article in the present study articles having a minimum of 200 citations were selected which resulted in 56 out of 1672 published works table s2 avio et al 2015 were found to be the most influential article with the maximum citations to its name this was followed by brennecke et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 lei et al 2018 mahon et al 2017 wang et al 2017 kirstein et al 2016 de witte et al 2014 l lu et al 2018 and della torre et al 2014 each having at least 400 citations while the first three articles focus primarily on the effects of mps on the marine ecosystem including the bioaccumulation effects on different aquatic organisms mahon et al 2017 were among the first to study the effects of mps on the treatment processes of sewage sludges in a wastewater treatment plant likewise wang et al 2017 reported on the mps in surficial sediments in beijing providing details regarding the composition texture and nature of mps present in them he was also among the first to report the interactions of mps with the heavy metals present in the soil samples while the first studies on the effects of mps on the args removal process have been reported in 2016 bondarczuk et al 2016 chen et al 2016 few researchers have studied this area karkman et al 2018 yang et al 2019 gu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c furthermore all literature reported is more recently published and has started to grow significantly in the research domain 3 5 countries active in the research domain with a limit set to a minimum of 10 publications and 200 citations the scientometric analysis revealed 31 countries that are the most active in the research domain nearly 50 of the articles have been affiliated with one country i e china which has roughly 10 times the number of articles published by the immediate successor i e the united states table s3 this shows the volume of research being carried out by china in the research domain today china is the highest plastic producer in the world and battles a large plastic waste problem liu et al 2022 significant amounts of plastics in every form enter the oceans and other water bodies studies on mps have therefore become a hot topic of research in china however when it comes to publishing some of the most influential articles belgium tops the chart with the highest average normalized citation score 1 43 followed by mexico 1 43 hong kong 1 41 united kingdom 1 40 netherlands 1 40 australia 1 37 and malaysia 1 33 observing fig s5 it may be clearly seen that all the countries have been categorized into four clusters based on the research they carry out the nodal lines also clearly indicate that all countries are highly interlinked to each other clearly indicating that the mp problem is truly a global issue and not limited to any locality or country and that all countries must come together and strive for mutual collaborative research and their implementation to make our planet a better place 3 6 major organizations actively involved in the research domain while analyzing the database for a minimum of 5 articles and 30 citations from each organization laboratory 62 organizations were found to contribute the most in the research domain fig s6 and table s4 the university of chinese academy of sciences beijing china has the most number of documents pertaining to the research in the field of mps followed by 21 more chinese universities occupying 2nd to 22nd positions not a single university outside china could make up to the top 20 most active organizations contributing to the research domain in addition more than 80 of the articles were affiliated to some organization in china indicating the vast contributions from it this is primarily attributed to the growing concerns about plastic pollution in china as it is the highest producer of plastic waste in the world these plastics eventually affect the water bodies significantly disrupting the ecological balance in the aquatic ecosystems 4 qualitative discussion post scientometric analyses a detailed qualitative analysis was carried out identifying the current trends in the research domain followed by identification of the research gaps in the available literature and finally providing a guide to future research the details of the section are discussed as follows 4 1 past and current trends in research fig 2 shows a timeline of the research carried out in the research domain of the association of mps with microbes and heavy metals as seen from the figure the first call for research in this area was coined in 2011 by harrison et al 2011 wherein the authors coined for research on the association between marine micro organisms and synthetic thermoplastics entering the oceans the authors gave thrust to working on the effects of mps on bacteria archaea and picoeukaryotes surviving on the coastal sediments and acting as a key reference to the sustenance of life in the oceans thereafter several studies have been published in this area by different authors worldwide currently researchers talked about the synergistic effect of toxicity caused by environmental pollutants loaded in mnps and their human health impacts dusza et al 2023 sun et al 2022 khan and jia 2023 zhou et al 2022 focused on the information gap in the type of bacteria in biofilms generated on contaminated mps in heavy metal and antibiotics contaminated sewage they also demonstrated that increased selective pressure is exerted on bacterial populations by metals antibacterial agents and antibiotics and that this pressure encourages the co selection of resistance genes heavy metals pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polybrominated diethers pbds polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs and perfluorinated alkyl substances pfas have all been reported to aggressively adsorb on the surface of mps it has been discovered that weathering of mps can boost the antibiotic sorption capacity by up to 171 stapleton et al 2023 yet in another study the largest concentration of mps 14 9 items g and args 6 24 108 copies g were found in chicken faeces suggesting that chicken farms may be the main source of the co distribution of mps and args and coexist in agricultural systems yu et al 2023 the entire published dataset can be categorized into three categories based on the sub areas of research in the domain a detailed description of each sub sections is provided as follows 4 1 1 microplastics in soil sediment environment mps play a significant role in altering the bacterial functions in the soil and surficial sediments of water bodies the first study was carried out by harrison et al 2014 where the authors concluded that bacterial colonies can be rapidly formed within the low density polyethylene ldpe mps with indications for the formation of bacterial assemblages specific to a particular plastisphere ling et al 2017 reported the ubiquitous presence of mps in the coastal floor sediments with a vast majority of the mps present as large microfilaments these mps occur at significant concentrations and carry the immense potential for ingestion by aquatic organisms the elemental and chemical characterizations have been provided in detail through xrf studies turner 2017 further associations of the sediment column have revealed that microbes isolated from the sediment column have been successfully tested for the biodegradation of the mps their growth kinetics have been reported by auta et al 2018 similar studies on mp degradation through bacterial isolation from the sediments were also carried out nanthini devi et al 2021 other investigations include understanding the aging dynamics of mps in the sediments chen et al 2021b wherein it was observed that the mps subjected to varying anoxic oxic conditions in the bottom sediments aged the most providing a basis for the engineered optimizations of mp degradation process it has been seen that ph plays a dominant role in the plastisphere bacterial communities in sediments li et al 2021a there have been many published articles where researchers have attempted to understand the impacts of mps on soil fertility agricultural productivity through the effects on the microbial community in the soil affecting the nutrient cycle of the soil as well as the toxicity effects of heavy metals blöcker et al 2020 dong et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 gao et al 2021 guo et al 2021 li et al 2021b 2021d ng et al 2021 rong et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 4 1 2 microplastics in aquatic ecosystem the studies on the effects of mps on aquatic ecosystems include toxicological studies that include the biomarkers for potential toxicity including neuro toxicity and cardiovascular toxicity among different plants and animals avio et al 2015 karami et al 2016 2017 heindler et al 2017 sleight et al 2017 barboza et al 2018 espinosa et al 2018 granby et al 2018 ji et al 2018 jin et al 2018 lei et al 2018 rainieri et al 2018 salvaggio et al 2019 bhagat et al 2021 limonta et al 2021 parra et al 2021 sun et al 2021 teng et al 2021 huang et al 2022 ingestion of mps mazurais et al 2015 gene exchange studies in aquatic ecosystems arias andres et al 2018 abundance of mps in ocean bohdan 2022 and degradation transformation of hms by mps zhang et al 2021b these studies provide detailed insights into the association of mps with different macrobenthic aquatic communities and how they alter the natural processes of the entire ecosystems which include rivers oceans and wetlands 4 1 3 microplastics and heavy metals studies on the association of mps with heavy metals started with the spatial variability chemical characterization composition surface textures and their associated interactions abbasi et al 2017 wang et al 2017 dobaradaran et al 2018 vedolin et al 2018 mohsen et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 ta and babel 2020 this was followed by the sorption behavior adsorption desorption of mps with regard to heavy metals turner and holmes 2015 wang et al 2015 2020b kedzierski et al 2018 mao et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zou et al 2020 lin et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 the final set of studies primarily focused on the sorption effects of the heavy metals on various aquatic animals and their toxicological effects upon long term exposure lu et al 2018 borges ramírez et al 2021 gonzález fernández et al 2021 selvam et al 2021 sheng et al 2021 xu et al 2021 4 1 4 microplastics and microbes args the associations of args and microbes with mps started with understanding the biogeochemistry of the plastisphere which were the first reported studies in the sub domain of research amaral zettler et al 2015 foulon et al 2016 gonzález pleiter et al 2021 szabó et al 2021 these studies primarily focused on next gen dna sequencing to understand the microbial characterization of the mps this helped in determining the microbial communities prevailing within the plastisphere to better understand their interactions with mps with respect to different aspects such as mp degradation another important aspect covered by the researchers is the studies concerning the microbial associations with mps i e the args and metal resistant genes the first major breakthrough was provided by yang et al 2019 who were the first to find that the size of the mps actually does not have any influence on the density and diversity of the resistant genes both metal and antibiotic resistant they also observed that the metal resistant genes had significantly higher abundances than the args and postulated an important observation plastics being a reservoir for both types of resistant genes lu et al 2019 studied on the distribution of the args in an aquatic ecosystem concerning mps and water columns the authors concluded that the distribution and diversification of args on mps were much higher compared to the water column in the order of 103 they too reported mps acting as arg reservoirs furthermore studies were carried out on the fate and impact of args on mps in different systems such as soil lu et al 2020 yan et al 2020 ding et al 2021 wang et al 2021a water bodies wang et al 2020a hu et al 2021 sewage sludges and wastewater treatment plants dai et al 2020 wang et al 2020c 2021b 2021c cui et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a 2021c zhao et al 2021 and landfills shi et al 2020 2021 su et al 2021 all studies cite the negative effects of the args on the various natural functions due to the interferences of the mps 4 2 gaps in the available literature and a way forward the present literature dataset clearly suggests that the research area is relatively new and only a handful of research has been reported there lies immense scope for future research in this domain fig 3 presents a framework connecting the present research to the future some of the aspects that need to be addressed in the future are listed as follows firstly we see that the studies on the associations of heavy metals and mps have been primarily focused on the soil sediment systems even on water bodies there is limited evidence where the water column or the wastewater systems have been taken into account therefore there exists a considerable gap in research on this aspect and water and wastewater systems may be taken into consideration in the future furthermore it is observed that the mps in conjunction with the args and the heavy metal resistant genes hmrgs have been studied primarily focusing on the sewage sludges however these sludges after digestion are applied on land as compost or organic manure hence there is every possibility that the mps along with args and hmrgs may affect the soil conditioning process and thereby reduce the efficacy of the manure in enhancing soil fertility research in this direction is highly encouraged in addition there is limited evidence of literature on the fate and transport of these mps associated with args and hmrgs this is particularly essential due to the dynamics of the transport mechanisms of the emerging contaminants rendering them extremely vulnerable to increasing their toxicity levels in various environmental ecosystems there are very few studies on the availability of heavy metals in different forms the available fractions of the heavy metals are still unclear therefore research in this direction cannot be ignored finally there were no studies revealing the bioaccumulation potential of the args and hmrgs associated with mps it is important to have a clear idea regarding the effects of these contaminants when they pass on to higher trophic levels therefore future research in this direction is highly recommended 5 concluding remarks keeping in view the united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs which call for a unified approach towards protecting the planet from any contamination either present or emerging it is important to understand the growing importance of studies on mnps that are emerging as possible future contaminants therefore a holistic and comprehensive approach to reviewing published articles to gain a deep understanding of the various research being conducted worldwide is essential the present study provides the readers with a detailed analysis of all the works carried out on this emerging subject a total of 689 articles were analyzed after the due screening process and the following key observations were noted there is emerging importance of this research domain which is confirmed through the growing number of published articles over the years especially in the recent past the scientometric analysis provided us with significant information regarding several aspects such as the most productive and influential journals frequently used keywords authorship details publications carrying the most significant and the countries that have actively contributed to the research in the domain science of the total environment was found to be the most productive journal whereas chemical engineering journal was found to be the most influential one maximum publications were seen to have been contributed by china with more than five times the numbers obtained for the next country and seven times for the third nation post scientometric analysis a qualitative discussion was conducted the past and current trends in the research were discussed that provided ideas with which various researchers worldwide have proceeded with their research through the sub domains in addition to this the gaps in the available research were identified and future directives were given that will help in further research while the current review is limited to the literature sample extracted from scopus there may exist some uncertainty if we consider other search engines as well furthermore the screening was done to accommodate those articles which are most perceived however overall this review article will provide substantial information and knowledge regarding the dynamics of the published literature in this research domain and will prove consequential to all readers and researchers current and future worldwide who wish to undertake research in this area due to their large surface area and high adsorption abilities mnps introduce different contaminants into the environment and living organisms the most frequent impact in animals plants and or microbes is synergistic enhancement the information on the behavior of mnps in a different environment is inconsistent and the cytotoxic properties of mnp loaded contaminants and their toxicity pathway are poorly known therefore it is important for academicians to focus more on illustrating how composite pollutants move and interact in the ecosystem funding the authors declare that no funds grants or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

11643,over exploitation of groundwater resources in jordan has resulted in the depletion and degradation of many groundwater aquifers most aquifers are heavily exploited and are expected to dry up by 2040 these pressing challenges require jordan to find creative and sustainable solutions since the annual natural groundwater recharge rate is limited to 0 1 5 managed aquifer recharge is a proposed solution for jordan to enhance recharge the spreading technique is one method used to deliberately recharge water into groundwater aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefits this study presents a tool based on a geographic information system multi criteria analysis to identify the potential sites for groundwater recharge in jordan using the spreading technique large sets of spatial data were used to develop a potential site suitability map for managed aquifer recharge spreading methods the criteria were chosen based on technical economic and environmental considerations the site assessment combined fourteen thematic maps to create suitability maps using the weighted linear combination approach which were combined with constraint mapping using the boolean logic constraint mapping showed that nearly 47 7198 km2 of the study area did not meet the minimum criteria the site assessment criteria on the remaining areas showed that about 4 618 7 km2 of the study area has low suitability 14 2123 km2 has moderate suitability 20 3101 km2 is suitable and 15 2388 km2 is highly suitable managed aquifer recharge has a great potential in the relief of water stress in arid areas existing geospatial tools and the increasing availability of spatial data are a great asset to local authorities in water planners graphical abstract image 1 keywords site selection managed aquifer recharge spreading technique arid regions gis mcda jordan data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction jordan is one of the most water scarce countries globally and is ranked second amongst the poorest countries regarding per capita water availability al naber and molle 2017 the scarcity of surface water resources in jordan has increased the pressure on groundwater to cover the increasing water demands especially during the last three decades where overexploitation of groundwater exceeded the natural replenishment brückner et al 2021 almomani et al 2018 this has led to the depletion and degradation of groundwater quality and quantity in many aquifers some of which are expected to dry up by 2040 margane and al dweiri 2020 furthermore population growth industrial development and environmental impacts of climate change are expected to increase the water demands in the future and reduce the per capita water share to 40 l per capita per day according to some scenarios yoon et al 2021 according to jordan s ministry of water and irrigation mwi the climate is characterized by extremely high evaporation rates 93 in 2017 and high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation water yearbook 2018 mwi 2018 the natural groundwater recharge rate in jordan is limited to 0 1 5 of the rainfall and occurs through indirect recharge in the valley basins scanlon et al 2006 therefore managed aquifer recharge mar is a promising solution to increase groundwater recharge reduce water stress and mitigate the impacts of climate change in the future mar is increasingly utilized globally to reduce the rate of groundwater decline minimize seawater intrusion improve groundwater quality through the soil aquifer geo purification use aquifers as water conveyance systems and inject surface water into the aquifer in areas where groundwater is traditionally preferred over surface water for drinking bouwer 2002 zhu et al 2000 other purposes for mar include storing surface water floods or reclaimed wastewater for future use asano 1985 mar is also used to reduce floods and flood damage increase urban comfort land value reduce aquifer salinity improve water supplies and increase environmental flows in original catchments dillon et al 2009 mar is defined in several ways todd 2004 defined it as the processes of increasing the natural movement of surface water in the subsurface by surface water spreading or artificially changing natural conditions zhu et al 2000 defined mar as the deliberate recharge of water into aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefits mar techniques differ from one another in construction operation and costs examples of mar techniques are a the spreading method sm gale et al 2002 b the in channel modification method im sallwey et al 2019 c the well shaft and borehole recharge wsb method zhu et al 2000 d rainwater and runoff harvesting rwh gale et al 2002 e and induced bank filtration ibf dupont 2018 for developing countries with arid and semi arid climates low cost mar methods such as the sm are probably most suitable gale et al 2002 groundwater recharge occurs only when enough water is available to flow underground and infiltrate into the saturated zone bouwer 2002 therefore mar site assessment and decision making applications utilize several hydrogeological factors such as slope drainage and land use land cover and different climatic parameters to identify potential suitable sites for mar rahman et al 2013 the integration of geographic information system gis and multiple criteria decision analysis mcda results in the most useful tools for analyses of environmental issues jelokhani niaraki et al 2018 gis mcda is defined as the procedures to identify the best alternative solution among various possibilities to aid in decision making by collecting converting and integrating spatial data malczewski 2006 mcda has been accepted worldwide as a highly effective tool for dealing with complex decision making agarwal and garg 2016 integrating mcda technologies with gis has led to significant advances in traditional map overlay methods for site suitability analysis rahman et al 2013 mcda for mar utilizes a wide range of hydrogeological and climatic factors that vary from one case study to another based on data availability and the specific objectives of each study table 1 summarizes a thorough review of different methodologies used in 18 cited papers investigating mar suitable sites nearly 88 of the reviewed studies were in semi arid climates in total 37 different thematic parameters were counted within this review in descending order the most frequently used criteria are slope depth to the water table geology land use land cover soil texture and distance from a waterbody the present study aims to assess suitable sites in jordan for using the spreading method in mar a gis mcda analysis tool will be utilized our geographical focus will be on the semi arid areas of north west jordan furthermore we will investigate the availability of excess treated wastewater tww as a potential resource for the mar 2 study area 2 1 overview of the study area the study area in north west jordan is a semi arid area that includes six surface basins with varying hydrogeological characteristics namely the north river side wadis nrsw basin the jordan valley jv basin the yarmouk river yar basin the amman zarqa az basin the dead sea ds basin and the south river side wadis srsw basin are shown in fig 1 the study area is nearly 15 430 km2 constituting 17 of jordan s total area based on a 30 m resolution digital elevation model usgs 2021 the elevation of the study area ranges from 434 m below sea level at the dead sea to 1854 m above sea level m asl at jebel umm el dami the climate varies mediterranean in the western parts of the study area to arid and semi arid moving into the eastern and southern parts of the study area average monthly temperatures in the northern parts range between 8 and 26 c while in the southern areas it ranges from 16 to 33 c margane and al dweiri 2020 the winter period when most of the precipitation occurs starts from september october till april may precipitation ranges from 600 mm year in the north to 100 mm year as we move into the south mwi 2019 the land cover consists of bare soils and rocks 75 crops and various forms of vegetation 9 urban areas 7 and the remaining area 9 is covered by valley wadi deposits and mudflats as seen in fig 2 surface water sources in the study area include the jordan river the yarmouk river and the zarqa river 2 2 hydrogeological description of the area an assessment of the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area is conducted nine hydrogeological units are identified see figure 3 from youngest to oldest as following the alluvium aquifer is located in the jordan valley it is considered a vital aquifer made up of unconsolidated sediments accumulated in the depression of the jordan valley and the soil covered deposits are composed of sand and gravel water yearbook 2018 mwi 2018 the basalt aquifer generally overlies sedimentary formations and extends from southwestern syria through eastern jordan into saudi arabia the b4 b5 aquifer consists mainly of limestone and appears in jordan s eastern and most northern parts steinel et al 2016a b c the aquifer is used on a large scale within the jafar and azraq basins for irrigation activities which has led to a decline in the water level and water quality the b3 aquife which is an aquitard consists of chalky to marly paleogene limestone with a minor insert of chert steinel et al 2016a b c the b2 a7 aquifer one of jordan s most important groundwater aquifers consists of fractured sedimentary rocks such as carbonates and chert enabling large amounts of groundwater storage the a7 b2 rocks appear in jordan s western and southern parts water yearbook 2018 mwi 2018 the a1 a6 group consist of several formations that belong to the upper cretaceous ajlun group it is usually grouped as the a1 a6 aquitard when working nationwide it is exposed along the edge of the jordan valley and consists of limestone and marl it includes the a1 a2 and a4 aquifers which are essential for the water supply at the local scale especially where the overlying a7 b2 aquifer has nearly dried up and includes the naur formation a1 2 which is composed of intercalations of limestone and relatively thin layers of marl and marly limestone the a4 and a5 a6 units cannot be distinguished from each other south of the siwaqa fault brückner et al 2017 the a1 a6 unit comprises several geological formations making it an aquifer in some parts and an aquitard in others therefore this group cannot be considered an aquifer or aquitard in addition to the fact that the areas regarded as aquitard have fractures and joints because of their geologic formation that increases the recharge water yearbook 2018 mwi 2018 the kurnub aquifer k is a sandstone aquifer and is widely exposed along the edge of the jordan valley and the southern part of jordan the zarqa aquifer z consists of sandstone siltstone limestone and dolomite and is exposed along the edge of the jordan valley finally the ram aquifer is a sandstone aquifer exposed along the wadi araba dead sea rift valley in the southern part of jordan it is known as the disi group 2 3 additional available water resources for mar the study area hosts 14 dams and 12 waste water treatment plants wwtps of various sizes and capacities as shown in tables 2 a and 2b most of the water in these dams and wwtps is destined for agricultural use but certain reserves usually remain at the end of the year and these might be considered available for mar purposes table 2a shows the inflow outflow and water reserve volumes in each dam at the end of 2018 table 2 b shows the inflow outflow and the tww reuse percentage of each wwtps in 2018 mwi 2018 based on these numbers we estimate that 123 721 mcm was available for mar at the end of 2018 3 methods this section details and explains the methodology adopted in this research fig 4 is a flowchart that illustrates the 4 main steps of the methodology in the first step spatial input data are compiled and spatially processed in the second step constraint maps are generated these maps represent areas that will be excluded from the assessment because they are not suitable for mar thirdly 14 different thematical spatial data layers are created these layers include 14 different themes as will be explained later finally the suitability map is generated by processing the constraint maps with the thematical layers as will be described in more detail in a later section see fig 5 3 1 geoprocessing the required spatial data was collected from various governmental and private institutions including the ministry of water and irrigation mwi the ministry of energy and mineral resources menr the ministry of agriculture moa and bundesanstalt für geowissenschaften und rohstoffe bgr in jordan table 3 shows the full list of datasets used for this research 3 2 constraint mapping constraint maps are developed to delineate areas excluded from the analysis at the outset the boolean logic assessment technique which allows ratings as suitable or unsuitable 0 and 1 values is used to identify such areas to determine the excluded areas from the analysis six criteria were considered as follows areas with slope 12 these areas are considered unsuitable for mar sites because the basin s build up operation and maintenance becomes complicated unfeasible and water infiltration may not be assured gdoura et al 2015 land cover land use lulc urban areas water bodies quarries dry and wet mudflats and agricultural fields are land cover classes that were excluded from the analysis due to the unsuitability for mar vegetation areas were excluded due to sediment fertilizer and pesticide input in agricultural areas and conflicts of interest in these areas steinel et al 2016a b c rahman et al 2013 and mahdavi et al 2013 excluded lulc within urban areas natural forests and planted forests for this study the constraint map for lulc include the following classes urban areas water bodies quarry sites as well as dry and wet mudflats due to their very limited infiltration capacity as for agricultural areas they are also excluded due to sediment fertilizer and pesticide inputs and the risk of groundwater contamination depth to groundwater table unsaturated zone 10 m or 200 m these areas are considered constraint areas suitable sites should have at least a 5 m thick unsaturated zone representing the vadose zone thickness where water is treated before reaching the groundwater table ahmadi et al 2017 groundwater depths larger than 200 m are usually not favorable for mar due to the increased length of time for water to reach the aquifer aquifer thickness 20 m aquifer thickness is as important a criterion as are the overall aquifer criteria such as the transmissivity and aquifer storage volume rahman et al 2013 therefore the higher the aquifer thickness value the higher the priority thus areas with aquifers less than 20 m in thickness are excluded from the analysis especially since the minimum accepted unsaturated zone is 10 m precipitation 50 mm year these areas are considered constraint areas because they are not economically feasible only if the slopes were high to allow most of the runoff to reach the mar site steinel et al 2016a b c hydrogeology aquitard formations are considered constraint areas because they have very low permeability 3 3 mcda suitability mapping the weighted linear combination wlc method is used to identify the suitability sites and rank them in order of suitability the wlc approach assigns weights for each criterion and ranks values based on relative importance for each sub criteria the final score can be obtained by summation multiplying weight and rank rate as shown in equation 1 esquivel et al 2015 the highest absolute value indicates the most suitable option 1 s i n w i r i where si suitability index w i weights for each criterion r i rank for each criterion layers of constraint after excluding certain areas by applying the constraint map technique the remaining sites are evaluated according to the mcda approach to identify potential mar sites the mcda classifies each criterion into highly suitable areas value 4 suitable areas value 3 moderately suitable areas value 2 low suitability areas value 1 and unsuitable areas value 0 all prepared maps were ranked using the wlc method and extracted in raster format with a cell size of 30 m 30 m with the palestinian belt 1923 coordinate system 4 results and discussion applying mar techniques is very important to jordan due to its arid nature and the very limited natural groundwater recharge rates rainfall scarcity and overexploitation of groundwater have placed high pressure on water resources and created an urgent need to find and apply different innovative techniques to replenish overused groundwater basins and increase the available water resources one of such techniques not widely used in jordan is the spreading method geographic information system gis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda were integrated using large sets of technical economic and environmental criteria to select the most promising sites in western jordan to apply the spreading method in using treated wastewater for groundwater recharge is not popular and still used on a limited scale in jordan where treated wastewater is mostly used for agricultural purposes only this gave the novelty of this research 4 1 mcda for the spreading method 4 1 1 technical criteria the technical criteria used in the mar site assessment is presented and explained herein it includes 11 thematic parameters the slope land cover soil texture soil thickness hydrogeology depth to the groundwater aquifer thickness distance from faults distance from the main road precipitation and drainage density table 4 lists the thematic parameters with their classes ranks weights and thresholds 4 1 1 1 slope the slope is an essential factor in determining suitable mar sites because it controls processes such as infiltration runoff and erosion mahdavi et al 2013 the maximum permitted slope value its weight and rank vary with the aim of the study mar purpose and mar techniques gdoura et al 2015 pedrero et al 2011 and anane et al 2008 studied aquifer recharge with reclaimed water a slope of 12 was considered as the threshold as it is the maximum permitted value to ensure mar feasibility above this value the basin s build up operation and maintenance become complicated furthermore the water infiltration may not be assured fig 6 a represents the classification of the slope within the study area based on the classifications in table 4 4 1 1 2 land use land cover lulc is another critical indicator of the suitability of the site for mar singh et al 2013 lulc controls the behavior of water flow over terrain surfaces and the recharge process several parameters describe this effect including soil type and thickness bare rocks vegetation and agriculture each parameter affects water recharge in a different and complex manner hammouri et al 2014 lulc which are excluded from the analysis based on the constraint mapping procedure are indicated earlier for the mar suitability map two lulc classes are included open areas and forests with a rank equal to 1 and bare rocks and pasture with a rank equal to 2 lulc with pastures sands bare soil bare rocks wadi deposits and chert plains are considered very suitable sites and ranked 4 fig 6 b 4 1 1 3 soil texture and thickness soil texture is essential to describe the infiltration capabilities runoff potential and permeability rates these factors control the rate at which water enters the soil from the upper surface and determine the rate of water movement within the interconnecting voids and vacuoles vishwakarma et al 2020 water flow into the soil is affected by texture structure and other factors such as layers of soil features water flow rate is a function of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks controlled by pore size distribution and tortuosity of flow paths for example clay is characterized by a small pore size and a highly tortuous flow path with low ks a soil texture map was prepared using the data from level one scale 1 250 000 and level two 1 50 000 soil survey that was carried out in jordan in the 1990s by the moa the classes for soil texture depend on the soil type description and infiltration rate clay sandy clay and silty clay have very slow permeability according to the permeability class table 4 which is regarded as the worst condition for recharge and as such is ranked one and classified as low suitability however the soil with dominant sand loamy sand and coarse sand have rapid and very rapid permeability and as such presents optimal conditions for recharge and is hence classified as very suitable and ranked 4 fig 6 c soil thickness helps determine the infiltration capacity and the soil s moisture holding capacity steinel et al 2016a b c for recharge purposes it is preferable to have thin soils to ensure fast infiltration however a minimum soil thickness is usually desired to ensure improved infiltrated water quality therefore the suitability of soils with a thickness of less than 20 cm is considered low while soils with a thickness between 20 and 50 cm are considered highly suitable and ranked 4 fig 6 d 4 1 1 4 aquifer hydrogeology an aquifer is an underground layer consisting of porous and permeable rocks that allow it to store and transmit water meanwhile an aquitard is an underground water barrier a compact layer of clay silt or rock that prevents water from flowing underground in this context mar sites should be located on top of aquifers and not aquitards in order to allow t the spreading technique methods to work alluvial and sand aquifers result in high recharge rates due to their high permeability and response to rainfall fuentes and vervoort 2020 in this study the ram kurnub alluvium and zarqa aquifers were considered highly suitable for mar and rated 4 because they usually have high permeability the b2 a7 was also considered highly suitable because it consists of fractured sedimentary rocks such as carbonates and chert which enables it to carry large amounts of groundwater basalt aquifers are highly fractured as well so they are considered suitable for mar and ranked at 3 finally b4 b5 aquifers are considered moderately suitable because of the water s high salinity and are ranked at 2 check table 4 and fig 6 e for the hydrogeological classification results 4 1 1 5 depth to the groundwater table vadose zone the distance from the ground surface to the groundwater table is unsaturated and is also called the vadose zone an essential criterion to consider for mar analysis along this depth infiltrated water is treated before reaching the groundwater table thus suitable sites for mar should have at least a 5 m thick unsaturated zone ahmadi et al 2017 or according to the studies of rahman et al 2013 and steinel et al 2016b a 10 m threshold for groundwater table depth for this study 10 m was is chosen as the threshold for groundwater table depth to ensure a minimum risk of groundwater pollution the depth to groundwater table ranging from 10 to 50 m is given a high rank while the areas with a depth to groundwater table less than 10 m or greater than 200 m are considered unsuitable sites table 4 describes the depth to groundwater table criteria weight rank classification and the threshold used figure 6f shows the suitability map of the study area based on the depth to groundwater table 4 1 1 6 aquifer thickness aquifer thickness affects transmissivity and storage volume therefore it is an important parameter to consider for mar rahman et al 2013 the higher the aquifer thickness value the higher the suitability for mar sites the aquifer thickness threshold used in the studies of rahman et al 2013 and steinel et al 2016a b c was 10 m and 20 m respectively for this study the aquifer thickness for the top aquifer and the given ranks are shown in table 4 aquifer thickness of less than 20 m were considered unsuitable and thus were give a 0 rank and excluded from the analysis as a constraint in comparison aquifers with a thickness of more than 50 m were considered optimal for mar and ranked 4 areas with no data on aquifer thickness are considered of low suitability for mar and rated by 1 areas with the kurnub and disi sandstone aquifers or the alluvial aquifer in the jordan valley have no thickness data brückner et al 2017 but cannot be excluded from the site selection so they are ranked by 1 the aquifer thickness suitability map of the study area is shown in figure 6g 4 1 1 7 distance from major faults faults provide good flow paths and enhance vertical hydraulic conductivity for rapid infiltration steinel et al 2016a b c however rapid infiltration causes incomplete water treatment ahmadi et al 2017 a buffer zone around the major faults is thus recommended and has been considered in this study fig 6 h 4 1 1 8 infrastructure assessment for the construction and maintenance of mar sites access to the site must be easy however care must be taken to avoid vandalism so selected sites must not be easily visible from the main road additionally a shorter distance from main roads increases the possibility of surface water contamination from the various pollutants usually present on road surfaces steinel et al 2016a b c therefore the infrastructure assessment for this study includes the assessment of roads and railroads for the site access and easy maintenance of the mar site a buffer of 400 m from the road is considered the main roads buffer is shown in fig 6 i 4 1 1 9 drainage density the drainage pattern of any topography reflects the characteristics of surface formations and underground formations fenta and ki 2015 drainage density is expressed in terms of channel length per unit area km km2 fuentes and vervoort 2020 which refers to an expression of proximity to channel spacing that provides a quantitative measure of the average length of flow channels within different parts of the entire basin singh et al 2013 drainage density is an essential factor in recharge assessment as it is an inverse function of permeability usually areas with very high drainage density are poorly recharged therefore it indirectly indicates the appropriateness of the site for mar fuentes and vervoort 2020 fenta and ki 2015 singh et al 2013 the drainage density was created for each surface basin and combined with the stream length divided by the watershed area in arcmap using the watershed s dem a flow direction map was built using the flow direction hydrology tool a raster of accumulated flow into each cell was then created using the flow accumulation tool finally the streams network for the watershed was built then the rank was assigned to classify the study area for mar site selection purposes fig 6 j 4 1 1 10 precipitation the amount of precipitation is considered an important criterion affecting groundwater recharge fenta and ki 2015 recharge is usually negligible for areas with precipitation less than 50 mm year steinel et al 2016a b c in this research an area with less than 50 mm year precipitation was considered unsuitable for mar and ranked zero in contrast regions with precipitation greater or equal to 200 mm year were deemed highly suitable sites and ranked 4 as described in table 4 classification of the study area based on its precipitation is shown in fig 6 k 4 1 2 environmental criteria as a result of improper site selection pollutants such as wastewater can cause the contamination of drinking groundwater supplies ahmadi et al 2017 therefore buffer areas around groundwater drinking sources have been considered in this research kallali et al 2007 used a 500 m buffer around a hill reservoir whereas anane et al 2008 used a 200 m buffer steinel et al 2016b took a 0 5 km distance buffer from active government wells ahmadi et al 2017 used a buffer area of 150 m around streams and 300 m buffer around dug wells in this study a safeguard distance of at least 300 m around active wells is considered fig 6 l and a buffer of 500 m around water bodies dams lake springs river canals fig 6 m is also defined to avoid their contamination 4 1 3 economic criteria in this study we have identified dams and wwtps that might have excess water that can be utilized for mar however it is important to avoid high water transport costs of these waters to the potential mar sites therefore distance from such water resources is considered in the mar sites suitability mapping for economic consideration hence areas outside a buffer of 8000 m from such water resources are considered unsuitable for mar sites fig 6 n 4 2 constraint mapping constraint mapping resulted in excluding 47 7187 km2 of the total study area 15 430 km2 fig 7 shows the areas that are excluded from the analysis according to the constraint mapping criterion explained earlier and summarized in table 5 4 3 spreading method suitability map areas that were not excluded as a result of constraint mapping are assessed for suitability for mar using the spreading method in total fourteen different technical environmental and economic criteria were used in the suitability assessment the final suitability score values varied from 0 to 154 using the natural breaks jenks areas are classified into five suitability classes fig 8 1 unsuitable value 0 2 low suitability values of 0 112 3 moderately suitable values of 112 124 4 suitable values of 124 133 5 highly suitable values of 133 154 the assessment indicates that 46 65 of the study area is unsuitable constraint area for mar spreading method 4 01 has low suitability 13 76 has moderate suitability 20 10 is suitable and 15 48 is highly suitable as shown in fig 8 without the constraint map for the spreading method site selection the assessment shows that 10 54 of the study area has low suitability 27 38 is moderately suitable 31 42 is suitable and 30 66 is highly suitable fig 9 5 conclusions mar suitability maps have been prepared for possible incorporation into sustainable groundwater management plans to assist decision makers in jordan after determining the potential area for mar based on technical environmental and economic criteria it is recommended to add the land ownership map to the suitability maps a case study was developed to determine potentially suitable sites for groundwater recharge in west jordan fourteen thematic maps were used to create two potential maps using mcda gis for the spreading method the criteria were chosen following technical economic and environmental considerations the potential map procedure used the gis based multi criteria to generate constraint maps with boolean logic and the suitability maps used wlc for potential sites the suitability maps assessment showed that 46 65 of the study area did not fulfill the minimum criteria constraint mapping while applying the 14 site assessment criteria using wlc showed that about 4 01 has low suitability 13 76 has moderate suitability 20 10 is suitable and 15 48 is highly suitable in conclusion it is evident that spatial planning is useful to identify potential locations for mar significant areas can be utilized as the results of this research show even more significant volumes of rainfall are lost to evaporation especially in arid areas therefore we argue that mar has a great potential in the relief of water stress in arid areas existing geospatial tools and the increasing availability of spatial data are a great asset to

11643,over exploitation of groundwater resources in jordan has resulted in the depletion and degradation of many groundwater aquifers most aquifers are heavily exploited and are expected to dry up by 2040 these pressing challenges require jordan to find creative and sustainable solutions since the annual natural groundwater recharge rate is limited to 0 1 5 managed aquifer recharge is a proposed solution for jordan to enhance recharge the spreading technique is one method used to deliberately recharge water into groundwater aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefits this study presents a tool based on a geographic information system multi criteria analysis to identify the potential sites for groundwater recharge in jordan using the spreading technique large sets of spatial data were used to develop a potential site suitability map for managed aquifer recharge spreading methods the criteria were chosen based on technical economic and environmental considerations the site assessment combined fourteen thematic maps to create suitability maps using the weighted linear combination approach which were combined with constraint mapping using the boolean logic constraint mapping showed that nearly 47 7198 km2 of the study area did not meet the minimum criteria the site assessment criteria on the remaining areas showed that about 4 618 7 km2 of the study area has low suitability 14 2123 km2 has moderate suitability 20 3101 km2 is suitable and 15 2388 km2 is highly suitable managed aquifer recharge has a great potential in the relief of water stress in arid areas existing geospatial tools and the increasing availability of spatial data are a great asset to local authorities in water planners graphical abstract image 1 keywords site selection managed aquifer recharge spreading technique arid regions gis mcda jordan data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction jordan is one of the most water scarce countries globally and is ranked second amongst the poorest countries regarding per capita water availability al naber and molle 2017 the scarcity of surface water resources in jordan has increased the pressure on groundwater to cover the increasing water demands especially during the last three decades where overexploitation of groundwater exceeded the natural replenishment brückner et al 2021 almomani et al 2018 this has led to the depletion and degradation of groundwater quality and quantity in many aquifers some of which are expected to dry up by 2040 margane and al dweiri 2020 furthermore population growth industrial development and environmental impacts of climate change are expected to increase the water demands in the future and reduce the per capita water share to 40 l per capita per day according to some scenarios yoon et al 2021 according to jordan s ministry of water and irrigation mwi the climate is characterized by extremely high evaporation rates 93 in 2017 and high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation water yearbook 2018 mwi 2018 the natural groundwater recharge rate in jordan is limited to 0 1 5 of the rainfall and occurs through indirect recharge in the valley basins scanlon et al 2006 therefore managed aquifer recharge mar is a promising solution to increase groundwater recharge reduce water stress and mitigate the impacts of climate change in the future mar is increasingly utilized globally to reduce the rate of groundwater decline minimize seawater intrusion improve groundwater quality through the soil aquifer geo purification use aquifers as water conveyance systems and inject surface water into the aquifer in areas where groundwater is traditionally preferred over surface water for drinking bouwer 2002 zhu et al 2000 other purposes for mar include storing surface water floods or reclaimed wastewater for future use asano 1985 mar is also used to reduce floods and flood damage increase urban comfort land value reduce aquifer salinity improve water supplies and increase environmental flows in original catchments dillon et al 2009 mar is defined in several ways todd 2004 defined it as the processes of increasing the natural movement of surface water in the subsurface by surface water spreading or artificially changing natural conditions zhu et al 2000 defined mar as the deliberate recharge of water into aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefits mar techniques differ from one another in construction operation and costs examples of mar techniques are a the spreading method sm gale et al 2002 b the in channel modification method im sallwey et al 2019 c the well shaft and borehole recharge wsb method zhu et al 2000 d rainwater and runoff harvesting rwh gale et al 2002 e and induced bank filtration ibf dupont 2018 for developing countries with arid and semi arid climates low cost mar methods such as the sm are probably most suitable gale et al 2002 groundwater recharge occurs only when enough water is available to flow underground and infiltrate into the saturated zone bouwer 2002 therefore mar site assessment and decision making applications utilize several hydrogeological factors such as slope drainage and land use land cover and different climatic parameters to identify potential suitable sites for mar rahman et al 2013 the integration of geographic information system gis and multiple criteria decision analysis mcda results in the most useful tools for analyses of environmental issues jelokhani niaraki et al 2018 gis mcda is defined as the procedures to identify the best alternative solution among various possibilities to aid in decision making by collecting converting and integrating spatial data malczewski 2006 mcda has been accepted worldwide as a highly effective tool for dealing with complex decision making agarwal and garg 2016 integrating mcda technologies with gis has led to significant advances in traditional map overlay methods for site suitability analysis rahman et al 2013 mcda for mar utilizes a wide range of hydrogeological and climatic factors that vary from one case study to another based on data availability and the specific objectives of each study table 1 summarizes a thorough review of different methodologies used in 18 cited papers investigating mar suitable sites nearly 88 of the reviewed studies were in semi arid climates in total 37 different thematic parameters were counted within this review in descending order the most frequently used criteria are slope depth to the water table geology land use land cover soil texture and distance from a waterbody the present study aims to assess suitable sites in jordan for using the spreading method in mar a gis mcda analysis tool will be utilized our geographical focus will be on the semi arid areas of north west jordan furthermore we will investigate the availability of excess treated wastewater tww as a potential resource for the mar 2 study area 2 1 overview of the study area the study area in north west jordan is a semi arid area that includes six surface basins with varying hydrogeological characteristics namely the north river side wadis nrsw basin the jordan valley jv basin the yarmouk river yar basin the amman zarqa az basin the dead sea ds basin and the south river side wadis srsw basin are shown in fig 1 the study area is nearly 15 430 km2 constituting 17 of jordan s total area based on a 30 m resolution digital elevation model usgs 2021 the elevation of the study area ranges from 434 m below sea level at the dead sea to 1854 m above sea level m asl at jebel umm el dami the climate varies mediterranean in the western parts of the study area to arid and semi arid moving into the eastern and southern parts of the study area average monthly temperatures in the northern parts range between 8 and 26 c while in the southern areas it ranges from 16 to 33 c margane and al dweiri 2020 the winter period when most of the precipitation occurs starts from september october till april may precipitation ranges from 600 mm year in the north to 100 mm year as we move into the south mwi 2019 the land cover consists of bare soils and rocks 75 crops and various forms of vegetation 9 urban areas 7 and the remaining area 9 is covered by valley wadi deposits and mudflats as seen in fig 2 surface water sources in the study area include the jordan river the yarmouk river and the zarqa river 2 2 hydrogeological description of the area an assessment of the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area is conducted nine hydrogeological units are identified see figure 3 from youngest to oldest as following the alluvium aquifer is located in the jordan valley it is considered a vital aquifer made up of unconsolidated sediments accumulated in the depression of the jordan valley and the soil covered deposits are composed of sand and gravel water yearbook 2018 mwi 2018 the basalt aquifer generally overlies sedimentary formations and extends from southwestern syria through eastern jordan into saudi arabia the b4 b5 aquifer consists mainly of limestone and appears in jordan s eastern and most northern parts steinel et al 2016a b c the aquifer is used on a large scale within the jafar and azraq basins for irrigation activities which has led to a decline in the water level and water quality the b3 aquife which is an aquitard consists of chalky to marly paleogene limestone with a minor insert of chert steinel et al 2016a b c the b2 a7 aquifer one of jordan s most important groundwater aquifers consists of fractured sedimentary rocks such as carbonates and chert enabling large amounts of groundwater storage the a7 b2 rocks appear in jordan s western and southern parts water yearbook 2018 mwi 2018 the a1 a6 group consist of several formations that belong to the upper cretaceous ajlun group it is usually grouped as the a1 a6 aquitard when working nationwide it is exposed along the edge of the jordan valley and consists of limestone and marl it includes the a1 a2 and a4 aquifers which are essential for the water supply at the local scale especially where the overlying a7 b2 aquifer has nearly dried up and includes the naur formation a1 2 which is composed of intercalations of limestone and relatively thin layers of marl and marly limestone the a4 and a5 a6 units cannot be distinguished from each other south of the siwaqa fault brückner et al 2017 the a1 a6 unit comprises several geological formations making it an aquifer in some parts and an aquitard in others therefore this group cannot be considered an aquifer or aquitard in addition to the fact that the areas regarded as aquitard have fractures and joints because of their geologic formation that increases the recharge water yearbook 2018 mwi 2018 the kurnub aquifer k is a sandstone aquifer and is widely exposed along the edge of the jordan valley and the southern part of jordan the zarqa aquifer z consists of sandstone siltstone limestone and dolomite and is exposed along the edge of the jordan valley finally the ram aquifer is a sandstone aquifer exposed along the wadi araba dead sea rift valley in the southern part of jordan it is known as the disi group 2 3 additional available water resources for mar the study area hosts 14 dams and 12 waste water treatment plants wwtps of various sizes and capacities as shown in tables 2 a and 2b most of the water in these dams and wwtps is destined for agricultural use but certain reserves usually remain at the end of the year and these might be considered available for mar purposes table 2a shows the inflow outflow and water reserve volumes in each dam at the end of 2018 table 2 b shows the inflow outflow and the tww reuse percentage of each wwtps in 2018 mwi 2018 based on these numbers we estimate that 123 721 mcm was available for mar at the end of 2018 3 methods this section details and explains the methodology adopted in this research fig 4 is a flowchart that illustrates the 4 main steps of the methodology in the first step spatial input data are compiled and spatially processed in the second step constraint maps are generated these maps represent areas that will be excluded from the assessment because they are not suitable for mar thirdly 14 different thematical spatial data layers are created these layers include 14 different themes as will be explained later finally the suitability map is generated by processing the constraint maps with the thematical layers as will be described in more detail in a later section see fig 5 3 1 geoprocessing the required spatial data was collected from various governmental and private institutions including the ministry of water and irrigation mwi the ministry of energy and mineral resources menr the ministry of agriculture moa and bundesanstalt für geowissenschaften und rohstoffe bgr in jordan table 3 shows the full list of datasets used for this research 3 2 constraint mapping constraint maps are developed to delineate areas excluded from the analysis at the outset the boolean logic assessment technique which allows ratings as suitable or unsuitable 0 and 1 values is used to identify such areas to determine the excluded areas from the analysis six criteria were considered as follows areas with slope 12 these areas are considered unsuitable for mar sites because the basin s build up operation and maintenance becomes complicated unfeasible and water infiltration may not be assured gdoura et al 2015 land cover land use lulc urban areas water bodies quarries dry and wet mudflats and agricultural fields are land cover classes that were excluded from the analysis due to the unsuitability for mar vegetation areas were excluded due to sediment fertilizer and pesticide input in agricultural areas and conflicts of interest in these areas steinel et al 2016a b c rahman et al 2013 and mahdavi et al 2013 excluded lulc within urban areas natural forests and planted forests for this study the constraint map for lulc include the following classes urban areas water bodies quarry sites as well as dry and wet mudflats due to their very limited infiltration capacity as for agricultural areas they are also excluded due to sediment fertilizer and pesticide inputs and the risk of groundwater contamination depth to groundwater table unsaturated zone 10 m or 200 m these areas are considered constraint areas suitable sites should have at least a 5 m thick unsaturated zone representing the vadose zone thickness where water is treated before reaching the groundwater table ahmadi et al 2017 groundwater depths larger than 200 m are usually not favorable for mar due to the increased length of time for water to reach the aquifer aquifer thickness 20 m aquifer thickness is as important a criterion as are the overall aquifer criteria such as the transmissivity and aquifer storage volume rahman et al 2013 therefore the higher the aquifer thickness value the higher the priority thus areas with aquifers less than 20 m in thickness are excluded from the analysis especially since the minimum accepted unsaturated zone is 10 m precipitation 50 mm year these areas are considered constraint areas because they are not economically feasible only if the slopes were high to allow most of the runoff to reach the mar site steinel et al 2016a b c hydrogeology aquitard formations are considered constraint areas because they have very low permeability 3 3 mcda suitability mapping the weighted linear combination wlc method is used to identify the suitability sites and rank them in order of suitability the wlc approach assigns weights for each criterion and ranks values based on relative importance for each sub criteria the final score can be obtained by summation multiplying weight and rank rate as shown in equation 1 esquivel et al 2015 the highest absolute value indicates the most suitable option 1 s i n w i r i where si suitability index w i weights for each criterion r i rank for each criterion layers of constraint after excluding certain areas by applying the constraint map technique the remaining sites are evaluated according to the mcda approach to identify potential mar sites the mcda classifies each criterion into highly suitable areas value 4 suitable areas value 3 moderately suitable areas value 2 low suitability areas value 1 and unsuitable areas value 0 all prepared maps were ranked using the wlc method and extracted in raster format with a cell size of 30 m 30 m with the palestinian belt 1923 coordinate system 4 results and discussion applying mar techniques is very important to jordan due to its arid nature and the very limited natural groundwater recharge rates rainfall scarcity and overexploitation of groundwater have placed high pressure on water resources and created an urgent need to find and apply different innovative techniques to replenish overused groundwater basins and increase the available water resources one of such techniques not widely used in jordan is the spreading method geographic information system gis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda were integrated using large sets of technical economic and environmental criteria to select the most promising sites in western jordan to apply the spreading method in using treated wastewater for groundwater recharge is not popular and still used on a limited scale in jordan where treated wastewater is mostly used for agricultural purposes only this gave the novelty of this research 4 1 mcda for the spreading method 4 1 1 technical criteria the technical criteria used in the mar site assessment is presented and explained herein it includes 11 thematic parameters the slope land cover soil texture soil thickness hydrogeology depth to the groundwater aquifer thickness distance from faults distance from the main road precipitation and drainage density table 4 lists the thematic parameters with their classes ranks weights and thresholds 4 1 1 1 slope the slope is an essential factor in determining suitable mar sites because it controls processes such as infiltration runoff and erosion mahdavi et al 2013 the maximum permitted slope value its weight and rank vary with the aim of the study mar purpose and mar techniques gdoura et al 2015 pedrero et al 2011 and anane et al 2008 studied aquifer recharge with reclaimed water a slope of 12 was considered as the threshold as it is the maximum permitted value to ensure mar feasibility above this value the basin s build up operation and maintenance become complicated furthermore the water infiltration may not be assured fig 6 a represents the classification of the slope within the study area based on the classifications in table 4 4 1 1 2 land use land cover lulc is another critical indicator of the suitability of the site for mar singh et al 2013 lulc controls the behavior of water flow over terrain surfaces and the recharge process several parameters describe this effect including soil type and thickness bare rocks vegetation and agriculture each parameter affects water recharge in a different and complex manner hammouri et al 2014 lulc which are excluded from the analysis based on the constraint mapping procedure are indicated earlier for the mar suitability map two lulc classes are included open areas and forests with a rank equal to 1 and bare rocks and pasture with a rank equal to 2 lulc with pastures sands bare soil bare rocks wadi deposits and chert plains are considered very suitable sites and ranked 4 fig 6 b 4 1 1 3 soil texture and thickness soil texture is essential to describe the infiltration capabilities runoff potential and permeability rates these factors control the rate at which water enters the soil from the upper surface and determine the rate of water movement within the interconnecting voids and vacuoles vishwakarma et al 2020 water flow into the soil is affected by texture structure and other factors such as layers of soil features water flow rate is a function of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks controlled by pore size distribution and tortuosity of flow paths for example clay is characterized by a small pore size and a highly tortuous flow path with low ks a soil texture map was prepared using the data from level one scale 1 250 000 and level two 1 50 000 soil survey that was carried out in jordan in the 1990s by the moa the classes for soil texture depend on the soil type description and infiltration rate clay sandy clay and silty clay have very slow permeability according to the permeability class table 4 which is regarded as the worst condition for recharge and as such is ranked one and classified as low suitability however the soil with dominant sand loamy sand and coarse sand have rapid and very rapid permeability and as such presents optimal conditions for recharge and is hence classified as very suitable and ranked 4 fig 6 c soil thickness helps determine the infiltration capacity and the soil s moisture holding capacity steinel et al 2016a b c for recharge purposes it is preferable to have thin soils to ensure fast infiltration however a minimum soil thickness is usually desired to ensure improved infiltrated water quality therefore the suitability of soils with a thickness of less than 20 cm is considered low while soils with a thickness between 20 and 50 cm are considered highly suitable and ranked 4 fig 6 d 4 1 1 4 aquifer hydrogeology an aquifer is an underground layer consisting of porous and permeable rocks that allow it to store and transmit water meanwhile an aquitard is an underground water barrier a compact layer of clay silt or rock that prevents water from flowing underground in this context mar sites should be located on top of aquifers and not aquitards in order to allow t the spreading technique methods to work alluvial and sand aquifers result in high recharge rates due to their high permeability and response to rainfall fuentes and vervoort 2020 in this study the ram kurnub alluvium and zarqa aquifers were considered highly suitable for mar and rated 4 because they usually have high permeability the b2 a7 was also considered highly suitable because it consists of fractured sedimentary rocks such as carbonates and chert which enables it to carry large amounts of groundwater basalt aquifers are highly fractured as well so they are considered suitable for mar and ranked at 3 finally b4 b5 aquifers are considered moderately suitable because of the water s high salinity and are ranked at 2 check table 4 and fig 6 e for the hydrogeological classification results 4 1 1 5 depth to the groundwater table vadose zone the distance from the ground surface to the groundwater table is unsaturated and is also called the vadose zone an essential criterion to consider for mar analysis along this depth infiltrated water is treated before reaching the groundwater table thus suitable sites for mar should have at least a 5 m thick unsaturated zone ahmadi et al 2017 or according to the studies of rahman et al 2013 and steinel et al 2016b a 10 m threshold for groundwater table depth for this study 10 m was is chosen as the threshold for groundwater table depth to ensure a minimum risk of groundwater pollution the depth to groundwater table ranging from 10 to 50 m is given a high rank while the areas with a depth to groundwater table less than 10 m or greater than 200 m are considered unsuitable sites table 4 describes the depth to groundwater table criteria weight rank classification and the threshold used figure 6f shows the suitability map of the study area based on the depth to groundwater table 4 1 1 6 aquifer thickness aquifer thickness affects transmissivity and storage volume therefore it is an important parameter to consider for mar rahman et al 2013 the higher the aquifer thickness value the higher the suitability for mar sites the aquifer thickness threshold used in the studies of rahman et al 2013 and steinel et al 2016a b c was 10 m and 20 m respectively for this study the aquifer thickness for the top aquifer and the given ranks are shown in table 4 aquifer thickness of less than 20 m were considered unsuitable and thus were give a 0 rank and excluded from the analysis as a constraint in comparison aquifers with a thickness of more than 50 m were considered optimal for mar and ranked 4 areas with no data on aquifer thickness are considered of low suitability for mar and rated by 1 areas with the kurnub and disi sandstone aquifers or the alluvial aquifer in the jordan valley have no thickness data brückner et al 2017 but cannot be excluded from the site selection so they are ranked by 1 the aquifer thickness suitability map of the study area is shown in figure 6g 4 1 1 7 distance from major faults faults provide good flow paths and enhance vertical hydraulic conductivity for rapid infiltration steinel et al 2016a b c however rapid infiltration causes incomplete water treatment ahmadi et al 2017 a buffer zone around the major faults is thus recommended and has been considered in this study fig 6 h 4 1 1 8 infrastructure assessment for the construction and maintenance of mar sites access to the site must be easy however care must be taken to avoid vandalism so selected sites must not be easily visible from the main road additionally a shorter distance from main roads increases the possibility of surface water contamination from the various pollutants usually present on road surfaces steinel et al 2016a b c therefore the infrastructure assessment for this study includes the assessment of roads and railroads for the site access and easy maintenance of the mar site a buffer of 400 m from the road is considered the main roads buffer is shown in fig 6 i 4 1 1 9 drainage density the drainage pattern of any topography reflects the characteristics of surface formations and underground formations fenta and ki 2015 drainage density is expressed in terms of channel length per unit area km km2 fuentes and vervoort 2020 which refers to an expression of proximity to channel spacing that provides a quantitative measure of the average length of flow channels within different parts of the entire basin singh et al 2013 drainage density is an essential factor in recharge assessment as it is an inverse function of permeability usually areas with very high drainage density are poorly recharged therefore it indirectly indicates the appropriateness of the site for mar fuentes and vervoort 2020 fenta and ki 2015 singh et al 2013 the drainage density was created for each surface basin and combined with the stream length divided by the watershed area in arcmap using the watershed s dem a flow direction map was built using the flow direction hydrology tool a raster of accumulated flow into each cell was then created using the flow accumulation tool finally the streams network for the watershed was built then the rank was assigned to classify the study area for mar site selection purposes fig 6 j 4 1 1 10 precipitation the amount of precipitation is considered an important criterion affecting groundwater recharge fenta and ki 2015 recharge is usually negligible for areas with precipitation less than 50 mm year steinel et al 2016a b c in this research an area with less than 50 mm year precipitation was considered unsuitable for mar and ranked zero in contrast regions with precipitation greater or equal to 200 mm year were deemed highly suitable sites and ranked 4 as described in table 4 classification of the study area based on its precipitation is shown in fig 6 k 4 1 2 environmental criteria as a result of improper site selection pollutants such as wastewater can cause the contamination of drinking groundwater supplies ahmadi et al 2017 therefore buffer areas around groundwater drinking sources have been considered in this research kallali et al 2007 used a 500 m buffer around a hill reservoir whereas anane et al 2008 used a 200 m buffer steinel et al 2016b took a 0 5 km distance buffer from active government wells ahmadi et al 2017 used a buffer area of 150 m around streams and 300 m buffer around dug wells in this study a safeguard distance of at least 300 m around active wells is considered fig 6 l and a buffer of 500 m around water bodies dams lake springs river canals fig 6 m is also defined to avoid their contamination 4 1 3 economic criteria in this study we have identified dams and wwtps that might have excess water that can be utilized for mar however it is important to avoid high water transport costs of these waters to the potential mar sites therefore distance from such water resources is considered in the mar sites suitability mapping for economic consideration hence areas outside a buffer of 8000 m from such water resources are considered unsuitable for mar sites fig 6 n 4 2 constraint mapping constraint mapping resulted in excluding 47 7187 km2 of the total study area 15 430 km2 fig 7 shows the areas that are excluded from the analysis according to the constraint mapping criterion explained earlier and summarized in table 5 4 3 spreading method suitability map areas that were not excluded as a result of constraint mapping are assessed for suitability for mar using the spreading method in total fourteen different technical environmental and economic criteria were used in the suitability assessment the final suitability score values varied from 0 to 154 using the natural breaks jenks areas are classified into five suitability classes fig 8 1 unsuitable value 0 2 low suitability values of 0 112 3 moderately suitable values of 112 124 4 suitable values of 124 133 5 highly suitable values of 133 154 the assessment indicates that 46 65 of the study area is unsuitable constraint area for mar spreading method 4 01 has low suitability 13 76 has moderate suitability 20 10 is suitable and 15 48 is highly suitable as shown in fig 8 without the constraint map for the spreading method site selection the assessment shows that 10 54 of the study area has low suitability 27 38 is moderately suitable 31 42 is suitable and 30 66 is highly suitable fig 9 5 conclusions mar suitability maps have been prepared for possible incorporation into sustainable groundwater management plans to assist decision makers in jordan after determining the potential area for mar based on technical environmental and economic criteria it is recommended to add the land ownership map to the suitability maps a case study was developed to determine potentially suitable sites for groundwater recharge in west jordan fourteen thematic maps were used to create two potential maps using mcda gis for the spreading method the criteria were chosen following technical economic and environmental considerations the potential map procedure used the gis based multi criteria to generate constraint maps with boolean logic and the suitability maps used wlc for potential sites the suitability maps assessment showed that 46 65 of the study area did not fulfill the minimum criteria constraint mapping while applying the 14 site assessment criteria using wlc showed that about 4 01 has low suitability 13 76 has moderate suitability 20 10 is suitable and 15 48 is highly suitable in conclusion it is evident that spatial planning is useful to identify potential locations for mar significant areas can be utilized as the results of this research show even more significant volumes of rainfall are lost to evaporation especially in arid areas therefore we argue that mar has a great potential in the relief of water stress in arid areas existing geospatial tools and the increasing availability of spatial data are a great asset to

11644,modified clay mineral is a potential technique for phosphorus adsorption and has received much attention in the high phosphate pollution witnessing regions in the present work an iron pillared eggshell modified bentonite clay bio composite ip esmb is used to test the adsorption of phosphate from the aqueous medium the characteristics of the prepared ip esmb bio composite were analyzed using xrf sem edx ftir xrd bet tg and dtg analysis to study its physicochemical characteristics the diffusion process electrostatic interaction and ion exchange mechanisms work in concert to remove the phosphate ions effectively at a ph of 3 0 the adsorption capacity is influenced by the initial phosphate concentrations adsorbent dose 2 g l contact time 50 min temperature 303 k and ph 3 0 of the solution kinetic studies revealed that the pseudo second order model best described the experimental data the langmuir isotherm model provided the best fit for the equilibrium isotherm data of the ip esmb and the determined q0 value was found to be 60 51 mg g at ph 3 0 and 30 0c the reaction was endothermic and spontaneous according to thermodynamic analysis with overall changes in enthalpy δh 0 and entropy δg 0 of 10 08 kjmol 1 and 0 09 kjmol 1k 1 respectively it is also found that the ip esmb bio composite has excellent reusability over several adsorption cycles designing an adsorption reactor provides another means of calibrating the performance of the created bio composite during factorial operations this study confirms that to curb eutrophication in a natural water system the present modified clay mineral can efficiently act as a green adsorbent graphical abstract image 1 keywords bentonite clay phosphate removal adsorption reactor adsorption capacity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the proliferation of the world population has necessitated an increase in global food production which has reinforced the voluminous use of phosphate minerals and phosphatic fertilizers however using p and its products extensively harms the environment the organic phosphorous that is found in manure rock phosphates and other sources as colloids and particles is readily biodegradable depending on the ph levels of aqueous environments orthophosphate po4 3 the predominant inorganic phosphorous can exist in three distinct forms phosphorous eutrophication will often take place if the total phosphorous tp level in water bodies exceeds 0 02 mg l phosphorous products are frequently released from fertilizer discharges of agricultural land areas industrial settlements sludge and domestic wastewaters into lakes rivers groundwater and other ecosystems which causes dissolved oxygen depletion algae blooms death of aquatic life which disrupts the entire natural food chain process zhang et al 2021 therefore it is ecologically necessary to employ an effective technique to remove phosphate species resulting from anthropogenic and natural activities before discharging them to water bodies in the existing literature numerous multifarious techniques such as adsorption crystallization membrane filtration and chemical precipitation have been used in phosphate removal studies among these adsorption is regarded as one of the best in the practical application because of its high adsorption capacity eco friendliness reduced sludge creation low cost and reusability based on their structural characteristics accessibility recyclability high surface area mechanical durability chemical stability and cation exchange capabilities bentonite clay minerals bt have been gaining interest as potential adsorbents for the removal of various environmental toxins ozola davidane et al 2021 the isomorphous substitution of al3 ions of the octahedral silicate layer of bt by mg2 ions will impart a negative charge and thereby reduces the adsorption capacity for anionic pollutants such as phosphate fluoride and arsenate hence modifying clay using proper physical and chemical methods can enhance phosphate removal and recovery recently substantial research has been done on metal oxide pillared interlayered bentonite clays for low cost wastewater treatment in this approach researchers have developed different hydroxyl oligomeric cations using al fe ti zr and la by exchanging the interlayer cations of the clay mineral to remove phosphate ions from water bodies various researchers had created fe iii pillared sodium montmorillonites borgnino et al 2009 yan et al 2010 the results indicate the presence of fe oh functional groups and a rise in specific surface area interlayer spacing and total pore volume that improved the adsorption effectiveness in another study fe al pillared ca bentonite greatly enhanced the sorption of phosphate yaghoobi rahini et al 2017 moreover lin et al 2018 found that zirconium modified ca bentonites have superior adsorption performance compared to na bentonite he concluded that the ca2 pre treatment could have enhanced the amount of exchangeable ca which contributed to the higher phosphate adsorption capability for zirconium modified bentonite the world s most prevalent biomass waste material eggshell is extraordinarily high in calcium and is made up primarily of calcite crystals with a high caco3 content calcinations of eggshells at high temperature 800 0c forms more soluble cao and ca oh 2 this leads to the formation of ca3 po4 2 precipitate which increases the phosphate adsorption capacity of waste eggshells park et al 2022 studies on the extraction of cacl2 from eggshell waste showed that eggshell which is typically discarded as waste provides an alternative source for the synthesis of cacl2 thakur et al 2019 the waste eggshells when dissolved in a strongly acidic medium lead to the formation of cacl2 which can be confirmed until no gas bubbles were observed garnjanagoonchorn and changpuak 2007 hence the cacl2 synthesized from eggshells can be used for the modifications of clay minerals to exchange the interlayer cations with ca2 ions to form a homoionic clay mineral in this manner the eggshell becomes a potential supply of calcium for preparing calcium saturated bentonite by undergoing ion exchange with interlayer cations of the clay mineral further studies of enhanced phosphate removal by inorganic modification of bt by la fe pillared montmorillonite and fe pillared montmorillonite for phosphate recovery were reported by castro et al 2019a and leite et al 2020 earlier research has shown that iron intercalated clay materials are a suitable functionalized material for the applications in a range of disciplines such as adsorbents and different catalysts for the removal of a variety of contaminants and soil remediation wu et al 2016 meanwhile among inorganic pillaring agents like hydroxyl iron and hydroxyl aluminum the former has shown to be more ecologically friendly and can enhance the interlayer gap allowing additional adsorption sites qiang et al 2021 in addition to these the various oxidation states magnetic characteristics and advantages in economic terms make iron a relevant material for industrial applications tomul 2011 in light of this the literature review identified iron intercalated clay minerals as a potential adsorbent for phosphate adsorption the objective of the present study is to demonstrate that fe pillared bentonite which is made by pre treating bentonite clay with cacl2 obtained from eggshell waste powder works effectively as an adsorbent for phosphate species in water media the research also focuses to integrate paddy field monitoring studies with mitigation strategies to remove phosphate nutrients from the watersheds in and around the river basin this integrated technique will bring good results in implementing the adsorptive removal technique in the field in a consistent decentralized manner by the diffusion of phosphate ions into the pores of ip esmb 2 experimental 2 1 materials iron iii chloride anhydrous 98 kh₂po₄ 98 naoh hcl ascorbic acid potassium antimony iii oxide tartrate hemihydrates and nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o were obtained from merck india

the contaminants they were dried by air for 24 h at 100 c the dried eggshells were weighed precisely at 10 g after being ground into a fine powder the above weighed raw eggshell powder was added to 5 g of bt clay that had been dissolved in 50 ml of milli q water about 0 1 m naoh and hcl solutions were used to keep the ph of the solution at 4 0 until all of the co2 gas in the solution had evolved the solution was then homogenized after 48 h of continuous stirring at 250 rpm the milli q water was used to wash the calcium saturated bentonite clay suspension esmb multiple times until the filtrate was chlorine free under vigorous shaking 250 ml of 0 2 mol l fecl3 solutions and 250 ml of 0 4 mol l naoh solutions were slowly combined to create an iron pillaring solution the resulting solution is stirred at room temperature for 72 h the prepared pillaring solution was slowly and carefully added to the formed calcium bentonite clay composite esmb and then agitated at 450 rpm for 72 h the solution was filtered after 72 h the residue was continuously washed with milli q water until no chloride was found with agno3 solutions and the solution was then dried in an air oven at 100 0c after cooling the product ip esmb was sieved through 230 mesh sized sieve and kept in sealed polypropylene bottles for additional adsorption and characterization experiments 2 3 analytical tools using an

eutech ph tutor 2 4 adsorption experiments anhydrous potassium dihydrogen phosphate was dissolved in water to create a phosphate stock solution in a series of batch adsorption experiments phosphate solution with concentrations ranging from 15 0 to 50 0 mg l was mixed with 0 1 g of adsorbent using solutions of 0 01 0 5 n naoh and 0 01 0 5 n hno3 the ph of the solution was adjusted the prepared

is the amount of phosphate species adsorbed mg g on ip esmb ca and c0 are the final and initial concentrations of phosphate ions mg l in aqueous solution v is the aqueous phase volume ml and m is the mass of the adsorbent g the experiments were conducted in a stopper iodine flask with 0 1 g of ip esmb composite and an initial phosphate concentration of 50 mg l 15 25 30 50 mg l to ascertain how temperature affects thermodynamic characteristics adsorption experiments were carried out at 283 293 303 and 313 k temperatures with initial phosphate concentrations of 15 25 30 and 50 mg l and a dose of 2 0 g l adsorbent adsorption kinetics were achieved similar to this optimal conditions were used to conduct adsorption isotherms at 293 303 313 and 323 k with initial phosphate concentrations of 15 25 30 50 75 and 100 mg l based on statistical error parameters such as the sum of the squared estimate of errors sse and determination coefficient r2 values the fit quality of both kinetic and isotherm models was evaluated 2 5 adsorption experiments in natural water systems the case study site was selected to be the netravati river basin in karnataka india 12o50 13o11 n 74o46 75o44 e which has a total basin size of 4409 km2 water samples collected from different paddy field locations in dakshin kannada were chemically analyzed the collected samples were filtered using 0 45 μm whatman tmuniflopvdf sterile disposable syringe filters and were collected in acid cleaned pe bottles and preserved in ice bags a portable water quality meter eutech aqua read 1000 d was used to test in situ the ph bod ec and tds of the river samples the preserved samples were moved and kept in the refrigerator at the lab an analytical device called a continuous flow analyzer cfa skalar san 1052 was used in the lab to analyze bicarbonate and nitrate the study area geographical information and physicochemical characteristics of the samples are provided in the supplemental material fig s1 and table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ip esmb the elemental composition wt profiles of bt esmb and ip esmb are determined by xrf analysis it is obvious from table 1 that the ca2 in bt increased to 81 02 during the development of esmb the increase in ca2 that was seen in esmb suggested that ca2 ions were exchanged for na mg2 and k ions during the pre treatment of bt with the raw eggshell solution at a low ph additionally ip esmb gains fe3 86 74 as a result of fe pillaring of the esmb therefore xrf data revealed the formation of pillared clay by exhibiting an increase in the weight of fe in ip esmb the surface morphologies of the bt esmb ip esmb and raw eggshell adsorbents were studied using sem images fig 1 a and b exhibits irregularly shaped eggshell particles and block crystal type particles of bt the surface morphology of the clay mineral was significantly altered by esmb into a more precise agglomerated particle size which supported the alteration of eggshell with clay mineral fig 1c the more porous ip esmb surface morphology supported the pillaring of fe in esmb fig 1d the pillaring of fe and phosphate adsorption on the developed adsorbent ip esmb was confirmed by the appearance of the fe and phosphorous peak in the edx spectra of ip esmb p fig s2 bet surface areas were 58 99 m2 g and 111 m2 g for esmb and ip esmb respectively it is found that the pore volume and surface area of pillared clay are significantly greater than those of the prepared esmb composite according to the above mentioned data pillaring of the esmb resulted in a considerable increase in bet surface area and enlarged total adsorption pore volumes table s2 and fig s3 ftir spectra of raw eggshell esmb ip esmb and ip esmb p are displayed in fig 2 a in the ir spectrum of raw eggshells the bands at 1412 and 872 cm 1 correspond to carbonate peaks while the strong absorbance peak centered at 711 cm 1 is related to the ca o bond pandey et al 2020 the bands at 3637 and 3627 cm 1 in esmb and ip esmb are symmetric stretching vibrations of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl al al oh or si si oh groups of clay mineral the hydrogen bonded o h stretching vibrations are responsible for the comparatively weak absorption band at 3410 and 3412 cm 1 in esmb and ip esmb respectively the peak at 1636 cm 1 in esmb corresponds to the deformation mode of the h oh bending vibration of the physically adsorbed water molecule the absence of the absorption band at 1412 and 871 cm 1 which is associated with c o asymmetric stretching from either an ester group or a carboxylic group present in eggshell powder in esmb suggests that co2 evolved in acidic environments and ca2 ions diffused resulting in the production of esmb the very strong intense si o si stretching vibration peak at 1006 cm 1 and the peak at 1636 cm 1 are displaced to 1013 cm 1 and 1628 cm 1 after pillaring esmb with iron iii cations this guarantees cation exchange in the interlayer space of the modified eggshell clay bio composite and the creation of the ip esmb composite anirudhan et al 2010a in addition the shifting of the si o si and si o al bending vibration bands from 424 cm 1 and 512 cm 1 to 436 cm 1 and 518 cm 1 provided evidence for the interaction of iron iii cations with the al oh group in the alumina octahedral layers and the si o group in the siloxane layers moma et al 2018 the deformation of si o fe vibration is reflected in the ip esmb absorption band at 518 cm 1 after adsorption the ip esmb peak shifted from 1013 cm 1 to 1017 cm 1 and the development of a signal at 873 cm 1 proved that the phosphate had been adsorbed on the prepared composite sokolova et al 2015 wide angle x ray scattering waxs diffraction patterns of esmb and ip esmb are displayed in fig 2 b the typical peak of calcium bentonite in esmb corresponding to plane d 001 was seen at 2θ 6 99 with a d spacing value of 1 26 nm with the formation of ferric oxide pillars there is a minor shift in the d 001 plane s 2θ value from 6 99 to 5 67 as well as increases in peak width and d spacing of 0 25 0 45 and 1 26 nm 1 55 nm respectively this results from the interchange of calcium ions with iron iii cations in the interlayer spaces of the esmb jia et al 2017 the shift of a sharp intense peak from 2θ 20 15 d100 and 2θ 31 74 d011 to 2θ 19 68 and 29 23 in ip esmb with a peak width increment from 1 02 to 1 18 and 0 18 to 1 29 provides additional support for the modification of the esmb the size of the fe oligomer fe3 oh 4 5 present in the interlayer regions of esmb which led to increased basal spacing of clay minerals can be linked to these increments in peak widths the quartz peaks are reflected at 2θ 26 69o 35 00o and 55 23o with corresponding d spacing values of 3 35 ao 2 56 ao and 1 66 ao additionally other montmorillonite peaks are produced in esmb at 2θ 62 02o and 75 29o with a basal spacing of 1 49 and 1 26 ao fig s4 these montmorillonite and quartz peaks previously located at 2θ 62 02 and 26 69 are now located at 2θ 61 71 and 26 37 respectively and their peak widths have increased from 0 58 to 0 89 and 0 18 to 0 22 the expansion of interlayer spacing of clay minerals is signaled by these shifts in 2θ towards lower values with an increase in peak widths confirming the creation of pillared clay manohar et al 2002 fig s5 displays the thermogravimetric analysis tg and dtg curves for the ip esmb an endothermic peak was seen in the tg of ip esmb below 150 c as a result of the dehydration of interlayer and physically adsorbed water molecules because of the existence of three forms of fe2 fe3 and fe6 iron oxides a weight loss of 0 86 occurs between 200 and 300 c and a little peak with two shoulders was noticed castro et al 2019b similar to the first weight loss the second weight loss between 330 and 800 c was caused by the release of water molecules coordinated with the pillared clay mineral and the decomposition of the produced oxide baloyi et al 2018 due to the decomposition of aluminosilicates evaporation and degradation of pillared metal oxide ip esmb showed significant weight loss at 640 0c following this temperature there is an increase in weight and it remains stable up to 800 0c indicating the excellent thermal stability of ip esmb at 640 0c ip esmb displayed significant weight loss due to the breakdown of aluminosilicates evaporation and deterioration of pillared metal oxide however following this temperature the weight increases and remains steady up to 800 0c demonstrating ip esmb s thermal stability 3 2 optimization of batch adsorption parameters 3 2 1 influence of ph understanding the chemistry of phosphate speciation and the surface charge of the adsorbent is crucial to comprehend the adsorption affinity of phosphate species ions on ip esmb initially the ph measurements were carried out separately using bt and raw eggshells and these substances showed a phosphate adsorption capability of less than 20 the weak van der waals force was probably responsible for bt s low adsorption affinity however the phosphorous removal by eggshell at higher ph values may have been brought by the precipitation of ca5 po4 3oh in the alkaline media ph 8 the relatively high calcium ions in raw eggshells diffused into the clay s interlayer areas by an ion exchange process in the modified esmb adsorbent resulting in the formation of ca exchanged bentonite the use of an iron pillaring agent increased the esmb s capability for further adsorption adsorption tests for ip esmb were carried out using starting phosphate concentrations of 15 25 30 and 50 mg l and adsorbent dosage of 2 0 g l over a ph range of 2 0 8 0 in the studies phosphate adsorption on ip esmb as a function of ph is depicted in fig 3 a the maximum phosphate adsorption of 93 02 for an initial phosphate concentration of 15 mg l was attained at ph 3 0 in aqueous media phosphate species can exist as h3po4 ph 2 h2po4 ph 2 7 hpo4 2 ph 7 11 and po4 3 ph 11 according to the speciation study the major phosphate species in this case at ph 3 0 is h2po4 goscianska et al 2018 since ip esmb s zero point charge phzpc was discovered to be 5 6 protonation caused the edges to become positively charged below ph 5 6 which also favoured electrostatic attraction to h2po4 phosphate species fig 3b however the edge charge of ip esmb becomes more negative at increasing ph values producing repulsion between the adsorbent and anionic phosphorous further phosphate adsorption may be reduced as a result of competition between phosphate species and hydroxide ions for adsorption sites on the other hand ligand exchange reaction and inner sphere surface complexation have also been proposed as potential processes for phosphate adsorption onto pillared clay composite when the ph is lower ligand exchange between h2po4 phosphate species and the hydroxyl group on the adsorbent surface causes the hydroxyl group to be released into the solution which raises the ph the number of hpo4 2 species in the solution increases as a result which lowers the capacity for phosphate adsorption since h2po4 is preferable for exchange with the surface oh group than hpo4 2 lin et al 2018 the ligand exchange interaction with the surface hydroxyl group on ip esmb is represented by the following equations 3 fe oh h2po4 fe h2po4 oh 4 fe oh 2 hpo4 2 fe hpo4 2oh 5 fe h2po4 fe hpo4 h 6 fe hpo4 h2o fe h2po4 oh the maximal phosphate adsorption for the 25 30 and 50 mg l initial phosphate solutions were likewise 85 22 79 23 and 68 26 respectively 3 2 2 effect of contact time at different initial phosphate concentrations 15 25 30 and 50 mg l 2 0 g l adsorbent dose 303 k temperature ph 3 0 and by adjusting time intervals between 0 and 70 min the ability of ip esmb to remove phosphate was examined in fig 3c the impact of contact time on ip esmb s ability to remove phosphate is graphically depicted the observed results show that the amount of phosphate adsorbed on ip esmb gradually increases with time and finally achieves equilibrium at about 50 min this may be because the ip esmb has many active empty sites that are open to phosphate adsorption the majority of the active sites on the adsorbent have already been occupied by phosphate ions and there are no more unoccupied sites accessible when equilibrium after 50 min approaches the slow adsorption after 50 min was brought on by the repelling interactions between the phosphate species adsorbed on the adsorbent surface and those in the bulk phase 3 2 3 effect of initial ion concentration the effect of phosphate adsorption on ip esmb was studied with starting concentrations ranging from 15 to 100 mg l with ph and temperature being held constant at 3 0 and 303 k respectively throughout the experiment initial concentrations of 15 100 mg l resulted in a rise in equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of 6 83 38 03 mg g and a decrease in adsorption percentage of 91 01 76 11 for the limited number of adsorption surface sites on ip esmb the phosphate species in an aqueous medium would compete which would lower the proportion of phosphate adsorption more active functional groups will be present on the adsorbent surface at low concentrations but when the initial phosphate ion concentration rises the surface active site for their adsorption diminishes and the rate of adsorption falls fig 3d 3 2 4 adsorption isotherm studies adsorption isotherms provide data on the maximum adsorption capacity that characterizes the performance of an adsorbent ip esmb phosphate interactions were clarified using isotherm models such as the langmuir and freundlich isotherms at the ideal ph 2 0 g l adsorbent dosage at various temperatures 283 293 303 and 313 k at the optimum contact period of 50 min and various initial phosphate concentrations of 15 25 30 50 75 and 100 mg l respectively the langmuir isotherm model implies homogenous monolayer adsorption on a definite limited number of energetic adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface langmuir 1916 the langmuir adsorption isotherm s non linear form is as follows 7 q e q 0 b c e 1 b c e where qe mg g is the adsorption amount of phosphate per unit mass of adsorbent ce mg l is the phosphate concentration in solution at equilibrium q0 mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and b l mg is the langmuir constant related to the binding energy of adsorption the plot of qe vs ce is used to determine the values of the langmuir constants q0 and b fig 4 a likewise the freundlich adsorption isotherm model explains the non ideal reversible multilayer adsorption process over heterogeneous surfaces freundlich 1906 the non linear form of the equation is expressed as 8 q e k f c e 1 n f where kf mg g 1 mg l 1 1 nf is the freundlich constant and 1 nf is the heterogeneity factor related to extending adsorption and energy of adsorption from the qe vs ce figure the corresponding kf and 1 nf constants are calculated and shown in table 2 when statistical parameters are compared it can be seen that the langmuir model better describes the adsorption isotherm than the freundlich model with lower sse values and higher regression coefficient values r2 0 9855 a separation factor dimensionless constant rl can be represented as 9 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 mg l is the adsorbate initial phosphate concentration and b l mg is the langmuir isotherm constant the computed rl values were discovered to lie between 0 and 1 for the initial phosphate concentrations 15 100 mg l supporting the langmuir isotherm for adsorption as a result the adsorption process is explained using the best fit langmuir isotherm model in the current study it was discovered that ip esmb has a phosphate adsorption capacity of 60 51 mg g at 30 0c the adsorption capacity of the ip esmb composite and other known clay modified phosphate adsorbents are shown in table s3 3 2 5 thermodynamics of the study experiments were conducted at four different temperatures 10 0c 40 0c under the ideal contact time ph value 2 0 g l adsorbent dosage and for various initial phosphate concentrations of 15 100 mg l to examine the impact of temperature on the adsorption performance at the solid liquid interface fig 4b the amount of adsorption increases from 6 37 to 6 90 mg g in the temperature range of 10 0c to 40 0c and for an initial phosphate content of 15 mg l the maximum adsorption of 6 90 mg g was found at 40 0c similar to this the adsorption capacity varies between 10 45 11 19 12 00 13 05 19 01 21 23 23 37 31 32 and 32 51 39 01 mg g for the initial concentrations of 25 30 50 75 and 100 mg l from 10 0c to 40 0c phosphate adsorption on ip esmb peaks at 40 0c at extremely low concentrations hence as the temperature rises adsorption likewise rises which may be a result of the endothermic nature of the adsorption process equations used for studying thermodynamic parameters are as follows 10 δ g 0 r t l n ρ w k d 11 ln ρ w k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 r t where t k is the absolute temperature of the phosphate solution δg0 is the variations of the free energy change δs0 is the free energy change δh0 is the enthalpy change ρw g l 1 is the water density kd l g 1 is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and r kj mol 1k 1 is the universal gas constant by graphing ln ρw kd vs 1 t values for δh0 and δs0 are determined from the slope and intercept of the curve fig 4c the endothermic feasibility and spontaneous character of the adsorption process were disclosed from the positive δh0 10 08 kj and negative δg0 values 16 76 17 93 18 74 and 19 65 kj mol 1 values table s4 the positive value of δs0 0 09 kj mol k supported the randomization nature of the liquid solid boundary 3 2 6 adsorption kinetic models adsorption kinetics which specifies the potential rate at which the adsorption process happens is regarded as the most important parameter for defining adsorption efficiency when constructing the adsorption desorption system a physicochemical process including electrostatic interaction complex formation and ion exchange is generally perceived to maintain phosphate adsorption from the aqueous to the solid phase therefore the mechanism of phosphate removal can be depicted as follows in the absence of stoichiometric data 12 s p s p where s represents available active sites on the adsorbent p represents free phosphate ion concentrations in aqueous media and sp represents the concentration of adsorbed phosphate ions on the adsorbent k 1 and k 2 represent adsorption and desorption rate constants three major kinetic models used in this study are the pseudo first order pfo langergren 1898 pseudo second order pso ho and mckay 1999 and the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model weber and morris 1963 the non linear mathematical equations of pfo is 13 q t q e 1 e k 1 t the non linear mathematical equations of pso is 14 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t the intraparticle diffusion model 15 q t k i t 1 2 c where k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg 1min 1 are the pseudo first order and second order reaction rate constants qe and qt represent the phosphate adsorption capacity mg g at equilibrium and time t c mg g 1 is the boundary layer thickness and ki mg g min0 5 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant based on higher r2 sse χ2 and experimental qe values it can be affirmed that the pso model was the appropriate kinetic model to describe phosphate adsorption on ip esmb and is given in table 3 among pfo and pso kinetic models pseudo second order with higher r2 0 9906 low χ2 0 5 and lower sse values is the adequate model to describe adsorption kinetics fig s6 a thus it is clear from table 3 that as the initial concentration increases from 15 to 50 mg l the qe value increases suggesting the efficient utilization of available adsorption sites of ip esmb due to greater driving force by a higher concentration gradient pressure to determine the rate limiting stage in the solid liquid adsorption process intra particle diffusion models were used adsorption of solute particles in a solution involves the binding of adsorbate in active pore sites pore diffusion the transfer of h2po4 ions within the active centers of the adsorbent surface diffusion and the migration of h2po4 ions from the bulk to the surface of the adsorbent film diffusion sarkar et al 2003 intraparticle diffusion is not the rate controlling process as shown by the fact that the plot of t0 5 vs qt does not pass through the origin fig s6 b instead the adsorption process was regulated by various adsorption processes it is obvious from the multilinear plots and sections that diverge from the origin that external mass transfer takes place during adsorption causing the diffusion of phosphate ions into the pores of ip esmb 3 3 mechanism of phosphate binding onto ip esmb electrostatic attraction ligand exchange and inner sphere surface complexation are the major processes involved in the complex process of phosphate adsorption onto ip esmb fig s7 zeta potential measurements reveal that the phzpc of ip esmb is 5 6 the positively charged oligomeric iron hydroxide cations that are present in the interlayer gaps of eggshell modified bentonite clay can easily undergo electrostatic adhesion with the negatively charged phosphate ions when the solution ph is less than phzpc ip esmb is made up of a layer of two sheets in which silicon and aluminum atoms are tetrahedrally and octahedrally bonded to hydroxyl groups the positively charged proton functional al oh 2 and si oh 2 sites and phosphate species may also exhibit electrostatic attraction through a ligand exchange process phosphate can frequently remove the iron hydroxyl functional group from the appropriate metal binding sites an inner sphere complexation may have been involved in the phosphate uptake by ip esmb as evidenced by the increased phosphate adsorption concomitant to the rise in ionic strength additionally the outcome of intraparticle diffusion revealed that several adsorption processes control the phosphate adsorption process and that phosphate ions would pass through the inside of ip esmb p anions from the liquid phase have initially been transported to the solid liquid interface through electrostatic contact and a ligand exchange mechanism it will then gradually diffuse into the ip esmb s inner sphere by bonding with the surface and interlayer hydroxyl groups of the modified eggshell adsorbent the increase in the ip esmb s average pore diameter provides additional evidence that phosphate ions are capable of passing through the pores the appearance of an asymmetric p o peak at 873 cm 1 and a fe o peak at 618 cm 1 in ftir spectra validates the previously proposed process phosphate adsorption on ip esmb is also supported by the presence of the p element in the edx spectra of ip esmb p 3 4 application of ip esmb in the real water system agricultural run off samples taken from 5 different locations were used to investigate the effectiveness of ip esmb in removing phosphate following are the phosphate concentrations mg l of the samples that were examined site 1 3 14 site 2 4 25 site 3 3 04 site 4 5 11 and site 5 2 15 the optimized conditions for adsorption ph 3 dosage 2 g l concentration 15 mg l and contact time 50 min obtained from batch adsorption studies were maintained during the experiment the phosphate solutions were spiked to 11 86 10 75 11 96 9 89 and 12 85 mg l for the samples from stations 1 5 respectively and the samples percentage of phosphate removal was discovered to be between 40 and 50 this is because in addition to phosphate ions the natural water system also contains co existing anions including cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 as bicarbonate containing solutions are naturally basic and phosphate adsorption was unfavourable in alkaline environments hco3 had the highest harmful impact on phosphate adsorption among these anions multivalent ions were discovered to be easier to adsorb than monovalent ions by zhang et al 2018 the overall percentage of phosphate removal can be significantly decreased as so4 2 ion accumulation on the surface site competes with negatively charged po4 3 ions through electrostatic repulsion the creation of an outer sphere complex by cl ions was also previously observed in prior studies huang et al 2015 consequently the ability of ip esmb to adsorb phosphate is readily disrupted by these anions under the optimized condition of the adsorption process the effect of adsorbent dosage on phosphate removal was studied and the results are shown in fig s8 the addition of 2 0 g l of adsorbent dosage only shows less than 50 phosphate removal because phosphate in water mutually competes with co existing anions therefore we slightly increased the dosage quantity by adding 2 0 g l in each subsequent cycle and discovered that an adsorbent dose of around 10 0 12 0 g l is necessary for the removal of 99 9 of phosphate from various sample sites adsorbed phosphate can interact with the heavy metal cation through a ternary surface complex which can further increase the adsorption of heavy metal cation through the phosphatic complex ma et al 2015 as a result the produced composite can be employed to simultaneously remove two significant environmental contaminants from aqueous media 3 5 factorial design for quantitative adsorption estimation to optimize the number of steps needed for the complete sorption of phosphate ions using ip esmb an adsorption batch reactor was constructed based on the findings of kinetic and equilibrium experiments pre optimized variables from batch adsorption experiments were strictly maintained during the reactor design fig 5 displays a schematic diagram for a three stage batch design the main objective of the design is to reduce the initial phosphate concentration of c0 mg l at t o to cf mg l at t t for a total phosphate solution of volume v l when x g of ip esmb is added phosphate ions in the solution undergo adsorption and the number of phosphate ions changes from q0 mg g to qt mg g at the corresponding time t 0 to t t the mass balance equation for the sorption process in a single stage design is given by 16 c 0 c f v q t q 0 x under equilibrium conditions q0 0 qt qe cf ce and substituting these values along with qe q 0 b c e 1 b c e from adsorption isotherm studies in eq 16 we get 17 x v c 0 c e q 0 b c e 1 b c e after the completion of the single stage process the two stage process can be designed by considering the phosphate concentration left after the single stage design ie from ce t 0 to cf t t in volume v ml similarly for very high phosphate concentrations n stages of operation for n times can be repeated for the complete removal of phosphate ions substituting the values of q0 60 51 and b 0 072 from table 3 in eq 17 we get 18 x v c 0 c e 1 0 072 c e 4 3567 c e from this equation the amount of ip esmb required to remove phosphate ions when it is treated with a definite volume of solutions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 l having an initial phosphate concentration of 15 25 30 50 75 100 mg l can be calculated in addition to this for a given amount of ip esmb by substituting the values of known initial concentrations c0 ce can be calculated in the current experiment the deduced ce values of 14 07 and 23 69 mg l for 75 and 100 mg l initial concentration with 2 0 g l adsorbent dosage were found to be in good agreement with the experimental values for these particular concentrations around 76 82 of adsorption takes place through the single stage process hence for the 99 99 percentage removal we identified the possibility of a multistage design anirudhan et al 2010b for this eq 17 was rearranged as follows 19 q e v m c e v m c 0 to develop the multi stage process design initially a langmuir isotherm plot qe vs ce was drawn and an operating line with slope 0 5 had drawn from 100 mg l which is represented as c0 q0 and intercepted the langmuir isotherm at 24 mg l 38 mg g ie ce qe this is represented as the stage one process in the next stage an operational line with a slope of 0 5 was drawn from ce 24 mg l and the line was found to intercept at 2 8 mg l 11 mg g again a third operating line with the same slope had drawn from 2 8 mg l and in this stage ce becomes zero hence in the current experiment a three stage batch design is required for the 99 99 phosphate removal 3 6 desorption studies desorption studies of adsorbed phosphate from ip esmb facilitate the reusability of the prepared ip esmb composite studies on ph have demonstrated that the adsorption process starts at a low ph or ph 3 0 this suggests that the adsorbed phosphate species can be successfully desorbed from the produced composite at high ph i e at a basic media for desorption tests solutions ranging from 0 005 to 0 1 m naoh were investigated and maximum phosphate desorption from ip esmb bio composite was seen at 0 1 m naoh desorption experiments were thus conducted using naoh solutions and the outcomes are shown in fig s9 the adsorption capacity of ip esmb dropped from 92 02 in the first cycle to 75 40 in the fourth cycle after undergoing four cycles similarly the desorption of phosphate ions by 0 1 m naoh decreased from 89 55 to 72 80 indicating the efficiency of naoh solution to regenerate the prepared ip esmb composite 3 7 limitations the primary aim of the study was to develop ip esmb a low cost green adsorbent that is beneficial to the environment to remove phosphate species from water bodies the ability of the synthesized material to remove 99 9 of the phosphate species from an aqueous medium was discovered but the research has some limitations to estimate the ultimate cost of the adsorbent after accounting for transportation costs chemicals and electrical energy we need to conduct a cost effective analysis in the future in addition to this variation of adsorption capacity based on fe and ca content of the prepared composite has not yet been estimated despite this batch adsorption treatments are rarely used for practical industrial purposes scaling up and implementation of the prepared composite in large scale industries and adsorbing high pollution load fixed bed column experiments have to be conducted in the future hence from a future perspective the optimization of concentrations of both ca and fe also needs to be evaluated to predict the ultimate strength of the prepared material for phosphate adsorption 4 conclusion in the current work pillared clay mineral eggshell bio composite was successfully synthesized and tested for phosphate removal from aquatic ecosystems it was determined through analytical characterization techniques that the pillaring process alters the morphological surface of esmb favoring the adsorption process in batch studies ip esmb displayed successful phosphate removal at ph 3 0 and the stability of phosphate capture was somewhat reduced when competitive anions and organic matter were present capacity loss 40 50 increasing ip esmb dosages will significantly improve this fall in phosphate adsorption compared with esmb 58 99 m2 g the specific surface area of ip esmb increased to 111 00 m2 g the pseudo second order rate kinetic model was used to predict the adsorption process and the process was described as endothermic by thermodynamic studies with negative δg0 values indicating the adsorption was spontaneous ligand exchange surface complexation and electrostatic attraction dominated the adsorption process to contribute a well defined knowledge regarding complete phosphate removal from wastewater a three stage quantitative operational process design was portrayed this process design can be modulated depending on the amount of phosphate ion concentration in the solution providing information about ce and qe at any desired concentration of the phosphate ions in reusability studies the adsorbent demonstrated its highest performance

11644,modified clay mineral is a potential technique for phosphorus adsorption and has received much attention in the high phosphate pollution witnessing regions in the present work an iron pillared eggshell modified bentonite clay bio composite ip esmb is used to test the adsorption of phosphate from the aqueous medium the characteristics of the prepared ip esmb bio composite were analyzed using xrf sem edx ftir xrd bet tg and dtg analysis to study its physicochemical characteristics the diffusion process electrostatic interaction and ion exchange mechanisms work in concert to remove the phosphate ions effectively at a ph of 3 0 the adsorption capacity is influenced by the initial phosphate concentrations adsorbent dose 2 g l contact time 50 min temperature 303 k and ph 3 0 of the solution kinetic studies revealed that the pseudo second order model best described the experimental data the langmuir isotherm model provided the best fit for the equilibrium isotherm data of the ip esmb and the determined q0 value was found to be 60 51 mg g at ph 3 0 and 30 0c the reaction was endothermic and spontaneous according to thermodynamic analysis with overall changes in enthalpy δh 0 and entropy δg 0 of 10 08 kjmol 1 and 0 09 kjmol 1k 1 respectively it is also found that the ip esmb bio composite has excellent reusability over several adsorption cycles designing an adsorption reactor provides another means of calibrating the performance of the created bio composite during factorial operations this study confirms that to curb eutrophication in a natural water system the present modified clay mineral can efficiently act as a green adsorbent graphical abstract image 1 keywords bentonite clay phosphate removal adsorption reactor adsorption capacity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the proliferation of the world population has necessitated an increase in global food production which has reinforced the voluminous use of phosphate minerals and phosphatic fertilizers however using p and its products extensively harms the environment the organic phosphorous that is found in manure rock phosphates and other sources as colloids and particles is readily biodegradable depending on the ph levels of aqueous environments orthophosphate po4 3 the predominant inorganic phosphorous can exist in three distinct forms phosphorous eutrophication will often take place if the total phosphorous tp level in water bodies exceeds 0 02 mg l phosphorous products are frequently released from fertilizer discharges of agricultural land areas industrial settlements sludge and domestic wastewaters into lakes rivers groundwater and other ecosystems which causes dissolved oxygen depletion algae blooms death of aquatic life which disrupts the entire natural food chain process zhang et al 2021 therefore it is ecologically necessary to employ an effective technique to remove phosphate species resulting from anthropogenic and natural activities before discharging them to water bodies in the existing literature numerous multifarious techniques such as adsorption crystallization membrane filtration and chemical precipitation have been used in phosphate removal studies among these adsorption is regarded as one of the best in the practical application because of its high adsorption capacity eco friendliness reduced sludge creation low cost and reusability based on their structural characteristics accessibility recyclability high surface area mechanical durability chemical stability and cation exchange capabilities bentonite clay minerals bt have been gaining interest as potential adsorbents for the removal of various environmental toxins ozola davidane et al 2021 the isomorphous substitution of al3 ions of the octahedral silicate layer of bt by mg2 ions will impart a negative charge and thereby reduces the adsorption capacity for anionic pollutants such as phosphate fluoride and arsenate hence modifying clay using proper physical and chemical methods can enhance phosphate removal and recovery recently substantial research has been done on metal oxide pillared interlayered bentonite clays for low cost wastewater treatment in this approach researchers have developed different hydroxyl oligomeric cations using al fe ti zr and la by exchanging the interlayer cations of the clay mineral to remove phosphate ions from water bodies various researchers had created fe iii pillared sodium montmorillonites borgnino et al 2009 yan et al 2010 the results indicate the presence of fe oh functional groups and a rise in specific surface area interlayer spacing and total pore volume that improved the adsorption effectiveness in another study fe al pillared ca bentonite greatly enhanced the sorption of phosphate yaghoobi rahini et al 2017 moreover lin et al 2018 found that zirconium modified ca bentonites have superior adsorption performance compared to na bentonite he concluded that the ca2 pre treatment could have enhanced the amount of exchangeable ca which contributed to the higher phosphate adsorption capability for zirconium modified bentonite the world s most prevalent biomass waste material eggshell is extraordinarily high in calcium and is made up primarily of calcite crystals with a high caco3 content calcinations of eggshells at high temperature 800 0c forms more soluble cao and ca oh 2 this leads to the formation of ca3 po4 2 precipitate which increases the phosphate adsorption capacity of waste eggshells park et al 2022 studies on the extraction of cacl2 from eggshell waste showed that eggshell which is typically discarded as waste provides an alternative source for the synthesis of cacl2 thakur et al 2019 the waste eggshells when dissolved in a strongly acidic medium lead to the formation of cacl2 which can be confirmed until no gas bubbles were observed garnjanagoonchorn and changpuak 2007 hence the cacl2 synthesized from eggshells can be used for the modifications of clay minerals to exchange the interlayer cations with ca2 ions to form a homoionic clay mineral in this manner the eggshell becomes a potential supply of calcium for preparing calcium saturated bentonite by undergoing ion exchange with interlayer cations of the clay mineral further studies of enhanced phosphate removal by inorganic modification of bt by la fe pillared montmorillonite and fe pillared montmorillonite for phosphate recovery were reported by castro et al 2019a and leite et al 2020 earlier research has shown that iron intercalated clay materials are a suitable functionalized material for the applications in a range of disciplines such as adsorbents and different catalysts for the removal of a variety of contaminants and soil remediation wu et al 2016 meanwhile among inorganic pillaring agents like hydroxyl iron and hydroxyl aluminum the former has shown to be more ecologically friendly and can enhance the interlayer gap allowing additional adsorption sites qiang et al 2021 in addition to these the various oxidation states magnetic characteristics and advantages in economic terms make iron a relevant material for industrial applications tomul 2011 in light of this the literature review identified iron intercalated clay minerals as a potential adsorbent for phosphate adsorption the objective of the present study is to demonstrate that fe pillared bentonite which is made by pre treating bentonite clay with cacl2 obtained from eggshell waste powder works effectively as an adsorbent for phosphate species in water media the research also focuses to integrate paddy field monitoring studies with mitigation strategies to remove phosphate nutrients from the watersheds in and around the river basin this integrated technique will bring good results in implementing the adsorptive removal technique in the field in a consistent decentralized manner by the diffusion of phosphate ions into the pores of ip esmb 2 experimental 2 1 materials iron iii chloride anhydrous 98 kh₂po₄ 98 naoh hcl ascorbic acid potassium antimony iii oxide tartrate hemihydrates and nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o were obtained from merck india

for preparing practical solutions 2 2 synthesis of iron pillared eggshell modified bentonite clay composite ip esmb the collected eggshells were thoroughly cleaned with milli q water to get rid of all the contaminants they were dried by air for 24 h at 100 c the dried eggshells were weighed precisely at 10 g after being ground into a fine powder the above weighed raw eggshell powder was added to 5 g of bt clay that had been dissolved in 50 ml of milli q water about 0 1 m naoh and hcl solutions were used to keep the ph of the solution at 4 0 until all of the co2 gas in the solution had evolved the solution was then homogenized after 48 h of continuous stirring at 250 rpm the milli q water was used to wash the calcium saturated bentonite clay suspension esmb multiple times until the filtrate was chlorine free under vigorous shaking 250 ml of 0 2 mol l fecl3 solutions and 250 ml of 0 4 mol l naoh solutions were slowly combined to create an iron pillaring solution the resulting solution is stirred at room temperature for 72 h the prepared pillaring solution was slowly and carefully added to the formed calcium bentonite clay composite esmb and then agitated at 450 rpm for 72 h the solution was filtered after 72 h the residue was continuously washed with milli q water until no chloride was found with agno3 solutions and the solution was then dried in an air oven at 100 0c after cooling the product ip esmb was sieved through 230 mesh sized sieve and kept in sealed polypropylene bottles for additional adsorption and characterization experiments 2 3 analytical tools using an

eutech ph tutor 2 4 adsorption experiments anhydrous potassium dihydrogen phosphate was dissolved in water to create a phosphate stock solution in a series of batch adsorption experiments phosphate

was assessed by a uv visible spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 plus at a wavelength of 880 nm by the ascorbic acid method apha 1998 the following equations were used to determine the adsorption

temperature affects thermodynamic characteristics adsorption experiments were carried out at 283 293 303 and 313 k temperatures with initial phosphate concentrations of 15 25 30 and 50 mg l and a dose of 2 0 g l adsorbent adsorption kinetics were achieved similar to this optimal conditions were used to conduct adsorption isotherms at 293 303 313 and 323 k with initial phosphate concentrations of 15 25 30 50 75 and 100 mg l based on statistical error parameters such as the sum of the squared estimate of errors sse and determination coefficient r2 values the fit quality of both kinetic and isotherm models was evaluated 2 5 adsorption experiments in natural water systems the case study site was selected to be the netravati river basin in karnataka india 12o50 13o11 n 74o46 75o44 e which has a total basin size of 4409 km2 water samples collected from different paddy field locations in dakshin kannada were chemically analyzed the collected samples were filtered using 0 45 μm whatman tmuniflopvdf sterile disposable syringe filters and were collected in acid cleaned pe bottles and preserved in ice bags a portable water quality meter eutech aqua read 1000 d was used to test in situ the ph bod ec and tds of the river samples the preserved samples were moved and kept in the refrigerator at the lab an analytical device called a continuous flow analyzer cfa skalar san 1052 was used in the lab to analyze bicarbonate and nitrate the study area geographical information and physicochemical characteristics of the samples are provided in the supplemental material fig s1 and table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ip esmb the elemental composition wt profiles of bt esmb and ip esmb are determined by xrf analysis it is obvious from table 1 that the ca2 in bt increased to 81 02 during the development of esmb the increase in ca2 that was seen in esmb suggested that ca2 ions were exchanged for na mg2 and k ions during the pre treatment of bt with the raw eggshell solution at a low ph additionally ip esmb gains fe3 86 74 as a result of fe pillaring of the esmb therefore xrf data revealed the formation of pillared clay by exhibiting an increase in the weight of fe in ip esmb the surface morphologies of the bt esmb ip esmb and raw eggshell adsorbents were studied using sem images fig 1 a and b exhibits irregularly shaped eggshell particles and block crystal type particles of bt the surface morphology of the clay mineral was significantly altered by esmb into a more precise agglomerated particle size which supported the alteration of eggshell with clay mineral fig 1c the more porous ip esmb surface morphology supported the pillaring of fe in esmb fig 1d the pillaring of fe and phosphate adsorption on the developed adsorbent ip esmb was confirmed by the appearance of the fe and phosphorous peak in the edx spectra of ip esmb p fig s2 bet surface areas were 58 99 m2 g and 111 m2 g for esmb and ip esmb respectively it is found that the pore volume and surface area of pillared clay are significantly greater than those of the prepared esmb composite according to the above mentioned data pillaring of the esmb resulted in a considerable increase in bet surface area and enlarged total adsorption pore volumes table s2 and fig s3 ftir spectra of raw eggshell esmb ip esmb and ip esmb p are displayed in fig 2 a in the ir spectrum of raw eggshells the bands at 1412 and 872 cm 1 correspond to carbonate peaks while the strong absorbance peak centered at 711 cm 1 is related to the ca o bond pandey et al 2020 the bands at 3637 and 3627 cm 1 in esmb and ip esmb are symmetric stretching vibrations of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl al al oh or si si oh groups of clay mineral the hydrogen bonded o h stretching vibrations are responsible for the comparatively weak absorption band at 3410 and 3412 cm 1 in esmb and ip esmb respectively the peak at 1636 cm 1 in esmb corresponds to the deformation mode of the h oh bending vibration of the physically adsorbed water molecule the absence of the absorption band at 1412 and 871 cm 1 which is associated with c o asymmetric stretching from either an ester group or a carboxylic group present in eggshell powder in esmb suggests that co2 evolved in acidic environments and ca2 ions diffused resulting in the production of esmb the very strong intense si o si stretching vibration peak at 1006 cm 1 and the peak at 1636 cm 1 are displaced to 1013 cm 1 and 1628 cm 1 after pillaring esmb with iron iii cations this guarantees cation exchange in the interlayer space of the modified eggshell clay bio composite and the creation of the ip esmb composite anirudhan et al 2010a in addition the shifting of the si o si and si o al bending vibration bands from 424 cm 1 and 512 cm 1 to 436 cm 1 and 518 cm 1 provided evidence for the interaction of iron iii cations with the al oh group in the alumina octahedral layers and the si o group in the siloxane layers moma et al 2018 the deformation of si o fe vibration is reflected in the ip esmb absorption band at 518 cm 1 after adsorption the ip esmb peak shifted from 1013 cm 1 to 1017 cm 1 and the development of a signal at 873 cm 1 proved that the phosphate had been adsorbed on the prepared composite sokolova et al 2015 wide angle x ray scattering waxs diffraction patterns of esmb and ip esmb are displayed in fig 2 b the typical peak of calcium bentonite in esmb corresponding to plane d 001 was seen at 2θ 6 99 with a d spacing value of 1 26 nm with the formation of ferric oxide pillars there is a minor shift in the d 001 plane s 2θ value from 6 99 to 5 67 as well as increases in peak width and d spacing of 0 25 0 45 and 1 26 nm 1 55 nm respectively this results from the interchange of calcium ions with iron iii cations in the interlayer spaces of the esmb jia et al 2017 the shift of a sharp intense peak from 2θ 20 15 d100 and 2θ 31 74 d011 to 2θ 19 68 and 29 23 in ip esmb with a peak width increment from 1 02 to 1 18 and 0 18 to 1 29 provides additional support for the modification of the esmb the size of the fe oligomer fe3 oh 4 5 present in the interlayer regions of esmb which led to increased basal spacing of clay minerals can be linked to these increments in peak widths the quartz peaks are reflected at 2θ 26 69o 35 00o and 55 23o with corresponding d spacing values of 3 35 ao 2 56 ao and 1 66 ao additionally other montmorillonite peaks are produced in esmb at 2θ 62 02o and 75 29o with a basal spacing of 1 49 and 1 26 ao fig s4 these montmorillonite and quartz peaks previously located at 2θ 62 02 and 26 69 are now located at 2θ 61 71 and 26 37 respectively and their peak widths have increased from 0 58 to 0 89 and 0 18 to 0 22 the expansion of interlayer spacing of clay minerals is signaled by these shifts in 2θ towards lower values with an increase in peak widths confirming the creation of pillared clay manohar et al 2002 fig s5 displays the thermogravimetric analysis tg and dtg curves for the ip esmb an endothermic peak was seen in the tg of ip esmb below 150 c as a result of the dehydration of interlayer and physically adsorbed water molecules because of the existence of three forms of fe2 fe3 and fe6 iron oxides a weight loss of 0 86 occurs between 200 and 300 c and a little peak with two shoulders was noticed castro et al 2019b similar to the first weight loss the second weight loss between 330 and 800 c was caused by the release of water molecules coordinated with the pillared clay mineral and the decomposition of the produced oxide baloyi et al 2018 due to the decomposition of aluminosilicates evaporation and degradation of pillared metal oxide ip esmb showed significant weight loss at 640 0c following this temperature there is an increase in weight and it remains stable up to 800 0c indicating the excellent thermal stability of ip esmb at 640 0c ip esmb displayed significant weight loss due to the breakdown of aluminosilicates evaporation and deterioration of pillared metal oxide however following this temperature the weight increases and remains steady up to 800 0c demonstrating ip esmb s thermal stability 3 2 optimization of batch adsorption parameters 3 2 1 influence of ph understanding the chemistry of phosphate speciation and the surface charge of the adsorbent is crucial to comprehend the adsorption affinity of phosphate species ions on ip esmb initially the ph measurements were carried out separately using bt and raw eggshells and these substances showed a phosphate adsorption capability of less than 20 the weak van der waals force was probably responsible for bt s low adsorption affinity however the phosphorous removal by eggshell at higher ph values may have been brought by the precipitation of ca5 po4 3oh in the alkaline media ph 8 the relatively high calcium ions in raw eggshells diffused into the clay s interlayer areas by an ion exchange process in the modified esmb adsorbent resulting in the formation of ca exchanged bentonite the use of an iron pillaring agent increased the esmb s capability for further adsorption adsorption tests for ip esmb were carried out using starting phosphate concentrations of 15 25 30 and 50 mg l and adsorbent dosage of 2 0 g l over a ph range of 2 0 8 0 in the studies phosphate adsorption on ip esmb as a function of ph is depicted in fig 3 a the maximum phosphate adsorption of 93 02 for an initial phosphate concentration of 15 mg l was attained at ph 3 0 in aqueous media phosphate species can exist as h3po4 ph 2 h2po4 ph 2 7 hpo4 2 ph 7 11 and po4 3 ph 11 according to the speciation study the major phosphate species in this case at ph 3 0 is h2po4 goscianska et al 2018 since ip esmb s zero point charge phzpc was discovered to be 5 6 protonation caused the edges to become positively charged below ph 5 6 which also favoured electrostatic attraction to h2po4 phosphate species fig 3b however the edge charge of ip esmb becomes more negative at increasing ph values producing repulsion between the adsorbent and anionic phosphorous further phosphate adsorption may be reduced as a result of competition between phosphate species and hydroxide ions for adsorption sites on the other hand ligand exchange reaction and inner sphere surface complexation have also been proposed as potential processes for phosphate adsorption onto pillared clay composite when the ph is lower ligand exchange between h2po4 phosphate species and the hydroxyl group on the adsorbent surface causes the hydroxyl group to be released into the solution which raises the ph the number of hpo4 2 species in the solution increases as a result which lowers the capacity for phosphate adsorption since h2po4 is preferable for exchange with the surface oh group than hpo4 2 lin et al 2018 the ligand exchange interaction with the surface hydroxyl group on ip esmb is represented by the following equations 3 fe oh h2po4 fe h2po4 oh 4 fe oh 2 hpo4 2 fe hpo4 2oh 5 fe h2po4 fe hpo4 h 6 fe hpo4 h2o fe h2po4 oh the maximal phosphate adsorption for the 25 30 and 50 mg l initial phosphate solutions were likewise 85 22 79 23 and 68 26 respectively 3 2 2 effect of contact time at different initial phosphate concentrations 15 25 30 and 50 mg l 2 0 g l adsorbent dose 303 k temperature ph 3 0 and by adjusting time intervals between 0 and 70 min the ability of ip esmb to remove phosphate was examined in fig 3c the impact of contact time on ip esmb s ability to remove phosphate is graphically depicted the observed results show that the amount of phosphate adsorbed on ip esmb gradually increases with time and finally achieves equilibrium at about 50 min this may be because the ip esmb has many active empty sites that are open to phosphate adsorption the majority of the active sites on the adsorbent have already been occupied by phosphate ions and there are no more unoccupied sites accessible when equilibrium after 50 min approaches the slow adsorption after 50 min was brought on by the repelling interactions between the phosphate species adsorbed on the adsorbent surface and those in the bulk phase 3 2 3 effect of initial ion concentration the effect of phosphate adsorption on ip esmb was studied with starting concentrations ranging from 15 to 100 mg l with ph and temperature being held constant at 3 0 and 303 k respectively throughout the experiment initial concentrations of 15 100 mg l resulted in a rise in equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of 6 83 38 03 mg g and a decrease in adsorption percentage of 91 01 76 11 for the limited number of adsorption surface sites on ip esmb the phosphate species in an aqueous medium would compete which would lower the proportion of phosphate adsorption more active functional groups will be present on the adsorbent surface at low concentrations but when the initial phosphate ion concentration rises the surface active site for their adsorption diminishes and the rate of adsorption falls fig 3d 3 2 4 adsorption isotherm studies adsorption isotherms provide data on the maximum adsorption capacity that characterizes the performance of an adsorbent ip esmb phosphate interactions were clarified using isotherm models such as the langmuir and freundlich isotherms at the ideal ph 2 0 g l adsorbent dosage at various temperatures 283 293 303 and 313 k at the optimum contact period of 50 min and various initial phosphate concentrations of 15 25 30 50 75 and 100 mg l respectively the langmuir isotherm model implies homogenous monolayer adsorption on a definite limited number of energetic adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface langmuir 1916 the langmuir adsorption isotherm s non linear form is as follows 7 q e q 0 b c e 1 b c e where qe mg g is the adsorption amount of phosphate per unit mass of adsorbent ce mg l is the phosphate concentration in solution at equilibrium q0 mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and b l mg is the langmuir constant related to the binding energy of adsorption the plot of qe vs ce is used to determine the values of the langmuir constants q0 and b fig 4 a likewise the freundlich adsorption isotherm model explains the non ideal reversible multilayer adsorption process over heterogeneous surfaces freundlich 1906 the non linear form of the equation is expressed as 8 q e k f c e 1 n f where kf mg g 1 mg l 1 1 nf is the freundlich constant and 1 nf is the heterogeneity factor related to extending adsorption and energy of adsorption from the qe vs ce figure the corresponding kf and 1 nf constants are calculated and shown in table 2 when statistical parameters are compared it can be seen that the langmuir model better describes the adsorption isotherm than the freundlich model with lower sse values and higher regression coefficient values r2 0 9855 a separation factor dimensionless constant rl can be represented as 9 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 mg l is the adsorbate initial phosphate concentration and b l mg is the langmuir isotherm constant the computed rl values were discovered to lie between 0 and 1 for the initial phosphate concentrations 15 100 mg l supporting the langmuir isotherm for adsorption as a result the adsorption process is explained using the best fit langmuir isotherm model in the current study it was discovered that ip esmb has a phosphate adsorption capacity of 60 51 mg g at 30 0c the adsorption capacity of the ip esmb composite and other known clay modified phosphate adsorbents are shown in table s3 3 2 5 thermodynamics of the study experiments were conducted at four different temperatures 10 0c 40 0c under the ideal contact time ph value 2 0 g l adsorbent dosage and for various initial phosphate concentrations of 15 100 mg l to examine the impact of temperature on the adsorption performance at the solid liquid interface fig 4b the amount of adsorption increases from 6 37 to 6 90 mg g in the temperature range of 10 0c to 40 0c and for an initial phosphate content of 15 mg l the maximum adsorption of 6 90 mg g was found at 40 0c similar to this the adsorption capacity varies between 10 45 11 19 12 00 13 05 19 01 21 23 23 37 31 32 and 32 51 39 01 mg g for the initial concentrations of 25 30 50 75 and 100 mg l from 10 0c to 40 0c phosphate adsorption on ip esmb peaks at 40 0c at extremely low concentrations hence as the temperature rises adsorption likewise rises which may be a result of the endothermic nature of the adsorption process equations used for studying thermodynamic parameters are as follows 10 δ g 0 r t l n ρ w k d 11 ln ρ w k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 r t where t k is the absolute temperature of the phosphate solution δg0 is the variations of the free energy change δs0 is the free energy change δh0 is the enthalpy change ρw g l 1 is the water density kd l g 1 is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and r kj mol 1k 1 is the universal gas constant by graphing ln ρw kd vs 1 t values for δh0 and δs0 are determined from the slope and intercept of the curve fig 4c the endothermic feasibility and spontaneous character of the adsorption process were disclosed from the positive δh0 10 08 kj and negative δg0 values 16 76 17 93 18 74 and 19 65 kj mol 1 values table s4 the positive value of δs0 0 09 kj mol k supported the randomization nature of the liquid solid boundary 3 2 6 adsorption kinetic models adsorption kinetics which specifies the potential rate at which the adsorption process happens is regarded as the most important parameter for defining adsorption efficiency when constructing the adsorption desorption system a physicochemical process including electrostatic interaction complex formation and ion exchange is generally perceived to maintain phosphate adsorption from the aqueous to the solid phase therefore the mechanism of phosphate removal can be depicted as follows in the absence of stoichiometric data 12 s p s p where s represents available active sites on the adsorbent p represents free phosphate ion concentrations in aqueous media and sp represents the concentration of adsorbed phosphate ions on the adsorbent k 1 and k 2 represent adsorption and desorption rate constants three major kinetic models used in this study are the pseudo first order pfo langergren 1898 pseudo second order pso ho and mckay 1999 and the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model weber and morris 1963 the non linear mathematical equations of pfo is 13 q t q e 1 e k 1 t the non linear mathematical equations of pso is 14 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t the intraparticle diffusion model 15 q t k i t 1 2 c where k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg 1min 1 are the pseudo first order and second order reaction rate constants qe and qt represent the phosphate adsorption capacity mg g at equilibrium and time t c mg g 1 is the boundary layer thickness and ki mg g min0 5 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant based on higher r2 sse χ2 and experimental qe values it can be affirmed that the pso model was the appropriate kinetic model to describe phosphate adsorption on ip esmb and is given in table 3 among pfo and pso kinetic models pseudo second order with higher r2 0 9906 low χ2 0 5 and lower sse values is the adequate model to describe adsorption kinetics fig s6 a thus it is clear from table 3 that as the initial concentration increases from 15 to 50 mg l the qe value increases suggesting the efficient utilization of available adsorption sites of ip esmb due to greater driving force by a higher concentration gradient pressure to determine the rate limiting stage in the solid liquid adsorption process intra particle diffusion models were used adsorption of solute particles in a solution involves the binding of adsorbate in active pore sites pore diffusion the transfer of h2po4 ions within the active centers of the adsorbent surface diffusion and the migration of h2po4 ions from the bulk to the surface of the adsorbent film diffusion sarkar et al 2003 intraparticle diffusion is not the rate controlling process as shown by the fact that the plot of t0 5 vs qt does not pass through the origin fig s6 b instead the adsorption process was regulated by various adsorption processes it is obvious from the multilinear plots and sections that diverge from the origin that external mass transfer takes place during adsorption causing the diffusion of phosphate ions into the pores of ip esmb 3 3 mechanism of phosphate binding onto ip esmb electrostatic attraction ligand exchange and inner sphere surface complexation are the major processes involved in the complex process of phosphate adsorption onto ip esmb fig s7 zeta potential measurements reveal that the phzpc of ip esmb is 5 6 the positively charged oligomeric iron hydroxide cations that are present in the interlayer gaps of eggshell modified bentonite clay can easily undergo electrostatic adhesion with the negatively charged phosphate ions when the solution ph is less than phzpc ip esmb is made up of a layer of two sheets in which silicon and aluminum atoms are tetrahedrally and octahedrally bonded to hydroxyl groups the positively charged proton functional al oh 2 and si oh 2 sites and phosphate species may also exhibit electrostatic attraction through a ligand exchange process phosphate can frequently remove the iron hydroxyl functional group from the appropriate metal binding sites an inner sphere complexation may have been involved in the phosphate uptake by ip esmb as evidenced by the increased phosphate adsorption concomitant to the rise in ionic strength additionally the outcome of intraparticle diffusion revealed that several adsorption processes control the phosphate adsorption process and that phosphate ions would pass through the inside of ip esmb p anions from the liquid phase have initially been transported to the solid liquid interface through electrostatic contact and a ligand exchange mechanism it will then gradually diffuse into the ip esmb s inner sphere by bonding with the surface and interlayer hydroxyl groups of the modified eggshell adsorbent the increase in the ip esmb s average pore diameter provides additional evidence that phosphate ions are capable of passing through the pores the appearance of an asymmetric p o peak at 873 cm 1 and a fe o peak at 618 cm 1 in ftir spectra validates the previously proposed process phosphate adsorption on ip esmb is also supported by the presence of the p element in the edx spectra of ip esmb p 3 4 application of ip esmb in the real water system agricultural run off samples taken from 5 different locations were used to investigate the effectiveness of ip esmb in removing phosphate following are the phosphate concentrations mg l of the samples that were examined site 1 3 14 site 2 4 25 site 3 3 04 site 4 5 11 and site 5 2 15 the optimized conditions for adsorption ph 3 dosage 2 g l concentration 15 mg l and contact time 50 min obtained from batch adsorption studies were maintained during the experiment the phosphate solutions were spiked to 11 86 10 75 11 96 9 89 and 12 85 mg l for the samples from stations 1 5 respectively and the samples percentage of phosphate removal was discovered to be between 40 and 50 this is because in addition to phosphate ions the natural water system also contains co existing anions including cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 as bicarbonate containing solutions are naturally basic and phosphate adsorption was unfavourable in alkaline environments hco3 had the highest harmful impact on phosphate adsorption among these anions multivalent ions were discovered to be easier to adsorb than monovalent ions by zhang et al 2018 the overall percentage of phosphate removal can be significantly decreased as so4 2 ion accumulation on the surface site competes with negatively charged po4 3 ions through electrostatic repulsion the creation of an outer sphere complex by cl ions was also previously observed in prior studies huang et al 2015 consequently the ability of ip esmb to adsorb phosphate is readily disrupted by these anions under the optimized condition of the adsorption process the effect of adsorbent dosage on phosphate removal was studied and the results are shown in fig s8 the addition of 2 0 g l of adsorbent dosage only shows less than 50 phosphate removal because phosphate in water mutually competes with co existing anions therefore we slightly increased the dosage quantity by adding 2 0 g l in each subsequent cycle and discovered that an adsorbent dose of around 10 0 12 0 g l is necessary for the removal of 99 9 of phosphate from various sample sites adsorbed phosphate can interact with the heavy metal cation through a ternary surface complex which can further increase the adsorption of heavy metal cation through the phosphatic complex ma et al 2015 as a result the produced composite can be employed to simultaneously remove two significant environmental contaminants from aqueous media 3 5 factorial design for quantitative adsorption estimation to optimize the number of steps needed for the complete sorption of phosphate ions using ip esmb an adsorption batch reactor was constructed based on the findings of kinetic and equilibrium experiments pre optimized variables from batch adsorption experiments were strictly maintained during the reactor design fig 5 displays a schematic diagram for a three stage batch design the main objective of the design is to reduce the initial phosphate concentration of c0 mg l at t o to cf mg l at t t for a total phosphate solution of volume v l when x g of ip esmb is added phosphate ions in the solution undergo adsorption and the number of phosphate ions changes from q0 mg g to qt mg g at the corresponding time t 0 to t t the mass balance equation for the sorption process in a single stage design is given by 16 c 0 c f v q t q 0 x under equilibrium conditions q0 0 qt qe cf ce and substituting these values along with qe q 0 b c e 1 b c e from adsorption isotherm studies in eq 16 we get 17 x v c 0 c e q 0 b c e 1 b c e after the completion of the single stage process the two stage process can be designed by considering the phosphate concentration left after the single stage design ie from ce t 0 to cf t t in volume v ml similarly for very high phosphate concentrations n stages of operation for n times can be repeated for the complete removal of phosphate ions substituting the values of q0 60 51 and b 0 072 from table 3 in eq 17 we get 18 x v c 0 c e 1 0 072 c e 4 3567 c e from this equation the amount of ip esmb required to remove phosphate ions when it is treated with a definite volume of solutions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 l having an initial phosphate concentration of 15 25 30 50 75 100 mg l can be calculated in addition to this for a given amount of ip esmb by substituting the values of known initial concentrations c0 ce can be calculated in the current experiment the deduced ce values of 14 07 and 23 69 mg l for 75 and 100 mg l initial concentration with 2 0 g l adsorbent dosage were found to be in good agreement with the experimental values for these particular concentrations around 76 82 of adsorption takes place through the single stage process hence for the 99 99 percentage removal we identified the possibility of a multistage design anirudhan et al 2010b for this eq 17 was rearranged as follows 19 q e v m c e v m c 0 to develop the multi stage process design initially a langmuir isotherm plot qe vs ce was drawn and an operating line with slope 0 5 had drawn from 100 mg l which is represented as c0 q0 and intercepted the langmuir isotherm at 24 mg l 38 mg g ie ce qe this is represented as the stage one process in the next stage an operational line with a slope of 0 5 was drawn from ce 24 mg l and the line was found to intercept at 2 8 mg l 11 mg g again a third operating line with the same slope had drawn from 2 8 mg l and in this stage ce becomes zero hence in the current experiment a three stage batch design is required for the 99 99 phosphate removal 3 6 desorption studies desorption studies of adsorbed phosphate from ip esmb facilitate the reusability of the prepared ip esmb composite studies on ph have demonstrated that the adsorption process starts at a low ph or ph 3 0 this suggests that the adsorbed phosphate species can be successfully desorbed from the produced composite at high ph i e at a basic media for desorption tests solutions ranging from 0 005 to 0 1 m naoh were investigated and maximum phosphate desorption from ip esmb bio composite was seen at 0 1 m naoh desorption experiments were thus conducted using naoh solutions and the outcomes are shown in fig s9 the adsorption capacity of ip esmb dropped from 92 02 in the first cycle to 75 40 in the fourth cycle after undergoing four cycles similarly the desorption of phosphate ions by 0 1 m naoh decreased from 89 55 to 72 80 indicating the efficiency of naoh solution to regenerate the prepared ip esmb composite 3 7 limitations the primary aim of the study was to develop ip esmb a low cost green adsorbent that is beneficial to the environment to remove phosphate species from water bodies the ability of the synthesized material to remove 99 9 of the phosphate species from an aqueous medium was discovered but the research has some limitations to estimate the ultimate cost of the adsorbent after accounting for transportation costs chemicals and electrical energy we need to conduct a cost effective analysis in the future in addition to this variation of adsorption capacity based on fe and ca content of the prepared composite has not yet been estimated despite this batch adsorption treatments are rarely used for practical industrial purposes scaling up and implementation of the prepared composite in large scale industries and adsorbing high pollution load fixed bed column experiments have to be conducted in the future hence from a future perspective the optimization of concentrations of both ca and fe also needs to be evaluated to predict the ultimate strength of the prepared material for phosphate adsorption 4 conclusion in the current work pillared clay mineral eggshell bio composite was successfully synthesized and tested for phosphate removal from aquatic ecosystems it was determined through analytical characterization techniques that the pillaring process alters the morphological surface of esmb favoring the adsorption process in batch studies ip esmb displayed successful phosphate removal at ph 3 0 and the stability of phosphate capture was somewhat reduced when competitive anions and organic matter were present capacity loss 40 50 increasing ip esmb dosages will significantly improve this fall in phosphate adsorption compared with esmb 58 99 m2 g the specific surface area of ip esmb increased to 111 00 m2 g the pseudo second order rate kinetic model was used to predict the adsorption process and the process was described as endothermic by thermodynamic studies with negative δg0 values indicating the adsorption was spontaneous ligand exchange surface complexation and electrostatic attraction dominated the adsorption process to contribute a well defined knowledge regarding complete phosphate removal from wastewater a three stage quantitative operational process design was portrayed this process design can be modulated depending on the amount of phosphate ion concentration in the solution providing information about ce and qe at any desired concentration of the phosphate ions in reusability studies the adsorbent demonstrated its highest performance
