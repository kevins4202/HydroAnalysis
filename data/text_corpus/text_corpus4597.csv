22985,the turning circle is one of the most basic and important parameters that represents the turning performance of a ship steady turning diameter is an important indicator of maneuverability of ships and has received widespread attention fin stabilizers are currently added to ship designs for the primary purpose of producing roll canceling moments during ordinary operation the present work

idea for attitude control in ship turning keywords fin stabilizer turning circle ship turning pid monte carlo simulation 1 introduction in order to reduce the time and fuel to reach the destination ships sailing on the sea always try to keep a straight line at a certain speed as much as possible perez 2005 however the ship must change its course when there are obstacles or other ships in its original course du et al 2018 in some situations the ship has to conduct emergency turn to avoid the incoming threat martin 2003 most ships rely on one or more vertically oriented rudders to accomplish the maneuvers to turn the ship in time the rudder is usually set to a certain amount of angle of attack to produce moments large enough to generate rotation about the ship s vertical axis in the intended direction carley and duberley 1972 jin and yao 2013 the turning circle is one of the most basic and important parameters that represent the turning performance of a ship perez 2005 liu 2013 the steady turning diameter is an important indicator of the maneuverability of the ship the amplitude of the steady turning diameter mainly depends on the rudder angle of attack at a certain ship speed wang 2013 the larger the rudder angle of attack the smaller the steady turning diameter however there are emergency situations that the ship cannot avoid the threat even if the rudder deflection reaches its maximum limitation especially when the ship sails in a confined waterway which seriously affects the ship safety du et al 2017 fin stabilizers are another important ship control device they are mounted in pairs on both sides of the hull at fixed angles with respect to the transverse plane of the ship and rotated through angles of equal magnitude and opposite directions about their spanwise axis as the most effective and widely adopted active roll reduction device in the world fin stabilizers are designed and optimized for the primary goal of obtaining the maximum anti rolling moments during ordinary operation there have been studies on the use of fin stabilizers to improve the turning performance of ships martin 2003 explored the effect of fin stabilizers on ship s turning characteristics in calm water considering various combination of initial ship surge velocity and constant commanded deflections of rudders and fin stabilizers wang 2013 studied the effect of fin stabilizers on ship s turning performance considering environment disturbance liang et al 2013 performed the research of rudder parameters optimization based on ship optimal turning diameter zhang 2016 used the method of sensitivity analysis to study the effects of rudder and fin stabilizer parameters on ship turning motion characteristics and obtained the optimal rudder and fin stabilizer parameters based on multi objective genetic algorithm moga optimization liang et al 2018a designed a linear quadratic regulator lqr controller to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship roll control during turning motion and proved that fin stabilizers can also greatly reduce ship rolling and heeling caused by the turning and wave disturbance however it is found that using fin stabilizers to reduce the roll motion during ship turning can also cause an increase in the turning diameter inspired by this phenomenon the present work aims to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on the turning circle control during ship turns generally fin stabilizers need to incorporate the automatic controller to achieve the optimal roll reduction for ship traveling in rough sea fang et al 2010 this also applies to the turning circle control that is a suitable controller is important to achieve satisfactory control effect the controller of the turning circle control can be selected by referring to the roll reduction controller so far pd control fang et al 2012 pid control crossland 2003 fang et al 2010 liang et al 2018c lqr control lee et al 2011 yuan 2014 liang et al 2018a adaptive control carletti et al 2009 li et al 2016 fuzzy control robert et al 1999 cao and lee 2003 sliding mode control mcgookin et al 2000 fang and luo 2007 and robust model predictive control ghaemi et al 2009 have been developed and applied to control the fin stabilizers to reduce ship roll motion the pid controller may be the one which is the most extensively applied for its high reliability and strong robustness therefore the pid controller is also considered here to realize the control of turning circle using fin stabilizers in order to inhibit the integral drift caused by integration and avoid high frequency noise induced by the differentiation an improved pid controller applied in the actual fin control is adopted here however the tuning of the control parameters are usually time consuming and depends on the operator s experience trial and error or experiments some theoretical or empirical formulas have been developed to determine the related parameters ziegler and nichols 1943 natarajan and gilbert 2017 the optimization methods such as genetic algorithm fang and luo 2006 liu and jin 2013 neural network fang et al 2010 multi objective optimization du et al 2017 mono objective optimization khanh et al 2013 or monte carlo simulation sheng 2014 were also incorporated to improve its efficiency monte carlo simulation can realistically simulate actual physical processes which makes it have large potential to solve the optimization problems it can achieve relatively optimal results through the combined effects of a large number of random numbers it is time saving compared with the common used genetic algorithm optimization therefore the monte carlo simulation is adopted in this paper to optimize the control parameters of the improved pid controller the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 establishes the mathematical models of ship motion forces and moments caused by propeller rudder fin stabilizers and wave disturbance in matlab section 3 simulates and analyzes ship s turning motion without and with fin stabilizers in calm water and verifies the established mathematical model based on the analysis results the controller design is given in section 4 section 5 represents the results and discussion finally the conclusion is given 2 ship modeling a ship in a seaway moves in six degrees of freedom as show in fig 1 two type of reference frames the inertial frames and the body fixed frames are used to describe its motion in the modeling of ship motion the ship is usually considered as a rigid body and the 6 dof equations of motions can be obtained according to the newton law perez and blanke 2002 perez 2005 the six degrees of freedom motions of the ship are coupled to each other with different coupling strength and can be divided into several groups according to the content and purpose of the study for example the main considerations in the study of manoeuvrability are the surge sway and yaw movements in horizontal plane while in the study of ship motion in vertical plane the pitch and heave attitudes are mainly considered jin and yao 2013 the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship turning circle control therefore the turning motion of the ship in horizontal plane is mainly considered take into account that ships experience a certain amount of rolling and heeling during turning the roll attitude is also included motions in pitch and heave can often be neglected in comparison with the other four degrees of freedom of motions holden et al 2007 therefore the 4 dof mathematical model of ship motion in surge sway roll and yaw is established as follow 1 m u v r x g r 2 z g p r x h y d x p r o p x f i n x r u d x e n v m v u r x g r z g p y

the characteristics of the fluid in the area of the sailing and can be expressed in the form of nonlinear functions of the position velocity and acceleration of the ship abkowitz 1964 in this paper the nonlinear hydrodynamic model given by perez and blanke 2002 is adopted 2 x h y d x u u x u u u u x v r v r y h y d y v v y p p y r r y u v u v y u r u r y v v v v y v r v r y r v r v y φ u v φ u v

is the ship s volumetric displacement g z φ is an expression of the ship s resistance to capsizing as a function of roll angle the multipliers are the ship s hydrodynamic coefficients propeller is the propulsion device of the ship its complex structure and hydrodynamic characteristics make it difficult to model accurately to simplify the research the thrust force generated by the propeller is assumed to be equal to the ship resistance which can be set equal to x u u u 0 2 as a first approximation perez 2005 ignore the effects of propeller on other three degrees of freedom the propeller forces and moments can be expressed as 3 x p r o p x u u u 0 2 y p r o p 0 k p r o p 0 n p r o p 0 where x u u is the hydrodynamic coefficient related to the surge velocity u 0 is the initial sailing speed fin stabilizers and rudders are the main ship control devices with similar shapes but different locations they are driven by hydraulic machinery according to the action command from the controller the simplified model presented by van amerongen et al 1990 as shown in fig 2 is adopted here to simulate the hydraulic machinery to impose constraints on the control action α c α m α m a x and α m a x are the control command mechanical angle maximum angle and maximum turning rate of the fin or rudder respectively the forces generated on a hydrofoil moving in uniform flow with a certain angle of attack are shown in fig 3 u is the relative inflow velocity α is the angle of attack b is the chord a is the distance between the shaft and the leading edge x c is the distance between the centre of pressure and the leading edge f is the resultant hydrodynamic force generated on the hydrofoil and can be divided into the lift force l perpendicular to the incoming flow direction and the drag force d along the flow direction or the tangential force t along to the chord direction and the normal force n perpendicular to the chord direction the relationship between the hydrodynamic force and each component is as follows 4 f l 2 d 2 t 2 n 2 n d sin α l cos α t d cos α l sin α the lift and drag generated on the hydrofoil can be calculated as perez 2005 5 l 0 5 ρ u 2 a c l α d 0 5 ρ u 2 a c d 0 c l 2 α 0 9 π λ where a is the hydrofoil area λ is the aspect ratio of the hydrofoil c l α and c d 0 are the lift coefficient and minimum section drag coefficient of the hydrofoil respectively the rudder is installed below the stern line and mainly used to control the course of the ship the rudder forces and moments acting the hull can be calculated as wang 2013 6 x r u d d r δ r y r u d l r δ r k r u d r r l r δ r n r u d l c g l r δ r where l r and d r are the rudder induced side force and drag force respectively δ r is the effective rudder angle of attack r r and l c g are the vertical and longitudinal distance between the centre of pressure of the rudder and the centre of gravity of the ship respectively fin stabilizers are mounted in pairs on both sides of the bilge of the hull and mainly used to reduce the roll motion of the ship the forces and moments generated on the fin stabilizers can be expressed as perez 2005 7 x f i n 2 t f α e y f i n 2 n f sin β f i n α e k f i n 2 r f n f α e n f i n 2 f c g n f sin β f i n α e where t f and n f are the fin induced tangential force and normal force respectively r f and f c g are the roll arm and yaw arm of the fin respectively β f i n is the fin tilt angle α c is the effective fin angle of attack considering the roll induced vertical velocity and can be calculated as 8 α e α f arctan r f p u where α f is the fin mechanical angle of attack ships sailing in a seaway often suffer from environment disturbances such as sea waves winds and currents among them sea waves may have the largest effect on the normal navigation of the ship therefore the disturbance forces and moments caused by sea waves are mainly considered in this paper however the motion of sea waves is a complicated stochastic process which is difficult to model accurately the model including the first order and the second order wave disturbance proposed by daidola 1986 is adopted here to simulate the disturbance forces and moments caused by sea waves and can be expressed as 9 x w a v e ρ g cos χ n 1 n n e n ω n 2 g a n cos ω e t ε n b n sin ω e t ε n 0 5 ρ l p p cos χ n 1 n n c x w λ n a n 2 y w a v e ρ g sin χ n 1 n n e n ω n 2 g a n

forces and moments c x w c y w and c n w are the corresponding coefficients of the second order wave disturbance forces and moments ω n and ω e are the wave frequency and encounter frequency respectively χ is the encounter angle l p p is the ship length and d is the ship draft ε n λ n a n and s ς ω n are the random phase wave length wave height and wave height spectrum of the nth regular wave respectively n n is the number of regular waves 3 simulation analysis in order to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship turning performance the simulations of ship turning without and with fin stabilizers are conducted based on the mathematical model established in section 2 in this paper a multipurpose naval vessel with a pair of fin stabilizers and twin rudders is selected as the research object the main parameters of the full scale vessel are shown in table 1 the hydrodynamic coefficients of the multipurpose naval vessel in surge sway roll and yaw can be found in perez 2005 the principle parameters of the fin stabilizer and rudder are shown in table 2 although the simulated stall angle of the fin is up to 35 the maximum fin angle of attack is limited to 25 considering the machinery constraints and load torque in practical application the rudder angle that turns the ship to port is defined as the positive rudder angle the fin angle that rolls the ship to port is defined as the positive fin angle the seawater density is 1025 kg m3 the coordinate of cg in body fixed coordinate system is 3 38 0 1 06 the commercial cfd software fluent was used to calculate the lift coefficients of the fin and rudder the three dimensional numerical simulation was adopted to get accurate results the mesh models of the fin and rudder as well as the corresponding computational domains were built in the pre process software gambit and imported to fluent for the calculation simulation denser meshes were used where it is closer to the fin and rudder to improve the precision accuracy of the computation the computation domains of the fin and rudder are 10 times 5 times and 5 times the chord of the fin and rudder respectively the pressure based implicit solver the simpec algorithm and rng k ε turbulence model were used to accomplish the numerical simulations the remeshing method was used to avoid generating negative cells the inlet and outlet of the computational domains were set as velocity inlet space and pressure outlet space respectively the remaining other side were set as symmetry boundary condition the surfaces of the fin and rudder were set as wall with no slip condition the lift coefficients of the fin and rudder versus angle of attack obtained from cfd simulations are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the maximum lift coefficients of the fin and rudder obtained from are about 1 25 and 1 34 which are basically consistent with the values 1 26 and 1 33 given in martin 2003 and perez 2005 3 1 model verification in order to verify the established mathematical model of ship motion the ship turning motion without the act of fin stabilizers are conducted the simulation results in liang et al 2018b show that the positive and negative rudder angles with the same magnitude have the same effect on ship turning motion except for the direction therefore the turning motion under the action of the positive rudder angle is analyzed and discussed in the following sections fig 5 shows the simulation results of ship turning in clam water with different initial sailing speeds at rudder angle of 30 the corresponding numerical results are shown in table 3 it should be noted that the total simulation time is 250 s to have a clear representation of the transient process of the turning motion the roll rate curves of the first 100 s are given due to the lack of data from model tests and full scale trials the accuracy of the established 4 dof mathematical model of ship motion is verified by comparing the simulation results with the calculation results using empirical formulas obtained by summarizing a large number of model tests and full scale trials davidson 1944 suggests the following formula to describe the relationship between the speed drop on turning and the relative steady turning radius 10 u 0 u s 3 sin π 2 u s u 0 5 9 r 0 l p p 2 1 where u s is the initial sailing speed and the steady turning speed respectively r 0 is the steady turning radius the steady outward heel angle during ship turning in calm water can be estimated by the following formula jia and yang 1999 11 φ s u s 2 v c g d 2 g h r 0 where v c g is the vertical distance between the centre of gravity and the baseline of the ship h is the transverse metacentric height the theoretical steady turning diameter and outward heel angle are calculated using eqs 11 and 12 according to the speed drop on turning obtained from simulations the comparison of simulation results and calculation results is shown in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the simulation results of the steady turning diameter and outward heel angle are slightly less than the theoretical calculations the error of the steady turning diameter between simulations and calculations is small and less than 1 5 whereas the error of the steady outward heel angle between simulations and calculations is between 17 5 and 25 which is relative large however the error of the steady outward heel angle between simulations and calculations is still in the reasonable range considering the small value base of the steady outward heel angle take into account the simplification in the modeling process the above errors are all within a reasonable range therefore the established 4 dof mathematical model of ship motion can be considered correct and the obtained results obtained by simulation have a certain reference value 3 2 ship turning motion with fin stabilizers in order to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on turning circle control during ship turning ship turning motion with fin stabilizers are simulated without loss of generality the initial sailing speed is set at 15 m s and the rudder angle is set at 30 the simulation results of ship turning in calm water under the action of fin stabilizers are shown in fig 6 the total simulation time is 100 s and the roll rate curves of the first 50 s are given to have a clear representation of the transient process it can be seen from fig 6 and table 5 that the fin stabilizers can greatly affect the ship turning performance in the light of conducted simulations the positive and negative fin angles have the opposite effect on ship turning motion the positive fin angle increases the inward heel and the steady turning diameter and decreases and even eliminates the steady outward heel whereas the negative fin angle increases the steady outward heel decreases the steady turning diameter and even eliminates the inward heel the steady turning diameter with fin angle of 20 increases by 14 64 whereas the steady turning diameter with fin angle of 20 decreases by 12 05 compared with that without the action of fin stabilizers which means we can use the fin stabilizers to realize the turning circle control in a certain range it can be noted that the effect of fin stabilizers on the steady outward heel and the steady turning diameter is just the opposite which means we can use the fin stabilizers to control steady outward heel to indirectly control the turning circle therefore the control strategy using fin stabilizers to control the turning circle is obtained 4 controller design and parameter optimization it can be known from the simulation results that the effect of fin stabilizers on the outward heel is opposite to that on the turning diameter and we can use this feature to control the turning circle that is the fin stabilizers are operated in anti rolling mode to increase the turning circle whereas in forced rolling mode to decrease the turning circle in order to minimize the turning circle the fin stabilizers should be used to increase the outward heel of the ship as much as possible while ensuring the safety of the ship the diagram of turning circle control can be shown in fig 7 4 1 improved pid controller pid controllers are the most used controllers in the world as they are easy to maintain and tune and have higher reliability and strong robustness liu 2013 they are extensively applied in ship industry such as the control of fin stabilizers crossland 2003 fang et al 2010 anti rolling tanks marzouk and nayfeh 2009 magnus rotating roll stabilizers liang et al 2017 etc the pid controller is usually expressed as 12 g p i d s k p k i 1 s k d s where k p k i and k d are the gains of proportional integral and derivative respectively the control law for a control system in practice has to be stable and reliable for a long time to improve the stability and reliability of the pid controller the integral is replaced by a first order inertial element to avoid the integral drift caused by the integrator and the derivative is substituted by a second order oscillating element to avoid high frequency noise in the working frequency range of fin stabilizers of 0 4 1 6 rad s therefore the improved pid controller is obtained as 13 g p i d s k p k i k 1 t 1 s 1 k d k 2 s t 2 s 1 t 3 s 1 where k 1 k 2 t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the gains and time constants of the first order inertial element and the second order oscillation element respectively 4 2 monte carlo simulation optimization monte carlo simulation mcs is a random simulation method and is very important numerical method guided by probability statistics theory it uses random numbers to solve complex computational problems and can guarantee the accuracy of the optimization process it has been widely used in financial engineering macroeconomics and computational physics it is also extensively applied in optimization problem in ocean engineering naess et al 2017 huseby et al 2013 kim and kim 2017 and controller parameters sheng 2014 liang et al 2018b in this paper the mcs is adopted to optimize the control gain parameters of the improved pid controller to achieve good control effect on ship turning circle to simplify the research the multidisciplinary optimization software isight is adopted isight is an excellent software integration platform it does not perform calculations by itself however it can quickly integrate and couple various simulation softwares as needed in the form of building blocks and automatically run simulation program and restart the design process in this paper isight is used to integrate the mcs optimization algorithm and the ship motion program in matlab the integration is shown in fig 8 where the ship motion program simulates ship s turning motion and the optimization program in isight selects appropriate control parameters according to the cost function results and sends back to matlab the optimal control parameters can be obtained after the optimization process is completed the mcs generates random combination of controller gain parameters within the preset parameter ranges according to the selected random sampling technique in this paper the descriptive sampling method is adopted the preset parameter ranges are selected according to the control parameters obtained through ziegler nichols approach for comparison purpose two evaluation indexes of the performance of the turning circle control are adopted as 14 j 1 var φ φ s e t j 2 w 1 var φ φ s e t w 2 var α f where var φ φ s e t is the variance of the roll angle with respect to the maximum expected heel angle φ s e t var α f is the variance of the fin angle w 1 and w 2 are the weighting coefficients 5 results and discussion simulations are performed to demonstrate the effect of turning circle control using fin stabilizers with the developed pid controller the simulation parameters are as follows the rudder angle is 30 the initial ship speed is 15 m s the significant wave height is 1 5 m and the initial encounter angle is 90 for the target vessel in this paper it is assumed that its safety outward heel angle is 25 therefore for safety considerations the maximum expected outward heel angle is set to 20 the controller parameters obtained from ziegler nichols method are k p 1 062 k i 0 5446 and k d 0 497 the ranges of k p k i and k d for mcs are selected as 0 5 0 3 and 0 5 according to the control gains obtained from ziegler nichols approach the optimized pid parameters using j 1 as the evaluation index are k p 2 375 k i 0 475 and k d 1 175 the optimized pid parameters using j 2 as the evaluation index are k p 4 075 k i 0 225 and k d 4 275 with w 1 5 and w 2 1 the simulation results are shown in fig 9 the performance of turning circle control is given in table 6 the roll angle in table 6 represents the single significant amplitude of the roll angle it can be seen from fig 9 and table 6 that the turning circle has been reduced to a certain degree and the ship turns faster with turning circle control tcc the turning diameter with control is reduced by 9 1 compared to the diameter without control the turning period is reduced from 74 9s to 72 8s the total turning path is reduced from 895 m to about 812 m the cost to reduce the turning circle is to increase the outward heel the control effect of monte carlo simulation based pid mcs pid is better than the ziegler nichols based pid zn pid the outward heel angle under msc pid control is smoother and close to the maximum expected outward heel angle the turning diameter and fin angle under mcs pid control with the evaluation index considering ship s roll and fin s movement have a certain degree of reduction compared with that only considering ship s roll which saves energy to a certain degree simulation results show fin stabilizers is promising and effective in ship turning circle control with a properly designed pid controller 6 conclusion in this paper the effect of fin stabilizers on turning circle control during ship turns is investigated the models of ship motion and forces and moments caused by propeller rudder fin stabilizer and wave disturbance are established based on the established models in matlab the simulations of ship turning motion with and without the action of fin stabilizers are carried out simulation results show that fin stabilizers can obviously affect ship turning performance based on the characteristics that the effect of fin stabilizers on turning circle and outward heel is opposite the turning circle can be indirectly controlled by control the outward heel using fin stabilizers for engineering application an improved pid controller is developed to realize the turning circle control monte carlo simulation is adopted to optimize the developed pid control parameters for comparison purpose two evaluation indexes are used in monte carlo simulation optimization simulation results show that the mcs based pid control with performance index considering ship s roll and fin s movement has a better control effect the turning circle diameter reduces obviously and the outward heel is smoother and more close to the expected maximum outward heel with less fin action it can be concluded that fin stabilizers are promising for turning circle control during ship turning with a properly designed pid controller it

original course du et al 2018 in some situations the ship has to conduct emergency turn to avoid the incoming threat martin 2003 most ships rely on one or more vertically oriented rudders to accomplish the maneuvers to turn the ship in time the rudder is usually set to a certain amount of angle of attack to produce moments large enough to generate rotation about the ship s vertical axis

2013 the steady turning diameter is an important indicator of the maneuverability of the ship the amplitude of the steady turning diameter mainly depends on the rudder angle of attack at a certain ship speed wang 2013 the larger the rudder angle of attack the smaller the steady turning diameter however there are emergency situations that the ship cannot avoid the threat even if the rudder deflection reaches its maximum limitation especially when the ship sails in a confined waterway which seriously affects the ship safety du et al 2017 fin stabilizers are another important ship control

adaptive control carletti et al 2009 li et al 2016 fuzzy control robert et al 1999 cao and lee 2003 sliding mode control mcgookin et al 2000 fang and luo 2007 and robust model predictive control ghaemi et al 2009 have been developed and applied to control the fin stabilizers to reduce ship roll motion the pid controller may be the one which is the most extensively applied for its high reliability and strong robustness therefore the pid controller is also considered here to realize the control of turning circle using fin stabilizers in order to inhibit the integral drift caused by integration and avoid high frequency noise induced by the differentiation an improved pid controller applied in the actual fin control is adopted here however the tuning of the control parameters are usually time consuming and depends on the operator s experience trial and error or experiments some theoretical or empirical formulas have been developed to determine the related parameters ziegler and nichols 1943 natarajan and gilbert 2017 the optimization methods such as genetic algorithm fang and luo 2006 liu and jin 2013 neural network fang et al 2010 multi objective optimization du et al 2017 mono objective optimization khanh et al 2013 or monte carlo simulation sheng 2014 were also incorporated to improve its efficiency monte carlo simulation can realistically simulate actual physical processes which makes it have large potential to solve the optimization problems it can achieve relatively optimal results through the combined effects of a large number of random numbers it is time saving compared with the common used genetic algorithm optimization therefore the monte carlo simulation is adopted in this paper to optimize the control parameters of the improved pid controller the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 establishes the mathematical models of ship motion forces and moments caused by propeller rudder fin stabilizers and wave disturbance in matlab section 3 simulates and analyzes ship s turning motion without and with fin stabilizers in calm water and verifies the established mathematical model based on the analysis results the controller design is given in section 4 section 5 represents the results and discussion finally the conclusion is given 2 ship modeling a ship in a seaway moves in six degrees of freedom as show in fig 1 two type of reference frames the inertial frames and the body fixed frames are used to describe its motion in the modeling of ship motion the ship is usually considered as a rigid body and the 6 dof equations of motions can be obtained according to the newton law perez and blanke 2002 perez 2005 the six degrees of freedom motions of the ship are coupled to each other with different coupling strength and can be divided into several groups according to the content and purpose of the study for example the main considerations in the study of manoeuvrability are the surge sway and yaw movements in horizontal plane while in the study of ship motion in vertical plane the pitch and heave attitudes are mainly considered jin and yao 2013 the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship turning circle control therefore the turning motion of the ship in horizontal plane is mainly considered take into account that ships experience a certain amount of rolling and heeling during turning the roll attitude is also included motions in pitch and heave can often be neglected in comparison with the other four degrees of freedom of motions holden et al 2007 therefore the 4 dof mathematical model of ship motion in surge sway roll and yaw is established as follow 1 m u v r x g r 2 z g p r x h y d x p r o p x f i n x r u d x e n v m v u r x g r z g p y

the characteristics of the fluid in the area of the sailing and can be expressed in the form of nonlinear functions of the position velocity and acceleration of the ship abkowitz 1964 in this paper the nonlinear hydrodynamic model given by perez and blanke 2002 is adopted 2 x h y d x u u x u u u u x v r v r y h y d y v v y p p y r r y u v u v y u r u r y v v v v y v r v r y r v r v y φ u v φ u v

is the ship s volumetric displacement g z φ is an expression of the ship s resistance to capsizing as a function of roll angle the multipliers are the ship s hydrodynamic coefficients propeller is the propulsion device of the ship its complex structure and hydrodynamic characteristics make it difficult to model accurately to simplify the research the thrust force generated by the propeller is assumed to be equal to the ship resistance which can be set equal to x u u u 0 2 as a first approximation perez 2005 ignore the effects of propeller on other three degrees of freedom the propeller forces and moments can be expressed as 3 x p r o p x u u u 0 2 y p r o p 0 k p r o p 0 n p r o p 0 where x u u is the hydrodynamic coefficient related to the surge velocity u 0 is the initial sailing speed fin stabilizers and rudders are the main ship control devices with similar shapes but different locations they are driven by hydraulic machinery according to the action command from the controller the simplified model presented by van amerongen et al 1990 as shown in fig 2 is adopted here to simulate the hydraulic machinery to impose constraints on the control action α c α m α m a x and α m a x are the control command mechanical angle maximum angle and maximum turning rate of the fin or rudder respectively the forces generated on a hydrofoil moving in uniform flow with a certain angle of attack are shown in fig 3 u is the relative inflow velocity α is the angle of attack b is the chord a is the distance between the shaft and the leading edge x c is the distance between the centre of pressure and the leading edge f is the resultant hydrodynamic force generated on the hydrofoil and can be divided into the lift force l perpendicular to the incoming flow direction and the drag force d along the flow direction or the tangential force t along to the chord direction and the normal force n perpendicular to the chord direction the relationship between the hydrodynamic force and each component is as follows 4 f l 2 d 2 t 2 n 2 n d sin α l cos α t d cos α l sin α the lift and drag generated on the hydrofoil can be calculated as perez 2005 5 l 0 5 ρ u 2 a c l α d 0 5 ρ u 2 a c d 0 c l 2 α 0 9 π λ where a is the hydrofoil area λ is the aspect ratio of the hydrofoil c l α and c d 0 are the lift coefficient and minimum section drag coefficient of the hydrofoil respectively the rudder is installed below the stern line and mainly used to control the course of the ship the rudder forces and moments acting the hull can be calculated as wang 2013 6 x r u d d r δ r y r u d l r δ r k r u d r r l r δ r n r u d l c g l r δ r where l r and d r are the rudder induced side force and drag force respectively δ r is the effective rudder angle of attack r r and l c g are the vertical and longitudinal distance between the centre of pressure of the rudder and the centre of gravity of the ship respectively fin stabilizers are mounted in pairs on both sides of the bilge of the hull and mainly used to reduce the roll motion of the ship the forces and moments generated on the fin stabilizers can be expressed as perez 2005 7 x f i n 2 t f α e y f i n 2 n f sin β f i n α e k f i n 2 r f n f α e n f i n 2 f c g n f sin β f i n α e where t f and n f are the fin induced tangential force and normal force respectively r f and f c g are the roll arm and yaw arm of the fin respectively β f i n is the fin tilt angle α c is the effective fin angle of attack considering the roll induced vertical velocity and can be calculated as 8 α e α f arctan r f p u where α f is the fin mechanical angle of attack ships sailing in a seaway often suffer from environment disturbances such as sea waves winds and currents among them sea waves may have the largest effect on the normal navigation of the ship therefore the disturbance forces and moments caused by sea waves are mainly considered in this paper however the motion of sea waves is a complicated stochastic process which is difficult to model accurately the model including the first order and the second order wave disturbance proposed by daidola 1986 is adopted here to simulate the disturbance forces and moments caused by sea waves and can be expressed as 9 x w a v e ρ g cos χ n 1 n n e n ω n 2 g a n cos ω e t ε n b n sin ω e t ε n 0 5 ρ l p p cos χ n 1 n n c x w λ n a n 2 y w a v e ρ g sin χ n 1 n n e n ω n 2 g a n

with fin stabilizers are conducted based on the mathematical model established in section 2 in this paper a multipurpose naval vessel with a pair of fin stabilizers and twin rudders is selected as the research object the main parameters of the full scale vessel are shown in table 1 the hydrodynamic coefficients of the multipurpose naval vessel in surge sway roll and yaw can be found in perez 2005 the principle parameters of the fin stabilizer and rudder are shown in table 2 although the simulated stall angle of the fin is up to 35 the maximum fin angle of attack is limited to 25 considering the machinery constraints and load torque in practical application the rudder angle that turns the ship to port is defined as the positive rudder angle the fin angle that rolls the ship to port is defined as the positive fin angle the seawater density is 1025 kg m3 the coordinate of cg in body fixed coordinate system is 3 38 0 1 06 the commercial cfd software fluent was used to calculate the lift coefficients of the fin and rudder the three dimensional numerical simulation was adopted to get accurate results the mesh models of the fin and rudder as well as the corresponding computational domains were built in the pre process software gambit and imported to fluent for the calculation simulation denser meshes were used where it is closer to the fin and rudder to improve the precision accuracy of the computation the computation domains of the fin and rudder are 10 times 5 times and 5 times the chord of the fin and rudder respectively the pressure based implicit solver the simpec algorithm and rng k ε turbulence model were used to accomplish the numerical simulations the remeshing method was used to avoid generating negative cells the inlet and outlet of the computational domains were set as velocity inlet space and pressure outlet space respectively the remaining other side were set as symmetry boundary condition the surfaces of the fin and rudder were set as wall with no slip condition the lift coefficients of the fin and rudder versus angle of attack obtained from cfd simulations are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the maximum lift coefficients of the fin and rudder obtained from are about 1 25 and 1 34 which are basically consistent with the values 1 26 and 1 33 given in martin 2003 and perez 2005 3 1 model verification in order to verify the established mathematical model of ship motion the ship turning motion without the act of fin stabilizers are conducted the simulation results in liang et al 2018b show that the positive and negative rudder angles with the same magnitude have the same effect on ship turning motion except for the direction therefore the turning motion under the action of the positive rudder angle is analyzed and discussed in the following sections fig 5 shows the simulation results of ship turning in clam water with different initial sailing speeds at rudder angle of 30 the corresponding numerical results are shown in table 3 it should be noted that the total simulation time is 250 s to have a clear representation of the transient process of the turning motion the roll rate curves of the first 100 s are given due to the lack of data from model tests and full scale trials the accuracy of the established 4 dof mathematical model of ship motion is verified by comparing the simulation results with the calculation results using empirical formulas obtained by summarizing a large number of model tests and full scale trials davidson 1944 suggests the following formula to describe the relationship between the speed drop on turning and the relative steady turning radius 10 u 0 u s 3 sin π 2 u s u 0 5 9 r 0 l p p 2 1 where u s is the initial sailing speed and the steady turning speed respectively r 0 is the steady turning radius the steady outward heel angle during ship turning in calm water can be estimated by the following formula jia and yang 1999 11 φ s u s 2 v c g d 2 g h r 0 where v c g is the vertical distance between the centre of gravity and the baseline of the ship h is the transverse metacentric height the theoretical steady turning diameter and outward heel angle are calculated using eqs 11 and 12 according to the speed drop on turning obtained from simulations the comparison of simulation results and calculation results is shown in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the simulation results of the steady turning diameter and outward heel angle are slightly less than the theoretical calculations the error of the steady turning diameter between simulations and calculations is small and less than 1 5 whereas the error of the steady outward heel angle between simulations and calculations is between 17 5 and 25 which is relative large however the error of the steady outward heel angle between simulations and calculations is still in the reasonable range considering the small value base of the steady outward heel angle take into account the simplification in the modeling process the above errors are all within a reasonable range therefore the established 4 dof mathematical model of ship motion can be considered correct and the obtained results obtained by simulation have a certain reference value 3 2 ship turning motion with fin stabilizers in order to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on turning circle control during ship turning ship turning motion with fin stabilizers are simulated without loss of generality the initial sailing speed is set at 15 m s and the rudder angle is set at 30 the simulation results of ship turning in calm water under the action of fin stabilizers are shown in fig 6 the total simulation time is 100 s and the roll rate curves of the first 50 s are given to have a clear representation of the transient process it can be seen from fig 6 and table 5 that the fin stabilizers can greatly affect the ship turning performance in the light of conducted simulations the positive and negative fin angles have the opposite effect on ship turning motion the positive fin angle increases the inward heel and the steady turning diameter and decreases and even eliminates the steady outward heel whereas the negative fin angle increases the steady outward heel decreases the steady turning diameter and even eliminates the inward heel the steady turning diameter with fin angle of 20 increases by 14 64 whereas the steady turning diameter with fin angle of 20 decreases by 12 05 compared with that without the action of fin stabilizers which means we can use the fin stabilizers to realize the turning circle control in a certain range it can be noted that the effect of fin stabilizers on the steady outward heel and the steady turning diameter is just the opposite which means we can use the fin stabilizers to control steady outward heel to indirectly control the turning circle therefore the control strategy using fin stabilizers to control the turning circle is obtained 4 controller design and parameter optimization it can be known from the simulation results that the effect of fin stabilizers on the outward heel is opposite to that on the turning diameter and we can use this feature to control the turning circle that is the fin stabilizers are operated in anti rolling mode to increase the turning circle whereas in forced rolling mode to decrease the turning circle in order to minimize the turning circle the fin stabilizers should be used to increase the outward heel of the ship as much as possible while ensuring the safety of the ship the diagram of turning circle control can be shown in fig 7 4 1 improved pid controller pid controllers are the most used controllers in the world as they are easy to maintain and tune and have higher reliability and strong robustness liu 2013 they are extensively applied in ship industry such as the control of fin stabilizers crossland 2003 fang et al 2010 anti rolling tanks marzouk and nayfeh 2009 magnus rotating roll stabilizers liang et al 2017 etc the pid controller is usually expressed as 12 g p i d s k p k i 1 s k d s where k p k i and k d are the gains of proportional integral and derivative respectively the control law for a control system in practice has to be stable and reliable for a long time to improve the stability and reliability of the pid controller the integral is replaced by a first order inertial element to avoid the integral drift caused by the integrator and the derivative is substituted by a second order oscillating element to avoid high frequency noise in the working frequency range of fin stabilizers of 0 4 1 6 rad s therefore the improved pid controller is obtained as 13 g p i d s k p k i k 1 t 1 s 1 k d k 2 s t 2 s 1 t 3 s 1 where k 1 k 2 t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the gains and time constants of the first order inertial element and the second order oscillation element respectively 4 2 monte carlo simulation optimization monte carlo simulation mcs is a random simulation method and is very important numerical method guided by probability statistics theory it uses random numbers to solve complex computational problems and can guarantee the accuracy of the optimization process it has been widely used in financial engineering macroeconomics and computational physics it is also extensively applied in optimization problem in ocean engineering naess et al 2017 huseby et al 2013 kim and kim 2017 and controller parameters sheng 2014 liang et al 2018b in this paper the mcs is adopted to optimize the control gain parameters of the improved pid controller to achieve good control effect on ship turning circle to simplify the research the multidisciplinary optimization software isight is adopted isight is an excellent software integration platform it does not perform calculations by itself however it can quickly integrate and couple various simulation softwares as needed in the form of building blocks and automatically run simulation program and restart the design process in this paper isight is used to integrate the mcs optimization algorithm and the ship motion program in matlab the integration is shown in fig 8 where the ship motion program simulates ship s turning motion and the optimization program in isight selects appropriate control parameters according to the cost function results and sends back to matlab the optimal control parameters can be obtained after the optimization process is completed the mcs generates random combination of controller gain parameters within the preset parameter ranges according to the selected random sampling technique in this paper the descriptive sampling method is adopted the preset parameter ranges are selected according to the control parameters obtained through ziegler nichols approach for comparison purpose two evaluation indexes of the performance of the turning circle control are adopted as 14 j 1 var φ φ s e t j 2 w 1 var φ φ s e t w 2 var α f where var φ φ s e t is the variance of the roll angle with respect to the maximum expected heel angle φ s e t var α f is the variance of the fin angle w 1 and w 2 are the weighting coefficients 5 results and discussion simulations are performed to demonstrate the effect of turning circle control using fin stabilizers with the developed pid controller the simulation parameters are as follows the rudder angle is 30 the initial ship speed is 15 m s the significant wave height is 1 5 m and the initial encounter angle is 90 for the target vessel in this paper it is assumed that its safety outward heel angle is 25 therefore for safety considerations the maximum expected outward heel angle is set to 20 the controller parameters obtained from ziegler nichols method are k p 1 062 k i 0 5446 and k d 0 497 the ranges of k p k i and k d for mcs are selected as 0 5 0 3 and 0 5 according to the control gains obtained from ziegler nichols approach the optimized pid parameters using j 1 as the evaluation index are k p 2 375 k i 0 475 and k d 1 175 the optimized pid parameters using j 2 as the evaluation index are k p 4 075 k i 0 225 and k d 4 275 with w 1 5 and w 2 1 the simulation results are shown in fig 9 the performance of turning circle control is given in table 6 the roll angle in table 6 represents the single significant amplitude of the roll angle it can be seen from fig 9 and table 6 that the turning circle has been reduced to a certain degree and the ship turns faster with turning circle control tcc the turning diameter with control is reduced by 9 1 compared to the diameter without control the turning period is reduced from 74 9s to 72 8s the total turning path is reduced from 895 m to about 812 m the cost to reduce the turning circle is to increase the outward heel the control effect of monte carlo simulation based pid mcs pid is better than the ziegler nichols based pid zn pid the outward heel angle under msc pid control is smoother and close to the maximum expected outward heel angle the turning diameter and fin angle under mcs pid control with the evaluation index considering ship s roll and fin s movement have a certain degree of reduction compared with that only considering ship s roll which saves energy to a certain degree simulation results show fin stabilizers is promising and effective in ship turning circle control with a properly designed pid controller 6 conclusion in this paper the effect of fin stabilizers on turning circle control during ship turns is investigated the models of ship motion and forces and moments caused by propeller rudder fin stabilizer and wave disturbance are established based on the established models in matlab the simulations of ship turning motion with and without the action of fin stabilizers are carried out simulation results show that fin stabilizers can obviously affect ship turning performance based on the characteristics that the effect of fin stabilizers on turning circle and outward heel is opposite the turning circle can be indirectly controlled by control the outward heel using fin stabilizers for engineering application an improved pid controller is developed to realize the turning circle control monte carlo simulation is adopted to optimize the developed pid control parameters for comparison purpose two evaluation indexes are used in monte carlo simulation optimization simulation results show that the mcs based pid control with performance index considering ship s roll and fin s movement has a better control effect the turning circle diameter reduces obviously and the outward heel is smoother and more close to the expected maximum outward heel with less fin action it can be concluded that fin stabilizers are promising for turning circle control during ship turning with a properly designed pid controller it also provides a new idea to the attitude control in ship turning acknowledgment this work is supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities under grant heucfm170404 harbin

22986,designing floating offshore wind turbine system is a quite challenging task because of the complex environmental loading and complicated coupling effects in the present study the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic model for numerical simulation of floating offshore wind turbine fowt is established with open source tool openfoam the coupled fowt ualm sjtu solver is developed using the open source cfd package openfoam in which the unsteady actuator line model ualm is introduced into openfoam for the aerodynamic simulation of wind turbine while the hydrodynamic computation of floating platform is carried out with a two phase cfd solver naoe foam sjtu in the coupled model the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are solved with the turbulence model k ω sst employed for closure of rans equations and the pressure implicit with splitting of operations piso algorithm is applied to solve the pressure velocity coupling equations the coupled responses of a fowt with nrel 5mw baseline wind turbine mounted on a semi submersible platform are investigated from the simulation aerodynamic forces including the unsteady aerodynamic power and thrust can be obtained and hydrodynamic responses such as the six degree of freedom motions of the floating platform and the mooring tensions are also available the impact of dynamic motions of floating platform on the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine is analyzed and the effect of the aerodynamic forces on the hydrodynamic response of the floating platform is also studied keywords unsteady actuator line model coupled aero hydrodynamics fowt ualm sjtu solver naoe foam sjtu solver floating offshore wind turbine 1 introduction excessive exploitation of conventional fossil fuels has intensified the energy crisis and environmental pollution problem which makes it an immediate issue to find clean and renewable energy resource to replace the traditional energy as one of the most promising non polluting renewable energy sources wind energy has shown great potential and attracted the global attention exploitation of wind energy has experienced rapid growth since last few decades according to the statistics the global reserves of wind energy is up to 2 74 109mw and 2 107mw are utilizable zhang et al 2010 which is about 10 times of the available water energy the offshore wind resource has lots of particular advantages over onshore wind energy for instance the average speed of offshore wind is about 90 larger than that of onshore one archer and jacobson 2005 wind turbines as wind energy harvesting devices has developed from onshore to offshore wind farms in recent years installing wind turbines in offshore wind farms far away from land can reduce the visual pollution and noise compared with those onshore or near land offshore ones bae et al 2011 water depth increases rapidly with the distance from the land while cost of the traditional gravity based or jacket type foundations grow sharply with water depth floating offshore wind turbines sørensen and shen 2002 are more cost effective choice for offshore wind farms with water depth exceeding 50m butterfield et al 2005 in june 2009 the first multi megawatt fowt in the world hywind demo equipped with a 2 3 mw wind turbine was installed at the west coast of norway and its power production has been quite promising skaare et al 2015 and the success of hywind demo has inspired the development on fowt the scottish government granted installation of a floating offshore wind farm with five 6 mw fowts in the north sea off the peterhead coast bbc 2015 liu et al 2017 where the water depth is over 100m however designing fowt system is a quite challenging task due to the complicated structure the complex environmental loading and the coupling effects luo et al 2012 compared with conventional onshore wind turbine or fixed bottom wind turbine working in shallow water a fowt suffers much more complicated environmental loads the aerodynamic forces on turbine rotor the hydrodynamic loads on floating support platform and the mooring forces etc furthermore the aerodynamic forces on turbine rotor transmitted to the floating support platform via the tower which affects the dynamic responses of the platform the mooring lines provide restoring forces on supporting platform to restrict the movement of the system and on the other round the motion of platform influences the aerodynamic performance of the turbine blades by changing the relative flow velocity experienced by turbine blades complex interaction between the components makes coupling prediction of fowt a quite challenging task experimental test as an indispensable tool for research plays an important role in study on fowt a couple of intermediate scale fowt models have been deployed on ocean coast viselli et al 2015 experiencing the offshore wind wave environment the intermediate scale experiments provide reliable reference data for further design of commercial scale devices however the high cost and the difficulties in operational control make intermediate scale experiment an inadvisable choice meanwhile a number of scaled down fowt with different designing concepts have been carried out in wave basin under various experimental conditions martin 2011 koo et al 2014 myhr anygaard 2014 sandner et al 2015 these scaled down experiments also show practical results and reference data for validation and designing of fowt but there still underlies a problem that the froude scaling law and the reynolds similarity law cannot be guaranteed at the same time to meet the requirement of predicting coupled aero hydrodynamic performances of a fowt system the numerical method stands out which is much more economical than experimental tests either in intermediate scale or scaled down models and without limitation of the scaling laws since onshore wind turbines have developed for decades there exist a couple of numerical tools for aerodynamic analysis the most commonly used numerical methods are the blade element momentum bem method glauert 1963 the vortex methods voutsinas et al 1995 the potential flow theory van bussel 1995 the actuator line model shen and sørensen 2002 the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods zhou and wan 2015 etc bem method is simple and very time saving during computing and most of the commercial numerical tools are developed based on bem method jonkman 2007 however the assumptions in this model and the dependency on 2d aerodynamic experimental data of airfoils exposed the limitation and the inaccuracy of bem model to gain the description of 3d flow information around turbine blades the vortex methods and potential flow theory are developed as is known to all these two methods are based on the inviscid flow assumption so the viscous effects are neglected which may result in significant inaccuracy besides the vortex method has a potential risk for stability while vortex elements getting close to each other hansen et al 2006 with rapid development of computational technology the cfd method is becoming popular in aerodynamics study cheng et al 2016 with direct calculation by solving navier stokes n s equations cfd simulations provide much more precise results including detailed flow information for in depth discuss on the physical mechanism on the other side the direct calculation method requires higher computing performance and takes much longer time using the actuator line model alm is an effective way to reduce computational cost by replacing the real blade structure with virtual actuator lines and guarantee considerable precision by solving the navier stokes equations in flow field troldborg et al 2007 however the aerodynamics analysis of fowts is significantly different from the conventional fixed wind turbines due to the additional motion caused by platform dynamic responses sebastian and lackner 2012 in some previous research works the unsteady aerodynamics of fowt blades is investigated by considering the typical motions of support platform tran tran and dong 2015 tran and kim 2016a has done a series of calculations on unsteady aerodynamic predictions of turbine blades by considering platform motion with periodic surge pitch or yaw using unsteady cfd methods with a dynamic moving grid technique besides the oscillating regularity of both aerodynamic thrust and power the flow interaction phenomena between the turbine blades with oscillating motions and the generated blade tip vortices were observed wu wu and nguyen 2017 has developed a cfd model for unsteady and non linear aerodynamic simulations of rotor under floating platform induced motions with arbitrary mesh interface ami recently fully coupled aero hydrodynamic simulations of fowts have been conducted under combined wind wave conditions and the coupling effects between the aerodynamics of wind turbine and the hydrodynamics of floating platform are studied the national renewable energy laboratory nrel developed a fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic tool named fast jonkman 2009 which is based on bem and potential flow theory to implement the coupled simulation of fowts however utility of fast is dependent on data inputting from an external potential flow based hydrodynamic solver such as wamit which restricts its usage for more accurate predictions as the viscous effect is ignored in potential flow theories there are other numerical tools for coupling simulation of fowt based on bem method such as hawc2 3dfloat bladed etc cordle 2010 as bem is an empirical method with various correction models such as glauert correction skewed wake correction etc sebastian sebastian and lackner 2013 indicated that the bem is still questionable in unsteady aerodynamic prediction for fowts therefore benefitting from the rapid development of high performance computing hpc technique the cfd method has shown great potential for accurate numerical simulation for fowt in recent years studies on fully coupled analysis of fowts have been conducted with cfd method tran conducted the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis of a semi submersible fowt using a dynamic fluid body interaction approach tran and kim 2016b liu liu et al 2017 established a fully coupled cfd analysis tool for fowts based on openfoam package and the coupling effect of the oc4 deepcwind semi submersible fowt was studied cfd simulations achieve accurate results and enable detailed quantitative analysis of flow field however a full structure cfd simulation is quite computational costly based on the open source platform openfoam our research team developed the cfd solver naoe foam sjtu to investigate hydrodynamic problems in the

utilized to implement the aerodynamic prediction of fowt the alm is an effective way to reduce computational cost by displacing the real blades surfaces with virtual actuator lines and not being required to solve the blade geometry layer the wind turbine blades are simplified into actuator lines withstanding body forces in alm which are divided into a series of discrete actuator points sørensen and shen 2002 in this study modifications are made to the initial alm so that it can be used to simulate the fowt this is accomplished by accounting for the influence of the platform motion on the blades when the alm is applied to the simulation of the fowts the velocity vector u m induced by the motions of the floating platform is added into the velocity triangle as shown in fig 1 which will lead to complex interactions between the rotor and its wake so the alm needs to be modified to solve the unsteady problem caused by the dynamic motion responses of floating platform the unsteady actuator line model considering the effect of six degree of freedom motions is used in this paper in order to determine the aerodynamic forces acting on rotor blades a blade element method combined with two dimensional 2d airfoil characteristics is used fig 1 shows a cross sectional element at radius r which defines the airfoil in the xoy plane the figure shows the integral velocity vectors

6 u rel u in u m i n 2 ω r u r o t u m r o t 2 the angle of attack α which determines the airfoil aerodynamic data is defined as 7 α ϕ θ t ϕ tan 1 u in u m i n ω r u r o t u m r o t where φis the inflow angle θ t is the local airfoil twist angle and the aerodynamic lift and drag forces can be given by the following equation 8 f l d ρ u r e l 2 c n b 2 r d θ d z c l e l c d e d where c is the chord length of the airfoil n b is the total number of blades c l and c d c l and c d are the lift and drag coefficient respectively e l and e d denote the unit vectors in the directions of the lift and the drag respectively the lift and drag coefficient are determined from measured or computed 2d airfoil data which are corrected with 3d effects the aerodynamic lift and drag forces are acting as body force in the flow field after smooth treatment to avoid singular behavior 9 f ε f η ε and 10 η ε d 1 ε 3 π 3 2 ⅇ d i ε 2 here d i is the distance between the measured point in flow field and the actuator points on the rotor ε is a constant width parameter to adjust the strength of regularization function and the parameter ε is suggested to be determined according to the length of grid near turbine blades or the chord length of airfoil sørensen et al 1998 and the body force added onto the right side of the momentum equations as a source term can be written as 11 f ε x y z t σ i 1 n f x i y i z i t 1 ε 3 π 3 2 ⅇ d i ε 2 then the ualm is programmed as a c class based on the openfoam 2 3 six degree of freedom 6dof motions the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic solver is established by combining the aerodynamic ualm module and the hydrodynamic code and the hydrodynamic solver employed in this paper is our in house code naoe foam sjtu shen et al 2012a naoe foam sjtu is developed based on the openfoam which is an open source tool package in this solver the two phase incompressible rans equations are solved which are discretized by the finite volume method fvm and the volume of fluid vof method is utilized to capture the free surface and the dynamic deformation mesh approach is employed to handle structure motions shen et al 2012b based on fundamental codes in openfoam several modules are developed a numerical tank system including the wave generation and damping module the six degree of freedom 6dof motion module and the mooring system module as validations hydrodynamic simulation of floating platform coupled with mooring system was conducted by cao using naoe foam sjtu cao et al 2013 and some verification was made in previous work zhao and wan 2015 which proved that naoe foam sjtu is a good choice to deal with this kind of problems with establishment of the 6dof motion module the naoe foam sjtu solver is able to predict the motion responses of floating structures two coordinate systems as shown in fig 2 are set up in the procedure of solving 6dof motion equations the body fixed coordinate system and the earth fixed coordinate system at each time step simulation the motion equations are solved in platform fixed coordinate system while the forces are calculated in earth fixed coordinate system therefore a transformation between the data in these two systems is essential the added velocity induced by the dynamic motions of the supporting platform is updated by the following equation 12 u m o t i o n i j u c ω c x i x c where j represents the transformation matrix defined from the body fixed coordinate to earth fixed coordinate u c and ω c donate the translational velocity and the angular velocity of the rotating center x c is the location the rotating center 2 4 volume of fluid vof method for capturing the free surface the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 with bounded compression technique rusche 2003 is applied in our solver the vof transport equation is defined as 13 α t u u g α u r 1 α α 0 where u is the velocity of flow field u g is the velocity of grid nodes and α is the volume fraction representing the relative proportion of fluid in each cell which is defined as 14 α 0 α 1 0 α 1 air water interface and the fluid density ρ and the dynamic viscosity μ can be described with the volume fraction as 15 ρ α ρ l 1 α ρ g 16 μ α μ l 1 α μ g where ρ l and μ l are the density and dynamic viscosity of the liquid water while ρ l and μ l are the density and dynamic viscosity of the gas air 2 5 wave generation and absorption module for hydrodynamic simulation of a floating platform the work of wave generation must be implemented in naoe foam sjtu solver the wave generation and absorption module is capable of generating various types of waves such as linear wave high order 2nd to 5th stokes waves irregular waves shen and wan 2016 focusing waves cao and wan 2014 etc the linear regular waves will be adopted in the following paper the surface elevation for the linear regular wave and the horizontal and vertical components of fluid velocity distribution are described as 17 η a cos k x ω t 18 u π h t cosh k

coordinate and d represents the water depth once the wave is generated and propagates from inlet towards outlet boundary reflection is non negligible which travels in an opposite direction and may interfere with the incident wave so that the wave damping module is developed larsen and dancy 1983 in the wave damping module sponge layer takes effect by adding an additional artificial viscous term as a source term on the right side of the momentum equation in rans the new term is expressed as 19 f s ρ μ s u where μ s is the artificial viscosity determined by the following equation 20 μ s x α s x x 0 l s 2 x x 0 0 x x 0 where α s is a dimensionless quantity defining damping strength for the sponge layer l s represents the length of sponge layer and x 0 is the start of the sponge layer see fig 3 2 6 mooring system modelling to simulate the interaction between the mooring lines and floating platform the code of mooring system module liu 2014 is developed here the piecewise extrapolating method pem which is a quasi static model is implemented to calculate the mooring forces in this method a mooring line is divided into a number of segments fan et al 2012 a typical example is shown in fig 4 equations of static equilibrium are established in both horizontal and vertical directions 21 t x i 1 t x i f i d s cos φ i 1 d i d s sin φ i 1 t z i 1 d i d s cos φ i 1 t z i f i d s sin φ i 1

plane dl and ds are the segment length before and after elongation respectively w i is net submerged weight of lines per unit length d and f denote normal and tangential components of drag force acting on the segment which are calculated by morison s equation and the subscript i represents the ith node lies on the ith segment 2 7 coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis model a fully coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis model fowt ualm sjtu for numerical simulation of floating wind turbine was established by combing the ualm and naoe foam sjtu the coupled dynamic responses of the fowts include the aerodynamics of wind turbine the hydrodynamics of floating platform and the performance of mooring system fig 5 shows the coupled analysis module of this coupled model where the aerodynamic simulations are conducted with the ualm and the 6dof motions and the mooring forces are predicted by the naoe foam sjtu as introduced above the body force on flow field smoothed from aerodynamic force obtained with ualm module are added as a source term f ε on the right side of the momentum equations in addition the effect of sponge layer is also considered as a source term f s so the momentum equation in rans is modified as 22 ρ u t ρ u u g u p d g x ρ μ e f f u u μ e f f f σ f s f ε where f σ is the surface tension term in two phases model and takes effect only on the liquid free surface the solving procedure of coupled aero hydrodynamic simulation for the fowts is shown in fig 6 the main program loop is based on naoe foam sjtu at the start of the simulation for each time step the aerodynamics hydrodynamics and the mooring systems are calculated simultaneously with corresponding modules since the mesh grid and fluid field information are updated according to the motions calculated in last time step then the volume forces calculated with the ualm module are transferred to the main program to solve the rans equations eqn 22 with piso loops for the whole fluid field where 2 6 piso loops are required to reach convergence of the fluid field simulation and when the 6dof motion equations are solved the turbine aerodynamic forces calculated with ualm module as well as the mooring forces simulated with the mooring module are transferred to the main program so the motion of fowt is calculated and the mesh deforming information is updated 3 validation for the numerical models 3 1 validation for aerodynamics with ualm module in our previous study with alm the validation against blind test 1 is conducted li 2016 fig 7 illustrates the thrust and power comparisons of the numerical results and the experimental ones both the numerical power and thrust show quite good agreement with the test data which confirms alm a powerful and reliable tool in aerodynamic simulation the ualm module is employed for the aerodynamic simulation of nrel 5mw baseline wind turbine detailed description can be found in the following section the aerodynamic forces and powers on the nrel 5mw wind turbine with various steady uniform wind speed are first obtained with alm model the results of power and thrust are compared with results obtained with previous results in fig 8 which shows quite good agreement with other results and certifies that the fowt ualm sjtu solver is reliable in basic aerodynamic simulation considering the wind turbine in the whole fowt system experiences 6dof motion the unsteady aerodynamic simulation for turbine rotor experiencing periodic surge motion is also conducted for validation of ualm module the surge motion is determined with a sinusoidal function s 8sin 0 246t where the amplitude and the circular frequency of oscillating surge motion are 8m and 0 246 respectively the periodic surge motion causes the variation of the relative wind speed nearby the turbine blades and brings about the oscillation of the aerodynamic forces on turbine the aerodynamic thrust and power are compared with those calculated with overset grid technique tran and kim 2016a and the curves in fig 9 show good agreement in both thrust and power of the wind turbine the range between the maximum and the minimum of both the aerodynamic power and thrust resulted from ualm are a little smaller than that from simulations using full structured cfd method with overset grid technique but the difference is no more than 7 it is also well proved that the fowt ualm sjtu solver is a reliable solver for both unsteady aerodynamic calculations 3 2 validation for wave generation and absorption module the 3d numerical wave tank including wave generation and absorbing is employed the wave properties used for validation and the following coupled simulation in the present work are listed in table 1 the simulation domain is set as a rectangular region with longitude range of 150m 300m which is about three times of the wave length a range of 150m 150m in landscape direction and the distance from bottom to the initial water surface is 100m to guarantee the linear wave condition requirement to validate the wave generation and absorbing four wave gauges are set along wave propagating direction in the numerical wave tank x 50m 0m 100m 279m to monitor wave elevation at different position the numerical results are compared with the theoretical data the first three pictures in fig 10 show the comparison results of wave elevation at the position of the three wave gauges and the fourth shows result at the end of the damping area the figures indicate that the numerical simulation results agree quite well with the theoretical solutions in the last figure the wave height has been significantly reduced over 90 with the sponge layer effect in which case the wave reflection effect is neglected therefore the wave generation and absorbing module for naoe foam sjtu solver utilized in this paper is accurate and reliable 3 3 validation for naoe foam sjtu with hydrodynamic response of platform in regular wave the hydrodynamic response of the semi submersible floating platform is also investigated under a regular heading wave condition as introduced above three main degrees of freedoms of the floating platform with the most significant responses in heading wave conditions surge heave and pitch are analyzed fig 11 shows the response amplitude operators raos for surge pitch and heave motions of the floating platform the numerical results of this present work are compared with the experimental data and numerical results with fast coulling et al 2013 and other cfd solvers liu et al 2017 tran and kim 2016b to get the raos of the platform motions the motion amplitudes of surge pitch and heave are normalized by the amplitude of the regular wave 3 79m fig 11 shows that the hydrodynamic prediction of the platform motion in this regular heading wave condition agrees quite well with the experimental data as well as the numerical results using other simulation solvers 3 4 validation for naoe foam sjtu solver with free decay motion of the platform free decay test is an efficient way to predict the natural frequency of a floating structure which is one of the main hydrodynamic coefficients since the surging pitching heaving motion responses are more significant than others in heading waves the free decay motion analysis of the oc4 deepcwind semi submersible floating platform utilized in the present study is performed for each of the three dofs surge heave pitch using naoe foam sjtu solver the platform model and simulation domain are shown in fig 12 while detailed structural parameters are described in the following section free decay tests are carried out in calm water without wind wave current herein the platform is initially perturbed with a prescribed displacement and released to move freely as oscillating back to the equilibrium position the perturbed displacements in the numerical simulation are determined with experimental data table 2 presents the natural periods for these three dofs compared with experimental and numerical results the natural period obtained in the present simulations show good agreement with those from other numerical tools with potential flow panel method or cfd method and matches quite well with the experimental results by marin coulling et al 2013 fig 13 illustrates the dynamic responses of free decay surge and pitch motions the dynamic motion results are compared with the previous studies tran and kim 2015 luan et al 2013 krogstad and lund 2012 in both cfd method and potential flow method the present cfd approach black solid curve is capable to consider the viscous effect of floating platform which shows improved hydrodynamic damping of cfd results than those potential based approach 4 description of geometry model 4 1 phase ii of oc4 floating offshore wind turbine system in the present simulation work a semi submersible floating offshore wind turbine fowt system phase ii of oc4 project robertson et al 2012 is adopted the offshore code comparison collaboration continuation oc4 project which was formed in 2010 under the international energy agency wind task 30 is a project to verify the accuracy of the simulation tools and codes for offshore wind turbines robertson et al 2013 the fowt contains several main parts a wind turbine the nrel 5mw baseline wind turbine a tower supporting the turbine a supporting floating platform the semi submersible platform on which the tower is mounted and the mooring system to restrict the motion of platform fig 14 shows the sketch of this fowt system 4 2 nrel 5mw baseline wind turbine the wind turbine in phase ii of oc4 fowt system is nrel 5mw baseline line wind turbine which is a conventional three bladed upwind variable speed and blade pitch to feather controlled wind turbine this 5 mw wind turbine is a large scaled turbine with blade length of 63m and the center of rotor is 90m above the still water level swl the specification of the prototype is listed in table 3 jonkman et al 2009 4 3 the semi submersible platform as shown in fig 15 the semi submersible floating system consists of a main column attached to the tower three offset columns covering significant portion of buoyancy a couple of smaller diameter pontoons and cross braces to link the main column and offset columns and to strengthen the structure detailed properties are listed in table 4 4 4 mooring system the semi submersible floating system for phase ⅱ of oc4 is moored with three catenary lines spread symmetrically about the platform center robertson et al 2012 fig 16 shows the arrangement of the mooring system table 5 lists the mooring system properties used in this paper 4 5 determination of the rotating center the phase ii of oc4 floating wind turbine system is shown in fig 14 besides the floating support platform the fowt system also contains the wind turbine and the tower above the supporting system so the wind turbine and the tower should be counted when analyzing the mass distribution and the inertia of the whole system the mass distribution and the structural of the whole system are listed in table 6 and table 7 4 6 simulation domain and grid structure the entire hexahedral simulation domain is set as 750 x 320 y 400 z as shown in fig 17 in fig 17 the parameter λ represents for the wave length which changes in the cases so the length of simulation domain is not set exactly according to the wave length the distance between the inlet boundary and the center the floating offshore wind turbine system is 200m and a sponge layer region with 180m length is set for wave absorption near the outlet boundary here the water depth is set as 200m and the distance between the bottom of computational domain and the initial still water surface is 10m where d is the water depth and the height of domain above the water surface is set as 4d 260m where d is the diameter of rotating turbine the right figure shows the grid structure on a cross section the refine region around the platform and the wake flow area with second order refinement is illustrated in the right figure in fig 17 as alm is an efficiency model with simplified actuator model instead of the real blades structure in the aerodynamic simulation much higher level refinement along the blades surface layer is saved thus the total number of grid cells in this simulation is about 3 5m both simulations are running in parallel with 40 processors and time consumption for each time step with 6 inner piso loops is about 20s 5 results and discussions 5 1 aerodynamics of nrel 5mw wind turbine the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic numerical simulations of the phase ii of oc4 semi submersible fowt are conducted with two different regular incoming waves under same inflow wind condition as listed in table 8 the inflow wind speed for both fully coupled simulations are set as the rated wind speed 11 4 m s while regular incoming waves with different wave period and wave height are adopted in case 1 the wave period is 9 7s and the wave height which is two times of the wave amplitude is 3 66m while the wave period and wave height in case 2 are 12 1s and 7 58m respectively aerodynamic forces and power of the fowt are recorded during simulation and time history of aerodynamic thrust and power are plotted in fig 18 different from the conventional steady aerodynamic simulations for centre fixed wind turbines both aerodynamic thrust and power of fowt show significantly unsteady characteristics with the coupling interaction between aerodynamic loads on turbine and the hydrodynamic responses of floating platform the time history of thrust curves of case 1 and case 2 both fluctuate periodically while the periods of differs from each other due to the computational start up fluctuation the quasi static periodic results are achieved since t 200s and curves in fig 18 are drawn with data in time range of 340s 356s which covers fluctuation periods of both cases the fluctuation periods of both thrust and power in case 1 are about 9 7s which is the same with the wave period adopted in case 1 similarly the fluctuation period of aerodynamic loads in case 2 are about 12 1s same with the wave period in case 2 wave does not act on the turbine blades directly but on the floating platform which causes periodic hydrodynamic motion responses of the platform here in the present work the platform wind turbine and tower are all regarded as rigid bodies amounted on the floating platform through rigid tower the wind turbine gains an additional motion from the platform s hydrodynamic response compared with the thrust and power data obtained from steady aerodynamic simulations conducted in the above validation section the averaged value of both thrust and power of fowt are decreased the difference between the averaged values of case 1 and case 2 is negligible but the oscillating amplitude of both thrust and power in case 2 is significantly larger than that in case 1 thus a preliminary conclusion indicates that the growth of incoming wave amplitude causes the increase of fluctuation amplitude but has tiny influence on the averaged value of the turbine aerodynamic loads 5 2 hydrodynamic responses of the semi submersible platform as is well known an incoming regular wave induces periodic motion responses of the structures floating on the free surface cheng and wan 2015 where the first order wave force causes the periodic motion around the initial position with the same period as incoming wave while the higher order hydrodynamic wave load drives the structure towards the wave marching direction with restriction of mooring system the floating structure will finally oscillates around an equilibrium position after a period of evolution a fowt naturally is a moored floating structure with additional wind turbine so the basic oscillating regulation is observed in the hydrodynamic motions recorded during fully coupled simulation and the motions time history of three main dofs in heading waves surge heave and pitch are plotted in fig 19 the impact of wind turbine on platform is equivalent to external dynamic forces transformed through tower since the tower is ignored in the structure model the force approximates to the aerodynamic forces by integrating the aerodynamic forces on actuator points along turbine blades and the moments is determined as cross product of the aerodynamic forces and the moment arm vector pointing from turbine rotating centre to the fowt rotating centre previous studies cheng and wan 2015 indicated that the distance from equilibrium position of hydrodynamic oscillating motion to the initial centre is no more than 0 5m with same wave condition as case 1 while the equilibrium position for coupled system in case 1 is about 14 2m as shown as surge motion in fig 19 a which is significantly increased with the aerodynamic impacts of the wind turbine with growth of wave amplitude and wave length the averaged surge motion is increased from case 1 to case 2 the averaged surge motion is driven by two main factors high order drift forces with incoming wave and the external forces from the wind turbine as discussed above the aerodynamic forces of wind turbine in case 1 and case 2 have similar averaged value so it can be demonstrated preliminarily that the increase of averaged surge motion from case 1 to case 2 is mainly resulted from the growth of drift forces on the other hand the oscillating amplitudes of the motions are quite similar to that from previous calculation cheng and wan 2015 however as larger amplitude wave in case 2 causes stronger oscillating forces which induces greater periodic motion the increase of oscillating amplitude is observed for all three dofs in fig 19 5 3 coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis as discussed above the oscillating motion of floating platform has significant influence on the aerodynamic loading of the wind turbine and the aerodynamic forces also strongly affects the hydrodynamic responses of supporting platform eqn 8 illustrates that the determining factor for the aerodynamic loads is the relative velocity near the actuator points which has taken the platform motion into account when rotor blade moves towards inflow wind marching direction the relative velocity of air flow is lower compared to the fixed rotating centre condition on the contrary the relative velocity increases as the wind turbine moving to the reverse note that the platform motion component which makes a difference in the rotor blades motion is not only the surging motion but also pitching motion comparing fig 19 a with fig 19 c the platform surging motion has an opposite variation law with pitching motion namely when the platform surge motion drives the rotor blade towards the ox direction the blade motion caused by the platform pitching motion points to the ox direction there is another notable phenomenon the aerodynamic forces of case 1 and case 2 meet the maximum value at the same time about t 342 2s in fig 18 but both surge and pitch in these two cases change on the opposite way at t 342 2s this is comprehensible by combining the surging effect and the pitching effect on the blades motion in case 1 the oscillating amplitude of surge is 0 7m while the oscillating amplitude of pitch is about 0 8deg multiplying pith angle with the distance between blade points to the rotational centre of whole fowt system 100m the amplitude of equilibrium motion induced by platform pitching motion is up to 1 4m so the pitching motion plays the leading role in affecting the relative flow velocity at turbine blade the platform motion speed is determined with the time derivative of surge displacement or pitch angle and it s clear to see that pitching motion meets the minus maximum speed around t 342 2s therefore the relative flow speed achieve the maximum value and so does the aerodynamic loads the same principle applies to case 2 with surge oscillating amplitude 2 3m and pitch oscillating amplitude 1 05deg in which case the surging motion acts as the leading factor thus case 2 meets the maximum aerodynamic forces when platform surging with the minus maximum surging speed the aerodynamic forces also cause significant increase of averaged surge and pitch motion on hydrodynamic responses of floating platform and the fluctuation of aerodynamic forces also influences the oscillating amplitude of surge and pitch nevertheless the aerodynamic forces and moments transmitted to floating platform are negligibly small compared with the hydrodynamic loads with the coupling interaction the wake flow is also disturbed the evolution of wake vortex structure of case 1 is illustrated during a representative period in fig 20 the wake vortex of the rotor is visualized with the iso surface of the second order invariant of velocity gradient q digraskar 2010 and the wave free surface is contoured by surface elevation three clear and stable spiral vortexes are generated at the tip of the blades then march downstream with positive speeds of air flow with additional motions transmitted from platform the rotor blades moves into and out of its wake flow which results the differences of the distance between two neighbour vortex tubes and this additional motion also disturbs the wake flow and results in the quick dissipation of vortexes 6 conclusions the actuator line model alm is introduced into openfoam for aerodynamic simulation of wind turbine to take the platform motion into consideration in the aerodynamic simulation of wind turbine the unsteady actuator line model ualm is established by implementing the ualm as an aerodynamic simulation module into our in house cfd code naoe foam sjtu the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic model fowt ualm sjtu is developed for the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis of fowts since the complex blades structures are simplified as actuator line model and only structured background grids are requested for aerodynamic simulations this numerical model is quite time saving comparing with other conventional cfd tools besides by solving the n s equations in the entire flow filed this simulation model provides more detailed and more accurate flow information over traditional bem and potential flow theory proper fundamental validations for the fowt ualm sjtu solver are carried out which shows good capability and reliability on both aerodynamic prediction of wind turbine and the hydrodynamic calculation of floating platform then fully coupled aero hydrodynamic simulation of phase ii of oc4 semi submersible fowt is conducted with this coupled model compared with aerodynamic loads in fixed centre simulations both aerodynamic thrust and power decrease in fully coupled fowt system from the coupled aero hydrodynamic simulation results oscillating regularity on aerodynamic loads of wind turbine is observed with the same oscillating period as the incoming wave with growth of the wave amplitude the fluctuation amplitude of aerodynamic loads increases obviously but wave condition has tiny influence on the averaged value of the turbine aerodynamic loads the fluctuation of aerodynamic load results from the oscillation of platform motions and meets the maximum value when the blade actuator points moves with the maximum speed in the opposite direction with inflow wind both surging and pitching motions play important roles in the influence on the relative flow velocity and the maximum of aerodynamic loads are achieved when the leading motion reaches the minus maximum speed with effect of turbine aerodynamics as an external load on the supporting platform the platform motion shows significant increase on the averaged value while the influence of turbine loads on the fluctuation of platform is negligible nevertheless the wave amplitude affects the fluctuation amplitude of platform a lot besides the oscillating motion of the fowt disturbs the flow wake of turbine and speeds up the dissipation of wake vortex the coupling interactions between the turbine aerodynamics and the platform hydrodynamics is much more complicated and more research work need to be done for further study on the complex coupled floating offshore wind turbine system in the preliminary stage the model studies herein limited in steady wind and regular wave conditions with rigid blade structures where the flexibility of the structures the pitch control effect as well as the tower blades interaction are omitted thus in our near future work the numerical model will be improved to take these practical factors this numerical model shows great potential in aero hydrodynamic simulations of floating offshore wind turbines

model coupled aero hydrodynamics fowt ualm sjtu solver naoe foam sjtu solver floating offshore wind turbine 1 introduction excessive exploitation of conventional fossil fuels has intensified the energy crisis and environmental pollution problem which makes it an immediate issue to find clean and renewable energy resource to replace the traditional energy as one of the most promising non polluting renewable energy sources wind energy has shown great potential and attracted the global attention exploitation of wind energy has experienced rapid growth since last few decades according to the statistics the global reserves of wind energy is up to 2 74 109mw and 2 107mw are utilizable zhang et al 2010 which is about 10 times of the available water energy the offshore wind resource has lots of particular advantages over onshore wind energy for instance the average speed of offshore wind is about 90 larger than that of onshore one archer and jacobson 2005 wind turbines as wind energy harvesting devices has developed from onshore to offshore wind farms in recent years installing wind turbines in offshore wind farms far away from land can reduce the visual pollution and noise compared with those onshore or near land offshore ones bae et al 2011 water depth increases rapidly with the distance from the land while cost of the traditional gravity based or jacket type foundations grow sharply with water depth floating offshore wind turbines sørensen and shen 2002 are more cost effective choice for offshore wind farms with water depth exceeding 50m butterfield et al 2005 in june 2009 the first multi megawatt fowt in the world hywind demo equipped with a 2 3 mw wind turbine was installed at the west coast of norway and its power production has been quite promising skaare et al 2015 and the success of hywind demo has inspired the development on fowt the scottish government granted installation of a floating offshore wind farm with five 6 mw fowts in the north sea off the peterhead coast bbc 2015 liu et al 2017 where the water depth is over 100m however designing fowt system is a quite challenging task due to the complicated structure the complex environmental loading and the coupling effects luo et al 2012 compared with conventional onshore wind turbine or fixed bottom wind turbine working in shallow water a fowt suffers much more complicated environmental loads the aerodynamic forces on turbine rotor the hydrodynamic loads on floating support platform and the mooring forces etc furthermore the aerodynamic forces on turbine rotor transmitted to the floating support platform via the tower which affects the dynamic responses of the platform the mooring lines provide restoring forces on supporting platform to restrict the movement of the system and on the other round the motion of platform influences the aerodynamic performance of the turbine blades by changing the relative flow velocity experienced by turbine blades complex interaction between the components makes coupling prediction of fowt a quite challenging task experimental test as an indispensable tool for research plays an important role in study on fowt a couple of intermediate scale fowt models have been deployed on ocean coast viselli et al 2015 experiencing the offshore wind wave environment the intermediate scale experiments provide reliable reference data for further design of commercial scale devices however the high cost and the difficulties in operational control make intermediate scale experiment an inadvisable choice meanwhile a number of scaled down fowt with different designing concepts have been carried out in wave basin under various experimental conditions martin 2011 koo et al 2014 myhr anygaard 2014 sandner et al 2015 these scaled down experiments also show practical results and reference data for validation and designing of fowt but there still underlies a problem that the froude scaling law and the reynolds similarity law cannot be guaranteed at the same time to meet the requirement of predicting coupled aero hydrodynamic performances of a fowt system the numerical method stands out which is much more economical than experimental tests either in intermediate scale or scaled down models and without limitation of the scaling laws since onshore wind turbines have developed for decades there exist a couple of numerical tools for aerodynamic analysis the most commonly used numerical methods are the blade element momentum bem method glauert 1963 the vortex methods voutsinas et al 1995 the potential flow theory van bussel 1995 the actuator line model shen and sørensen 2002 the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods zhou and wan 2015 etc bem method is simple and very time saving during computing and most of the commercial numerical tools are developed based on bem method jonkman 2007 however the assumptions in this model and the dependency on 2d aerodynamic experimental data of airfoils exposed the limitation and the inaccuracy of bem model to gain the description of 3d flow information around turbine blades the vortex methods and potential flow theory are developed as is known to all these two methods are based on the inviscid flow assumption so the viscous effects are neglected which may result in significant inaccuracy besides the vortex method has a potential risk for stability while vortex elements getting close to each other hansen et al 2006 with rapid development of computational technology the cfd method is becoming popular in aerodynamics study cheng et al 2016 with direct calculation by solving navier stokes n s equations cfd simulations provide much more precise results including detailed flow information for in depth discuss on the physical mechanism on the other side the direct calculation method requires higher computing performance and takes much longer time using the actuator line model alm is an effective way to reduce computational cost by replacing the real blade structure with virtual actuator lines and guarantee considerable precision by solving the navier stokes equations in flow field troldborg et al 2007 however the aerodynamics analysis of fowts is significantly different from the conventional fixed wind turbines due to the additional motion caused by platform dynamic responses sebastian and lackner 2012 in some previous research works the unsteady aerodynamics of fowt blades is investigated by considering the typical motions of support platform tran tran and dong 2015 tran and kim 2016a has done a series of calculations on unsteady aerodynamic predictions of turbine blades by considering platform motion with periodic surge pitch or yaw using unsteady cfd methods with a dynamic moving grid technique besides the oscillating regularity of both aerodynamic thrust and power the flow interaction phenomena between the turbine blades with oscillating motions and the generated blade tip vortices were observed wu wu and nguyen 2017 has developed a cfd model for unsteady and non linear aerodynamic simulations of rotor under floating platform induced motions with arbitrary mesh interface ami recently fully coupled aero hydrodynamic simulations of fowts have been conducted under combined wind wave conditions and the coupling effects between the aerodynamics of wind turbine and the hydrodynamics of floating platform are studied the national renewable energy laboratory nrel developed a fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic tool named fast jonkman 2009 which is based on bem and potential flow theory to implement the coupled simulation of fowts however utility of fast is dependent on data inputting from an external potential flow based hydrodynamic solver such as wamit which restricts its usage for more accurate predictions as the viscous effect is ignored in potential flow theories there are other numerical tools for coupling simulation of fowt based on bem method such as hawc2 3dfloat bladed etc cordle 2010 as bem is an empirical method with various correction models such as glauert correction skewed wake correction etc sebastian sebastian and lackner 2013 indicated that the bem is still questionable in unsteady aerodynamic prediction for fowts therefore benefitting from the rapid development of high performance computing hpc technique the cfd method has shown great potential for accurate numerical simulation for fowt in recent years studies on fully coupled analysis of fowts have been conducted with cfd method tran conducted the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis of a semi submersible fowt using a dynamic fluid body interaction approach tran and kim 2016b liu liu et al 2017 established a fully coupled cfd analysis tool for fowts based on openfoam package and the coupling effect of the oc4 deepcwind semi submersible fowt was studied cfd simulations achieve accurate results and enable detailed quantitative analysis of flow field however a full structure cfd simulation is quite computational costly based on the open source platform openfoam our research team developed the cfd solver naoe foam sjtu to investigate hydrodynamic problems in the field of ship and ocean engineering and the unsteady actuator line model ualm li et al 2015 was introduced into openfoam for aerodynamic simulation of wind turbine by combining these two solvers the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic model for simulation of a floating offshore wind turbine is established by using the solver the validation of unsteady aerodynamic loads was conducted compared to different numerical methods moreover the coupled aero hydrodynamic simulation for a fowt was also completed compared to the simplified method karimirad and moan 2012 in the present study the coupled aero hydrodynamic responses of phase ii of oc4 which is a semisubmersible supported wind turbine system are investigated the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations coupled with the k ω sst turbulence model are solved the pressure implicit with splitting of operations algorithm piso is employed to solve the pressure velocity coupling equations the effect of turbine aerodynamics on floating platform response is investigated with proper comparison between the fully coupled simulation of fowt system and the hydrodynamic results of pure platform similarly the influence of platform hydrodynamics on turbine dynamics is examined by comparing the fully coupled simulation of fowt system and the aerodynamic results of pure wind turbine in addition the impact of incoming wave condition on the system performance is analyzed by varying the wave conditions in this paper the numerical model utilized in this present work is introduced firstly validations for both aerodynamic and hydrodynamic models are conducted and presented in the following part and the descriptions of the physical model employed in the present study the phase ii of oc4 floating offshore wind turbine system are shown simulation results and discussions are interpreted and finally proper conclusions are stated 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations in the fully coupled numerical simulation model for fowt system the three dimensional 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for transient incompressible and viscous newtonian fluid are solved which contain the

are not closed as they contain more variables than equations in order to meet the closure requirement and solve rans equations the two equation turbulence model k ω sst menter 1994 is employed where the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent dissipation rate ω can be described as 3 ρ k t ρ u k γ k k g k y k s k 4 ρ ω t ρ u ω γ ω ω g ω y ω d ω s ω where г k and г ω are the effective diffusion coefficients for the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent dissipation rate ω respectively g k and g ω are turbulence generation terms for k and ω y k and y ω are turbulent dissipation terms for k and ω s k and s ω are the source terms for k and ω d ω is the cross diffusion terms for ω 2 2 unsteady actuator line model in this present study the actuator line model alm is utilized to implement the aerodynamic prediction of fowt the alm is an effective way to reduce computational cost by displacing the real blades surfaces with virtual actuator lines and not being required to solve the blade geometry layer the wind turbine blades are simplified into actuator lines withstanding body forces in alm which are divided into a series of discrete actuator points sørensen and shen 2002 in this study modifications are made to the initial alm so that it can be used to simulate the fowt this is accomplished by accounting for the influence of the platform motion on the blades when the alm is applied to the simulation of the fowts the velocity vector u m induced by the motions of the floating platform is added into the velocity triangle as shown in fig 1 which will lead to complex interactions between the rotor and its wake so the alm needs to be modified to solve the unsteady problem caused by the dynamic motion responses of floating platform the unsteady actuator line model considering the effect of six degree of freedom motions is used in this paper in order to determine the aerodynamic forces acting on rotor blades a blade element method combined with two dimensional 2d airfoil characteristics is used fig 1 shows a cross sectional element at radius r which defines the airfoil in the xoy plane the figure shows the integral velocity vectors relationship described as 5 u r e l u i n ω r u r o t u m where u in represents the inflow velocity vector u rot is the flow velocity induced by the rotating blade ω r is the speed of airfoil causes by the blades rotation u m is the additional airfoil velocity vector induced by the motions of the floating platform and the magnitude of the local velocity relative to the rotating blade is given as 6 u rel u in u m i n 2 ω r u r o t u m r o t 2 the angle of attack α which determines the airfoil aerodynamic data is defined as 7 α ϕ θ t ϕ tan 1 u in u m i n ω r u r o t u m r o t where φis the inflow angle θ t is the local airfoil twist angle and the aerodynamic lift and drag forces can be given by the following equation 8 f l d ρ u r e l 2 c n b 2 r d θ d z c l e l c d e d where c is the chord length of the airfoil n b is the total number of blades c l and c d c l and c d are the lift and drag coefficient respectively e l and e d denote the unit vectors in the directions of the lift and the drag respectively the lift and drag coefficient are determined from measured or computed 2d airfoil data which are corrected with 3d effects the aerodynamic lift and drag forces are acting as body force in the flow field after smooth treatment to avoid singular behavior 9 f ε f η ε and 10 η ε d 1 ε 3 π 3 2 ⅇ d i ε 2 here d i is the distance between the measured point in flow field and the actuator points on the rotor ε is a constant width parameter to adjust the strength of regularization function and the parameter ε is suggested to be determined according to the length of grid near turbine blades or the chord length of airfoil sørensen et al 1998 and the body force added onto the right side of the momentum equations as a source term can be written as 11 f ε x y z t σ i 1 n f x i y i z i t 1 ε 3 π 3 2 ⅇ d i ε 2 then the ualm is programmed as a c class based on the openfoam 2 3 six degree of freedom 6dof motions the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic solver is established by combining the aerodynamic ualm module and the hydrodynamic code and the hydrodynamic solver employed in this paper is our in house code naoe foam sjtu shen et al 2012a naoe foam sjtu is developed based on the openfoam which is an open source tool package in this solver the two phase incompressible rans equations are solved which are discretized by the finite volume method fvm and the volume of fluid vof method is utilized to capture the free surface and the dynamic deformation mesh approach is employed to handle structure motions shen et al 2012b based on fundamental codes in openfoam several modules are developed a numerical tank system including the wave generation and damping module the six degree of freedom 6dof motion module and the mooring system module as validations hydrodynamic simulation of floating platform coupled with mooring system was conducted by cao using naoe foam sjtu cao et al 2013 and some verification was made in previous work zhao and wan 2015 which proved that naoe foam sjtu is a good choice to deal with this kind of problems with establishment of the 6dof motion module the naoe foam sjtu solver is able to predict the motion responses of floating structures two coordinate systems as shown in fig 2 are set up in the procedure of solving 6dof motion equations the body fixed coordinate system and the earth fixed coordinate system at each time step simulation the motion equations are solved in platform fixed coordinate system while the forces are calculated in earth fixed coordinate system therefore a transformation between the data in these two systems is essential the added velocity induced by the dynamic motions of the supporting platform is updated by the following equation 12 u m o t i o n i j u c ω c x i x c where j represents the transformation matrix defined from the body fixed coordinate to earth fixed coordinate u c and ω c donate the translational velocity and the angular velocity of the rotating center x c is the location the rotating center 2 4 volume of fluid vof method for capturing the free surface the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 with bounded compression technique rusche 2003 is applied in our solver the vof transport equation is defined as 13 α t u u g α u r 1 α α 0 where u is the velocity of flow field u g is the velocity of grid nodes and α is the volume fraction representing the relative proportion of fluid in each cell which is defined as 14 α 0 α 1 0 α 1 air water interface and the fluid density ρ and the dynamic viscosity μ can be described with the volume fraction as 15 ρ α ρ l 1 α ρ g 16 μ α μ l 1 α μ g where ρ l and μ l are the density and dynamic viscosity of the liquid water while ρ l and μ l are the density and dynamic viscosity of the gas air 2 5 wave generation and absorption module for hydrodynamic simulation of a floating platform the work of wave generation must be implemented in naoe foam sjtu solver the wave generation and absorption module is capable of generating various types of waves such as linear wave high order 2nd to 5th stokes waves irregular waves shen and wan 2016 focusing waves cao and wan 2014 etc the linear regular waves will be adopted in the following paper the surface elevation for the linear regular wave and the horizontal and vertical components of fluid velocity distribution are described as 17 η a cos k x ω t 18 u π h t cosh k z d sinh k d cos k x ω t w π h t sinh k z d sinh k d sin k x ω t where a and h 2a denote the wave amplitude and wave height k and ω are wave number and wave circular frequency z is the vertical coordinate and d represents the water depth once the wave is generated and propagates from inlet towards outlet boundary reflection is non negligible which travels in an opposite direction and may interfere with the incident wave so that the wave damping module is developed larsen and dancy 1983 in the wave damping module sponge layer takes effect by adding an additional artificial viscous term as a source term on the right side of the momentum equation in rans the new term is expressed as 19 f s ρ μ s u where μ s is the artificial viscosity determined by the following equation 20 μ s x α s x x 0 l s 2 x x 0 0 x x 0 where α s is a dimensionless quantity defining damping strength for the sponge layer l s represents the length of sponge layer and x 0 is the start of the sponge layer see fig 3 2 6 mooring system modelling to simulate the interaction between the mooring lines and floating platform the code of mooring system module liu 2014 is developed here the piecewise extrapolating method pem which is a quasi static model is implemented to calculate the mooring forces in this method a mooring line is divided into a number of segments fan et al 2012 a typical example is shown in fig 4 equations of static equilibrium are established in both horizontal and vertical directions 21 t x i 1 t x i f i d s cos φ i 1 d i d s sin φ i 1 t z i 1 d i d s cos φ i 1 t z i f i d s sin φ i 1 w i d l where t x and t z represent horizontal and vertical components of total mooring line tension at a cross section of one segment φ is the angle between total tension force vector and horizontal plane dl and ds are the segment length before and after elongation respectively w i is net submerged weight of lines per unit length d and f denote normal and tangential components of drag force acting on the segment which are calculated by morison s equation and the subscript i represents the ith node lies on the ith segment 2 7 coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis model a fully coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis model fowt ualm sjtu for numerical simulation of floating wind turbine was established by combing the ualm and naoe foam sjtu the coupled dynamic responses of the fowts include the aerodynamics of wind turbine the hydrodynamics of floating platform and the performance of mooring system fig 5 shows the coupled analysis module of this coupled model where the aerodynamic simulations are conducted with the ualm and the 6dof motions and the mooring forces are predicted by the naoe foam sjtu as introduced above the body force on flow field smoothed from aerodynamic force obtained with ualm module are added as a source term f ε on the right side of the momentum equations in addition the effect of sponge layer is also considered as a source term f s so the momentum equation in rans is modified as 22 ρ u t ρ u u g u p d g x ρ μ e f f u u μ e f f f σ f s f ε where f σ is the surface tension term in two phases model and takes effect only on the liquid free surface the solving procedure of coupled aero hydrodynamic simulation for the fowts is shown in fig 6 the main program loop is based on naoe foam sjtu at the start of the simulation for each time step the aerodynamics hydrodynamics and the mooring systems are calculated simultaneously with corresponding modules since the mesh grid and fluid field information are updated according to the motions calculated in last time step then the volume forces calculated with the ualm module are transferred to the main program to solve the rans equations eqn 22 with piso loops for the whole fluid field where 2 6 piso loops are required to reach convergence of the fluid field simulation and when the 6dof motion equations are solved the turbine aerodynamic forces calculated with ualm module as well as the mooring forces simulated with the mooring module are transferred to the main program so the motion of fowt is calculated and the mesh deforming information is updated 3 validation for the numerical models 3 1 validation for aerodynamics with ualm module in our previous study with alm the validation against blind test 1 is conducted li 2016 fig 7 illustrates the thrust and power comparisons of the numerical results and the experimental ones both the numerical power and thrust show quite good agreement with the test data which confirms alm a powerful and reliable tool in aerodynamic simulation the ualm module is employed for the aerodynamic simulation of nrel 5mw baseline wind turbine detailed description can be found in the following section the aerodynamic forces and powers on the nrel 5mw wind turbine with various steady uniform wind speed are first obtained with alm model the results of power and thrust are compared with results obtained with previous results in fig 8 which shows quite good agreement with other results and certifies that the fowt ualm sjtu solver is reliable in basic aerodynamic simulation considering the wind turbine in the whole fowt system experiences 6dof motion the unsteady aerodynamic simulation for turbine rotor experiencing periodic surge motion is also conducted for validation of ualm module the surge motion is determined with a sinusoidal function s 8sin 0 246t where the amplitude and the circular frequency of oscillating surge motion are 8m and 0 246 respectively the periodic surge motion causes the variation of the relative wind speed nearby the turbine blades and brings about the oscillation of the aerodynamic forces on turbine the aerodynamic thrust and power are compared with those calculated with overset grid technique tran and kim 2016a and the curves in fig 9 show good agreement in both thrust and power of the wind turbine the range between the maximum and the minimum of both the aerodynamic power and thrust resulted from ualm are a little smaller than that from simulations using full structured cfd method with overset grid technique but the difference is no more than 7 it is also well proved that the fowt ualm sjtu solver is a reliable solver for both unsteady aerodynamic calculations 3 2 validation for wave generation and absorption module the 3d numerical wave tank including wave generation and absorbing is employed the wave properties used for validation and the following coupled simulation in the present work are listed in table 1 the simulation domain is set as a rectangular region with longitude range of 150m 300m which is about three times of the wave length a range of 150m 150m in landscape direction and the distance from bottom to the initial water surface is 100m to guarantee the linear wave condition requirement to validate the wave generation and absorbing four wave gauges are set along wave propagating direction in the numerical wave tank x 50m 0m 100m 279m to monitor wave elevation at different position the numerical results are compared with the theoretical data the first three pictures in fig 10 show the comparison results of wave elevation at the position of the three wave gauges and the fourth shows result at the end of the damping area the figures indicate that the numerical simulation results agree quite well with the theoretical solutions in the last figure the wave height has been significantly reduced over 90 with the sponge layer effect in which case the wave reflection effect is neglected therefore the wave generation and absorbing module for naoe foam sjtu solver utilized in this paper is accurate and reliable 3 3 validation for naoe foam sjtu with hydrodynamic response of platform in regular wave the hydrodynamic response of the semi submersible floating platform is also investigated under a regular heading wave condition as introduced above three main degrees of freedoms of the floating platform with the most significant responses in heading wave conditions surge heave and pitch are analyzed fig 11 shows the response amplitude operators raos for surge pitch and heave motions of the floating platform the numerical results of this present work are compared with the experimental data and numerical results with fast coulling et al 2013 and other cfd solvers liu et al 2017 tran and kim 2016b to get the raos of the platform motions the motion amplitudes of surge pitch and heave are normalized by the amplitude of the regular wave 3 79m fig 11 shows that the hydrodynamic prediction of the platform motion in this regular heading wave condition agrees quite well with the experimental data as well as the numerical results using other simulation solvers 3 4 validation for naoe foam sjtu solver with free decay motion of the platform free decay test is an efficient way to predict the natural frequency of a floating structure which is one of the main hydrodynamic coefficients since the surging pitching heaving motion responses are more significant than others in heading waves the free decay motion analysis of the oc4 deepcwind semi submersible floating platform utilized in the present study is performed for each of the three dofs surge heave pitch using naoe foam sjtu solver the platform model and simulation domain are shown in fig 12 while detailed structural parameters are described in the following section free decay tests are carried out in calm water without wind wave current herein the platform is initially perturbed with a prescribed displacement and released to move freely as oscillating back to the equilibrium position the perturbed displacements in the numerical simulation are determined with experimental data table 2 presents the natural periods for these three dofs compared with experimental and numerical results the natural period obtained in the present simulations show good agreement with those from other numerical tools with potential flow panel method or cfd method and matches quite well with the experimental results by marin coulling et al 2013 fig 13 illustrates the dynamic responses of free decay surge and pitch motions the dynamic motion results are compared with the previous studies tran and kim 2015 luan et al 2013 krogstad and lund 2012 in both cfd method and potential flow method the present cfd approach black solid curve is capable to consider the viscous effect of floating platform which shows improved hydrodynamic damping of cfd results than those potential based approach 4 description of geometry model 4 1 phase ii of oc4 floating offshore wind turbine system in the present simulation work a semi submersible floating offshore wind turbine fowt system phase ii of oc4 project robertson et al 2012 is adopted the offshore code comparison collaboration continuation oc4 project which was formed in 2010 under the international energy agency wind task 30 is a project to verify the accuracy of the simulation tools and codes for offshore wind turbines robertson et al 2013 the fowt contains several main parts a wind turbine the nrel 5mw baseline wind turbine a tower supporting the turbine a supporting floating platform the semi submersible platform on which the tower is mounted and the mooring system to restrict the motion of platform fig 14 shows the sketch of this fowt system 4 2 nrel 5mw baseline wind turbine the wind turbine in phase ii of oc4 fowt system is nrel 5mw baseline line wind turbine which is a conventional three bladed upwind variable speed and blade pitch to feather controlled wind turbine this 5 mw wind turbine is a large scaled turbine with blade length of 63m and the center of rotor is 90m above the still water level swl the specification of the prototype is listed in table 3 jonkman et al 2009 4 3 the semi submersible platform as shown in fig 15 the semi submersible floating system consists of a main column attached to the tower three offset columns covering significant portion of buoyancy a couple of smaller diameter pontoons and cross braces to link the main column and offset columns and to strengthen the structure detailed properties are listed in table 4 4 4 mooring system the semi submersible floating system for phase ⅱ of oc4 is moored with three catenary lines spread symmetrically about the platform center robertson et al 2012 fig 16 shows the arrangement of the mooring system table 5 lists the mooring system properties used in this paper 4 5 determination of the rotating center the phase ii of oc4 floating wind turbine system is shown in fig 14 besides the floating support platform the fowt system also contains the wind turbine and the tower above the supporting system so the wind turbine and the tower should be counted when analyzing the mass distribution and the inertia of the whole system the mass distribution and the structural of the whole system are listed in table 6 and table 7 4 6 simulation domain and grid structure the entire hexahedral simulation domain is set as 750 x 320 y 400 z as shown in fig 17 in fig 17 the parameter λ represents for the wave length which changes in the cases so the length of simulation domain is not set exactly according to the wave length the distance between the inlet boundary and the center the floating offshore wind turbine system is 200m and a sponge layer region with 180m length is set for wave absorption near the outlet boundary here the water depth is set as 200m and the distance between the bottom of computational domain and the initial still water surface is 10m where d is the water depth and the height of domain above the water surface is set as 4d 260m where d is the diameter of rotating turbine the right figure shows the grid structure on a cross section the refine region around the platform and the wake flow area with second order refinement is illustrated in the right figure in fig 17 as alm is an efficiency model with simplified actuator model instead of the real blades structure in the aerodynamic simulation much higher level refinement along the blades surface layer is saved thus the total number of grid cells in this simulation is about 3 5m both simulations are running in parallel with 40 processors and time consumption for each time step with 6 inner piso loops is about 20s 5 results and discussions 5 1 aerodynamics of nrel 5mw wind turbine the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic numerical simulations of the phase ii of oc4 semi submersible fowt are conducted with two different regular incoming waves under same inflow wind condition as listed in table 8 the inflow wind speed for both fully coupled simulations are set as the rated wind speed 11 4 m s while regular incoming waves with different wave period and wave height are adopted in case 1 the wave period is 9 7s and the wave height which is two times of the wave amplitude is 3 66m while the wave period and wave height in case 2 are 12 1s and 7 58m respectively aerodynamic forces and power of the fowt are recorded during simulation and time history of aerodynamic thrust and power are plotted in fig 18 different from the conventional steady aerodynamic simulations for centre fixed wind turbines both aerodynamic thrust and power of fowt show significantly unsteady characteristics with the coupling interaction between aerodynamic loads on turbine and the hydrodynamic responses of floating platform the time history of thrust curves of case 1 and case 2 both fluctuate periodically while the periods of differs from each other due to the computational start up fluctuation the quasi static periodic results are achieved since t 200s and curves in fig 18 are drawn with data in time range of 340s 356s which covers fluctuation periods of both cases the fluctuation periods of both thrust and power in case 1 are about 9 7s which is the same with the wave period adopted in case 1 similarly the fluctuation period of aerodynamic loads in case 2 are about 12 1s same with the wave period in case 2 wave does not act on the turbine blades directly but on the floating platform which causes periodic hydrodynamic motion responses of the platform here in the present work the platform wind turbine and tower are all regarded as rigid bodies amounted on the floating platform through rigid tower the wind turbine gains an additional motion from the platform s hydrodynamic response compared with the thrust and power data obtained from steady aerodynamic simulations conducted in the above validation section the averaged value of both thrust and power of fowt are decreased the difference between the averaged values of case 1 and case 2 is negligible but the oscillating amplitude of both thrust and power in case 2 is significantly larger than that in case 1 thus a preliminary conclusion indicates that the growth of incoming wave amplitude causes the increase of fluctuation amplitude but has tiny influence on the averaged value of the turbine aerodynamic loads 5 2 hydrodynamic responses of the semi submersible platform as is well known an incoming regular wave induces periodic motion responses of the structures floating on the free surface cheng and wan 2015 where the first order wave force causes the periodic motion around the initial position with the same period as incoming wave while the higher order hydrodynamic wave load drives the structure towards the wave marching direction with restriction of mooring system the floating structure will finally oscillates around an equilibrium position after a period of evolution a fowt naturally is a moored floating structure with additional wind turbine so the basic oscillating regulation is observed in the hydrodynamic motions recorded during fully coupled simulation and the motions time history of three main dofs in heading waves surge heave and pitch are plotted in fig 19 the impact of wind turbine on platform is equivalent to external dynamic forces transformed through tower since the tower is ignored in the structure model the force approximates to the aerodynamic forces by integrating the aerodynamic forces on actuator points along turbine blades and the moments is determined as cross product of the aerodynamic forces and the moment arm vector pointing from turbine rotating centre to the fowt rotating centre previous studies cheng and wan 2015 indicated that the distance from equilibrium position of hydrodynamic oscillating motion to the initial centre is no more than 0 5m with same wave condition as case 1 while the equilibrium position for coupled system in case 1 is about 14 2m as shown as surge motion in fig 19 a which is significantly increased with the aerodynamic impacts of the wind turbine with growth of wave amplitude and wave length the averaged surge motion is increased from case 1 to case 2 the averaged surge motion is driven by two main factors high order drift forces with incoming wave and the external forces from the wind turbine as discussed above the aerodynamic forces of wind turbine in case 1 and case 2 have similar averaged value so it can be demonstrated preliminarily that the increase of averaged surge motion from case 1 to case 2 is mainly resulted from the growth of drift forces on the other hand the oscillating amplitudes of the motions are quite similar to that from previous calculation cheng and wan 2015 however as larger amplitude wave in case 2 causes stronger oscillating forces which induces greater periodic motion the increase of oscillating amplitude is observed for all three dofs in fig 19 5 3 coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis as discussed above the oscillating motion of floating platform has significant influence on the aerodynamic loading of the wind turbine and the aerodynamic forces also strongly affects the hydrodynamic responses of supporting platform eqn 8 illustrates that the determining factor for the aerodynamic loads is the relative velocity near the actuator points which has taken the platform motion into account when rotor blade moves towards inflow wind marching direction the relative velocity of air flow is lower compared to the fixed rotating centre condition on the contrary the relative velocity increases as the wind turbine moving to the reverse note that the platform motion component which makes a difference in the rotor blades motion is not only the surging motion but also pitching motion comparing fig 19 a with fig 19 c the platform surging motion has an opposite variation law with pitching motion namely when the platform surge motion drives the rotor blade towards the ox direction the blade motion caused by the platform pitching motion points to the ox direction there is another notable phenomenon the aerodynamic forces of case 1 and case 2 meet the maximum value at the same time about t 342 2s in fig 18 but both surge and pitch in these two cases change on the opposite way at t 342 2s this is comprehensible by combining the surging effect and the pitching effect on the blades motion in case 1 the oscillating amplitude of surge is 0 7m while the oscillating amplitude of pitch is about 0 8deg multiplying pith angle with the distance between blade points to the rotational centre of whole fowt system 100m the amplitude of equilibrium motion induced by platform pitching motion is up to 1 4m so the pitching motion plays the leading role in affecting the relative flow velocity at turbine blade the platform motion speed is determined with the time derivative of surge displacement or pitch angle and it s clear to see that pitching motion meets the minus maximum speed around t 342 2s therefore the relative flow speed achieve the maximum value and so does the aerodynamic loads the same principle applies to case 2 with surge oscillating amplitude 2 3m and pitch oscillating amplitude 1 05deg in which case the surging motion acts as the leading factor thus case 2 meets the maximum aerodynamic forces when platform surging with the minus maximum surging speed the aerodynamic forces also cause significant increase of averaged surge and pitch motion on hydrodynamic responses of floating platform and the fluctuation of aerodynamic forces also influences the oscillating amplitude of surge and pitch nevertheless the aerodynamic forces and moments transmitted to floating platform are negligibly small compared with the hydrodynamic loads with the coupling interaction the wake flow is also disturbed the evolution of wake vortex structure of case 1 is illustrated during a representative period in fig 20 the wake vortex of the rotor is visualized with the iso surface of the second order invariant of velocity gradient q digraskar 2010 and the wave free surface is contoured by surface elevation three clear and stable spiral vortexes are generated at the tip of the blades then march downstream with positive speeds of air flow with additional motions transmitted from platform the rotor blades moves into and out of its wake flow which results the differences of the distance between two neighbour vortex tubes and this additional motion also disturbs the wake flow and results in the quick dissipation of vortexes 6 conclusions the actuator line model alm is introduced into openfoam for aerodynamic simulation of wind turbine to take the platform motion into consideration in the aerodynamic simulation of wind turbine the unsteady actuator line model ualm is established by implementing the ualm as an aerodynamic simulation module into our in house cfd code naoe foam sjtu the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic model fowt ualm sjtu is developed for the fully coupled aero hydrodynamic analysis of fowts since the complex blades structures are simplified as actuator line model and only structured background grids are requested for aerodynamic simulations this numerical model is quite time saving comparing with other conventional cfd tools besides by solving the n s equations in the entire flow filed this simulation model provides more detailed and more accurate flow information over traditional bem and potential flow theory proper fundamental validations for the fowt ualm sjtu solver are carried out which shows good capability and reliability on both aerodynamic prediction of wind turbine and the hydrodynamic calculation of floating platform then fully coupled aero hydrodynamic simulation of phase ii of oc4 semi submersible fowt is conducted with this coupled model compared with aerodynamic loads in fixed centre simulations both aerodynamic thrust and power decrease in fully coupled fowt system from the coupled aero hydrodynamic simulation results oscillating regularity on aerodynamic loads of wind turbine is observed with the same oscillating period as the incoming wave with growth of the wave amplitude the fluctuation amplitude of aerodynamic loads increases obviously but wave condition has tiny influence on the averaged value of the turbine aerodynamic loads the fluctuation of aerodynamic load results from the oscillation of platform motions and meets the maximum value when the blade actuator points moves with the maximum speed in the opposite direction with inflow wind both surging and pitching motions play important roles in the influence on the relative flow velocity and the maximum of aerodynamic loads are achieved when the leading motion reaches the minus maximum speed with effect of turbine aerodynamics as an external load on the supporting platform the platform motion shows significant increase on the averaged value while the influence of turbine loads on the fluctuation of platform is negligible nevertheless the wave amplitude affects the fluctuation amplitude of platform a lot besides the oscillating motion of the fowt disturbs the flow wake of turbine and speeds up the dissipation of wake vortex the coupling interactions between the turbine aerodynamics and the platform hydrodynamics is much more complicated and more research work need to be done for further study on the complex coupled floating offshore wind turbine system in the preliminary stage the model studies herein limited in steady wind and regular wave conditions with rigid blade structures where the flexibility of the structures the pitch control effect as well as the tower blades interaction are omitted thus in our near future work the numerical model will be improved to take these practical factors this numerical model shows great potential in aero hydrodynamic simulations of floating offshore wind turbines

22987,in this paper the particle method for handling oscillation of floating body using variable particle spacing is reported heave oscillation of floating mono hull and twin hull on the free surface in a viscous fluid is performed using improved meshless local petrov galerkin method based on rankine source function imlpg r the imlpg r method is a particle based method that will solve the interaction between fluid and floating body using navier stokes equation the pressure at each time step is estimated from pressure poisson equation in order to incorporate the heaving of the floating bodies some improvements like free surface identification gradient calculations has been introduced in the present paper to handle the variable resolutions in modelling simulations are performed for different frequency and amplitude of oscillations for mono and twin hull forced motions to show the robustness of the developed model to handle both small and steep oscillations 1 introduction wave loads on floating structures may set them into motion which will affect safety and operations of the structures so the main application of computational hydrodynamics in ocean engineering is to predict the response of floating bodies under wave loading such analysis is important for the design and development of floating structures such as ships offshore platforms barges etc many researchers are focused on estimating hydrodynamic force experienced by floating structures under waves to judge the response of floating structures the hydrodynamics related to oscillation of floating structures on the free surface of a viscous fluid is a significant topic for study because of the complexity involved in solving equations of motion of floating body and fluid particle movement simultaneously in computational fluid dynamics two different numerical models are commonly using for solving floating body dynamics one is fully nonlinear potential flow theory fnpt models and another one is navier stokes model ns the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel is a quite popular method to solve the fnpt models kashiwagi 2000 and koo and kim 2004 extended mel method to study the 2d nonlinear interaction between waves and floating body a higher order bem has been developed by zhou et al 2015 to simulate the nonlinear interaction between waves and 3d fixed and floating bodies using potential flow theory wu and hu 2004 extended fem for simulating nonlinear wave interaction with the 3d floating body based on fnpt model with hybrid mesh generation fully nonlinear steep wave interaction with the 2d floating body is studied by yan and ma 2007 using the quasi arbitrary lagrangian eulerian finite element method qale fem based on fnpt although the fnpt models are giving better results the main disadvantage of fnpt model is that these models are not suitable for modelling wave breaking and turbulence as it is not considering viscosity fnpt models needs special treatment to handle the large amplitude oscillation of floating body but the advantage is it needs only course resolutions when compared to ns model on the other hand ns model has been used to overcome the difficulties faced in the fnpt yeung and ananthakrishnan 1992 1997 yeung et al 1998 and ananthakrishnan 1999 2012 2015 had numerically simulated various free surface flow problems associated with oscillation of floating bodies in the free surface of calm water using finite difference method fdm green water impact on fixed and moving bodies are investigated by yamasaki et al 2005 using fdm with marker and cell mac algorithm and overlapping grid system hadžić et al 2005 used finite volume method fvm with moving mesh technique for computing response of a floating body under waves wave structure interaction of a stationary floating body under regular and irregular waves are simulated by li and lin 2012 using fvm based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations free roll motion of floating body under regular wave is performed by jung et al 2013 using volume of fluid method based fvm constrained interpolation profile cip based cartesian grid method for studying green water loading on the deck of an advancing ship in waves is simulated by hu et al 2006 free sway motions of 2d floating body and water on deck phenomena are investigated by hu and kashiwagi 2009 they solved ns model using cip based cartesian grid method in their work water on deck phenomena is also simulated all the above discussed ns models are mesh based models even though the results produced by mesh based ns models are impressive the mesh based methods require good quality meshes and need to be managed depending on the formulation in order to obtain the promising result the mesh should be updated frequently or to be refined to capture the motion of the free surface and need to be maintained this is a time consuming task and costly especially in the cases with breaking waves recently developed mesh free method can overcome the problems associated with the mesh based method it considers fluid domain as randomly distributed nodes rather than discretizing the computational space into grids to construct appropriate solutions since there is no interconnectivity between nodes in the mesh free method the issues related to mesh orientations generally faced in finite elements and element connectivity are disappearing automatically so the drawback of the mesh based method does not exist many meshless or particle methods have been reported in the literature such as diffusion element method nayroles et al 1992 element free galerkin method belytschko et al 1994 smooth particle hydrodynamics monaghan 1994 reproducing kernel particle method liu et al 1996 moving particle semi implicit method koshizuka and oka 1996 and so on among them smooth particle hydrodynamics sph and moving particle semi implicit method mps have been commonly used for water wave problems doring et al 2004 bouscasse et al 2013 and ren et al 2015 are adopted sph method for simulating wave floating structure interaction problems omidvar et al 2013 improved the efficiency of sph method by using the variable particle mass technique for modelling 3d floating body motion mps method for studying the interaction between waves and floating bodies have been developed by sueyoshi 2004 and zhang et al 2015 meshless local petrov galerkin mlpg has been introduced by atluri and zhu 1998 mlpg method is a meshfree method in which partial differential equations are solving by using local weak form and moving least square mls method is used for local approximation of unknown variables lin and atluri 2001 applied this method for solving navier stokes equations ma 2005a tested mlpg method for simulating nonlinear water waves in his work he adopted the simple heaviside step function as the test function to formulate the weak form over local sub domains which results in the final formulations in terms of the pressure gradient ma 2005b altered mlpg method into a new form called mlpg r method in the mlpg r method instead of heaviside step function rankine source solution is used as the test function this new test function increases the accuracy of the pressure estimation by producing a weak form of governing equations which did not have the gradients of unknown variables either in terms of velocity or pressure gradient further matrix inversion used in the mls method for interpolation of variables is a time taking process so ma 2008 again modified the mlpg method using a new scheme called simplified finite difference interpolation sfdi which do not need the inverse of matrix sriram and ma 2012 used improved mlpg r method imlpg r for simulating violent wave interaction with elastic structures rijas and sriram 2017 extended the improved mlpg r method for simulating heave oscillation of floating body with uniformly distributed particles actually in fluid structure interaction problems very fine particle distribution is required only near the structure and free surface far field does not require fine resolution of particles so the uniform particle distribution will increase the number of particles and hence the computation time in order to improve the efficiency of the mlpg r method the present work uses variable particle distribution in this approach very fine particle spacing is applied near the structure and coarse particle distribution is used away from the body this is the first paper that reports mlpg method with variable particle spacing this paper is organized in the following order firstly the mathematical procedure for solving governing equations using the mlpg r method solid wall boundary treatment and free surface identification technique is presented next the convergence test and validation for vertical oscillation of monohull are described finally the method is applied for heave oscillation of twin hull under different frequency and amplitude the robustness of the developed method for handling different frequencies of oscillations from helmotz piston motion to sloshing mode partial standing phenomenon in the twin hull was reported 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions in the present work the fluid domain is represented by using a 2d fixed cartesian coordinate system the fluid flow is governed by the mass and momentum conservation equations 1 u 0 2 d u dt 1 ρ p g υ 2 u where u is the fluid velocity vector p is the fluid pressure ρ is the fluid density υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and g is the gravitational acceleration the kinematic and dynamic free surface conditions are expressed as 3 d r dt u 4 p 0 where r is the position vector the solid boundary inclusive of floating body surface should satisfy the following conditions 5 u n u n 6 n p ρ n g n u υ n 2 u where u and u are the velocity and acceleration vector of the solid boundary and n is the unit normal vector to the solid boundary 2 2 numerical procedure the above equations are solved by using the mesh free method with fractional time step algorithm introduced by chorin 1968 this method starts with an assumption that position velocity and pressure of fluid particles at nth time step is known and the physical quantities at n 1 th time step are updated by solving the governing equations as given below 1 at the beginning of a new time step the intermediate velocity u 0 and position d u dt 1 ρ p g υ 2 u of fluid particles are estimated explicitly as shown 7 u u n g dt υ 2 u n δ t 8 r r n u δ t where superscript n denotes nth time step and δt is the increment of the time step 2 next the pressure pn 1 is calculated implicitly from the following pressure poisson s equation ma and zhou 2009 9 2 p n 1 α ρ n 1 ρ δ t 2 1 α ρ δ t u where α is an artificial coefficient between 0 and 1 and ρ n 1 and ρ are density at n 1 th time step and intermediate time step the value of α is taken as zero by sriram and ma 2012 for their imlpg r method 3 after getting pn 1 the position and velocity of fluid particles at n 1 th time step can be calculated by numerical integration as shown 10 u n 1 u δ t ρ p n 1 11 r n 1 r u n 1 δ t 2 3 imlpg r formulation in the algorithm described above the key task is to solve the pressure poison equation and can be solved by any numerical method in this paper imlpg r method is applied for α 0 eq 9 can be written as 12 2 p n 1 ρ δ t u the imlpg r method discretizes the computational domain into randomly distributed particles or nodes a few nodes are situated in the boundaries and others are located inside the fluid domain each node has a circular sub domain having radius r and area ω with its centre located at the node itself in order to produce the weak form of eq 12 it is multiplying with an arbitrary test function φ and integrating over the circular subdomain of each node so for each node i the local formulation is given as 13 ω i 2 p ρ δ t u φ dω 0 the test function used in the imlpg r method is the solution of rankine source i e φ 1 2 π ln r r i ma 2005b where r is the distance of concerned particle inside the sub domain from the center of sub domain i e from node i numerical calculation of gradient of unknown pressure and derivative of intermediate velocity in eq 13 is a time consuming task so in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the results a zero term p 2 φ is added to eq 13 and gauss theorem is applied leading to the final form as 14 s i n p φ ds p ω i ρ δ t u φ dω similarly to avoid the calculation of 2 u on solid boundary in eq 6 it is modified to a new form by combining with eq 5 and eq 10 so eq 6 becomes 15 n p n 1 ρ δ t n u u n 1 in eq 14 the pressure on the left hand side is interpolated by using mls method and integration on the right hand side is performed by the semi analytical method a detailed discussion about discretization of eq 14 are given in ma and zhou 2009 and the same is not repeating here only final equations are given below k ij p b i where p x j 1 n φ j x p ˆ j k i j s i φ j x n φ d s φ j x i for inner nodes n φ j x i for solid boundary nodes and b i ω i ρ δ t u φ d ω for inner nodes ρ δ t n u u n 1 for solid boundary nodes where n is the number of particles that affect the pressure at the point x i p j ˆ are the nodal variables and φ j x is the shape function which is formulated by mls method ma 2005a the movement of the nodes will be based on minimum pressure gradient as detailed in sriram and ma 2012 2 4 pressure gradient calculation after estimating the pressure on all nodes velocity calculation of fluid particles eq 10 requires the gradient of pressure the pressure gradient is evaluated by using sfdi scheme ma 2008 the pressure gradient calculation near the boundaries may not be accurate because the fluid particles are distributed only one side of the boundary this was not a major issue for wave fixed structure interactions however for floating bodies numerical issues were observed so ghost particles set of imaginary particles are considered on another side of the boundary to compensate the deficiency of fluid particles during calculation of pressure gradient near the floating body the pressure on ghost particles is estimated by using the fixed ghost particle technique described by bouscasse et al 2013 in this method each ghost particle is associated with an interpolation point inside the fluid domain the position vector r of the interpolation point is determined by mirroring the position of ghost particle r s into the fluid domain the pressure on each interpolation point p is obtained by interpolating pressure on the fluid particles in the sub domain surrounding the interpolation point then ghost particle pressure p s is evaluated by using 16 p s p p n r r s where 17 p n ρ g n d u dt n υ 2 u n eq 17 is obtained from eq 2 once the pressure gradient is obtained the velocity and position of fluid particles are updated by using eqs 10 and 11 it should be noted the ghost particles are considering only during the estimation of pressure gradient and are not considering during pressure calculation in eq 14 2 5 free surface identification technique the fluid particles in the solution domain can be grouped into free surface particles and inner particles in the wave floating structure interaction problems the fluid particles initially on the free surface may submerge into the inner domain and fluid particles in the inner domain may rise on to the free surface because of the displacement of the structure so it is necessary to identify the free surface particles in each time step during the simulations free surface identification is most challenging in meshfree methods particularly in true mesh free methods like mlpg r method which do not use global background mesh in mps isph monaghan 1994 koshizuka and oka 1996 koshizuka et al 1998 method particle number density is commonly used to identify the free surface the numerical tests proved that this method is not robust as it incorrectly identified particles as free surface if large particle displacement is there so ma and zhou 2009 used particle number density in the first step and auxiliary function method to reconfirm whether the identified particle is free surface or not however this method requires the simulation to start with an initial uniform spacing due to the use of particle number density so in order to extend for non uniform or variable spacing we have used the free surface identification technique proposed by barecasco et al 2013 this method is based on the position vector of fluid particles only and is independent of formulation used it assumes each particle in the domain is surrounded by a circle sphere for the 3d problem of radius r if the distance between two particles is less than r the circle of one particle will overlap a portion of the circle of another particle the circle of a particle under considerations is completely overlapped by circles of surrounding particles then it can be considered as inner particles and incompletely covered particles can be considered as boundary particles the procedure for identifying free surface is available in barecasco et al 2013 however during the tests we faced many difficulties while simulating breaking waves and very steep waves leading to wrong identification of free surface so to overcome the issue we have used the auxiliary function method discussed in the paper ma and zhou 2009 to recheck the identification thus the first method simply identifies the particles which have chances to become free surface and second method will reconfirm it these two step approach overcome the difficulties of using particle number density commonly used in mps isph koshizuka et al 1998 which needs uniform distribution 2 6 variable particle distribution in fluid structure interaction problem very fine particle distribution is required near the structure in order to capture the flow characteristics accurately the fluid domain far from the structure does not require high resolution of particles uniform distribution of particles with very high resolution will increase total number of particles hence it increases the computation time so in order to improve the efficiency of the imlpg r method the present work introduced variable particle distribution which uses very fine particle distribution near the structure and coarse particle distribution in far field as shown in fig 1 in this figure let δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 and δ x 4 is the initial particle spacing in zone 1 zone 2 zone 3 and zone 4 respectively the spacing between particles is gradually increasing while going from inner fine spaced zone zone 1 to outer coarse spaced zone zone 4 if moving from very finely spaced zone1 to zone 2 the particle spacing for the interface node is δ x 2 for zone 2 to zone 3 the spacing is x 3 and so on further in order to handle the variable particle spacing the radius of the support domain for the particle under considerations will be changed to 18 r i r i r j 2 where j is the neighbouring particle under considerations further the movement of the particles from coarser to finer domain or vice versa are taken care for each time step the radius of support domain of each particle is recalculating with respect to the surrounding particles so the entry and exit of particles inside a support domain are considered 3 results and discussion 3 1 problem description forced heave oscillation of monohull as well as twin hull on the free surface of a viscous fluid in a 2d numerical wave tank having mean water depth h with an amplitude of a and frequency σ is considered a monohull is a rectangular floating body having base width l and draft d twin hull consist of two rectangular bodies separated by a distance g as illustrated in fig 2 at the mean position of oscillation the centroid of the body is at the free surface the heave displacement is positive in upward direction and negative in downward direction all the parameters discussed in this paper are non dimensionalized with respect to body width l the acceleration due to gravity g and the density of fluid ρ the important non dimensional parameters are given below draft d d l water depth h h l the separation distance between the hulls g g l the amplitude of oscillation a a l the frequency of oscillation σ σ l g fluid velocity u u g l fluid pressure p p ρ g l heave force f f ρ g l 2 the heave velocity of the body is u c a σ cos σ t where u c is the velocity of the centre of gravity of the heaving body and t is the time 3 2 spatial and temporal convergence in order to obtain an optimum particle spacing and time step size forced heave oscillation of monohull on the free surface of the viscous fluid is performed for the amplitude of a 0 025 and σ 1 5 in a numerical wave tank the tank length depends on the frequency of oscillation which decides the wavelength the tank length is adjusted in such a way that the primary radiated wave should not reach the open boundary during the total simulation time the size of the monohull considered is l 1 and d 0 5 simulations are performed for different particle spacing initial spacing near the structure varying from l 8 to l 20 and time step size varying from t 100 to t 400 in all simulations the particle spacing away from the structure gradually increases and in the far field spacing is kept as l 4 to act as a damping zone at the ends a typical variation of the spacing is shown in fig 3 fig 4 compare the snapshots of wave profile obtained at t 4 t for different particle spacing x near to the structure with the time step size t t 200 the wave profile obtained with spacing x l 16 is found to be very similar to the monohull with spacing x l 20 similarly the wave profile generated at t 4 t for different t with x l 16 are compared in fig 5 this figure clearly indicates that the wave profile obtained for time step size t 200 and t 400 have good agreement in addition time histories of free surface elevation at a distance 2 5l from the mono hull for different particle spacing and time step size are compared in fig 6 fig 7 the analytical results are also shown providing better comparisons the above figure shows that δ x l 16 with t t 200 is good enough further the time history of heave hydrodynamic force acting on the monohull for different particle spacing x when the time step size t t 200 is shown in fig 8 the heave force acting on the body has been calculated by integrating hydrodynamic pressure acting on the surface of the body when compared to the convergence level in the free surface profile the convergence for force time history is not good enough this is due to the numerical integrations of many points particularly the small difference near the free surface the same level of lower accuracy is also found in the other mesh based codes anantha krishnan 2015 so figs 4 8 clearly shows that δ x l 16 and t t 200 are the optimum particle spacing and time step size respectively for the present test cases 3 3 influence of variable particle distributions in order to investigate the length of the variable particle distributions and its influence in the wave profile and force time histories the following test case has been carried out in the following study the variable spaced particle distribution approach is validated by comparing with uniformly spaced particle distribution the particle spacing and time step size used for this test is x l 16 and t t 200 respectively in the present investigations as shown in fig 3 upto l from the hull resolution is δ t and varied to l 14 and l 12 for every l afterwards it is l 10 the time histories of free surface elevation obtained with uniformly spaced particle distribution and variable spaced particle distribution are compared in fig 9 the figure compares the wave elevation at 2 l x l 14 3 l x l 12 4 l x l 10 and 5 l x l 10 distance from the monohull the free surface elevation at 2 l and 3 l distance from the monohull with variable particle spacing are matching very well with the result of uniform particle spacing but there is a difference in wave elevation at 4 l and 5 l distance from the monohull this can be explained with the help of fig 10 which compares the time histories of free surface profile obtained at 5 l with variable particle distribution to uniform particle distribution with x l 16 and x l 10 the amplitude of free surface with x l 10 is small when compared to x l 16 and almost same in comparison with variable particle distribution with phase shift due to damping from the convergence study done in the previous section x l 16 is obtained as the minimum particle spacing required to capture the wave elevation properly when x greater than δ t there will be some damping of wave height resulting from less number of particles per wave length hence in variable particle distribution when the wave reaches the area where particle spacing is large the wave height decreases this issue will not come if the wave length is large in this test case the wave length is small because of high frequency of oscillation and a good test case to investigate the comparison of time histories of heave hydrodynamic force for uniform particle distribution and variable particle distribution are shown in fig 11 showing good agreement thus in the present problem the wave profile obtained in far field does not have any importance however in order to capture the wave profile exactly we have kept the length of first zone having spacing x l 16 as 5 l for all of frequency oscillation problems reported in this paper from the above investigations and varied afterwards table 1 shows the computational time obtained for the above studies using variable and uniform spacing it clearly shows the variable particle distribution reduces the computational time drastically of the order of 41 for the above problem the computations are carried out in intel core i7 with 32 gb ram in serial mode further in order to check the accuracy of proposed algorithm for pressure calculation heave oscillation of mono hull on the free surface of a viscous fluid is performed and the pressure near the body is compared with theoretical result two points first point b at the middle of the hull bottom and second point f at a distance y vertically below the point b are considered for the test let p b is the pressure at the point b and p f is the pressure at the point f the difference between pressures at these two points can be obtained from eq 2 p b p f ρ δ y g a b where a b is the acceleration of the point b and y x the comparison of pressure difference obtained by imlpg r method and theory is shown in fig 12 it is found that the numerical results achieves better matching with theoretical result 3 4 mono hull effect of frequencies and amplitudes further simulations are performed for different frequencies of σ 0 75 1 1 5 and different amplitudes of a 0 025 0 05 with optimum particle spacing to validate the model the amplitude of heave hydrodynamic force computed in the present numerical work is compared with the experimental value and the numerical value from finite difference method ananthakrishnan 2015 in table 2 the experimentally determined added mass and damping coefficient values given in vugts 1968 are used for calculating hydrodynamic force the table shows good agreement of results between present method and literature the snapshot of pressure field and velocity field respectively at different instants of time for the heave oscillation of monohull on the free surface of viscous fluid at a frequency of σ 1 5 and amplitude of a 0 05 is shown in fig 13 fig 14 at t 3 t the centroid of the body is at its mean position of oscillation and velocity of the body is in downward direction in downward movement of the body the high fluid pressure below the bottom wall of the body produces a fluid flow from the bottom of the body to free surface similarly the no slip boundary condition on the lateral walls of the body will produce a fluid flow along the lateral movement of the wall hence during the downward movement of the body it will produce a downflow along the side walls of the body fig 14 clearly displays the fluid flow due to increase in pressure at the bottom side of the body and fluid flow due to viscous effect at lateral sides of the body t 3 t the interaction between these two flows will produce a clockwise vortex on the left side of the body and counter clockwise vortex on the right side of the body the magnitude of velocity of oscillation is maximum at the mean position and minimum at its extreme positions so the vortex strength will be maximum at the mean position and decreases with downward motion of the body and radiates away from the body as it reaches the extreme bottom point of oscillation t 3 25 t also the fluid pressure decreases in downward direction and becomes minimum at t 3 25 t at this point velocity changes its sign and starts to move in upward direction so the pressure increases with velocity in upward direction the low pressure below the bottom wall of the body causes a fluid flow from free surface to the bottom wall of the hull also an upward flow will occur near lateral walls of the body due to viscous effect of fluid see fig 14 at t 3 5 t hence the direction of vortices on both sides of the body changes and starts to grow in upward motion until the centroid of the hull reaches mean position t 3 5 t the vortex strength decays continuously after the mean position with velocity of oscillation and changes its direction at the topmost point of oscillation t 3 75 t at this position fluid pressure reaches maximum velocity changes its direction and starts to oscillate in downward direction and the process continues all these phenomena of variation of pressure and velocity in downward motion and upward motion and fluid flow are clearly displayed in figs 13 and 14 in order to study the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation on wave characteristics and heave force simulations are performed for different frequencies σ 0 75 1 5 and amplitudes a 0 01 0 1 of oscillation the time histories of heave hydrodynamic force for σ 1 5 with a 0 01 and a 0 1 are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively and the corresponding wave profiles at time t 4 t are shown in fig 17 fig 18 respectively the free surface deformation is found to be more nonlinear as the amplitude of oscillation is high the reason for nonlinearity may be due to the influence of free surface dynamic pressure at the bottom of the hull or due to large particle displacement near the hull fig 19 clearly shows that at high frequency of oscillation the free surface dynamic pressure does not have any influence at the bottom of the hull so at high frequency of oscillation the reason for nonlinearity is from large free surface displacements as depicted by particle movement near the hull as shown in fig 20 fig 21 and fig 22 shows the time history of heave hydrodynamic force experienced by mono hull for amplitudes a 0 01 and a 0 1 respectively when σ 1 fig 23 and fig 24 show the free surface deformation corresponding to a 0 01 and a 0 1 with σ 1 the waves generated at this frequency of oscillation have the wave steepness is slightly small near the hull compared to second wave away from the hull this is because of significant viscous effect even at low amplitude of oscillation the no slip effect between the lateral walls of the hull and fluid dampens the amplitude of wave generation near the hull also the free surface profiles fig 23 seems to be nonlinear for low amplitude of oscillation this is due to influence of free surface dynamic pressure on the bottom wall of the hull fig 25 large fluid particle displacement happening near the hull and influence of dynamic free surface makes the free surface profile highly nonlinear at high amplitude of oscillation the heave hydrodynamic force time histories for σ 0 75 with a 0 01 0 1 are shown in fig 26 fig 27 the free surface deformations plotted in fig 28 fig 29 shows higher order nonlinearity on free surface even at low amplitude of oscillation this is because of higher influence in free surface dynamic pressure on the bottom of the hull fig 30 the no slip condition between the hull and fluid makes the free surface near the hull smoother for low amplitude of oscillation fig 28 at high amplitude of oscillation the large particle displacement near the hull causes significant nonlinearity in free surface profile figs 15 21 and 26 show that the magnitude of heave hydrodynamic force decrease with decrease in frequency of oscillation for same amplitude of oscillation comparing figs 15 and 16 figs 21 and 22 and figs 26 and 27 it can be seen that the amplitude of heave hydrodynamic force increases with increase in amplitude of oscillation at same frequency of oscillation figs 19 25 and 30 show the dynamic pressure contour for different frequency of oscillations these figures display that the interaction of the dynamic pressure of waves generated at the free surface to the bottom of the wall increase with decrease in frequency at σ 1 5 the waves generated have small wavelength and the dynamic pressure of generated waves slightly affecting the dynamic pressure at the bottom of the hull fig 19 at σ 0 75 the waves generated are longer and the dynamic pressure of these waves have a significant effect on the bottom of the heaving body fig 30 as the frequency of oscillation decreases the effect of viscosity becomes significant the no slip effect between the lateral walls of the hull and fluid dampens the amplitude of wave generation near the hull the combined effect of dynamic pressure interaction between free surface and hull bottom and viscous effect accelerates wave dampening effect at a low frequency of oscillation in far field the dynamic pressure interaction between free surface and hull bottom is absent so the wave attains smooth profile 3 5 twinhull 3 5 1 effect of frequency and amplitude of oscillation in this section heave oscillation of twin hull on the free surface of viscous fluid for different frequency of oscillation are performed and discussed the twin hull consists of two mono hulls having dimensions l 1 and d 0 5 separated by a fixed spacing of g 4 the hydrodynamics associated with oscillation of twin hull is more complicated than monohull because of the formation of standing wave in the space between hulls the nature of these standing waves may vary with respect to frequency and amplitude of oscillations in order to check the validity of the proposed algorithm simulations are performed for the values of frequencies and amplitudes discussed in ananthakrishnan 2015 the frequencies considered are σ 1 67 high non resonant frequency 1 29 frequency of sloshing and 0 72 helmholtz resonant frequency in each frequency simulations are performed for small and high amplitudes i e a 0 01 0 1 the time history of heave hydrodynamic force obtained from present imlpg r method for σ 1 67 and a 0 01 using imlpg r method is compared with corresponding viscous linear and nonlinear analysis result of ananthakrishnan 2015 in fig 31 the figure shows good agreement with literature results particularly the viscous results the time history of heave hydrodynamic force experienced by each hull for σ 1 67 and a 0 1 is compared with the corresponding time history of linear and nonlinear inviscid heave hydrodynamic force results reported in ananthakrishnan 2015 as shown in fig 32 it can be seen that at low amplitude of oscillation the viscous linear inviscid and nonlinear inviscid force curves are in good agreement with each other fig 31 whereas at high amplitude of oscillation the viscous result shows good agreement with nonlinear curve fig 32 this is because at high frequency with low amplitude of oscillation the free surface dynamic pressure has very less influence on the bottom wall of the body fig 33 and the particle displacement near the structure is smooth fig 34 hence the nonlinear effects are insignificant at low amplitude of oscillation but at high amplitude of oscillation the large fluid particle displacement near the hull fig 35 causes significant nonlinearity in heave force the particle distribution for low and high amplitude oscillation is shown in figs 34 and 35 showing the redistribution of the particle based on flow characteristics from our present methodology the velocity field for the heave oscillation of twin hull for σ 1 67 with a 0 1 in different instants of time is displayed in fig 36 similar to heave oscillation of mono hull each hull of the twin hull will produce vortices near the lateral sides as a result two vortices having opposite direction of rotation will generate in the space between two hulls the interaction between these two vortices will generate a partial standing wave in the space between hulls fig 37 and fig 38 shows the free surface deformation obtained at t 4 t corresponding to a 0 1 and 0 01 respectively for σ 1 67 the wave profiles are found to be symmetric and highly nonlinear for large amplitude of oscillation these figures indicate that at σ 1 67 the standing wave generated in the space between hulls have wavelength approximately equal to half of the spacing between the hulls this is because at a high frequency of oscillation the wavelength of the generated waves is small the snapshot of free surface profiles generated in the space between twin hull at different instant of time from 3t to 4t for σ 1 67 and a 0 1 are shown in fig 39 at t 3 t the centroid of the hulls is at the mean surface during this time velocity of oscillation is maximum and vortices have maximum strength since the body is in downward movement fig 36 t 3 t the fluid flow is from the bottom of the hull to free surface also the vortex size is very small at σ 1 67 because the viscous effect is negligible at a high frequency of oscillation hence the fluid from the bottom of the hull flows towards the free surface near the hull so crests are developing near the hulls and trough is developing in the middle of the gap between hulls as the hull moves from mean position to bottom most point of oscillation the velocity of oscillation decreases and hence the vortex strength decreases so the fluid flow velocity from bottom of the hulls to free surface decreases hence the amplitude of wave crest and trough reduces until the body reaches the extreme bottom point of oscillation t 3 25 t when the body changes the direction of motion to upward direction the velocity of oscillation increases till the body centroid reaches mean free surface t 3 5 t as well as the vortices developed during downward motion detaches from both the hulls and move to the centre of the spacing between hulls during this time the fluid is flowing from free surface near the hulls to bottom of the hulls so troughs are developing near the hulls and crest is developing in the middle of the hulls the amplitude of these troughs and crests keep on reducing after mean position of oscillation because of decrease in velocity of oscillation in upward direction from t 3 5 t to t 3 75 t the wave profile obtained at t 3 t and t 4 t are identical i e the wave profile is repeating in every period of oscillation fig 40 fig 41 gives the comparison between the time history of heave hydrodynamic force estimated using imlpg r method and nonlinear inviscid theory ananthakrishnan 2015 during the vertical oscillation of twin hull with a frequency of σ 1 29 the comparison shows that at low amplitude of oscillation σ 1 29 for a 0 01 the present viscous result matches with nonlinear inviscid result of ananthakrishnan 2015 depicts that viscous effect is not significant and nonlinearity is significant the reason for nonlinearity at this frequency of oscillation is the influence of free surface dynamic pressure at the bottom of the hull even at low amplitude of oscillation fig 42 at high amplitude of oscillation σ 1 29 and a 0 1 the viscous result shows small deference with the nonlinear inviscid result fig 43 compares the free surface wave profile developed from heave oscillation of twin hull at σ 1 29 for a 0 01 and 0 1 it can be seen that the wave amplitude depends on the amplitude of oscillation of twin hull and wavelength is constant if the frequency of oscillation is same as the amplitude of oscillation increases the effect of viscosity comes into action so the no slip condition between the outer lateral walls of the twin hull tries to dampen the wave amplitude near the exterior walls hence the free surface obtained in the exterior of the twin hull for σ 1 29 in fig 43 have small amplitude near the body compared to wave away from the body at σ 1 29 the standing wave generated in the space between the hulls have wavelength approximately equal to the spacing between the hulls fig 44 shows the snapshots of free surface deformation in the gap of twin hull corresponding to σ 1 29 and a 0 1 an interesting factor in this frequency of oscillation when compared to σ 1 67 and a 0 1 is that the high amplitude of wave crest and trough are developing only if the centroid of the hull is at extreme points of oscillation i e high crest is obtained when the centroid of the body is at the extreme bottom point of oscillation t 3 25 t and large trough is obtained when the body is at the extreme top most point of oscillation t 3 75 t the crest and trough amplitude are minimum when the centroid of the body is at the mean free surface this can be explained by using the snapshot of velocity plot of the left hull for the frequency of oscillation σ 1 29 and a 0 1 shown in fig 45 in this frequency the viscous effect comes into action when the amplitude of oscillation is high the downward motion of the hull pushes the fluid at the bottom of the hull to free surface but the viscous effect on the inner lateral wall of the hull pulls the more fluid in the downward direction along with hull this downward fluid flow tries to push the fluid coming from the bottom of the hull in the downward direction the combined effect produces a fluid flow in the horizontal direction for few distances and then turns to the free surface during the downward motion of hull from mean position t 3 t to bottom most point t 3 25 t the fluid will flow in the horizontal direction first and then pushes towards the free surface since the fluid flow is coming from the left hull and right hull both flows will meet in the middle of the spacing between hulls hence the formation of large crest is getting at t 3 25 t in the upward motion of the hull the fluid on the inner lateral side of the hull starts to move in the upward direction and the fluid at the free surface of the gap between the hulls flows towards the bottom of the hulls so the height of the crest decreases this flow continues until the hulls reach the topmost point of oscillation this is the reason for getting small wave crest when the body is at mean position t 3 5 t and high wave trough when the body is at topmost point t 3 75 t again in downward motion the trough of the wave decreases and becomes high wave crest when the body reaches the bottom point of oscillation this process continues in every cycle so the free surface obtained at t 3 t and t 4 t in fig 44 are very similar the time history of heave hydrodynamic forces estimated using present viscous method for σ 0 72 at different amplitude of oscillation are compared with viscous and linear inviscid results of ananthakrishnan 2015 in fig 46 fig 47 it can be see that there is a phase difference between viscous result and linear inviscid result this is because of significant viscous effect at low frequency of oscillation also the dynamic pressure on the free surface of the fluid between the hulls has influence with the bottom of the hull fig 48 both viscous and dynamic pressure effect make the free surface irregular for low frequency of oscillation as shown in fig 49 fig 50 these irregular waves generated near the exterior of the hull are getting dampens in the far field because of viscosity fig 51 shows the free surface profile in the space between the hulls at different instants of time the free surface profile behaves like piston kind of movement whereas when the mono hull moves from bottom most point t 3 25 t of oscillation to top most point t 3 75 t of oscillation the free surface moves from top to bottom and vice versa 3 5 2 effect of spacing between the hulls the spacing between hulls has a role in the heave force experienced by each hull further simulations are performed by varying the spacing between the hulls from g 0 5 to g 4 fig 52 shows the effect of spacing on the heave force experienced by hulls during oscillation for σ 1 67 and a 0 1 it is found out that as the spacing increases the heave force experienced by each hull decreases if the spacing increases beyond g 2 no further reductions in heave force is noticed fig 53 fig 54 show the dynamic pressure contour for g 0 5 and g 2 respectively when σ 1 67 and a 0 1 it can be seen that when g 0 5 the pressure from one hull directly influence the other hull but when the spacing is g 2 the influence or interference effect between hull is not present so the forces are minimum when spacing is greater than 2 similar analysis is also conducted for σ 0 72 and σ 0 75 1 5 and obtained that g 3 is the minimum spacing for getting minimum heave force fig 55 this is because of large wave length at low frequency of oscillation so it can be concluded that the frequency of oscillation have a role in determining minimum spacing between the hulls for getting lower force 4 conclusion the nonlinear waves generated due to forced heave oscillation of 2d mono hull as well as twin hull on the free surface in a calm water is analyzed numerically using improved meshless local petrov galerkin mlpg method based on rankine source function the mono hull consists of a rectangular floating body and twin hull consists of two rectangular floating bodies separated by a fixed distance ghost particle technique is used to improve the pressure gradient calculation near the oscillating body variable spaced particle distribution with very fine particle spacing near the body and coarse particle spacing in the far field has been used to reduce the computation time based on the numerical investigations 5l was used as the variable spacing distance from the hull where the fine spacing is adopted after 5l the spacing has been decreased in order to carry out the simulations and avoid reflection from the end walls the result shows that there is no difference in the force time history with uniform and variable spacing if one chooses the numerical parameters correctly the numerical algorithm is validated and further simulations have been performed for different frequencies of heave oscillation in each frequency of oscillation analysis are carried out for low and high amplitude of oscillations to show the robustness of the method the simulation results depicts that the frequency and amplitude of oscillation have significant effect on the properties of wave generated at a high frequency of oscillation viscous effects are negligible and becomes significant when frequency decreases however at high amplitude of oscillation viscous effect is significant further for high amplitude of oscillation nonlinearity in force and free surface are captured the developed model is applied for the investigations by varying the spacing between the twin hull and arriving at an optimum spacing for getting lower hydrodynamic force on each hull the optimum spacing increases with decrease in frequency of oscillation mostly the particle method works for very steep or violent waves and not for the small amplitude non breaking waves this paper shows the small amplitude waves in deep water characteristics can be effectively captured using the present particle method similar to the traditional mesh based methods using the variable spacing approach acknowledgement this work was carried under the funding from dst inspire faculty award 
22987,in this paper the particle method for handling oscillation of floating body using variable particle spacing is reported heave oscillation of floating mono hull and twin hull on the free surface in a viscous fluid is performed using improved meshless local petrov galerkin method based on rankine source function imlpg r the imlpg r method is a particle based method that will solve the interaction between fluid and floating body using navier stokes equation the pressure at each time step is estimated from pressure poisson equation in order to incorporate the heaving of the floating bodies some improvements like free surface identification gradient calculations has been introduced in the present paper to handle the variable resolutions in modelling simulations are performed for different frequency and amplitude of oscillations for mono and twin hull forced motions to show the robustness of the developed model to handle both small and steep oscillations 1 introduction wave loads on floating structures may set them into motion which will affect safety and operations of the structures so the main application of computational hydrodynamics in ocean engineering is to predict the response of floating bodies under wave loading such analysis is important for the design and development of floating structures such as ships offshore platforms barges etc many researchers are focused on estimating hydrodynamic force experienced by floating structures under waves to judge the response of floating structures the hydrodynamics related to oscillation of floating structures on the free surface of a viscous fluid is a significant topic for study because of the complexity involved in solving equations of motion of floating body and fluid particle movement simultaneously in computational fluid dynamics two different numerical models are commonly using for solving floating body dynamics one is fully nonlinear potential flow theory fnpt models and another one is navier stokes model ns the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel is a quite popular method to solve the fnpt models kashiwagi 2000 and koo and kim 2004 extended mel method to study the 2d nonlinear interaction between waves and floating body a higher order bem has been developed by zhou et al 2015 to simulate the nonlinear interaction between waves and 3d fixed and floating bodies using potential flow theory wu and hu 2004 extended fem for simulating nonlinear wave interaction with the 3d floating body based on fnpt model with hybrid mesh generation fully nonlinear steep wave interaction with the 2d floating body is studied by yan and ma 2007 using the quasi arbitrary lagrangian eulerian finite element method qale fem based on fnpt although the fnpt models are giving better results the main disadvantage of fnpt model is that these models are not suitable for modelling wave breaking and turbulence as it is not considering viscosity fnpt models needs special treatment to handle the large amplitude oscillation of floating body but the advantage is it needs only course resolutions when compared to ns model on the other hand ns model has been used to overcome the difficulties faced in the fnpt yeung and ananthakrishnan 1992 1997 yeung et al 1998 and ananthakrishnan 1999 2012 2015 had numerically simulated various free surface flow problems associated with oscillation of floating bodies in the free surface of calm water using finite difference method fdm green water impact on fixed and moving bodies are investigated by yamasaki et al 2005 using fdm with marker and cell mac algorithm and overlapping grid system hadžić et al 2005 used finite volume method fvm with moving mesh technique for computing response of a floating body under waves wave structure interaction of a stationary floating body under regular and irregular waves are simulated by li and lin 2012 using fvm based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations free roll motion of floating body under regular wave is performed by jung et al 2013 using volume of fluid method based fvm constrained interpolation profile cip based cartesian grid method for studying green water loading on the deck of an advancing ship in waves is simulated by hu et al 2006 free sway motions of 2d floating body and water on deck phenomena are investigated by hu and kashiwagi 2009 they solved ns model using cip based cartesian grid method in their work water on deck phenomena is also simulated all the above discussed ns models are mesh based models even though the results produced by mesh based ns models are impressive the mesh based methods require good quality meshes and need to be managed depending on the formulation in order to obtain the promising result the mesh should be updated frequently or to be refined to capture the motion of the free surface and need to be maintained this is a time consuming task and costly especially in the cases with breaking waves recently developed mesh free method can overcome the problems associated with the mesh based method it considers fluid domain as randomly distributed nodes rather than discretizing the computational space into grids to construct appropriate solutions since there is no interconnectivity between nodes in the mesh free method the issues related to mesh orientations generally faced in finite elements and element connectivity are disappearing automatically so the drawback of the mesh based method does not exist many meshless or particle methods have been reported in the literature such as diffusion element method nayroles et al 1992 element free galerkin method belytschko et al 1994 smooth particle hydrodynamics monaghan 1994 reproducing kernel particle method liu et al 1996 moving particle semi implicit method koshizuka and oka 1996 and so on among them smooth particle hydrodynamics sph and moving particle semi implicit method mps have been commonly used for water wave problems doring et al 2004 bouscasse et al 2013 and ren et al 2015 are adopted sph method for simulating wave floating structure interaction problems omidvar et al 2013 improved the efficiency of sph method by using the variable particle mass technique for modelling 3d floating body motion mps method for studying the interaction between waves and floating bodies have been developed by sueyoshi 2004 and zhang et al 2015 meshless local petrov galerkin mlpg has been introduced by atluri and zhu 1998 mlpg method is a meshfree method in which partial differential equations are solving by using local weak form and moving least square mls method is used for local approximation of unknown variables lin and atluri 2001 applied this method for solving navier stokes equations ma 2005a tested mlpg method for simulating nonlinear water waves in his work he adopted the simple heaviside step function as the test function to formulate the weak form over local sub domains which results in the final formulations in terms of the pressure gradient ma 2005b altered mlpg method into a new form called mlpg r method in the mlpg r method instead of heaviside step function rankine source solution is used as the test function this new test function increases the accuracy of the pressure estimation by producing a weak form of governing equations which did not have the gradients of unknown variables either in terms of velocity or pressure gradient further matrix inversion used in the mls method for interpolation of variables is a time taking process so ma 2008 again modified the mlpg method using a new scheme called simplified finite difference interpolation sfdi which do not need the inverse of matrix sriram and ma 2012 used improved mlpg r method imlpg r for simulating violent wave interaction with elastic structures rijas and sriram 2017 extended the improved mlpg r method for simulating heave oscillation of floating body with uniformly distributed particles actually in fluid structure interaction problems very fine particle distribution is required only near the structure and free surface far field does not require fine resolution of particles so the uniform particle distribution will increase the number of particles and hence the computation time in order to improve the efficiency of the mlpg r method the present work uses variable particle distribution in this approach very fine particle spacing is applied near the structure and coarse particle distribution is used away from the body this is the first paper that reports mlpg method with variable particle spacing this paper is organized in the following order firstly the mathematical procedure for solving governing equations using the mlpg r method solid wall boundary treatment and free surface identification technique is presented next the convergence test and validation for vertical oscillation of monohull are described finally the method is applied for heave oscillation of twin hull under different frequency and amplitude the robustness of the developed method for handling different frequencies of oscillations from helmotz piston motion to sloshing mode partial standing phenomenon in the twin hull was reported 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions in the present work the fluid domain is represented by using a 2d fixed cartesian coordinate system the fluid flow is governed by the mass and momentum conservation equations 1 u 0 2 d u dt 1 ρ p g υ 2 u where u is the fluid velocity vector p is the fluid pressure ρ is the fluid density υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and g is the gravitational acceleration the kinematic and dynamic free surface conditions are expressed as 3 d r dt u 4 p 0 where r is the position vector the solid boundary inclusive of floating body surface should satisfy the following conditions 5 u n u n 6 n p ρ n g n u υ n 2 u where u and u are the velocity and acceleration vector of the solid boundary and n is the unit normal vector to the solid boundary 2 2 numerical procedure the above equations are solved by using the mesh free method with fractional time step algorithm introduced by chorin 1968 this method starts with an assumption that position velocity and pressure of fluid particles at nth time step is known and the physical quantities at n 1 th time step are updated by solving the governing equations as given below 1 at the beginning of a new time step the intermediate velocity u 0 and position d u dt 1 ρ p g υ 2 u of fluid particles are estimated explicitly as shown 7 u u n g dt υ 2 u n δ t 8 r r n u δ t where superscript n denotes nth time step and δt is the increment of the time step 2 next the pressure pn 1 is calculated implicitly from the following pressure poisson s equation ma and zhou 2009 9 2 p n 1 α ρ n 1 ρ δ t 2 1 α ρ δ t u where α is an artificial coefficient between 0 and 1 and ρ n 1 and ρ are density at n 1 th time step and intermediate time step the value of α is taken as zero by sriram and ma 2012 for their imlpg r method 3 after getting pn 1 the position and velocity of fluid particles at n 1 th time step can be calculated by numerical integration as shown 10 u n 1 u δ t ρ p n 1 11 r n 1 r u n 1 δ t 2 3 imlpg r formulation in the algorithm described above the key task is to solve the pressure poison equation and can be solved by any numerical method in this paper imlpg r method is applied for α 0 eq 9 can be written as 12 2 p n 1 ρ δ t u the imlpg r method discretizes the computational domain into randomly distributed particles or nodes a few nodes are situated in the boundaries and others are located inside the fluid domain each node has a circular sub domain having radius r and area ω with its centre located at the node itself in order to produce the weak form of eq 12 it is multiplying with an arbitrary test function φ and integrating over the circular subdomain of each node so for each node i the local formulation is given as 13 ω i 2 p ρ δ t u φ dω 0 the test function used in the imlpg r method is the solution of rankine source i e φ 1 2 π ln r r i ma 2005b where r is the distance of concerned particle inside the sub domain from the center of sub domain i e from node i numerical calculation of gradient of unknown pressure and derivative of intermediate velocity in eq 13 is a time consuming task so in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the results a zero term p 2 φ is added to eq 13 and gauss theorem is applied leading to the final form as 14 s i n p φ ds p ω i ρ δ t u φ dω similarly to avoid the calculation of 2 u on solid boundary in eq 6 it is modified to a new form by combining with eq 5 and eq 10 so eq 6 becomes 15 n p n 1 ρ δ t n u u n 1 in eq 14 the pressure on the left hand side is interpolated by using mls method and integration on the right hand side is performed by the semi analytical method a detailed discussion about discretization of eq 14 are given in ma and zhou 2009 and the same is not repeating here only final equations are given below k ij p b i where p x j 1 n φ j x p ˆ j k i j s i φ j x n φ d s φ j x i for inner nodes n φ j x i for solid boundary nodes and b i ω i ρ δ t u φ d ω for inner nodes ρ δ t n u u n 1 for solid boundary nodes where n is the number of particles that affect the pressure at the point x i p j ˆ are the nodal variables and φ j x is the shape function which is formulated by mls method ma 2005a the movement of the nodes will be based on minimum pressure gradient as detailed in sriram and ma 2012 2 4 pressure gradient calculation after estimating the pressure on all nodes velocity calculation of fluid particles eq 10 requires the gradient of pressure the pressure gradient is evaluated by using sfdi scheme ma 2008 the pressure gradient calculation near the boundaries may not be accurate because the fluid particles are distributed only one side of the boundary this was not a major issue for wave fixed structure interactions however for floating bodies numerical issues were observed so ghost particles set of imaginary particles are considered on another side of the boundary to compensate the deficiency of fluid particles during calculation of pressure gradient near the floating body the pressure on ghost particles is estimated by using the fixed ghost particle technique described by bouscasse et al 2013 in this method each ghost particle is associated with an interpolation point inside the fluid domain the position vector r of the interpolation point is determined by mirroring the position of ghost particle r s into the fluid domain the pressure on each interpolation point p is obtained by interpolating pressure on the fluid particles in the sub domain surrounding the interpolation point then ghost particle pressure p s is evaluated by using 16 p s p p n r r s where 17 p n ρ g n d u dt n υ 2 u n eq 17 is obtained from eq 2 once the pressure gradient is obtained the velocity and position of fluid particles are updated by using eqs 10 and 11 it should be noted the ghost particles are considering only during the estimation of pressure gradient and are not considering during pressure calculation in eq 14 2 5 free surface identification technique the fluid particles in the solution domain can be grouped into free surface particles and inner particles in the wave floating structure interaction problems the fluid particles initially on the free surface may submerge into the inner domain and fluid particles in the inner domain may rise on to the free surface because of the displacement of the structure so it is necessary to identify the free surface particles in each time step during the simulations free surface identification is most challenging in meshfree methods particularly in true mesh free methods like mlpg r method which do not use global background mesh in mps isph monaghan 1994 koshizuka and oka 1996 koshizuka et al 1998 method particle number density is commonly used to identify the free surface the numerical tests proved that this method is not robust as it incorrectly identified particles as free surface if large particle displacement is there so ma and zhou 2009 used particle number density in the first step and auxiliary function method to reconfirm whether the identified particle is free surface or not however this method requires the simulation to start with an initial uniform spacing due to the use of particle number density so in order to extend for non uniform or variable spacing we have used the free surface identification technique proposed by barecasco et al 2013 this method is based on the position vector of fluid particles only and is independent of formulation used it assumes each particle in the domain is surrounded by a circle sphere for the 3d problem of radius r if the distance between two particles is less than r the circle of one particle will overlap a portion of the circle of another particle the circle of a particle under considerations is completely overlapped by circles of surrounding particles then it can be considered as inner particles and incompletely covered particles can be considered as boundary particles the procedure for identifying free surface is available in barecasco et al 2013 however during the tests we faced many difficulties while simulating breaking waves and very steep waves leading to wrong identification of free surface so to overcome the issue we have used the auxiliary function method discussed in the paper ma and zhou 2009 to recheck the identification thus the first method simply identifies the particles which have chances to become free surface and second method will reconfirm it these two step approach overcome the difficulties of using particle number density commonly used in mps isph koshizuka et al 1998 which needs uniform distribution 2 6 variable particle distribution in fluid structure interaction problem very fine particle distribution is required near the structure in order to capture the flow characteristics accurately the fluid domain far from the structure does not require high resolution of particles uniform distribution of particles with very high resolution will increase total number of particles hence it increases the computation time so in order to improve the efficiency of the imlpg r method the present work introduced variable particle distribution which uses very fine particle distribution near the structure and coarse particle distribution in far field as shown in fig 1 in this figure let δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 and δ x 4 is the initial particle spacing in zone 1 zone 2 zone 3 and zone 4 respectively the spacing between particles is gradually increasing while going from inner fine spaced zone zone 1 to outer coarse spaced zone zone 4 if moving from very finely spaced zone1 to zone 2 the particle spacing for the interface node is δ x 2 for zone 2 to zone 3 the spacing is x 3 and so on further in order to handle the variable particle spacing the radius of the support domain for the particle under considerations will be changed to 18 r i r i r j 2 where j is the neighbouring particle under considerations further the movement of the particles from coarser to finer domain or vice versa are taken care for each time step the radius of support domain of each particle is recalculating with respect to the surrounding particles so the entry and exit of particles inside a support domain are considered 3 results and discussion 3 1 problem description forced heave oscillation of monohull as well as twin hull on the

a a l the frequency of oscillation σ σ l g fluid velocity u u g l fluid pressure p p ρ g l heave force f f ρ g l 2 the heave velocity of the body is u c a σ cos σ t where u c is the velocity of the centre of gravity of the heaving body and t is the time 3 2 spatial and temporal convergence in order to obtain an optimum particle spacing and time step size forced heave oscillation of monohull on the free surface of the viscous fluid is performed for the amplitude of a 0 025 and σ 1 5 in a numerical wave tank the tank length depends on the frequency of oscillation which decides the wavelength the tank length is adjusted in such a way that the primary radiated wave should not reach the open boundary during the total simulation time the size of the monohull considered is l 1 and d 0 5 simulations are performed for different particle spacing initial spacing near the structure varying from l 8 to l 20 and time step size varying from t 100 to t 400 in all simulations the particle spacing away from the structure gradually increases and in the far field spacing is kept as l 4 to act as a damping zone at the ends a typical variation of the spacing is shown in fig 3 fig 4 compare the snapshots of wave profile obtained at t 4 t for different particle spacing x near to the structure with the time step size t t 200 the wave profile obtained with spacing x l 16 is found to be very similar to the monohull with spacing x l 20 similarly the wave profile generated at t 4 t for different t with x l 16 are compared in fig 5 this figure clearly indicates that the wave profile obtained for time step size t 200 and t 400 have good agreement in addition time histories of free surface elevation at a distance 2 5l from the mono hull for different particle spacing and time step size are compared in fig 6 fig 7 the analytical results are also shown providing better comparisons the above figure shows that δ x l 16 with t t 200 is good enough further the time history of heave hydrodynamic force acting on the monohull for different particle spacing x when the time step size t t 200 is shown in fig 8 the heave force acting on the body has been calculated by integrating hydrodynamic pressure acting on the surface of the body when compared to the convergence level in the free surface profile the convergence for force time history is not good enough this is due to the numerical integrations of many points particularly the small difference near the free surface the same level of lower accuracy is also found in the other mesh based codes anantha krishnan 2015 so figs 4 8 clearly shows that δ x l 16 and t t 200 are the optimum particle spacing and time step size respectively for the present test cases 3 3 influence of variable particle distributions in order to investigate the length of the variable particle distributions and its influence in the wave profile and force time histories the following test case has been carried out in the following study the variable spaced particle distribution approach is validated by comparing with uniformly spaced particle distribution the particle spacing and time step size used for this test is x l 16 and t t 200 respectively in the present investigations as shown in fig 3 upto l from the hull resolution is δ t and varied to l 14 and l 12 for every l afterwards it is l 10 the time histories of free surface elevation obtained with uniformly spaced particle distribution and variable spaced particle distribution are compared in fig 9 the figure compares the wave elevation at 2 l x l 14 3 l x l 12 4 l x l 10 and 5 l x l 10 distance from the monohull the free surface elevation at 2 l and 3 l distance from the monohull with variable particle spacing are matching very well with the result of uniform particle spacing but there is a difference in wave elevation at 4 l and 5 l distance from the monohull this can be explained with the help of fig 10 which compares the time histories of free surface profile obtained at 5 l with variable particle distribution to uniform particle distribution with x l 16 and x l 10 the amplitude of free surface with x l 10 is small when compared to x l 16 and almost same in comparison with variable particle distribution with phase shift due to damping from the convergence study done in the previous section x l 16 is obtained as the minimum particle spacing required to capture the wave elevation properly when x greater than δ t there will be some damping of wave height resulting from less number of particles per wave length hence in variable particle distribution when the wave reaches the area where particle spacing is large the wave height decreases this issue will not come if the wave length is large in this test case the wave length is small because of high frequency of oscillation and a good test case to investigate the comparison of time histories of heave hydrodynamic force for uniform particle distribution and variable particle distribution are shown in fig 11 showing good agreement thus in the present problem the wave profile obtained in far field does not have any importance however in order to capture the wave profile exactly we have kept the length of first zone having spacing x l 16 as 5 l for all of frequency oscillation problems reported in this paper from the above investigations and varied afterwards table 1 shows the computational time obtained for the above studies using variable and uniform spacing it clearly shows the variable particle distribution reduces the computational time drastically of the order of 41 for the above problem the computations are carried out in intel core i7 with 32 gb ram in serial mode further in order to check the accuracy of proposed algorithm for pressure calculation heave oscillation of mono hull on the free surface of a viscous fluid is performed and the pressure near the body is compared with theoretical result two points first point b at the middle of the hull bottom and second point f at a distance y vertically below the point b are considered for the test let p b is the pressure at the point b and p f is the pressure at the point f the difference between pressures at these two points can be obtained from eq 2 p b p f ρ δ y g a b where a b is the acceleration of the point b and y x the comparison of pressure difference obtained by imlpg r method and theory is shown in fig 12 it is found that the numerical results achieves better matching with theoretical result 3 4 mono hull effect of frequencies and amplitudes further simulations are performed for different frequencies of σ 0 75 1 1 5 and different amplitudes of a 0 025 0 05 with optimum particle spacing to validate the model the amplitude of heave hydrodynamic force computed in the present numerical work is compared with the experimental value and the numerical value from finite difference method ananthakrishnan 2015 in table 2 the experimentally determined added mass and damping coefficient values given in vugts 1968 are used for calculating hydrodynamic force the table shows good agreement of results between present method and literature the snapshot of pressure field and velocity field respectively at different instants of time for the heave oscillation of monohull on the free surface of viscous fluid at a frequency of σ 1 5 and amplitude of a 0 05 is shown in fig 13 fig 14 at t 3 t the centroid of the body is at its mean position of oscillation and velocity of the body is in downward direction in downward movement of the body the high fluid pressure below the bottom wall of the body produces a fluid flow from the bottom of the body to free surface similarly the no slip boundary condition on the lateral walls of the body will produce a fluid flow along the lateral movement of the wall hence during the downward movement of the body it will produce a downflow along the side walls of the body fig 14 clearly displays the fluid flow due to increase in pressure at the bottom side of the body and fluid flow due to viscous effect at lateral sides of the body t 3 t the interaction between these two flows will produce a clockwise vortex on the left side of the body and counter clockwise vortex on the right side of the body the magnitude of velocity of oscillation is maximum at the mean position and minimum at its extreme positions so the vortex strength will be maximum at the mean position and decreases with downward motion of the body and radiates away from the body as it reaches the extreme bottom point of oscillation t 3 25 t also the fluid pressure decreases in downward direction and becomes minimum at t 3 25 t at this point velocity changes its sign and starts to move in upward direction so the pressure increases with velocity in upward direction the low pressure below the bottom wall of the body causes a fluid flow from free surface to the bottom wall of the hull also an upward flow will occur near lateral walls of the body due to viscous effect of fluid see fig 14 at t 3 5 t hence the direction of vortices on both sides of the body changes and starts to grow in upward motion until the centroid of the hull reaches mean position t 3 5 t the vortex strength decays continuously after the mean position with velocity of oscillation and changes its direction at the topmost point of oscillation t 3 75 t at this position fluid pressure reaches maximum velocity changes its direction and starts to oscillate in downward direction and the process continues all these phenomena of variation of pressure and velocity in downward motion and upward motion and fluid flow are clearly displayed in figs 13 and 14 in order to study the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation on wave characteristics and heave force simulations are performed for different frequencies σ 0 75 1 5 and amplitudes a 0 01 0 1 of oscillation the time histories of heave hydrodynamic force for σ 1 5 with a 0 01 and a 0 1 are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively and the corresponding wave profiles at time t 4 t are shown in fig 17 fig 18 respectively the free surface deformation is found to be more nonlinear as the amplitude of oscillation is high the reason for nonlinearity may be due to the influence of free surface dynamic pressure at the bottom of the hull or due to large particle displacement near the hull fig 19 clearly shows that at high frequency of oscillation the free surface dynamic pressure does not have any influence at the bottom of the hull so at high frequency of oscillation the reason for nonlinearity is from large free surface displacements as depicted by particle movement near the hull as shown in fig 20 fig 21 and fig 22 shows the time history of heave hydrodynamic force experienced by mono hull for amplitudes a 0 01 and a 0 1 respectively when σ 1 fig 23 and fig 24 show the free surface deformation corresponding to a 0 01 and a 0 1 with σ 1 the waves generated at this frequency of oscillation have the wave steepness is slightly small near the hull compared to second wave away from the hull this is because of significant viscous effect even at low amplitude of oscillation the no slip effect between the lateral walls of the hull and fluid dampens the amplitude of wave generation near the hull also the free surface profiles fig 23 seems to be nonlinear for low amplitude of oscillation this is due to influence of free surface dynamic pressure on the bottom wall of the hull fig 25 large fluid particle displacement happening near the hull and influence of dynamic free surface makes the free surface profile highly nonlinear at high amplitude of oscillation the heave hydrodynamic force time histories for σ 0 75 with a 0 01 0 1 are shown in fig 26 fig 27 the free surface deformations plotted in fig 28 fig 29 shows higher order nonlinearity on free surface even at low amplitude of oscillation this is because of higher influence in free surface dynamic pressure on the bottom of the hull fig 30 the no slip condition between the hull and fluid makes the free surface near the hull smoother for low amplitude of oscillation fig 28 at high amplitude of oscillation the large particle displacement near the hull causes significant nonlinearity in free surface profile figs 15 21 and 26 show that the magnitude of heave hydrodynamic force decrease with decrease in frequency of oscillation for same amplitude of oscillation comparing figs 15 and 16 figs 21 and 22 and figs 26 and 27 it can be seen that the amplitude of heave hydrodynamic force increases with increase in amplitude of oscillation at same frequency of oscillation figs 19 25 and 30 show the dynamic pressure contour for different frequency of oscillations these figures display that the interaction of the dynamic pressure of waves generated at the free surface to the bottom of the wall increase with decrease in frequency at σ 1 5 the waves generated have small wavelength and the dynamic pressure of generated waves slightly affecting the dynamic pressure at the bottom of the hull fig 19 at σ 0 75 the waves generated are longer and the dynamic pressure of these waves have a significant effect on the bottom of the heaving body fig 30 as the frequency of oscillation decreases the effect of viscosity becomes significant the no slip effect between the lateral walls of the hull and fluid dampens the amplitude of wave generation near the hull the combined effect of dynamic pressure interaction between free surface and hull bottom and viscous effect accelerates wave dampening effect at a low frequency of oscillation in far field the dynamic pressure interaction between free surface and hull bottom is absent so the wave attains smooth profile 3 5 twinhull 3 5 1 effect of frequency and amplitude of oscillation in this section heave oscillation of twin hull on the free surface of viscous fluid for different frequency of oscillation are performed and discussed the twin hull consists of two mono hulls having dimensions l 1 and d 0 5 separated by a fixed spacing of g 4 the hydrodynamics associated with oscillation of twin hull is more complicated than monohull because of the formation of standing wave in the space between hulls the nature of these standing waves may vary with respect to frequency and amplitude of oscillations in order to check the validity of the proposed algorithm simulations are performed for the values of frequencies and amplitudes discussed in ananthakrishnan 2015 the frequencies considered are σ 1 67 high non resonant frequency 1 29 frequency of sloshing and 0 72 helmholtz resonant frequency in each frequency simulations are performed for small and high amplitudes i e a 0 01 0 1 the time history of heave hydrodynamic force obtained from present imlpg r method for σ 1 67 and a 0 01 using imlpg r method is compared with corresponding viscous linear and nonlinear analysis result of ananthakrishnan 2015 in fig 31 the figure shows good agreement with literature results particularly the viscous results the time history of heave hydrodynamic force experienced by each hull for σ 1 67 and a 0 1 is compared with the corresponding time history of linear and nonlinear inviscid heave hydrodynamic force results reported in ananthakrishnan 2015 as shown in fig 32 it can be seen that at low amplitude of oscillation the viscous linear inviscid and nonlinear inviscid force curves are in good agreement with each other fig 31 whereas at high amplitude of oscillation the viscous result shows good agreement with nonlinear curve fig 32 this is because at high frequency with low amplitude of oscillation the free surface dynamic pressure has very less influence on the bottom wall of the body fig 33 and the particle displacement near the structure is smooth fig 34 hence the nonlinear effects are insignificant at low amplitude of oscillation but at high amplitude of oscillation the large fluid particle displacement near the hull fig 35 causes significant nonlinearity in heave force the particle distribution for low and high amplitude oscillation is shown in figs 34 and 35 showing the redistribution of the particle based on flow characteristics from our present methodology the velocity field for the heave oscillation of twin hull for σ 1 67 with a 0 1 in different instants of time is displayed in fig 36 similar to heave oscillation of mono hull each hull of the twin hull will produce vortices near the lateral sides as a result two vortices having opposite direction of rotation will generate in the space between two hulls the interaction between these two vortices will generate a partial standing wave in the space between hulls fig 37 and fig 38 shows the free surface deformation obtained at t 4 t corresponding to a 0 1 and 0 01 respectively for σ 1 67 the wave profiles are found to be symmetric and highly nonlinear for large amplitude of oscillation these figures indicate that at σ 1 67 the standing wave generated in the space between hulls have wavelength approximately equal to half of the spacing between the hulls this is because at a high frequency of oscillation the wavelength of the generated waves is small the snapshot of free surface profiles generated in the space between twin hull at different instant of time from 3t to 4t for σ 1 67 and a 0 1 are shown in fig 39 at t 3 t the centroid of the hulls is at the mean surface during this time velocity of oscillation is maximum and vortices have maximum strength since the body is in downward movement fig 36 t 3 t the fluid flow is from the bottom of the hull to free surface also the vortex size is very small at σ 1 67 because the viscous effect is negligible at a high frequency of oscillation hence the fluid from the bottom of the hull flows towards the free surface near the hull so crests are developing near the hulls and trough is developing in the middle of the gap between hulls as the hull moves from mean position to bottom most point of oscillation the velocity of oscillation decreases and hence the vortex strength decreases so the fluid flow velocity from bottom of the hulls to free surface decreases hence the amplitude of wave crest and trough reduces until the body reaches the extreme bottom point of oscillation t 3 25 t when the body changes the direction of motion to upward direction the velocity of oscillation increases till the body centroid reaches mean free surface t 3 5 t as well as the vortices developed during downward motion detaches from both the hulls and move to the centre of the spacing between hulls during this time the fluid is flowing from free surface near the hulls to bottom of the hulls so troughs are developing near the hulls and crest is developing in the middle of the hulls the amplitude of these troughs and crests keep on reducing after mean position of oscillation because of decrease in velocity of oscillation in upward direction from t 3 5 t to t 3 75 t the wave profile obtained at t 3 t and t 4 t are identical i e the wave profile is repeating in every period of oscillation fig 40 fig 41 gives the comparison between the time history of heave hydrodynamic force estimated using imlpg r method and nonlinear inviscid theory ananthakrishnan 2015 during the vertical oscillation of twin hull with a frequency of σ 1 29 the comparison shows that at low amplitude of oscillation σ 1 29 for a 0 01 the present viscous result matches with nonlinear inviscid result of ananthakrishnan 2015 depicts that viscous effect is not significant and nonlinearity is significant the reason for nonlinearity at this frequency of oscillation is the influence of free surface dynamic pressure at the bottom of the hull even at low amplitude of oscillation fig 42 at high amplitude of oscillation σ 1 29 and a 0 1 the viscous result shows small deference with the nonlinear inviscid result fig 43 compares the free surface wave profile developed from heave oscillation of twin hull at σ 1 29 for a 0 01 and 0 1 it can be seen that the wave amplitude depends on the amplitude of oscillation of twin hull and wavelength is constant if the frequency of oscillation is same as the amplitude of oscillation increases the effect of viscosity comes into action so the no slip condition between the outer lateral walls of the twin hull tries to dampen the wave amplitude near the exterior walls hence the free surface obtained in the exterior of the twin hull for σ 1 29 in fig 43 have small amplitude near the body compared to wave away from the body at σ 1 29 the standing wave generated in the space between the hulls have wavelength approximately equal to the spacing between the hulls fig 44 shows the snapshots of free surface deformation in the gap of twin hull corresponding to σ 1 29 and a 0 1 an interesting factor in this frequency of oscillation when compared to σ 1 67 and a 0 1 is that the high amplitude of wave crest and trough are developing only if the centroid of the hull is at extreme points of oscillation i e high crest is obtained when the centroid of the body is at the extreme bottom point of oscillation t 3 25 t and large trough is obtained when the body is at the extreme top most point of oscillation t 3 75 t the crest and trough amplitude are minimum when the centroid of the body is at the mean free surface this can be explained by using the snapshot of velocity plot of the left hull for the frequency of oscillation σ 1 29 and a 0 1 shown in fig 45 in this frequency the viscous effect comes into action when the amplitude of oscillation is high the downward motion of the hull pushes the fluid at the bottom of the hull to free surface but the viscous effect on the inner lateral wall of the hull pulls the more fluid in the downward direction along with hull this downward fluid flow tries to push the fluid coming from the bottom of the hull in the downward direction the combined effect produces a fluid flow in the horizontal direction for few distances and then turns to the free surface during the downward motion of hull from mean position t 3 t to bottom most point t 3 25 t the fluid will flow in the horizontal direction first and then pushes towards the free surface since the fluid flow is coming from the left hull and right hull both flows will meet in the middle of the spacing between hulls hence the formation of large crest is getting at t 3 25 t in the upward motion of the hull the fluid on the inner lateral side of the hull starts to move in the upward direction and the fluid at the free surface of the gap between the hulls flows towards the bottom of the hulls so the height of the crest decreases this flow continues until the hulls reach the topmost point of oscillation this is the reason for getting small wave crest when the body is at mean position t 3 5 t and high wave trough when the body is at topmost point t 3 75 t again in downward motion the trough of the wave decreases and becomes high wave crest when the body reaches the bottom point of oscillation this process continues in every cycle so the free surface obtained at t 3 t and t 4 t in fig 44 are very similar the time history of heave hydrodynamic forces estimated using present viscous method for σ 0 72 at different amplitude of oscillation are compared with viscous and linear inviscid results of ananthakrishnan 2015 in fig 46 fig 47 it can be see that there is a phase difference between viscous result and linear inviscid result this is because of significant viscous effect at low frequency of oscillation also the dynamic pressure on the free surface of the fluid between the hulls has influence with the bottom of the hull fig 48 both viscous and dynamic pressure effect make the free surface irregular for low frequency of oscillation as shown in fig 49 fig 50 these irregular waves generated near the exterior of the hull are getting dampens in the far field because of viscosity fig 51 shows the free surface profile in the space between the hulls at different instants of time the free surface profile behaves like piston kind of movement whereas when the mono hull moves from bottom most point t 3 25 t of oscillation to top most point t 3 75 t of oscillation the free surface moves from top to bottom and vice versa 3 5 2 effect of spacing between the hulls the spacing between hulls has a role in the heave force experienced by each hull further simulations are performed by varying the spacing between the hulls from g 0 5 to g 4 fig 52 shows the effect of spacing on the heave force experienced by hulls during oscillation for σ 1 67 and a 0 1 it is found out that as the spacing increases the heave force experienced by each hull decreases if the spacing increases beyond g 2 no further reductions in heave force is noticed fig 53 fig 54 show the dynamic pressure contour for g 0 5 and g 2 respectively when σ 1 67 and a 0 1 it can be seen that when g 0 5 the pressure from one hull directly influence the other hull but when the spacing is g 2 the influence or interference effect between hull is not present so the forces are minimum when spacing is greater than 2 similar analysis is also conducted for σ 0 72 and σ 0 75 1 5 and obtained that g 3 is the minimum spacing for getting minimum heave force fig 55 this is because of large wave length at low frequency of oscillation so it can be concluded that the frequency of oscillation have a role in determining minimum spacing between the hulls for getting lower force 4 conclusion the nonlinear waves generated due to forced heave oscillation of 2d mono hull as well as twin hull on the free surface in a calm water is analyzed numerically using improved meshless local petrov galerkin mlpg method based on rankine source function the mono hull consists of a rectangular floating body and twin hull consists of two rectangular floating bodies separated by a fixed distance ghost particle technique is used to improve the pressure gradient calculation near the oscillating body variable spaced particle distribution with very fine particle spacing near the body and coarse particle spacing in the far field has been used to reduce the computation time based on the numerical investigations 5l was used as the variable spacing distance from the hull where the fine spacing is adopted after 5l the spacing has been decreased in order to carry out the simulations and avoid reflection from the end walls the result shows that there is no difference in the force time history with uniform and variable spacing if one chooses the numerical parameters correctly the numerical algorithm is validated and further simulations have been performed for different frequencies of heave oscillation in each frequency of oscillation analysis are carried out for low and high amplitude of oscillations to show the robustness of the method the simulation results depicts that the frequency and amplitude of oscillation have significant effect on the properties of wave generated at a high frequency of oscillation viscous effects are negligible and becomes significant when frequency decreases however at high amplitude of oscillation viscous effect is significant further for high amplitude of oscillation nonlinearity in force and free surface are captured the developed model is applied for the investigations by varying the spacing between the twin hull and arriving at an optimum spacing for getting lower hydrodynamic force on each hull the optimum spacing increases with decrease in frequency of oscillation mostly the particle method works for very steep or violent waves and not for the small amplitude non breaking waves this paper shows the small amplitude waves in deep water characteristics can be effectively captured using the present particle method similar to the traditional mesh based methods using the variable spacing approach acknowledgement this work was carried under the funding from dst inspire faculty award 
22988,recent advances in antifouling af paints in general prevent fouling in about 95 of the vessel s immersed surface however the remaining area which amounts to 5 or less of the total area does get fouled although this level of fouling has marginal impact on the routine performance of the vessel it is a predominant vector for the transmigration of invasive species which is now a serious environmental concern virtually all ocean going vessels are coated with antifouling paints predominant among them are self polishing coatings cfd analysis conducted on various types of vessels have indicated that there are certain hotspots where the polishing rates are exceedingly high and would polish the af paints at a much faster rate and ultimately result in the failure of the af coating a possible solution to this issue is to first identify these hotspots and suitable paint schemes formulations are to be applied in such areas an experimental procedure utilizing a drum test apparatus can be used to compute the coating thicknesses based on wall shear stresses such painting schemes would prevent the premature failure of the af coating in general and significantly reduce the risk of transmigration of invasive species in particular keywords antifouling self polishing coatings cfd invasive species painting schemes 1 introduction the commercial shipping industry primarily uses self polishing copolymer spc paints as anti fouling coatings these paints were introduced in the mid 1970s and in this class of paints the biocide is chemically bonded to a copolymer anderson 1993 hunter and cain 1996 ma et al 2017 the leaching rate of the biocide is highly controlled due to the fact that biocide is released when sea water reacts with the surface layer of the paint almeida et al 2007 the spc paints allow the application of thicker coatings with the biocide chemically bonded throughout the coating this results in the slow and uniform release of biocides to the surface hellio and yebra 2009 the biocide release for these coatings is only a few nanometres deep and the spent layer is slowly eroded away and a new active layer develops the popularity of these antifouling af coatings was primarily due to a controlled chemical dissolution of the paint film capable of long dry dock intervals typically between five to seven years predictable polishing enabling tailor made specifications by vessel operation thin leached layers making it easy to clean and recoat good weather ability quick drying and extremely good value for money yebra et al 2005 jones 2009 2 hydrodynamic forces at paint seawater interface the extent of polishing action in spc paints depend primarily on the hydrodynamic forces at the paint seawater interface the higher the hydrodynamic forces the higher are the polishing rates conversely lower hydrodynamic forces at the paint seawater interface imply lower polishing rates this implies that at locations where the hydrodynamic forces are high the polishing rates would be high and this could result in premature depletion of the antifouling coating also when the hydrodynamic forces are very low such as a ship standing in port waters low polishing action would result and this would lead to insufficient biocide release at the paint water interface kiil et al 2001 in both the preceding scenarios the paint film does not offer antifouling protection in the first case only when the paint is depleted which takes some time fouling takes place whereas in the second case fouling takes place almost immediately the practice of application of antifouling coating is that a uniform coating of a specified pre calculated thickness is applied on the underwater hull of the vessel taking in to account the average speed of the vessel its trading routes length of stay in port etc however shipbuilders owners etc do not account for the fact that there are non uniform polishing rates along the vessels hull in certain niche areas in the proximity of bow thrusters sea chest stern tube rudder shoulder water line etc that are prone to premature fouling camps et al 2014 these areas are less than five percent of the total underwater area of the vessel and therefore have negligible effect as far as the operational parameters of the vessel are concerned drake and lodge 2007 demirel et al 2014 although depletion of paints initiates corrosion a far more serious concern is that they are the primary vector for the transmigration of invasive species chan et al 2015 olivera and granhag 2016 now days some paint manufactures have started suggesting variable paint thickness across the hull surface the reasons for which are unknown invasive species also called as alien species or non native species are introduced in the marine environment by human activities threatens biological diversity and ecological integrity worldwide they can cause irreversible reduction in biodiversity by preying on or by competing or causing or carrying diseases or altering habitats of native species and threaten biodiversity by predation or competition they can also cause serious economic and ecological damage some can damage shorelines man made marine structures equipment and vessels the unep has declared that the invasive species are the most serious environmental issue only next to habitat loss many studies show that hull fouling is the primary vector for invasive species rainer 1995 coutts 1999 hewitt 2002 gollasch 2002 ashton et al 2007 coutts et al 2010 even the best maintained vessels are fouled to the extent of at least three percent of the hull area and are more than sufficient to cause the transmigration of alien species gollasch 2002 brine et al 2013 3 analysis of hydrodynamic forces at fluid hull interface a cfd analysis of hydrodynamic flow around the hull of a tanker and a 100 passenger vessel was carried out using fluent software simulation of flow around the hull has been performed by computational fluid dynamics cfd techniques using fluent the velocity profiles and wall shear stress distribution acting on the surface of the hull have been obtained based on cfd solutions the flow around the hull surface is governed by the incompressible form of the navier stokes equation a flow solution based on solution of the navier stokes equation using standard software available in the market has been attempted larsson and raven 2010 the reynolds averaged form of the above momentum equation including the turbulent shear stresses is given by t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g f where ρ is the fluid density v is the fluid velocity relative to the vessel ρ is the pressure τ is the shear stress g is the acceleration due to gravity f is any other external force term the ship was modeled from a lines plan of two existing ships lines plan was first drafted in autocad and it was exported tribon to model the 3 dimensional hull form the 3 d models of the ships are then taken as half the original volume and a flow volume was created and meshed in ansys software the flow volume is of a box shape and hull surface is inside the box to level of the draft and upper surfaces above waterline are trimmed fig 1 the details of the vessels for which the flow analysis was conducted are given below vessel 1 type tanker overall length 220 m maximum draft 12 m maximum speed 16 knots vessel 2 type 100 passenger vessel overall length 90 m maximum draft 3 m maximum speed 20 knots the boundary conditions used are schematically described below the fluid is assumed to enter the flow volume at an upstream boundary or inlet such that the ship appears stationary and the water flows past it the inlet boundary velocity is set to be a fixed value equal to the velocity of the ship but in the opposite direction the vessel s hull is set to be a wall with a no slip condition in order to reduce the size of the computational domain a symmetry plane is taken along the ship s centerline in cases for which the free surface effects are small or simply not of interest the water plane can also be assumed to be a wall with zero shear slip the top wall is therefore taken as a free surface with a prescribed zero shear stress the symmetry boundary condition for the scalar pressure and velocity components tangential to these boundaries is that their gradients normal to these boundaries are zero standard k model was

200 m long tanker and figs 6 and 7 show the same stresses of a 100 passenger vessel in all cases the flow of water is from bow to stern i e from left to right in each of the figures depicted there is a marked variation in the wall shear stresses throughout the hull which depends on the speed the draft and the vessel shape it can be observed that higher shear stresses which could imply higher paint polishing rates are only underwater and the boot top region is not a critical area for af paint depletion it can also be observed that stresses are high at areas of sharp curvature of the hull surface such as bilges and shoulders where wall shear stress is also high speed is also a primary parameter in determining wall shear stress this is evident from figs 2 and 3 areas of the vessel that experience comparatively high hydrodynamic stresses and therefore higher polishing rates show indications of premature fouling the current painting practice is that an antifouling coating of uniform thickness is applied without taking into considerations of the various hydrodynamic stresses for both the tanker and the 100 passenger pax vessel the computed shear stresses at the waterline and the stern have lower than average hydrodynamic stresses which indicates low polishing rates the extent of which depends on the draft speed and type of vessel in these areas insufficient biocide delivery results which is likely to result in premature fouling on the other hand for the tanker in particular the shoulder of the vessel behind the bow experiences high wall stresses which result in higher polishing rates in comparison to the rest of the vessel this would lead to the premature depletion of the antifouling paint and would again result in fouling much ahead of the bulk of the surface of the vessel thus at low shear stress regions there could be insufficient delivery of biocides leading to premature or large fouling also in regions of high shear stress paint depletion is rapid leading to early initiation of fouling it is seen that both regions of high and low shear stress lead to fouling in case a full form ship like a tanker the regions of high shear stress can be identified as regions of large curvature which are very pronounced along the bilges and forward and aft shoulders and this happens at comparatively low speed or at low froude number but in case of a fine form ship like a passenger vessel the regions of sharp curvature are less with comparatively low shear stress at similar speeds i e same froude number but shear stresses increase sharply with increase in speed or froude number and this increase is spread over large area of the hull surface 4 identification of niche areas for fouling the issue of invasive species can therefore be best addressed if fouling is further reduced or completely eliminated particularly in the niche areas of the vessel this could be best accomplished if these areas are accurately identified and appropriate paint schemes are applied at these regions to locate these niche areas hydrodynamic forces at the paint water interface are to be analyzed fig 8 depicts photographs of tanker on arrival at dry dock in the regular survey schedule and therefore after 5 years of last painting from these photographs it is evident that there is a marked depletion of af coating in certain areas of the tanker the fouled areas are illustrated in fig 9 for the entire length of the vessel the computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis shown in fig 10 corresponds approximately to the average operational speed and draft of tanker 1 which has a draft of 12 m and a speed of approximately 6 m per second in this figure wall shear stresses are high along the bottom of the vertical sides of the vessel with a small region forward and aft shoulders extending to the boottopping zone at the forward one third of the hull length although there could be many factors that may contribute to the excessive paint depletion which could include structural deformation butt welding etc however when compared with the dry dock data as pictorially depicted in fig 8 it is observed that there does exist a fairly good correlation between regions of high wall shear stress and fouling this is a likely indicatation that high wall shear stress results in the premature wearing of the af protection which ultimately leads to fouling passenger vessel data for actual ship has not been obtained since the tanker calculations and photographs show matching trends the calculations for passenger vessel are also likely to indicate regions of high shear stress correctly therefore in order to significantly minimize fouling antifouling af painting schemes must take into account the uneven hydrodynamic forces at the water hull interface in other words if a cfd analysis is first conducted to identify areas of high wall shear stress and correlation between wall shear stress at all locations on the vessels hull with rate of antifouling paint depletion is known then the appropriate af scheme could be applied 5 experiments for determiming polishing rate the drum test apparatus to obtain such a correlation between wall shear stress and the rate of antifouling paint depletion the drum test apparatus was devised designed manufactured and utilized ideally flow past a body to study the paint deterioration should have been simulated in an experimental set up by moving a flat plate or moving water around a stationary flat plate however such an experiment would require a towing tank or a water tunnel politis et al 2011 politis et al 2013 here the flow would be linear as in case of a ship more importantly any paint flow test is normally carried out over a long period of time and the experimental facility has to be occupied for this test only however the drum test apparatus utilized here is an easy to use low cost facility where the flow is turbulent and largely tangential to the drum and at any point it is linear without any circulation or vortex generation though there could be some curvature effects the sketch of the drum test apparatus is shown in fig 11 it essentially consists of two concentric cylinders the inner cylinder which is 250 mm in diameter rotates about a vertical shaft that is connected to a variable speed motor the outer cylinder is 600 mm in diameter and is stationary the gap within the inner and outer cylinders is filled with sea water plates coated with various antifouling paints are affixed on the inner cylinder and the inner cylinder is rotated at a known fixed speed for a predetermined time a total of six such plates can be attached to the central drum each of the steel plates were cleaned with thinner chlorinated rubber and dried then the surface of the plates was mechanically cleaned to visual standards of st3 for surface preparation after surface preparation plate was first brush coated with a primer of 50 μm two coats of anticorrosive paints of 150 μm each were applied then tie coat of 60 μm was applied and after 4 h of drying two antifouling coats of 100 μm each were finally applied the painting scheme was according to manufacturer s instruction artificial seawater was prepared by adding 3 5 g of crude salt per liter of tap water the drum was then rotated at the pre determined rpm for eight hours a day the paint film thickness was measured after regular intervals using an ultrasonic paint film thickness gauge the experiments were conducted in duplicate i e two plates of the same specifications and paint thickness were attached to the drum and the residual film thickness reported is the average of the measurements from the two plates the drum speeds reynolds number and wall shear stresses at which the experiments were conducted are listed below in table 1 although the maximum wall shear stresses on the vessel depicted in fig 10 are in the range of 40 50 pa the drum was intentionally run at speeds that correspond to shear stress that ranges between 679 8 and 1542 8 pa in order to obtain film thicknesses that are measurable within a reasonable time 6 results and discussions the results of paint film depletion versus time for various speeds of the drum are depicted in fig 12 a to c in fig 12a only two points were taken due to limitation of time whereas for fig 12 b and c three points were available in all cases the paint film depletion varies approximately linearly with time for a particular speed of rotation or shear stress which is a typical characteristic of a self polishing antifouling paint the wall shear stress for a particular speed on the drum has been estimated by cfd techniques by using commercially available software fluent ideally the provision of a torque meter attached to the shaft of the drum would provide a direct measurement and therefore a more accurate measurement of torque as such a meter could not be incorporated in this particular apparatus hence the wall shear stresses were estimated by cfd techniques the computed wall shear stress with the rate of af paint film depletion per day is plotted in fig 13 for three different af paints 7 optimum painting schemes the residual film thicknesses are to be predicted for a length of time that corresponds to a typical dry dock cycle of a commercial vessel which is approximately five years this period may vary for naval vessels and vessels operating in near shore areas such as coastguard vessels this correlation depends on a number of parameters that includes type of coating its formulation method of application backbone polymer additives etc thus by establishing the correlation between wall shear stresses and antifouling paint film depletion for a particular paint suitable painting schemes could be designed at regions of excessively high shear stresses and other niche areas to minimize the risk of antifouling paint failure and thereby increasing the risk of transmigration of invasive species a regression analysis for the three paints yielded a correlation of the form 1 y ax bx2 cx3 d where y paint film depletion hour where x wall shear stress pa the values of a b c and d are given in table 2 for the paints tested to obtain paint film depletion data with shear stresses for the vessel depicted in fig 3 it would take between three to five years using the present drum test apparatus therefore as mentioned earlier the drum test was run at speeds that correspond to much higher shear stresses and the results were extrapolated to very low values in the range of 10 50 pa so as to obtain the corresponding paint film depletions computed for the vessel using equation 1 this can be strictly justified since no experiments simulating exact operating conditions is possible it must however be mentioned that certain conclusions derived from the drum test data as stated below are valid for full scale also i the depletion rate is linear with time ii though the reynold s number is lower than that of ship it is in the turbulent region iii shear stress can be related to paint film depletion in a non linear manner as mentioned earlier the current practice of antifouling paints is to paint the underwater hull surface with a uniform coat of predetermined thickness the thickness of this coating is usually determined from experience by trial and error and approximate coating thicknesses for various vessels are indicated in table 3 this practice has a number of drawbacks which include premature depletion of af coating in niche areas where the wall shear stress is exceedingly high wastage of af paint introducing toxic entities in the aquatic environment much above than that what is required for af protection and cost of the additional quantity of paint that does not contribute to antifouling protection a correlation of the form of equation 1 which relates paint film depletion with wall shear stress would optimize the antifouling coat thickness at all locations on the vessels hull based on the wall shear stress at the corresponding locations a possible antifouling paint scheme based on wall shear stresses and computed from equation 1 for the three af paints is listed in table 4 8 conclusion a theoretical procedure has been suggested for determining wall shear stress on the underwater hull surface an actual photographic record of a tanker in dry dock after 5 years of sailing has been compared with the theoretical results the comparison indicates that the regions of high shear stress suffer from fast paint depletion which have not lasted for the 5 year period the results of the analysis show that paint 1 has the maximum polishing rates while in paint 3 the polishing action is minimum this implies that paint 3 could be coated for high speed high activity vessels such as ocean going vessels while paint 1 would be an option for low speed low activity vessels such as harbour crafts motor launches etc although the above paint schemes were a result of extrapolation to very low values from experimental data they nevertheless establish a procedure for the computation of af paint coating thickness throughout the underwater portion of the hull of the vessel such procedure could optimize the painting scheme that would not only reduce the costs of painting but would prevent excessive biocides from entering the aquatic terrestrial environment due to superfluous and unutilized toxic paints to improve the accuracy of the results the drum tests must be conducted at linear speeds that are close the actual speed of the vessel further various other hull forms must be investigated to identify zones of excessive wall shear stresses funding this work was supported by department of science technology government of india sanction order no sr s3 merc 033 2010 g dated

22988,recent advances in antifouling af paints in general prevent fouling in about 95 of the vessel s immersed surface however the remaining area which amounts to 5 or less of the total area does get fouled although this level of fouling has marginal impact on the routine performance of the vessel it is a predominant vector for the transmigration of invasive species which is now a serious environmental concern virtually all ocean going vessels are coated with antifouling paints predominant among them are self polishing coatings cfd analysis conducted on various types of vessels have indicated that there are certain hotspots where the polishing rates are exceedingly high and would polish the af paints at a much faster rate and ultimately result in the failure of the af coating a possible solution to this issue is to first identify these hotspots and suitable paint schemes formulations are to be applied in such areas an experimental procedure utilizing a drum test apparatus can be used to compute the coating thicknesses based on wall shear stresses such painting schemes would prevent the premature failure of the af coating in general and significantly reduce the risk of transmigration of invasive species in particular keywords antifouling self polishing coatings cfd invasive species painting schemes 1 introduction the commercial shipping industry primarily uses self polishing copolymer spc paints as anti fouling coatings these paints were introduced in the mid 1970s and in this class of paints the biocide is chemically bonded to a copolymer anderson 1993 hunter and cain 1996 ma et al 2017 the leaching rate of the biocide is highly controlled due to the fact that biocide is released when sea water reacts with the surface layer of the paint almeida et al 2007 the spc paints allow the application of thicker coatings with the biocide chemically bonded throughout the coating this results in the slow and uniform release of biocides to the surface hellio and yebra 2009 the biocide release for these coatings is only a few nanometres deep and the spent layer is slowly eroded away and a new active layer develops the popularity of these antifouling af coatings was primarily due to a controlled chemical dissolution of the paint film capable of long dry dock intervals typically between five to seven years predictable polishing enabling tailor made specifications by vessel operation thin leached layers making it easy to clean and recoat good weather ability quick drying and extremely good value for money yebra et al 2005 jones 2009 2 hydrodynamic forces at paint seawater interface the extent of polishing action in spc paints depend primarily on the hydrodynamic forces at the paint seawater interface the higher the hydrodynamic forces the higher are the polishing rates conversely lower hydrodynamic forces at the paint seawater interface imply lower polishing rates this implies that at locations where the hydrodynamic forces are high the polishing rates would be high and this could result in premature depletion of the antifouling coating also when the hydrodynamic forces are very low such as a ship standing in port waters low polishing action would result and this would lead to insufficient biocide release at the paint water interface kiil et al 2001 in both the preceding scenarios the paint film does not offer antifouling protection in the first case only when the paint is depleted which takes some time fouling takes place whereas in the second case fouling takes place almost immediately the practice of application of antifouling coating is that a uniform coating of a specified pre calculated thickness is applied on the underwater hull of the vessel taking in to account the average speed of the vessel its trading routes length of stay in port etc however shipbuilders owners etc do not account for the fact that there are non uniform polishing rates along the vessels hull in certain niche areas in the proximity of bow thrusters sea chest stern tube rudder shoulder water line etc that are prone to premature fouling camps et al 2014 these areas are less than five percent of the total underwater area of the vessel and therefore have negligible effect as far as the operational parameters of the vessel are concerned drake and lodge 2007 demirel et al 2014 although depletion of paints initiates corrosion a far more serious concern is that they are the primary vector for the transmigration of invasive species chan et al 2015 olivera and granhag 2016 now days some paint manufactures have started suggesting variable paint thickness across the hull surface the reasons for which are unknown invasive species also called as alien species or non native species are introduced in the marine environment by human activities threatens biological diversity and ecological integrity worldwide they can cause irreversible reduction in biodiversity by preying on or by competing or causing or carrying diseases or altering habitats of native species and threaten biodiversity by predation or competition they can also cause serious economic and ecological damage some can damage shorelines man made marine structures equipment and vessels the unep has declared that the invasive species are the most serious environmental issue only next to habitat loss many studies show that hull fouling is the primary vector for invasive species rainer 1995 coutts 1999 hewitt 2002 gollasch 2002 ashton et al 2007 coutts et al 2010 even the best maintained vessels are fouled to the extent of at least three percent of the hull area and are more than sufficient to cause the transmigration of alien species gollasch 2002 brine et al 2013 3 analysis of hydrodynamic forces at fluid hull interface a cfd analysis of hydrodynamic flow around the hull of a tanker and a 100 passenger vessel was carried out using fluent software simulation of flow around the hull has been performed by computational fluid dynamics cfd techniques using fluent the velocity profiles and wall shear stress distribution acting on the surface of the hull have been obtained based on cfd solutions the flow around the hull surface is governed by the incompressible form of the navier stokes equation a flow solution based on solution of the navier stokes equation using standard software available in the market has been attempted larsson and raven 2010 the reynolds averaged form of the above momentum equation including the turbulent shear stresses is given by t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g f where ρ is the fluid density v is the fluid velocity relative to the vessel ρ is the pressure τ is the shear stress g is the acceleration due to gravity f is any other external force term the ship was modeled from a lines plan of two existing ships lines plan was first drafted in autocad and it was exported tribon to model the 3 dimensional hull form the 3 d models of the ships are then taken as half the original volume and a flow volume was created and meshed in ansys software the flow volume is of a box shape and hull surface is inside the box to level of the draft and upper surfaces above waterline are trimmed fig 1 the details of the vessels for which the flow analysis was conducted are given below vessel 1 type tanker overall length 220 m maximum draft 12 m maximum speed 16 knots vessel 2 type 100 passenger vessel overall length 90 m maximum draft 3 m maximum speed 20 knots the boundary conditions used are schematically described below the fluid is assumed to enter the flow volume at an upstream boundary or inlet such that the ship appears stationary and the water flows past it the inlet boundary velocity is set to be a fixed value equal to the velocity of the ship but in the opposite direction the vessel s hull is set to be a wall with a no slip condition in order to reduce the size of the computational domain a symmetry plane is taken along the ship s centerline in cases for which the free surface effects are small or simply not of interest the water plane can also be assumed to be a wall with zero shear slip the top wall is therefore taken as a free surface with a prescribed zero shear stress the symmetry boundary condition for the scalar pressure and velocity components tangential to these boundaries is that their gradients normal to these boundaries are zero standard k model was

turbulence to overall dissipation rate s ε s k are the user defined source terms for turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate respectively figs 2 5 shows the computed wall shear stresses of a 200 m long tanker and figs 6 and 7 show the same stresses of a 100 passenger vessel in all cases the flow of water is from bow to stern i e from left to right in each of the figures depicted there is a marked variation in the wall shear stresses throughout the hull which depends on the speed the draft and the vessel shape it can be observed that higher shear stresses which could imply higher paint polishing rates are only underwater and the boot top region is not a critical area for af paint depletion it can also be observed that stresses are high at areas of sharp curvature of the hull surface such as bilges and shoulders where wall shear stress is also high speed is also a primary parameter in determining wall shear stress this is evident from figs 2 and 3 areas of the vessel that experience comparatively high hydrodynamic stresses and therefore higher polishing rates show indications of premature fouling the current painting practice is that an antifouling coating of uniform thickness is applied without taking into considerations of the various hydrodynamic stresses for both the tanker and the 100 passenger pax vessel the computed shear stresses at the waterline and the stern have lower than average hydrodynamic stresses which indicates low polishing rates the extent of which depends on the draft speed and type of vessel in these areas insufficient biocide delivery results which is likely to result in premature fouling on the other hand for the tanker in particular the shoulder of the vessel behind the bow experiences high wall stresses which result in higher polishing rates in comparison to the rest of the vessel this would lead to the premature depletion of the antifouling paint and would again result in fouling much ahead of the bulk of the surface of the vessel thus at low shear stress regions there could be insufficient delivery of biocides leading to premature or large fouling also in regions of high shear stress paint depletion is rapid leading to early initiation of fouling it is seen that both regions of high and low shear stress lead to fouling in case a full form ship like a tanker the regions of high shear stress can be identified as

applied at these regions to locate these niche areas hydrodynamic forces at the paint water interface are to be analyzed fig 8 depicts photographs of tanker on arrival at dry dock in the regular survey schedule and therefore after 5 years of last painting from these photographs it is evident that there is a marked depletion of af coating in certain areas of the tanker the fouled areas are illustrated in fig 9 for the entire length of the vessel the computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis shown in fig 10 corresponds approximately to the average operational speed and draft of tanker 1 which has a draft of 12 m and a speed of approximately 6 m per second in this figure wall shear stresses are high along the bottom of the vertical sides of the vessel with a small region forward and aft shoulders extending to the boottopping zone at the forward one third of the hull length although there could be many factors that may contribute to the excessive paint depletion which could

22989,heaving buoy convertor is one of the most common wave energy convertors wecs for its brief structure form and adaptability to wave directions in reality some heaving buoy convertors are designed to combine with other marine structures like floating platform seawall and offshore wind turbine in such cases the budget or the installation space may be a limitation for buoy s characteristics therefore the choices of dimension and mass are of great importance to capturing as much as possible energy under the limited condition however in the optimization of the buoys this study about the effects on the hydrodynamic performance and energy output by the relationship between section surface mass and draft is not sufficient this paper studies the optimization design of a conical bottomed heaving buoy converter with consideration of power take offs pto which are linear constant and quadratic non linear a 3d numerical wave tank nwt based on the rans equations and two phase vof model is established using cfd software flow 3d the numerical model is applied to deal with the buoy s movement under different ptos and is validated by the experimental data the movements of a conical bottomed heaving buoy with different mass and section surface are studied numerically which provide more information of the effects on the energy capture performance the conclusion of this paper gives a guidance to the buoy prototype optimization design under the certain wave conditions keywords numerical simulation conical bottomed heaving buoy convertor pto energy capture performance 1 introduction the needs of the clean and sustainable energy are increasing due to the limited resources of coal and oil and the environmental problems as well wave energy is one of the alternatives among the solutions over two hundred years numerous kinds of wecs have been invented to attain the goal falnes 2007 drew et al 2009 falcão 2010 the point absorber occupies a significant part and possesses many different structures for its flexibility and adaptability to the wave directions a bottom referenced heaving buoy is currently under development in sweden which is connected to a bottom fixed structure by wire another device the powerbuoy which was launched by the ocean power technologies opt adopts a two body floating structure and is fixed by slack mooring chain edwards and mekhiche 2014 to give higher put power ocean university of china proposed a heaving buoy system with four buoys it is more flexible and efficient under north china s wave condition comparing to other devices shi et al 2016 for the same purpose many experts even raise the concept of buoy array as a wave farm to capture wave energy more largely and efficiently vicente et al 2009 child and venugopal 2010 babarit et al 2015 however to enhance the capture efficiency in no form could the optimization be neglected physical model test is an effective method which is regarded as the direct way of such optimization capobianco et al 2002 studied eleven configurations of spar buoys with disks in the test basin to find the appropriate disk size and position of the gravity center while maximizing the relative motion with the buoy sarlak et al 2010 studied the performance of four different buoy shapes under different wave conditions in wave tank and believed that the horizontal cylinder is the most effective shape comparing with the vertical cylinder wedge and hemisphere by results of output power of each case ma 2013 studied the movement of cylinder buoys in different shapes by means of physical experiment and found that the velocity of the conical bottomed buoy exceeds the flat bottom buoy although the model test has a high reliability it costs much time when dealing with a mass of model sizes the development of computer programming greatly increases the efficiency in calculation with its help experts presented various heaving buoy optimization ideas and procedures with the approach of nonlinear programming clauss and birk 1996 proposed a procedure to evaluate and optimize the shape of offshore structures based on hydrodynamic analysis and gave four examples of different wave structures gilloteaux et al 2010 discussed the relationships between power output shape of heaving buoy and control method presenting an optimization procedure under random waves which suggested maximizing the heaving response by adjusting the shape and radius of the buoy goggins et al 2014 proposed a method to optimize the buoy s geometry that harvests the highest energy from its intended deployment site while demonstrated the results in the atlantic marine energy test site to achieve the tradeoff between multiple goals like efficiency cost and pto types some studies set their sights on the multi objective optimization of heaving buoy babarit et al 2005 took both maximum energy absorption and minimizing the device mass into consideration and optimized the device searve to resolve the conflict between power absorption and construction cost kurniawan and moan 2013 proposed a multi objective optimization strategy by genetic algorithm to optimize the geometry of a wave energy absorber paula et al 2015 studied the effects of pto constraints on the geometric optimization of heaving buoy whose results show that different control strategies lead to different optimal geometries but a tight pto force results in the geometries with smaller radius bigger draughts and longer resonant periods with the development of technology in numerical simulation more accurate results can be obtained in analyzing the hydrodynamic performance of different shaped heaving buoys vontorre et al 2004 determined the best draft of the buoy by testing the hydrodynamic performance of a bi cone shape buoy in the flume and under numerical simulation pastor et al 2014 also simulated the hydrodynamic performance between two buoy shapes with aqwa and got the conclusion that the conical buoy slightly outperforms the hemispherical one yeung et al 2011 took the fluid viscosity into consideration during the study of hydrodynamic characteristics of four heaving cylinders with different shapes and compared their differences in added mass damping coefficients and resonant frequency response sjökvist et al 2014 studied the relations between the buoy s velocity and its radius draft and pto damping in the frequency domain to improve the efficiency of wave device interaction three point absorbers with different geometry shapes cylinder bottom hemispherical bottom and 90 conical bottom were studied by jin and patton 2017 using physical experiment and computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations 2017 the results show that the streamlined geometry would significantly decrease the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficient and the buoy with 90 conical bottom performs the best in efficiency in the field of optimization this study is not sufficient when only considers portion of cross section mass and draft to estimate the hydrodynamic performance and energy output of a buoy some wave energy convertors are designed to combine with marine structures like floating platform seawall and offshore wind turbine muliawan et al 2012 gonzález et al 2013 bachynski and moan 2013 zhao et al 2017 in such cases the budget or the installation space may be a limitation cross section and mass therefore the choices of diameter and weight of the buoy may be of greatest importance to its possible energy absorption in this paper a conical bottom buoy with three types of pto which are linear constant and quadratic non linear are studied by using flow 3d the remainder of the paper is organized as followed section 2 builds a 3 d numerical wave tank nwt section 3 introduces the experimental test which validates the consistency of the 3 d nwt section 4 shows the performance of the buoy under linear and other types of ptos contents in 4 1 4 3 are studies using numerical simulation while for the constant pto study in 4 4 the experimental test section 5 gives an optimization example of heaving buoy based on a sea test prototype device section 6 draws conclusions of the paper figures out the method of optimization 2 numerical model set up 2 1 governing equations the 3 dimensional numerical wave tank is built with the commercial cfd software flow3d the unsteady incompressible flow field is described by the continuity equation together with navier stokes equation as follows u i x i 0 u i t u j u i x j x j μ μ t u i x j u j x i u i u j 1 ρ p x i where u i is the time averaged velocity component ρ is the fluid density μ is the kinetic viscosity and p is the fluid pressure μ t is the eddy viscosity and is defined as μ t c μ k 2 ε where k is the turbulence kinetic energy ε is the dissipation rate of k and c μ is a constant number u i u j represents the reynolds stresses the rng k ε model is applied to simulate the turbulent phenomenon a general moving object model in flow 3d is applied to simulate the buoy s motion the two phase interface is tracked accurately by the vof method 2 2 computational domain and boundary conditions the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 1 a 3 d numerical wave tank equipped with a pushboard wave maker and a slope type sponge layer is applied a model is placed more than three times of wavelength from the wave maker and more than eight times of wavelength from the sponge layer the two flanks of the nwt are set as symmetry boundaries at which zero gradient and zero velocity conditions are applied the grid resolution around the buoy is set as δx l 100 and δy h s 20 the initial time step is 0 001s and the minimum time step is 0 000001s which can ensure adequate temporal accuracy in the implicit solver 2 3 pto loading the movement of the heaving buoy was impeded by a vertical pto force which is applied on the center the types of the possible pto force are as follows 3 linear pto f p t o c 1 v 4 quadratic pto f p t o c 2 v v v 2 5 constant pto f p t o c 3 v v where v is the vertical velocity of heaving buoy and c 1 c 2 c 3 are the pto coefficients 3 model test a physical model test is conducted to validate the accuracy of the numerical wave tank and obtain the kinetic characteristic of the conical bottom heaving buoy under constant pto load 3 1 model set up the model test is executed at the shandong provincial key laboratory in ocean university of china the wave flume is 60 m in length 2 2 m in width and 1 0 m in water depth with the heaving buoy set at a distance of 15 m from the wave maker the incident waves are calibrated with a wave height gauge at the device s position when the wave flume is empty fig 2 shows the model device and its schematic diagram the buoy is attached to three vertical smooth steel shafts by three bearings to restrict its motion in heave direction the mass of buoy changes according to the weight blocks on it a constant pto loading is applied by a gear rack the lower end of which is vertically fixed in the center of the buoy and the upper end is connected with the input gear on the platform a unidirectional output gear box is set on the platform which converts the rotations of the input gear into one direction at which the weight tray is lifted as shown in fig 3 to apply the constant loading precisely all the weights are calibrated by adding weights in the tray till the buoy just stops falling a loading which balances the buoy is obtained in addition the draft of the buoy can be changed by adjusting the weight on the buoy 3 2 numerical results validation a comparison of the heaving amplitude h between experimental data and numerical simulation is shown in fig 4 the buoy s radius is set to 0 25 m which is the same as the experimental one the incident wave height hs and period t are set as 0 12 m and 1 81s respectively the mass of heaving buoy varies from 6 kg to 24 kg and the constant load was set as 10n the heave amplitude increases from 0 116 m to 0 12 m while the mass changes from 6 kg to 10 kg after that the heave amplitude h remains almost unchanged while the mass changes from 10 kg to 24 kg the numerical result shows high consistency with the experimental one which proves the accuracy of the nwt the time process of buoy s movement between the numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 5 the radius and the mass of the tested buoy are set as 0 25 m and 16 kg the wave condition and the weight loading are the same as the above it can be seen that the variation trend of numerical result agrees well with the experimental one and the relative error is less than 5 besides a pause can be observed clearly when the buoy reaches its trough it is a typical phenomenon under constant pto load 4 discussion and results 4 1 mass influence under a linear pto 4 1 1 regular wave condition the optimum mass range of the buoy under different linear pto loads is studied by simulation test to eliminate variables only one incident wave of which the height and period are 0 25 m and 1 75s is selected the buoy s motion is limited in heaving direction in which a linear pto force is applied f p t o c 1 v where v is the velocity of the buoy and c 1 is the pto load coefficient the test run series for various values of mass and c 1 are listed in table 1 and the radius r of the heaving buoy is 0 4m to describe the heave performance of heaving buoy the value of h hs is applied as shown in fig 6 it can be found that the resonance phenomenon happens when c 1 0 and c 1 250 n s m besides the resonance decreases with the c 1 increases the resonance phenomenon almost disappears when c 1 is above 1000 n s m an apparent peak stage can be found when resonance phenomenon disappears under pto load which implies that an optimum mass range in budget saving and hydrodynamic performance exists to describe the range accurately and take both mass and cross sectional area of the conical bottom heaving buoy into account a dimensionless variable α is defined as follows α h h c where h is the draft of the conical bottomed heaving buoy and h c is the height of the cone at the bottom see fig 7 fig 8 shows the result that the mass in fig 6 is replaced with α it can be found clearly that the magnitude of the pto force has a slight effect on the start of the peak stage which indicates that the optimum α range is relatively fixed with an invariant cross sectional area and α at the start of the peak stage is about 1 1 4 fig 9 shows the average output power p of the heaving buoy by α under the linear ptos the definition of p is written as follows p t t δ t c 1 v 2 d t δ t the peak stage phenomenon also occurs in p over the domain of α and its start point is about 1 1 4 which is close to fig 8 besides the maximum p at flat roof for c 1 1000 n s m is 64 and 34 larger than those for c 1 250 n s m and c 1 2000 n s m respectively indicating an optimum c 1 for maximum p really exists the components of the captured energy at the c 1 250 n s m is presented in fig 10 it can be found that the maximum p is only 30 4 of the total energy capture while the average kinetic energy occupies the most part nevertheless this average kinetic energy is hard to be utilized because the resonance intensity will change with the pto loading 4 1 2 irregular wave condition to validate the existence of optimum α in the real sea condition an irregular wave condition based on jonswap spectrum is adopted with mean wave height of 0 185m mean period of 2 27s while the significant wave height of 0 28m and significant wave period of 2 27s the test run series for various values of α are listed in table 2 and the radius r of the heaving buoy is also 0 4m the significant heaving amplitude hm and p under different α are showed in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively the peak stage phenomenon also exists and the optimum α for hm and p is about 1 1 4 too which show the consistency with the results in regular wave condition therefore the choice of mass should make α closed to the optimum α to save cost and attach best efficiency for designing a heaving buoy with a decided cross sectional area in addition under irregular wave condition with a price of five times mass and high risk to structure the maximum p in resonance is just 7 larger than the maximum p at c 1 1000 n s m the tradeoff between the two conditions is worth considering 4 2 cross sectional area under linear pto the hydrodynamic performance of heaving buoy is also effected by its cross sectional area s under a series of pto loadings let a be the cross sectional area in 3 1 a dimensionless variable β which is defined as the ratio of buoy diameter to wave length is used to describe the change of s the incident wave condition here is the same as in section 4 1 1 the test run series for various s are listed in table 3 fig 13 shows a comparison of the h h s among different linear pto loadings against the cross sectional coefficient β clearly the h h s increases with β but the rate of the increase approaches to 0 after certain points commonly it decreases with the pto loadings increase at each cross sectional area the comparison of the average output power p to β is presented in fig 14 it has the same trend as fig 13 however the maximum p happens at c 1 1500 n s m which is different this shows that there exists an optimal pto coefficient to maximize the average output power p at the given wave condition it is obvious that p bumps up with β in all pto loadings this proves that p increases with β increasing until the cross sectional area reaches a fixed bound the dimensionless variable α is also used into obtain the bound above fig 15 plots the variation of the h h s to α although it shows a declining trend there is an apparent turn point at α 0 8 to 1 which proves that there is a minimum cross sectional area that makes h h s high enough this phenomenon can be explained like that the conic section of heaving buoy wouldn t immerse into water completely when the cross sectional area is large enough at a constant mass at this condition the immersed conic section wouldn t change with the cross sectional area increasing as a result the influence on the motion of heaving buoy by the cross sectional area increasing would be slightly therefore the choice of cross sectional area should also make α be closed to the optimum α to save cost and attach best efficiency for designing a heaving buoy with a decided mass the results of the average output power p to α are presented in fig 16 and it also proves the above conclusion 4 3 mass and cross sectional area influence on the optimum α a series of heaving buoys with different mass and cross sectional area s under a fixed linear pto are simulated the test run series for various β and m are listed in table 4 the incident wave condition is same as in section 4 1 1 table 5 shows the heave amplitude of the buoy under different m and β the orange or yellow units represent the start of the flat roof stage the green units mean the overlap of the yellow and the orang ones with m and β increasing the orange units increasingly overlap with the yellow units and the overlap point is at β 0 189 and mass 50 kg table 6 shows the results that the oscillating amplitude in table 5 is replaced by α it can be found that the optimum α doesn t always overlap the optimum α decreases when the β increases inversely the optimum α increases when m increases the intersection of column and row happens at around β 20 and α is approximately 1 so there must be an optimum α for a heaving buoy with a definite mass or cross sectional area the intersection in table 6 can be used to determine the position of the optimum α for designing a heaving buoy 4 4 pto with optimum α in order to determine an optimum α different ptos of the heaving buoy are simulated the test run series for various m under quadratic non linear pto is listed in table 7 the radiuses of the buoy and the wave condition are the same as they are in 4 1 1 fig 17 shows h hs to α under different c 2 a peak stage can be clearly observed with the starting point that is the same as under the linear pto in 3 1 variable pto loadings have slightly influence on the optimum α the average output power p to α are presented in fig 18 it shows the same trend with that under linear pto the optimum α under constant pto is studied by the model test mentioned above the test run series for various values of m is listed in table 8 the h hs to α is presented in fig 19 it can be observed that there is also a peak stage while the starts that are not quite the same as all the others see fig 20 this is due to that the buoy can hardly heave when the constant pto loading exceeds its gravity that obviously reduces its peak stage therefore the choice of α under constant pto should be considered of the maximal adoptive pto loading 5 example of optimization an optimization example of heaving buoy by numerical simulation is given here with a 10 kw oscillating buoy array wave energy converter zhang et al 2018 the device is designed and built by ocean university of china and was tested in the sea area of zhaitang island qingdao china the average output efficiency from wave power to generated power is 18 2 the buoy s shape is the same with the above study the key point of this optimization is finding the optimum α by changing its mass the origin α of the buoy is 1 065 whose weight is 3t and radius is 1 6m the h hs to α is presented in fig 22 the incident wave height hs is set as 0 61m a linear pto is adopted and c 1 is set as 15000 n s m it shows that the heaving buoy performs the best under α 1 2 which is consistent with the conclusion in 4 1 see fig 21 the h hs and the average output power p of α 1 065 and α 1 200 under different linear pto loadings are presented in fig 23 and fig 24 respectively it can be seen that the buoy with the optimum α surpasses the origin one with the average increase percentage around 5 which proves the results of this study 6 conclusions a 3d numerical wave model was established by flow3d to research the influence on the energy capture performance of a conical bottomed heaving buoy by its mass and cross sectional area under different pto types to validate the consistency of the numerical wave tank an experimental test was carried in the laboratory of the ocean university of china through the numerical analysis and experimental test several conclusions were drawn for optimization design of the conical bottomed heaving buoy convertor besides an optimization example of heaving buoy is given based on a sea test prototype device 1 under linear pto the heaving amplitude and average output power of conical bottomed heaving buoy firstly increases rapidly and then decreases slowly with the coefficient α increasing while the cross sectional area is constant there is an apparent peak stage in this process and the pto load changing show little influence on it while α at the start of the flat roof is the optimum α and it is around 1 1 5 in this study 2 under linear pto the heaving amplitude and average output power increasing with the coefficient α decreasing and a constant mass until they attach a bound and keep constant in such condition α at the start of the bound is the optimum α as a result the choice of cross sectional area should also make α be close to the optimum α to save cost and attach best efficiency for designing a heaving buoy 3 there is an optimum α to for a heaving buoy with a decided mass or cross sectional area but the optimum α would changes with the decided property changing to determine the position of the optimum α for designing a heaving buoy the intersection of the optimum α under the two conditions the decided mass or the decided cross sectional area can be used 4 the influence of mass and cross sectional area on conical bottomed heaving buoy is also effected by pto type the quadratic pto shows a same effect with linear pto while the constant pto shows different when the constant pto load exceed buoy s gravity this study provided information of the effects on the motion and energy capture performance of a heaving buoy wave energy convertor with different inherent characteristics and pto types which may be helpful for the design of heaving buoy in limited conditions at the optimum α the buoy heaves better and cost less but the position of the optimum α would changes with different inherent characteristics and pto types in the future a research to determine the position of α precisely can be conducted based on buoy s inherent characteristics pto loads and wave conditions acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the

22989,heaving buoy convertor is one of the most common wave energy convertors wecs for its brief structure form and adaptability to wave directions in reality some heaving buoy convertors are designed to combine with other marine structures like floating platform seawall and offshore wind turbine in such cases the budget or the installation space may be a limitation for buoy s characteristics therefore the choices of dimension and mass are of great importance to capturing as much as possible energy under the limited condition however in the optimization of the buoys this study about the effects on the hydrodynamic performance and energy output by the relationship between section surface mass and draft is not sufficient this paper studies the optimization design of a conical bottomed heaving buoy converter with consideration of power take offs pto which are linear constant and quadratic non linear a 3d numerical wave tank nwt based on the rans equations and two phase vof model is established using cfd software flow 3d the numerical model is applied to deal with the buoy s movement under different ptos and is validated by the experimental data the movements of a conical bottomed heaving buoy with different mass and section surface are studied numerically which provide more information of the effects on the energy capture performance the conclusion of this paper gives

mekhiche 2014 to give higher put power ocean university of china proposed a heaving buoy system with four buoys it is more flexible and efficient under north china s wave condition comparing to other

2010 babarit et al 2015 however to enhance the capture efficiency in no form could the optimization be neglected physical model test is an effective method which is regarded as the direct way of such optimization capobianco et al 2002 studied eleven configurations of spar buoys with disks in the test basin to find the appropriate disk size and position of the gravity center while maximizing the relative motion with the buoy sarlak et al 2010 studied the performance of four different buoy shapes under different wave conditions in wave tank and believed that the horizontal cylinder is the most effective shape comparing with the vertical cylinder wedge and hemisphere by results of output power of each case ma 2013 studied the movement of cylinder buoys in different shapes by means of physical experiment and found that the velocity of the conical bottomed buoy exceeds the flat bottom buoy although the model test has a high reliability it costs much time when dealing with a mass of model sizes the development of computer programming greatly increases the efficiency in calculation with its help experts presented various heaving buoy optimization ideas and procedures with the approach of nonlinear programming clauss and birk 1996 proposed a procedure to evaluate and optimize the shape of offshore structures based on hydrodynamic analysis and gave four examples of different

absorber paula et al 2015 studied the effects of pto constraints on the geometric optimization of heaving buoy whose results show that different control strategies lead to different optimal geometries but a tight pto force results in the geometries with smaller radius bigger draughts and longer resonant periods with the development of technology in numerical simulation more accurate results can be obtained in analyzing the hydrodynamic performance of different shaped heaving buoys vontorre et al 2004 determined the best draft of the buoy by testing the hydrodynamic performance of a bi cone

were studied by jin and patton 2017 using physical experiment and computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations 2017 the results show that the streamlined geometry would significantly decrease the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficient and the buoy with 90 conical bottom performs the best in efficiency in the field of optimization this study is not sufficient when only considers portion of cross section mass and draft to estimate the hydrodynamic performance and energy output of a buoy some wave energy convertors are designed to combine with marine structures like floating platform seawall and offshore wind turbine muliawan et al 2012 gonzález et al 2013 bachynski and moan 2013 zhao et al 2017 in such cases the budget or the installation space may be a limitation cross section and mass therefore the choices of diameter and weight of the buoy may be of greatest importance to its possible energy absorption in this paper a conical bottom buoy with three types of pto which are

kinetic energy ε is the dissipation rate of k and c μ is a constant number u i u j represents the reynolds stresses the rng k ε model is applied to simulate the turbulent phenomenon a general moving object model in flow 3d is applied to simulate the buoy s motion the two phase interface is tracked accurately by the vof method 2 2 computational domain and boundary conditions the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 1 a 3 d numerical wave tank equipped with a pushboard wave maker and a slope type sponge layer is applied a model is placed more than three times of wavelength from the wave maker and more than eight times of wavelength from the sponge layer the two flanks of the nwt are set as symmetry boundaries at which zero gradient and zero velocity conditions are applied the grid resolution around the buoy is set as δx l 100 and δy h s 20 the initial time step is 0 001s and the minimum time step is 0 000001s which can ensure adequate temporal accuracy in the implicit solver 2 3 pto loading the movement of the heaving buoy was impeded by a vertical pto force which is applied on the center the types of the possible pto force are as follows 3 linear pto f p t o c 1 v 4 quadratic pto f p t o c 2 v v v 2 5 constant pto f p t o c 3 v v where v is the vertical velocity of heaving buoy and c 1 c 2 c 3 are the pto coefficients 3 model test a physical model test is conducted to validate the accuracy of the numerical wave tank and obtain the kinetic characteristic of the conical bottom heaving buoy under constant pto load 3 1 model set up the model test is executed at the shandong provincial key laboratory in ocean university of china the wave flume is 60 m in length 2 2 m in width and 1 0 m in water depth with the heaving buoy set at a distance of 15 m from the wave maker the incident waves are calibrated with a wave height gauge at the device s position when the wave flume is empty fig 2 shows the model device and its schematic diagram the buoy is attached to three vertical smooth steel shafts by three bearings to restrict its motion in heave direction the mass of buoy changes according to the weight blocks on it a constant pto loading is applied by a gear rack the lower end of which is vertically fixed in the center of the buoy and the upper end is connected with the input gear on the platform a unidirectional output gear box is set on the platform which converts the rotations of the input gear into one direction at which the weight tray is lifted as shown in fig 3 to apply the constant loading precisely all the weights are calibrated by adding weights in the tray till the buoy just stops falling a loading which balances the buoy is obtained in addition the draft of the buoy can be changed by adjusting the weight on the buoy 3 2 numerical results validation a comparison of the heaving amplitude h between experimental data and numerical simulation is shown in fig 4 the buoy s radius is set to 0 25 m which is the same as the experimental one the incident wave height hs and period t are set as 0 12 m and 1 81s respectively the mass of heaving buoy varies from 6 kg to 24 kg and the constant load was set as 10n the heave amplitude increases from 0 116 m to 0 12 m while the mass changes from 6 kg to 10 kg after that the heave amplitude h remains almost unchanged while the mass changes from 10 kg to 24 kg the numerical result shows high consistency with the experimental one which proves the accuracy of the nwt the time process of buoy s movement between the numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 5 the radius and the mass of the tested buoy are set as 0 25 m and 16 kg the wave condition and the weight loading are the same as the above it can be seen that the variation trend of numerical result agrees well with the experimental one and the relative error is less than 5 besides a pause can be observed clearly when the buoy reaches its trough it is a typical phenomenon under constant pto load 4 discussion and results 4 1 mass influence under a linear pto 4 1 1 regular wave condition the optimum mass range of the buoy under different linear pto loads is studied by simulation test to eliminate variables only one incident wave of which the height and period are 0 25 m and 1 75s is selected the buoy s motion is limited in heaving direction in which a linear pto force is applied f p t o c 1 v where v is the velocity of the buoy and c 1 is the pto load coefficient the test run series for various values of mass and c 1 are listed in table 1 and the radius r of the heaving buoy is 0 4m to describe the heave performance of heaving buoy the value of h hs is applied as shown in fig 6 it can be found that the resonance phenomenon happens when c 1 0 and c 1 250 n s m besides the resonance decreases with the c 1 increases the resonance phenomenon almost disappears when c 1 is above 1000 n s m an apparent peak stage can be found when resonance phenomenon disappears under pto load which implies that an optimum mass range in budget saving and hydrodynamic performance exists to describe the range accurately and take both mass and cross sectional area of the conical bottom heaving buoy into account a dimensionless variable α is defined as follows α h h c where h is the draft of the conical bottomed heaving buoy and h c is the height of the cone at the bottom see fig 7 fig 8 shows the result that the mass in fig 6 is replaced with α it can be found clearly that the magnitude of the pto force has a slight effect on the start of the peak stage which indicates that the optimum α range is relatively fixed with an invariant cross sectional area and α at the start of the peak stage is about 1 1 4 fig 9 shows the average output power p of the heaving buoy by α under the linear ptos the definition of p is written as follows p t t δ t c 1 v 2 d t δ t the peak stage phenomenon also occurs in p over the domain of α and its start point is about 1 1 4 which is close to fig 8 besides the maximum p at flat roof for c 1 1000 n s m is 64 and 34 larger than those for c 1 250 n s m and c 1 2000 n s m respectively indicating an optimum c 1 for maximum p really exists the components of the captured energy at the c 1 250 n s m is presented in fig 10 it can be found that the maximum p is only 30 4 of the total energy capture while the average kinetic energy occupies the most part nevertheless this average kinetic energy is hard to be utilized because the resonance intensity will change with the pto loading 4 1 2 irregular wave condition to validate the existence of optimum α in the real sea condition an irregular wave condition based on jonswap spectrum is adopted with mean wave height of 0 185m mean period of 2 27s while the significant wave height of 0 28m and significant wave period of 2 27s the test run series for various values of α are listed in table 2 and the radius r of the heaving buoy is also 0 4m the significant heaving amplitude hm and p under different α are showed in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively the peak stage phenomenon also exists and the optimum α for hm and p is about 1 1 4 too which show the consistency with the results in regular wave condition therefore the choice of mass should make α closed to the optimum α to save cost and attach best efficiency for designing a heaving buoy with a decided cross sectional area in addition under irregular wave condition with a price of five times mass and high risk to structure the maximum p in resonance is just 7 larger than the maximum p at c 1 1000 n s m the tradeoff between the two conditions is worth considering 4 2 cross sectional area under linear pto the hydrodynamic performance of heaving buoy is also effected by its cross sectional area s under a series of pto loadings let a be the cross sectional area in 3 1 a dimensionless variable β which is defined as the ratio of buoy diameter to wave length is used to describe the change of s the incident wave condition here is the same as in section 4 1 1 the test run series for various s are listed in table 3 fig 13 shows a comparison of the h h s among different linear pto loadings against the cross sectional coefficient β clearly the h h s increases with β but the rate of the increase approaches to 0 after certain points commonly it decreases with the pto loadings increase at each cross sectional area the comparison of the average output power p to β is presented in fig 14 it has the same trend as fig 13 however the maximum p happens at c 1 1500 n s m which is different this shows that there exists an optimal pto coefficient to maximize the average output power p at the given wave condition it is obvious that p bumps up with β in all pto loadings this proves that p increases with β increasing until the cross sectional area reaches a fixed bound the dimensionless variable α is also used into obtain the bound above fig 15 plots the variation of the h h s to α although it shows a declining trend there is an apparent turn point at α 0 8 to 1 which proves that there is a minimum cross sectional area that makes h h s high enough this phenomenon can be explained like that the conic section of heaving buoy wouldn t immerse into water completely when the cross sectional area is large enough at a constant mass at this condition the immersed conic section wouldn t change with the cross sectional area increasing as a result the influence on the motion of heaving buoy by the cross sectional area increasing would be slightly therefore the choice of cross sectional area should also make α be closed to the optimum α to save cost and attach best efficiency for designing a heaving buoy with a decided mass the results of the average output power p to α are presented in fig 16 and it also proves the above conclusion 4 3 mass and cross sectional area influence on the optimum α a series of heaving buoys with different mass and cross sectional area s under a fixed linear pto are simulated the test run series for various β and m are listed in table 4 the incident wave condition is same as in section 4 1 1 table 5 shows the heave amplitude of the buoy under different m and β the orange or yellow units represent the start of the flat roof stage the green units mean the overlap of the yellow and the orang ones with m and β increasing the orange units increasingly overlap with the yellow units and the overlap point is at β 0 189 and mass 50 kg table 6 shows the results that the oscillating amplitude in table 5 is replaced by α it can be found that the optimum α doesn t always overlap the optimum α decreases when the β increases inversely the optimum α increases when m increases the intersection of column and row happens at around β 20 and α is approximately 1 so there must be an optimum α for a heaving buoy with a definite mass or cross sectional area the intersection in table 6 can be used to determine the position of the optimum α for designing a heaving buoy 4 4 pto with optimum α in order to determine an optimum α different ptos of the heaving buoy are simulated the test run series for various m under quadratic non linear pto is listed in table 7 the radiuses of the buoy and the wave condition are the same as they are in 4 1 1 fig 17 shows h hs to α under different c 2 a peak stage can be clearly observed with the starting point that is the same as under the linear pto in 3 1 variable pto loadings have slightly influence on the optimum α the average output power p to α are presented in fig 18 it shows the same trend with that under linear pto the optimum α under constant pto is studied by the model test mentioned above the test run series for various values of m is listed in table 8 the h hs to α is presented in fig 19 it can be observed that there is also a peak stage while the starts that are not quite the same as all the others see fig 20 this is due to that the buoy can hardly heave when the constant pto loading exceeds its gravity that obviously reduces its peak stage therefore the choice of α under constant pto should be considered of the maximal adoptive pto loading 5 example of optimization an optimization example of heaving buoy by numerical simulation is given here with a 10 kw oscillating buoy array wave energy converter zhang et al 2018 the device is designed and built by ocean university of china and was tested in the sea area of zhaitang island qingdao china the average output efficiency from wave power to generated power is 18 2 the buoy s shape is the same with the above study the key point of this optimization is finding the optimum α by changing its mass the origin α of the buoy is 1 065 whose weight is 3t and radius is 1 6m the h hs to α is presented in fig 22 the incident wave height hs is set as 0 61m a linear pto is adopted and c 1 is set as 15000 n s m it shows that the heaving buoy performs the best under α 1 2 which is consistent with the conclusion in 4 1 see fig 21 the h hs and the average output power p of α 1 065 and α 1 200 under different linear pto loadings are presented in fig 23 and fig 24 respectively it can be seen that the buoy with the optimum α surpasses the origin one with the average increase percentage around 5 which proves the results of this study 6 conclusions a 3d numerical wave model was established by flow3d to research the influence on the energy capture performance of a conical bottomed heaving buoy by its mass and cross sectional area under different pto types to validate the consistency of the numerical wave tank an experimental test was carried in the laboratory of the ocean university of china through the numerical analysis and experimental test several conclusions were drawn for optimization design of the conical bottomed heaving buoy convertor besides an optimization example of heaving buoy is given based on a sea test prototype device 1 under linear pto the heaving amplitude and average output power of conical bottomed heaving buoy firstly increases rapidly and then decreases slowly with the coefficient α increasing while the cross sectional area is constant there is an apparent peak stage in this process and the pto load changing show little influence on it while α at the start of the flat roof is the optimum α and it is around 1 1 5 in this study 2 under linear pto the heaving amplitude and average output power increasing with the coefficient α decreasing and a constant mass until they attach a bound and keep constant in such condition α at the start of the bound is the optimum α as a result the choice of cross sectional area should also make α be close to the optimum α to save cost and attach best efficiency for designing a heaving buoy 3 there is an optimum α to for a heaving buoy with a decided mass or cross sectional area but the optimum α would changes with the decided property changing to determine the position of the optimum α for designing a heaving buoy the intersection of the optimum α under the two conditions the decided mass or the decided cross sectional area can be used 4 the influence of mass and cross sectional area on conical bottomed heaving buoy is also effected by pto type the quadratic pto shows a same effect with linear pto while the constant pto shows different when the constant pto load exceed buoy s gravity this study provided information of the effects on the motion and energy capture performance of a heaving buoy wave energy convertor with different inherent characteristics and pto types which may be helpful for the design of heaving buoy in limited conditions at the optimum α the buoy heaves better and cost less but the position of the optimum α would changes with different inherent characteristics and pto types in the future a research to determine the position of α precisely can be conducted based on buoy s inherent characteristics pto loads and wave conditions acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the
