8880,groundwater resources strongly support crop water requirement and economic yield improvement in semi arid and arid areas water resources management require more investigation in the response of evapotranspiration et partitioning and water use efficiency to groundwater change observational data collected over a three year period including water and carbon flux vegetable sap flow meteorological factors soil water content and groundwater depth were employed in this study additionally an improved shuttleworth wallace model was used for partitioning plant transpiration and bare soil evaporation e in a sunflower cropland with shallow groundwater the et of the sunflower was founded to be 353 5 15 0 mm and approximately 48 3 7 4 derived from the groundwater evaporation e amounted approximately 145 6 6 1 mm over the growth season and around 47 2 of which was lost during the seeding stage furthermore its dynamics depended on crop growth and groundwater table depth wtd these large amounts of non productive soil e had a negative impact on the water carbon coupling the presence of e had resulted in a lower ecosystem water use efficiency wuee measured at 1 02 0 33 g c kg 1 h2o compared to canopy water use efficiency wuec of 1 68 0 41 g c kg 1 h2o these results demonstrated that regulating wtd could improve wuee by increasing wuec and reducing soil e to achieve the higher wuee an optimum wtd was range of 1 5 2 0 m for border irrigated sunflower field grown on sandy loam identified by an analysis of normalized evaporation difference at the varying wtd this finding highlights the significance of maintaining specified wtd providing valuable insights into the complex interplay between crop evapotranspiration components and shallow groundwater moreover it offers guidance for precision agriculture irrigation practices keywords evapotranspiration and partitioning shallow groundwater water use efficiency shuttleworth wallace model optimum wtd data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction shallow groundwater plays an important role in supporting vegetation water use and maintaining ecological environment in arid and semi arid regions shallow groundwater influences 22 32 of global land area including similar to 15 as groundwater fed surface water features and 7 17 with the water table or its capillary fringe within plant rooting depths fan et al 2013 within agriculture ecosystems previous studies indicated that groundwater strongly supports crop water requirement and yield improvement ramos et al 2017 lowry et al 2011 huo et al 2012 wang et al 2018 du et al 2021 but may enhanced concurrently secondary soil salinization li et al 2023 traditionally maintaining a shallow groundwater table wtd serves as a safety measure buffer against the unreliability irrigation water and extreme weather rong et al 2023 as climate change exacerbates droughts and other extreme events wang et al 2023 groundwater will become increasingly important as a dependable water source however shallow groundwater can induce excess evapotranspiration thereby negatively affecting the farmland s water use efficiency undoubtedly such additional water loss exacerbates the risks and production costs caused by water scarcity and reduces agricultural productivity therefore the significance of elucidating hydrological processes to enhance water use efficiency wue for promoting sustainable development of agriculture cannot be overstated in arid and semi arid regions evapotranspiration et is inherently associated with water energy and carbon cycles two separate processes together constitute the et flux namely physical evaporation e and biological transpiration t which respond differently to changes in surface meteorological conditions water status and vegetation abundance zhang et al 2016 t being linked to plant photosynthesis and productivity is considered as an effective water use lawrence et al 2007 however e is generally regarded as an non productive consumption and is a major cause of water resource waste or low wue agricultural water saving strategies should prioritize reducing soil e thus increasing water availability specifically in regions with shallow groundwater in arid and semi arid environments where a strong connection between et and groundwater is commonly observed chen et al 2016 gao et al 2018 liu et al 2016 groundwater evaporation etg is typically expected to increase with the rising wtd and is influenced by factors such as irrigation rainfall or vegetation karimov et al 2014 recent studies have reported etg to total et contribution ratios varying from 16 3 to 97 2 dubois et al 2021 eltarabily et al 2020 ryken et al 2022 wang et al 2020 in fact groundwater exchange is challenging to measure directly although weighing and static water table lysimeters can provide accurate measurements of crop groundwater relations they are expensive and laborious the soil water balance method may be the better choice rushton et al 2006 chen et al 2018 found that the water supplied from groundwater increased from 5 to 15 during the period of water saving irrigation forkutsa et al 2009 showed that groundwater contributed a substantial share up to 399 mm to actual et of cotton estimated at 488 727 mm the research on groundwater contribution gwc reveals the importance of groundwater in terrestrial ecosystems however it is not clear how much of the gwc is invalid for crop growth raising questions about the dependence of et on shallow groundwater obviously further accurate estimation of et components is the foundation of sustainable water resources management with shallow groundwater especially in agricultural areas to evaluate the validity of et it is essential to partition of e and t in recent years various approaches are developed to improve our knowledge of et partitioning including measuring and modeling methods a methodology to directly partition t and e from eddy covariance ec measurements and turbulence theory has been recently presented scanlon and kustas 2010 but it is difficult in parameterizing wue zhou et al 2016 moreover isotope measurements have been introduced for et partitioning and have demonstrated great potential maxwell et al 2015 evaristo et al 2016 but application is highly limited by its cost laborious and with low time resolution sap flow chambers micro lysimeters and soil chambers are widely applied for t and e direct measurement green et al 2003 domec et al 2012 a meta analysis of field observations suggests that t et should approximately be 61 15 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 modeling research has provided additional insights into the quantification of e and t partitioning such as the shuttleworth wallace s w model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 soil water energy and transpiration sweat model daamen and simmonds 1996 and the simdualkc model rosa et al 2016 the simdualkc model was used to successfully simulate the partition of maize et into its components liu et al 2021 following the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 2005 previous studies have shown that s w model had contributed valuable information to in et partitioning among different vegetation types kool et al 2014 gharsallah et al 2013 lund and soegaard 2003 s w model can illustrate the most reliable estimate in both the magnitude and the across site variability of t et and mean annual t et was 0 61 0 14 at global fluxnet sites cao et al 2022 in a swiss cropland with winter cereals paul limoges et al 2022 observed that the t et ratio with an average of 0 725 exhibited similar seasonal dynamics across two crop seasons aouade et al 2016 found that average t et was 0 83 in an irrigated winter wheat field however validity of et heavenly depend on local meteorological and hydrological conditions especially groundwater depth to our best knowledge understanding the impact of shallow groundwater to validity of actual et is still not enough thus with three years of detailed site specific monitoring including water and carbon flux vegetable sap flow meteorological factors soil moisture and groundwater depth we try to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the impact of et validity on wue in arid areas with shallow groundwater farmland here the following objectives were defined 1 partition non productive e and t and clarify their dynamics throughout crop growth season 2 examine the impact of groundwater on wue 3 determine the optimum wtd to enhance wue the structural framework of this study is depicted in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation of comprehensive farmland hydrology the research was conducted at the hetao irrigation district which is a typical arid and semi arid irrigated agricultural area in the northwest of china the study site is situated in a typical arid continental monsoon climate characterized by an annual average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration of around 170 mm and 2300 mm respectively the mean annual temperature is 8 9 the hetao irrigation district covers an area of about 1 12 million hectares with a flat topography that gradually slopes from west to east dropping from about 1200 m to 1000 m sunflower maize and wheat are the primary crops grown in the area to support vegetation growth in this arid region irrigation water sourced from the yellow river is the primary water sources the utilization of approximately 5 billion cubic meters of yellow river water for field irrigation annually has resulted in a shallow groundwater table over the years although the shallow groundwater supports the agricultural production it is considered commonly that partly evapotranspiration is invalid to corp growth dai et al 2022 liu et al 2022a comprehensive farmland hydrological observation was carried out at the heji experimental station 40 43 n 107 16 e altitude 1 038 m located on the south edge of hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china fig 2 the crops we studied was sunflower helianthus annuus l which were planted in rows with a spacing of 0 80 m between rows the plant density for sunflower was 26 000 plants per hectare the sunflower field enclosed by the yellow solid line was the experimental monitoring site of eddy covariance system fig 2c the total area of sunflower was more than 10 ha wind speed in this area from june to september was statistically analyzed over several years and the main wind direction was found to be northeast other measuring instruments are also installed around the eddy covariance tower throughout the sunflower growing season the experimental field utilizes border irrigation only once a year through channel water diversion typically performed in early july each irrigation event involves the water application of approximately 90 mm soil physical properties such as field capacity θ fc and bulk density γ d were obtained from laboratory experiments with the 100 cm3 cutting rings soil physical properties at different depths was analyzed by laser grain size analyzer the soil in the 1 m soil layer is predominantly silt loam with slightly higher sand content in 0 30 cm layer detailed soil characteristics at different depths of the experimental site are included in table 1 2 2 measurements and data processing 2 2 1 flux and hydrological and meteorological measurements water and carbon fluxes were measured using an open path eddy covariance ec system which integrates an infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa and 3 d sonic anemometer gill solent instrument uk the ec system was operated at an altitude of 1 5 m above the canopy height and adjusted once during the growth period and the 30 min average flux data were recorded and stored by an automatic data logger cr3000 campbell scientific usa the distance between the measurement source area with a 90 contribution rate and the observation site was approximately 116 2 m with the point having the largest contribution rate being about 18 96 m away kljun et al 2002 kormann and meixner 2001 the field length in the main wind and wave area was approximately 400 m which met the measurement requirements the energy closure in our study was 0 75 0 81 and 0 78 for three consecutive years to achieve energy budget closure using 30 minute data the principle of bowen ratio preservation of energy was adopted meteorological observations include air temperature and relative humidity hmp155a vaisala inc fi net radiation cnr4 kipp zonen inc ned soil heat flux hfp01 hukseflux inc ned soil temperature and moisture content 5 cm depth cs616 campbell scientific inc usa wind speed and atmospheric pressure these data were automatically logged every 30 min using a digital data logger cr1000 campbell scientific usa the precipitation at half hour intervals was obtained from standard weather station observations at heji experimental station two sets of hydro probes stevens inc usa were embedded in five soil layers 10 20 40 60 80 cm depth to observe soil moisture content during the growth period the researchers used soil drill to take soil at the corresponding depth every ten days measured the soil moisture content by the oven drying method and calibrated the data measured by the hydra probe a 6 0 m deep groundwater observation well was installed near ec tower and two hobo u20 onset computer corp usa sensors were installed inside the well to record groundwater dynamics every 30 min the wtd was manually measured and calibrated every 10 days 2 2 2 sunflower sap flow measurements employing the energy balance principle we ascertained sunflower sap velocity sv g h 1 by detecting the heat generated during water transport during plant growth the vast majority more than 95 of the sap flow was directly consumed by transpiration thus the method was widely employed to transpiration measurement of various types of vegetation from trees eliades et al 2018 shrubs hayat et al 2021 to crops venturin et al 2020 to ensure a higher level of accuracy in measuring field transpiration we conducted measurements on approximately 30 sunflowers within the monitoring field including their height stem diameter and leaf area prior to selecting the plants for monitoring then 4 representative plants were selected and wrapped sensors sgb dynamax inc usa were installed near the base of sunflower stems this method of measurement allows for continuous and non invasive monitoring of plants transpiration while the selection of representative plants ensures that the obtained data is accurate and representative of the entire field the sensors were wrapped by sponges and aluminum membrane to isolate it from rainfall dew wind and radiation etc sv was recorded once every 30 min by flow32 1 k system dynamax inc usa total sap flow sf mm d 1 was obtained by summing the product of average hourly sv g h 1 and hours then dividing by water density 1 g cm 3 and sunflower planting density 2 6 plant m 2 daily sunflower transpiration t mm d 1 was calculated by converting total sap flow per day 2 2 3 vegetation monitoring and field management within the ec system coverage area three vegetation quadrats were established to gather average vegetation parameters representative plants were carefully selected for labeling and precise determination regular surveys were conducted every 10 days to measure various aspects including canopy height leaf width leaf area index lai and dry matter yield the height and leaf width of sunflowers were manually measured using a meter ruler while lai was determined using a portable leaf area meter field management data such as fertilization planting irrigation growth period duration and harvest date were collected through comprehensive field surveys 2 3 et partition based on shuttleworth wallace model 2 3 1 shuttleworth wallace model the shuttleworth wallace s w model was widely used to estimate evapotranspiration from the sparsely vegetated underlying surface the sw model was developed from the penman monteith p m model which followed hypothesis of uniform distribution of the underlying surface sw model regarded plant canopy and soil surface as two separates but interacting sources of water vapor making it a dual source model the specific calculation method for the model is described in detailed in shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and allen et al 1998 the basic equations of the s w model are shown in eqs 1 4 1 λ et λ e λ t c s p m s c c pm c 2 p m s δ a t ρ c p d δ r a s a t a s r a a r a s δ γ 1 r

evaluated its performance in producing reasonable et and et dynamics but further analysis was needed to verify the simulation of sunflower transpiration at the same time although the dynamic change of t was observed with sap flow meter we could not obtain complete data for the entire growth period due to factors such as stem thickness weather and instrument maintenance therefore we utilized two methods to calculate plant transpiration based on the model simulation results eqs 8 9 specifically express method i and method ii respectively 8 t λ t λ λ c c pm c λ 9 t λ t λ et et mea c c pm c c s

assessment the models were calibrated with data from 2019 and 2020 and were then verified using data from 2021 evaluation of the performance of the models with four statistical parameters relies on

crops the average rate of etg in mm d 1 is determined in the water balance method by noting the change in soil water content over time this study using the soil water balance swb methods to determine the etg based on measurements that adequately represent all the important physical processes eq 14 represents the swb model used to calculate etg 14 et g et a p i r dp swc where etg is groundwater

ecosystem exchange nee were recorded and calculated by the ec system to assess the impact of invaild soil evaporation we introduced two scales of ecosystem water use efficiency wue expressed as ecosystem wuee and canopy wuec levels the specific expressions of wuee and canopy wuec are shown in eqs 15 16 the daily wuee g c kg 1h2o was defined as the ratio of net ecosystem productivity nep g c m 2 d 1 nep nee to evapotranspiration et kg h2o m 2 d 1 describing the amount of net carbon assimilated per unit of water loss at the ecosystem scale the daily wuec was defined as the ratio of nep to transpiration t kg h2o m 2 d 1 indicating the amount of carbon gained per unit of plant transpiration 15 wu e e nep et nee et 16 wu e c nep t nee t 3 results 3 1 hydrological and meteorological conditions the seasonal variations of hydrological and meteorological factors including precipitation p irrigation i net radiation rn vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature ta soil water content swc and groundwater table depth wtd in the growth period from 2019 to 2021 are shown in fig 3 the p are 28 8 99 4 30 2 mm during the three growing seasons with an average of 52 8 mm it is important to note that both 2019 and 2021 were particularly dry years with precipitation levels significantly below the average annual crop water requirements the irrigation adopted the method of border irrigation which was only carried out in the sunflower seedling stages and the irrigation was roughly 90 mm at a time sparse rainfall has resulted in abundant solar thermal resources and relatively dry atmosphere in the arid region the rn varied between 58 6 w m 2 september 12 2019 and 478 6 w m 2 july 12 2021 with a daily average of 341 1 w m 2 the annual average vpd is 1 62 1 68 1 59 kpa respectively the ta varied between 12 42 c september 15 2020 and 27 82 c july 10 2021 with a daily average of 21 35 c the swc of the two deep soil layers 0 50 cm 50 100 cm exhibited an inconsistent trend with the lower layer showing slightly higher soil moisture mean value of 0 35 m3 m 3 compared to the upper layer mean value of 0 30 m3 m 3 these differences could be attributed to the precipitation crop growth and shallow groundwater in addition two irrigation events approximately 200 mm each referred to as spring and autumn irrigation gao et al 2018 were conducted in may and october before planting and after harvest respectively these irrigation water ensures higher soil moisture levels reduces soil salinity and decrease wtd before crop planting of course the increased wtd were observed during the growth period suggesting that the crop used the groundwater to meet the water demand the wtd exhibited seasonal fluctuations between 0 85 m and 2 21 m with an average daily value of 1 45 m 3 2 calibration and veridation of swg model 3 2 1 et simulation in this study the original sw model was used to simulate et of sunflower and the estimation of r s s was modified to consider the effect of groundwater swg model table 2 displays the values of the models parameters comparison of measured daily et by the eddy covariance with modeled evapotranspiration using original and modified r s s during three plant growth seasons are shown in fig 4 the modified average soil surface resistance value was 384 mm s 1 indicating a decrease from the previous value of 524 m s 1 additionally the modified r s s value exhibited smaller fluctuations particularly in shallower wtd and drier soil surface conditions the simulated et values match well with the observed et values for most years and the data points are distributed along the 1 1 line the average total et during the growth period of sunflowers was 25 66 mm higher in the swg model simulation compared to the sw model a smallest simulated et difference of 15 mm was observed in 2021 which can be explained by the deeper wtd and higher soil moisture resulting in a smaller difference in r s s table 3 displays the statistical parameters of sw and swg model performance compared with measured et the performance of the improved swg model is more reliable than the original sw model as evidenced by its slight increase in r2 and ns values and significant decrease in mae and rmse however it may appear a systematic overestimation or underestimation when the constant parameters are applied to the models the total simulated et values by the swg model for the three growing seasons 2019 2021 are 4 16 2 61 and 5 06 higher than the measured values respectively additionally even though the sw model simulates a total et value in 2021 that is closer to the measured value with only a difference of 2 06 mm its statistical parameters are still slightly worse than those of the improved swg model in summary the modified swg model shows a better performance in capturing et dynamics which may be more effective in the shallow groundwater area 3 2 2 transpiration simulation the comparison between daily transpiration calculated by method i and method ii and daily transpiration measured by sap flow meter during the available measurement period from 2019 to 2021 is presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the strong correlation observed between the transpiration part of the swg model and the measured t values supports a significant correspondence between the calculated and measured t of sunflower this statement expands the applicability of the swg model for modelling of sunflower transpiration the average r2 and rmse for method i were 0 67 and 0 50 mm d 1 respectively while for method ii they were 0 75 and 0 49 mm d 1 respectively in other words method ii demonstrated superior performance to method i potentially attributable to the inclusion of measured et constraints that decreased model uncertainty this innovative strategy which enables the partitioning et of experimental measurement was utilized to quantify sunflower transpiration over the entire growth period in this study 3 3 evaporation transpiration and et dynamics fig 6 depicts the seasonal variation patterns of daily soil evaporation plant transpiration and e et and t et ratios during three growing seasons 2019 2021 the shaded regions in the figure denote the periods when the sap flow meter was used to measure t while t values outside of these regions were estimated using a simulation method e is calculated by subtracting plant t from actual et table 4 presents the average et measured by the ec tower and its partitioning into t and e during different growth stages evapotranspiration shows similar seasonal dynamic pattern during the study period generally the largest average daily et occurs in budding and flowering stages the multi year average daily et is 3 88 mm d 1 with e and t contributing 1 60 mm d 1 and 2 28 mm d 1 respectively in 2020 the average daily et was the highest at 4 07 mm d 1 interestingly the highest average soil e 1 90 mm d 1 and lowest average t 2 17 mm d 1 were observed during et partitioning mean non productive e was approximately 145 6 mm over the three growth seasons 47 2 of which was lost during the seeding stage the average daily e during the growth stage gradually decreases likely due to vegetation effects such as reduced wind speed and radiation at the soil surface except for the maturity period in 2021 meanwhile t accounted for approximately 207 8 mm t increased quickly and dominated et when plants began to grow after an accumulation of photosynthesis while it gradually decreased in the late stage of maturity from table 4 typically the seedling stage occurred the highest e et ratio whereas the highest ratio of t to et was observed during the flowering stage as shown in fig 6b e et and t et exhibit comparable dynamic patterns the average values of e et and t et for the entire period are 41 03 and 59 97 respectively during the growth stage t et shows a non linear increase from zero to a maximum value followed by a stable period and then a gradual decrease conversely e et displays the opposite trend additionally it was observed that the intersecting point of the two trend lines corresponded to a sunflower lai of approximately 1 0 1 2 m2 m 2 we propose that lai and swc could also be crucial factors contributing to the divergence in the two trend curves 3 4 optimum groundwater table depth the normalized evaporation e et exp c r lai excluding the interferences from energy and crop growth conditions was used to assess the e between different wtd and swc conditions the normalized soil evaporation e et exp c r lai under different groundwater table depth during the three growing seasons are shown in fig 7 also shown is the daily soil water content swc 10 cm as the color scale we found that when the wtd is less than about 1 5 m the decline in the trend of indicates that shallower groundwater mainly could promote soil evaporation benefiting non productive e within this range conversely when wtd is about 2 0 m or more shows an increase trend which may be mainly due to the water limitation of plant transpiration in such cases groundwater mainly affects sunflower transpiration as rainfall scarcity and inadequate irrigation make it challenging to provide sufficient soil moisture directly for crop water needs however when wtd is between 1 5 and 2 0 m the value remains relatively stable we conclude that wtd within this range may not cause excessive soil e and can effectively supplement crop t resulting in the best utilization of water resources for farmland therefore the optimum wtd for sunflower was determined as about 1 5 2 0 m 3 5 wue of ecosystem and canopy scale water use efficiency could characterize the water carbon coupling relationship of farmland the regression relationships between daily net ecosystem productivity and evapotranspiration and transpiration and seasonal variations of ecosystem and canopy water use efficiency during the whole growing season of 2019 2021 are shown in fig 8 table 5 displays the average water use efficiency wuee and wuec and its components at different growth stages from the perspective of the whole growing season in 2019 2021 daily nep t showed a stronger positive correlation compared with nep et and the mean coefficient of determination r2 were 0 65 and 0 40 respectively we suggest that the existence of large amounts of non productive soil e had a negative impact on the water carbon coupling from the results the average wuee and wuec value are 1 02 0 33 g c kg 1 h2o and 1 68 0 41 g c kg 1 h2o for the three cropping seasons the wue of both scales followed a similar seasonal pattern with an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease the wuec represents the physiological characteristics of plant which are higher during the flowering and budding stages reaching up to 2 31 g c kg 1 h2o the greatest difference occurring at the seedling stage are 0 74 and 1 79 g c kg 1 h2o respectively as noted earlier this stage is associated with a significant number of soil evaporation highlighting the need for increased attention to water management during this stage 3 6 dependence of wue on groundwater table depth fig 9 shows water use efficiency of ecosystem and canopy under various water table depth during the whole growing season of 2019 2021 this result indicated that the difference of water use efficiency between the ecosystem and canopy scales was manifested in various depth of groundwater both wuee and wuec show a clear groundwater dependence increasing wtd reduces the discrepancy between wuee and wuec indicating a gradual reduction in the negative impact of soil e on wue this reduction is influenced by the groundwater level generally these variations indicate the difference in the coupling between water and carbon cycles in the main response to drought vegetation will balance the optimum carbon gain i e net photosynthesis and water loss i e transpiration keitel et al 2003 limousin et al 2015 we believe that due to the biological reactions of vegetation an increase in wtd may contribute to raise wuec nonetheless a deeper wtd can exacerbate drought stress in sunflowers reflecting the declining availability of groundwater fig 9 demonstrates that regulating wtd within a specific range could improve wuee by increasing wuec and reducing non productive soil e as previously mentioned the range of the optimum wtd of 1 5 2 0 m for border irrigated sunflower field grown on sandy loam has also been further recognized at the wue level 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of groundwater to et the groundwater is the important source that supports plant transpiration and soil evaporation making the study of the water use efficiency in farmland in shallow groundwater areas more complicated gao et al 2020 mueller et al 2005 in this study the contribution of groundwater supply to et in different growth stages of sunflowers from 2019 to 2021 was quantified based on the water balance equation fig 10 results indicated that groundwater supply played a vital role in et at various growth stages making up 32 68 of et the average upward groundwater evaporation water flux for the three growing seasons was 170 3 mm contributing 48 3 to the total et these values were higher than those found by miao et al 2016 for the same crop in the region which ranged from 21 to 33 this difference may be due to their more frequent irrigation events annual average irrigation of 389 mm 4 times while the average precipitation and irrigation 90 mm 1 time in our study were only 147 mm only accounting for 42 of the water requirement precipitation and irrigation could directly compensate for soil moisture and support crop growth in fact the water demand for groundwater depends on whether crops could receive sufficient soil moisture supply for example in the maturity period in 2019 the maximum contribution rate of etg to eta was 0 68 while the precipitation was merely 1 8 mm during that timeframe the study shows that in semi arid agricultural areas shallow groundwater has the ability to meet high et demand el khoumsi et al 2017 reported that during the dry season june july and august without irrigation supply 50 of date palm transpiration is satisfied by groundwater many studies have reported that irrigation and precipitation have significant effects on etg et xu et al 2020 sepaskhah et al 2003 reported that the etg et for sorghum increased by 112 at soil water deficit swd compared with swd 5 cm more frequent irrigation in addition irrigation precipitation and wtd will also affect the root growth of crops cohen et al 1995 kankarla et al 2021 liu et al 2020 irrigation and precipitation are more conducive to the horizontal growth of shallow roots talebnejad sepaskhah 2014 showed that the root dry weight in 0 10 cm was 58 higher in continuous flood irrigation compared to intermittent irrigation deeper wtd could promote greater root growth and penetration depth rose et al 2010 drought conditions facilitate the vertical growth of roots towards the moist layer near the groundwater resulting in greater dependence of vegetation on groundwater orellana et al 2012 the results offer tangible data evidence supporting the groundwater contribution to the total et in the study area the development and utilization of shallow groundwater as the primary source of water supply for vegetation coupled with efficient surface irrigation techniques could potentially offer advantages and opportunities for agricultural development in the region 4 2 resistance parameter modifications previous studies showed the upward capillary flux from the shallow aquifer helps to maintain a high rate of evaporation balugani et al 2017 yeh famiglietti 2009 chen et al 2018 suggested that shallower groundwater contributes more to soil surface evaporation based on their evaluation the relationship between evaporation rate and surface soil moisture at wtd of 0 4 1 4 2 2 m the extinction depth of etg was approximately 3 8 m was reported in luo and sophocleous 2010 at the same time our results show that it is reasonable to consider the empirical formula of the impact of shallow groundwater on the soil surface resistance which shows a better performance in capturing et dynamics in the study of application of sw model the soil surface resistance has been achieved through models formulated as a function of the soil water contents poyatos et al 2007 dzikiti et al 2018 nyolei et al 2021 further work was needed to better quantify the resistance parameters some studies optimized the parameters in the model using the monte carlo algorithmas wu et al 2020 or hierarchical bayesian model evidence wei et al 2020 in the shallow groundwater zone the parameter was usually recalibrated to improve the accuracy of et estimations in paddy xu et al 2020 peat lands yurova et al 2014 schwärzel et al 2006 and wetlands mezbahuddin et al 2016 despite efforts to build accurate s w models errors can still occur such as in the case of wetlands wessel and rouse 1994 found that s w model gave the poorest agreement with e due to its tendency to underestimate the observed values the s w model even performed worse than pm model in simulating rice et liu et al 2022b x liu et al 2020 y liu et al 2020 accordingly the modification of resistance parameters including r s c and r s s under the response of groundwater dynamic is worth further study which may be more effective in the shallow groundwater area 4 3 optimum wtd for crops the soil e under the crop canopy is affected by the atmosphere soil groundwater and crop conditions such as temperature solar radiation soil texture soil water content wtd crop type and lai it is invalid consumed in the form of soil e which is an important factor affecting the water carbon coupling relationship and water use efficiency wang and liu 2007 pointed out that the soil e is mainly determined by the surface net radiation and lai under the crop canopy in the vigorous growth period lai is the main factor affecting the change of e et bao et al 2021 the normalized evaporation could eliminate the interferences of energy and crop growth conditions the optimum wtd for sunflower was determined as about 1 5 2 0 m some studies have come to similar conclusions kahlown and ashraf 2005 shown that the wtd of 1 5 2 0 m was found to be optimum for studied sorghum and sugarcane talebnejad and sepaskhah 2015 reported that the groundwater depth of 1 62 m is favorable to the water use of quinoa in greenhouse an optimum wtd of 1 4 2 0 m was suggested for the growing seasons of tamarisk by ren et al 2019 it is generally believed that vegetables and grass have a lower optimal wtd and higher for trees wtd of 0 6 m was thought to be optimum for edible green vegetables studied ghamarnia and khodaei 2016 mueller et al 2005 showed that winter wheat of highest wue had optimum wtd in the range of 0 8 1 6 m and 0 8 1 2 m for soybean bogino and jobbágy 2011 shown that enhancing forest growth at optimum depths 2 8 m but depressing it or even killing trees when it approaches the surface 2 m the optimum groundwater level for desert riparian trees growth was 2 4 m along the middle and lower reaches of the tarim river hao et al 2010 and was about 4 m rassam et al 2008 for maroochy catchment these results help understand the water saving potential of agriculture and improve the farmland wue 5 conclusions in this study three years detailed measurement data and an improved swg model were used for partitioning plant t and bare soil e in a shallow groundwater sunflower cropland our results showed that the model could well describe the dynamics of t and et the et of the sunflower was founded to be 353 5 15 0 mm and it derived approximately 48 3 7 4 of the water from the groundwater evaporation it reveals that groundwater resources strongly supports crop water requirement in the semi arid area we found that e was approximately 145 6 mm over the sunflower growth season and around 47 2 of which was lost during the seeding stage these large amounts of non productive soil evaporation had a negative impact on the water carbon coupling in addition the study showed that regulating wtd could improve wuee by increasing wuec and reducing soil e an optimum wtd was determined by assessing the normalized evaporation difference with the varying wtd and it was about 1 5 2 0 m for border irrigated sunflower field grown on sandy loam in this area in conclusion these results shed light on the understanding of the interaction between evapotranspiration components of crop with shallow groundwater and the guidance for precision agriculture irrigation more investigations are urgently needed on other crops and

8880,groundwater resources strongly support crop water requirement and economic yield improvement in semi arid and arid areas water resources management require more investigation in the response of evapotranspiration et partitioning and water use efficiency to groundwater change observational data collected over a three year period including water and carbon flux vegetable sap flow meteorological factors soil water content and groundwater depth were employed in this study additionally an improved shuttleworth wallace model was used for partitioning plant transpiration and bare soil evaporation e in a sunflower cropland with shallow groundwater the et of the sunflower was founded to be 353 5 15 0 mm and approximately 48 3 7 4 derived from the groundwater evaporation e amounted approximately 145 6 6 1 mm over the growth season and around 47 2 of which was lost during the seeding stage furthermore its dynamics depended on crop growth and groundwater table depth wtd these large amounts of non productive soil e had a negative impact on the water carbon coupling the presence of e had resulted in a lower ecosystem water use efficiency wuee measured at 1 02 0 33 g c kg 1 h2o compared to canopy water use efficiency wuec of 1 68 0 41 g c kg 1 h2o these results demonstrated that regulating wtd could improve wuee by increasing wuec and reducing soil e to achieve the higher wuee an optimum wtd was range of 1 5 2 0 m for border irrigated sunflower field grown on sandy loam identified by an analysis of normalized evaporation difference at the varying wtd this finding highlights the significance of maintaining specified wtd providing valuable insights into the complex interplay between crop evapotranspiration components and shallow groundwater moreover it offers guidance for precision agriculture irrigation practices keywords evapotranspiration and partitioning shallow groundwater water use efficiency shuttleworth wallace model optimum wtd data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction shallow groundwater plays an important role in supporting vegetation water use and maintaining ecological environment in arid and semi arid regions shallow groundwater influences 22 32 of global land area including similar to 15 as groundwater fed surface water features and 7 17 with the water table or its capillary fringe within plant rooting depths fan et al 2013 within agriculture ecosystems previous studies indicated that groundwater strongly supports crop water requirement and yield improvement ramos et al 2017 lowry et al 2011 huo et al 2012 wang et al 2018 du et al 2021 but may enhanced concurrently secondary soil salinization li et al 2023 traditionally maintaining a shallow groundwater table wtd serves as a safety measure buffer against the unreliability irrigation water and extreme weather rong et al 2023 as climate change exacerbates droughts and other extreme events wang et al 2023 groundwater will become increasingly important as a dependable water source however shallow groundwater can induce excess evapotranspiration thereby negatively affecting the farmland s water use efficiency undoubtedly such additional water loss exacerbates the risks and production costs caused by water scarcity and reduces agricultural productivity therefore the significance of elucidating hydrological processes to enhance water use efficiency wue for promoting sustainable development of agriculture cannot be overstated in arid and semi arid regions evapotranspiration et is inherently associated with water energy and carbon cycles two separate processes together constitute the et flux namely physical evaporation e and biological transpiration t which respond differently to changes in surface meteorological conditions water status and vegetation abundance zhang et al 2016 t being linked to plant photosynthesis and productivity is considered as an effective water use lawrence et al 2007 however e is generally regarded as an non productive consumption and is a major cause of water resource waste or low wue agricultural water saving strategies should prioritize reducing soil e thus increasing water availability specifically in regions with shallow groundwater in arid and semi arid environments where a strong connection between et and groundwater is commonly observed chen et al 2016 gao et al 2018 liu et al 2016 groundwater evaporation etg is typically expected to increase with the rising wtd and is influenced by factors such as irrigation rainfall or vegetation karimov et al 2014 recent studies have reported etg to total et contribution ratios varying from 16 3 to 97 2 dubois et al 2021 eltarabily et al 2020 ryken et al 2022 wang et al 2020 in fact groundwater exchange is challenging to measure directly although weighing and static water table lysimeters can provide accurate measurements of crop groundwater relations they are expensive and laborious the soil water balance method may be the better choice rushton et al 2006 chen et al 2018 found that the water supplied from groundwater increased from 5 to 15 during the period of water saving irrigation forkutsa et al 2009 showed that groundwater contributed a substantial share up to 399 mm to actual et of cotton estimated at 488 727 mm the research on groundwater contribution gwc reveals the importance of groundwater in terrestrial ecosystems however it is not clear how much of the gwc is invalid for crop growth raising questions about the dependence of et on shallow groundwater obviously further accurate estimation of et components is the foundation of sustainable water resources management with shallow groundwater especially in agricultural areas to evaluate the validity of et it is essential to partition of e and t in recent years various approaches are developed to improve our knowledge of et partitioning including measuring and modeling methods a methodology to directly partition t and e from eddy covariance ec measurements and turbulence theory has been recently presented scanlon and kustas 2010 but it is difficult in parameterizing wue zhou et al 2016 moreover isotope measurements have been introduced for et partitioning and have demonstrated great potential maxwell et al 2015 evaristo et al 2016 but application is highly limited by its cost laborious and with low time resolution sap flow chambers micro lysimeters and soil chambers are widely applied for t and e direct measurement green et al 2003 domec et al 2012 a meta analysis of field observations suggests that t et should approximately be 61 15 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 modeling research has provided additional insights into the quantification of e and t partitioning such as the shuttleworth wallace s w model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 soil water energy and transpiration sweat model daamen and simmonds 1996 and the simdualkc model rosa et al 2016 the simdualkc model was used to successfully simulate the partition of maize et into its components liu et al 2021 following the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 2005 previous studies have shown that s w model had contributed valuable information to in et partitioning among different vegetation types kool et al 2014 gharsallah et al 2013 lund and soegaard 2003 s w model can illustrate the most reliable estimate in both the magnitude and the across site variability of t et and mean annual t et was 0 61 0 14 at global fluxnet sites cao et al 2022 in a swiss cropland with winter cereals paul limoges et al 2022 observed that the t et ratio with an average of 0 725 exhibited similar seasonal dynamics across two crop seasons aouade et al 2016 found that average t et was 0 83 in an irrigated winter wheat field however validity of et heavenly depend on local meteorological and hydrological conditions especially groundwater depth to our best knowledge understanding the impact of shallow groundwater to validity of actual et is still not enough thus with three years of detailed site specific monitoring including water and carbon flux vegetable sap flow meteorological factors soil moisture and groundwater depth we try to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the impact of et validity on wue in arid areas with shallow groundwater farmland here the following objectives were defined 1 partition non productive e and t and clarify their dynamics throughout crop growth season 2 examine the impact of groundwater on wue 3 determine the optimum wtd to enhance wue the structural framework of this study is depicted in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation of comprehensive farmland hydrology the research was conducted at the hetao irrigation district which is a typical arid and semi arid irrigated agricultural area in the northwest of china the study site is situated in a typical arid continental monsoon climate characterized by an annual average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration of around 170 mm and 2300 mm respectively the mean annual temperature is 8 9 the hetao irrigation district covers an area of about 1 12 million hectares with a flat topography that gradually slopes from west to east dropping from about 1200 m to 1000 m sunflower maize and wheat are the primary crops grown in the area to support vegetation growth in this arid region irrigation water sourced from the yellow river is the primary water sources the utilization of approximately 5 billion cubic meters of yellow river water for field irrigation annually has resulted in a shallow groundwater table over the years although the shallow groundwater supports the agricultural production it is considered commonly that partly evapotranspiration is invalid to corp growth dai et al 2022 liu et al 2022a comprehensive farmland hydrological observation was carried out at the heji experimental station 40 43 n 107 16 e altitude 1 038 m located on the south edge of hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china fig 2 the crops we studied was sunflower helianthus annuus l which were planted in rows with a spacing of 0 80 m between rows the plant density for sunflower was 26 000 plants per hectare the sunflower field enclosed by the yellow solid line was the experimental monitoring site of eddy covariance system fig 2c the total area of sunflower was more than 10 ha wind speed in this area from june to september was statistically analyzed over several years and the main wind direction was found to be northeast other measuring instruments are also installed around the eddy covariance tower throughout the sunflower growing season the experimental field utilizes border irrigation only once a year through channel water diversion typically performed in early july each irrigation event involves the water application of approximately 90 mm soil physical properties such as field capacity θ fc and bulk density γ d were obtained from laboratory experiments with the 100 cm3 cutting rings soil physical properties at different depths was analyzed by laser grain size analyzer the soil in the 1 m soil layer is predominantly silt loam with slightly higher sand content in 0 30 cm layer detailed soil characteristics at different depths of the experimental site are included in table 1 2 2 measurements and data processing 2 2 1 flux and hydrological and meteorological measurements water and carbon fluxes were measured using an open path eddy covariance ec system which integrates an infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa and 3 d sonic anemometer gill solent instrument uk the ec system was operated at an altitude of 1 5 m above the canopy height and adjusted once during the growth period and the 30 min average flux data were recorded and stored by an automatic data logger cr3000 campbell scientific usa the distance between the measurement source area with a 90 contribution rate and the observation site was approximately 116 2 m with the point having the largest contribution rate being about 18 96 m away kljun et al 2002 kormann and meixner 2001 the field length in the main wind and wave area was approximately 400 m which met the measurement requirements the energy closure in our study was 0 75 0 81 and 0 78 for three consecutive years to achieve energy budget closure using 30 minute data the principle of bowen ratio preservation of energy was adopted meteorological observations include air temperature and relative humidity hmp155a vaisala inc fi net radiation cnr4 kipp zonen inc ned soil heat flux hfp01 hukseflux

logger cr1000 campbell scientific usa the precipitation at half hour intervals was obtained from standard weather station observations at heji experimental station two sets of hydro probes stevens inc usa were embedded in five soil layers 10 20 40 60 80 cm depth to observe soil moisture content during the growth period the researchers used soil drill to take soil at the corresponding depth every ten days measured the soil moisture content by the oven drying method and calibrated the data measured by the hydra probe a 6 0 m deep groundwater observation well was installed near ec tower and two hobo u20 onset computer corp usa sensors were installed inside the well to record groundwater dynamics every 30 min the wtd was manually measured and calibrated every 10 days 2 2 2 sunflower sap flow measurements employing the energy balance principle we ascertained sunflower sap velocity sv g h 1 by detecting the heat generated during water transport during plant growth the vast majority more than 95 of the sap flow was directly consumed by transpiration thus the method was widely employed to transpiration measurement of various types of vegetation from trees eliades et al 2018 shrubs hayat et al 2021 to crops venturin et al 2020 to ensure a higher level of accuracy in measuring field transpiration we conducted measurements on approximately 30 sunflowers within the monitoring field including their height stem diameter and leaf area prior to selecting the plants for monitoring then 4 representative plants were selected and wrapped sensors sgb dynamax inc usa were installed near the base of sunflower stems this method of measurement allows for continuous and non invasive monitoring of plants transpiration while the selection of representative plants ensures that the obtained data is accurate and representative of the entire field the sensors were wrapped by sponges and aluminum membrane to isolate it from rainfall dew wind and radiation etc sv was recorded once every 30 min by flow32 1 k system dynamax inc usa total sap flow sf mm d 1 was obtained by summing the product of average hourly sv g h 1 and hours then dividing by water density 1 g cm 3 and sunflower planting density 2 6 plant m 2 daily sunflower transpiration t mm d 1 was calculated by converting total sap flow per day 2 2 3 vegetation monitoring and field management within the ec system coverage area three vegetation quadrats were established to gather average vegetation parameters representative plants were carefully selected for labeling and precise determination regular surveys were conducted every 10 days to measure various aspects including canopy height leaf width leaf area index lai and dry matter yield the height and leaf width of sunflowers were manually measured using a meter ruler while lai was determined using a portable leaf area meter field management data such as fertilization planting irrigation growth period duration and harvest date were collected through comprehensive field surveys 2 3 et partition based on shuttleworth wallace model 2 3 1 shuttleworth wallace model the shuttleworth wallace s w model was widely used to estimate evapotranspiration from the sparsely vegetated underlying surface the sw model was developed from the penman monteith p m model which followed hypothesis of uniform distribution of the underlying surface sw model regarded plant canopy and soil surface as two separates but interacting sources of water vapor making it a dual source model the specific calculation method for the model is described in detailed in shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and allen et al 1998 the basic equations of the s w model are shown in eqs 1 4 1 λ et λ e λ t c s p m s c c pm c 2 p m s δ a t ρ c p d δ r a s a t a s r a a r a s δ γ 1 r

evaluated its performance in producing reasonable et and et dynamics but further analysis was needed to verify the simulation of sunflower transpiration at the same time although the dynamic change of t was observed with sap flow meter we could not obtain complete data for the entire growth period due to factors such as stem thickness weather and instrument maintenance therefore we utilized two methods to calculate plant transpiration based on the model simulation results eqs 8 9 specifically express method i and method ii respectively 8 t λ t λ λ c c pm c λ 9 t λ t λ et et mea c c pm c c s

crops the average rate of etg in mm d 1 is determined in the water balance method by noting the change in soil water content over time this study using the soil water balance swb methods to determine the etg based on measurements that adequately represent all the important physical processes eq 14 represents the swb model used to calculate etg 14 et g et a p i r dp swc where etg is groundwater

ecosystem exchange nee were recorded and calculated by the ec system to assess the impact of invaild soil evaporation we introduced two scales of ecosystem water use efficiency wue expressed as ecosystem wuee and canopy wuec levels the specific expressions of wuee and canopy wuec are shown in eqs 15 16 the daily wuee g c kg 1h2o was defined as the ratio of net ecosystem productivity nep g c

conditions the seasonal variations of hydrological and meteorological factors including precipitation p irrigation i net radiation rn vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature ta soil water content swc and groundwater table depth wtd in the growth period from 2019 to 2021 are shown in fig 3 the p are 28 8 99 4 30 2 mm during the three growing seasons with an average of 52 8 mm it is important to note that both 2019 and 2021 were particularly dry years with precipitation levels significantly below the average annual crop water requirements the irrigation adopted the method of border irrigation which was only carried out in the sunflower seedling stages and the irrigation was roughly 90 mm at a time sparse rainfall has resulted in abundant solar thermal resources and relatively dry atmosphere in the arid region the rn varied between 58 6 w m 2 september 12 2019 and 478 6 w m 2 july 12 2021 with a daily average of 341 1 w m 2 the annual average vpd is 1 62 1 68 1 59 kpa respectively the ta varied between 12 42 c september 15 2020 and 27 82 c july 10 2021 with a daily average of 21 35 c the swc of the two deep soil layers 0 50 cm 50 100 cm exhibited an inconsistent trend with the lower layer showing slightly higher soil moisture mean value of 0 35 m3 m 3 compared to the upper layer mean value of 0 30 m3 m 3 these differences could be attributed to the precipitation crop growth and shallow groundwater in addition two irrigation events approximately 200 mm each referred to as spring and autumn irrigation gao et al 2018 were conducted in may and october before planting and after harvest respectively these irrigation water ensures higher soil moisture levels reduces soil salinity and decrease wtd before crop planting of course the increased wtd were observed during the growth period suggesting that the crop used the groundwater to meet the water demand the wtd exhibited seasonal fluctuations between 0 85 m and 2 21 m with an average daily value of 1 45 m 3 2 calibration and veridation of swg model 3 2 1 et simulation in this study the original sw model was used to simulate et of sunflower and the estimation of r s s was modified to consider the effect of groundwater swg model table 2 displays the values of the models parameters comparison of measured daily et by the eddy covariance with modeled evapotranspiration using original and modified r s s during three plant growth seasons are shown in fig 4 the modified average soil surface resistance value was 384 mm s 1 indicating a decrease from the previous value of 524 m s 1 additionally the modified r s s value exhibited smaller fluctuations particularly in shallower wtd and drier soil surface conditions the simulated et values match well with the observed et values for most years and the data points are distributed along the 1 1 line the average total et during the growth period of sunflowers was 25 66 mm higher in the swg model simulation compared to the sw model a smallest simulated et difference of 15 mm was observed in 2021 which can be explained by the deeper wtd and higher soil moisture resulting in a smaller difference in r s s table 3 displays the statistical parameters of sw and swg model performance compared with measured et the performance of the improved swg model is more reliable than the original sw model as evidenced by its slight increase in r2 and ns values and significant decrease in mae and rmse however it may appear a systematic overestimation or underestimation when the constant parameters are applied to the models the total simulated et values by the swg model for the three growing seasons 2019 2021 are 4 16 2 61 and 5 06 higher than the measured values respectively additionally even though the sw model simulates a total et value in 2021 that is closer to the measured value with only a difference of 2 06 mm its statistical parameters are still slightly worse than those of the improved swg model in summary the modified swg model shows a better performance in capturing et dynamics which may be more effective in the shallow groundwater area 3 2 2 transpiration simulation the comparison between daily transpiration calculated by method i and method ii and daily transpiration measured by sap flow meter during the available measurement period from 2019 to 2021 is presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the strong correlation observed between the transpiration part of the swg model and the measured t values supports a significant correspondence between the calculated and measured t of sunflower this statement expands the applicability of the swg model for modelling of sunflower transpiration the average r2 and rmse for method i were 0 67 and 0 50 mm d 1 respectively while for method ii they were 0 75 and 0 49 mm d 1 respectively in other words method ii demonstrated superior performance to method i potentially attributable to the inclusion of measured et constraints that decreased model uncertainty this innovative strategy which enables the partitioning et of experimental measurement was utilized to quantify sunflower transpiration over the entire growth period in this study 3 3 evaporation transpiration and et dynamics fig 6 depicts the seasonal variation patterns of daily soil evaporation plant transpiration and e et and t et ratios during three growing seasons 2019 2021 the shaded regions in the figure denote the periods when the sap flow meter was used to measure t while t values outside of these regions were estimated using a simulation method e is calculated by subtracting plant t from actual et table 4 presents the average et measured by the ec tower and its partitioning into t and e during different growth stages evapotranspiration shows similar seasonal dynamic pattern during the study period generally the largest average daily et occurs in budding and flowering stages the multi year average daily et is 3 88 mm d 1 with e and t contributing 1 60 mm d 1 and 2 28 mm d 1 respectively in 2020 the average daily et was the highest at 4 07 mm d 1 interestingly the highest average soil e 1 90 mm d 1 and lowest average t 2 17 mm d 1 were observed during et partitioning mean non productive e was approximately 145 6 mm over the three growth seasons 47 2 of which was lost during the seeding stage the average daily e during the growth stage gradually decreases likely due to vegetation effects such as reduced wind speed and radiation at the soil surface except for the maturity period in 2021 meanwhile t accounted for approximately 207 8 mm t increased quickly and dominated et when plants began to grow after an accumulation of photosynthesis while it gradually decreased in the late stage of maturity from table 4 typically the seedling stage occurred the highest e et ratio whereas the highest ratio of t to et was observed during the flowering stage as shown in fig 6b e et and t et exhibit comparable dynamic patterns the average values of e et and t et for the entire period are 41 03 and 59 97 respectively during the growth stage t et shows a non linear increase from zero to a maximum value followed by a stable period and then a gradual decrease conversely e et displays the opposite trend additionally it was observed that the intersecting point of the two trend lines corresponded to a sunflower lai of approximately 1 0 1 2 m2 m 2 we propose that lai and swc could also be crucial factors contributing to the divergence in the two trend curves 3 4 optimum groundwater table depth the normalized evaporation e et exp c r lai excluding the interferences from energy and crop growth conditions was used to assess the e between different wtd and swc conditions the normalized soil evaporation e et exp c r lai under different groundwater table depth during the three growing seasons are shown in fig 7 also shown is the daily soil water content swc 10 cm as the color scale we found that when the wtd is less than about 1 5 m the decline in the trend of indicates that shallower groundwater mainly could promote soil evaporation benefiting non productive e within this range conversely when wtd is about 2 0 m or more shows an increase trend which may be mainly due to the water limitation of plant transpiration in such cases groundwater mainly affects sunflower transpiration as rainfall scarcity and inadequate irrigation make it challenging to provide sufficient soil moisture directly for crop water needs however when wtd is between 1 5 and 2 0 m the value remains relatively stable we conclude that wtd within this range may not cause excessive soil e and can effectively supplement crop t resulting in the best utilization of water resources for farmland therefore the optimum wtd for sunflower was determined as about 1 5 2 0 m 3 5 wue of ecosystem and canopy scale water use efficiency could characterize the water carbon coupling relationship of farmland the regression relationships between daily net ecosystem productivity and evapotranspiration and transpiration and seasonal variations of ecosystem and canopy water use efficiency during the whole growing season of 2019 2021 are shown in fig 8 table 5 displays the average water use efficiency wuee and wuec and its components at different growth stages from the perspective of the whole growing season in 2019 2021 daily nep t showed a stronger positive correlation compared with nep et and the mean coefficient of determination r2 were 0 65 and 0 40 respectively we suggest that the existence of large amounts of non productive soil e had a negative impact on the water carbon coupling from the results the average wuee and wuec value are 1 02 0 33 g c kg 1 h2o and 1 68 0 41 g c kg 1 h2o for the three cropping seasons the wue of both scales followed a similar seasonal pattern with an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease the wuec represents the physiological characteristics of plant which are higher during the flowering and budding stages reaching up to 2 31 g c kg 1 h2o the greatest difference occurring at the seedling stage are 0 74 and 1 79 g c kg 1 h2o respectively as noted earlier this stage is associated with a significant number of soil evaporation highlighting the need for increased attention to water management during this stage 3 6 dependence of wue on groundwater table depth fig 9 shows water use efficiency of ecosystem and canopy under various water table depth during the whole growing season of 2019 2021 this result indicated that the difference of water use efficiency between the ecosystem and canopy scales was manifested in various depth of groundwater both wuee and wuec show a clear groundwater dependence increasing wtd reduces the discrepancy between wuee and wuec indicating a gradual reduction in the negative impact of soil e on wue this reduction is influenced by the groundwater level generally these variations indicate the difference in the coupling between water and carbon cycles in the main response to drought vegetation will balance the optimum carbon gain i e net photosynthesis and water loss i e transpiration keitel et al 2003 limousin et al 2015 we believe that due to the biological reactions of vegetation an increase in wtd may contribute to raise wuec nonetheless a deeper wtd can exacerbate drought stress in sunflowers reflecting the declining availability of groundwater fig 9 demonstrates that regulating wtd within a specific range could improve wuee by increasing wuec and reducing non productive soil e as previously mentioned the range of the optimum wtd of 1 5 2 0 m for border irrigated sunflower field grown on sandy loam has also been further recognized at the wue level 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of groundwater to et the groundwater is the important source that supports plant transpiration and soil evaporation making the study of the water use efficiency in farmland in shallow groundwater areas more complicated gao et al 2020 mueller et al 2005 in this study the contribution of groundwater supply to et in different growth stages of sunflowers from 2019 to 2021 was quantified based on the water balance equation fig 10 results indicated that groundwater supply played a vital role in et at various growth stages making up 32 68 of et the average upward groundwater evaporation water flux for the three growing seasons was 170 3 mm contributing 48 3 to the total et these values were higher than those found by miao et al 2016 for the same crop in the region which ranged from 21 to 33 this difference may be due to their more frequent irrigation events annual average irrigation of 389 mm 4 times while the average precipitation and irrigation 90 mm 1 time in our study were only 147 mm only accounting for 42 of the water requirement precipitation and irrigation could directly compensate for soil moisture and support crop growth in fact the water demand for groundwater depends on whether crops could receive sufficient soil moisture supply for example in the maturity period in 2019 the maximum contribution rate of etg to eta was 0 68 while the precipitation was merely 1 8 mm during that timeframe the study shows that in semi arid agricultural areas shallow groundwater has the ability to meet high et demand el khoumsi et al 2017 reported that during the dry season june july and august without irrigation supply 50 of date palm transpiration is satisfied by groundwater many studies have reported that irrigation and precipitation have significant effects on etg et xu et al 2020 sepaskhah et al 2003 reported that the etg et for sorghum increased by 112 at soil water deficit swd compared with swd 5 cm more frequent irrigation in addition irrigation precipitation and wtd will also affect the root growth of crops cohen et al 1995 kankarla et al 2021 liu et al 2020 irrigation and precipitation are more conducive to the horizontal growth of shallow roots talebnejad sepaskhah 2014 showed that the root dry weight in 0 10 cm was 58 higher in continuous flood irrigation compared to intermittent irrigation deeper wtd could promote greater root growth and penetration depth rose et al 2010 drought conditions facilitate the vertical growth of roots towards the moist layer near the groundwater resulting in greater dependence of vegetation on groundwater orellana et al 2012 the results offer tangible data evidence supporting the groundwater contribution to the total et in the study area the development and utilization of shallow groundwater as the primary source of water supply for vegetation coupled with efficient surface irrigation techniques could potentially offer advantages and opportunities for agricultural development in the region 4 2 resistance parameter modifications previous studies showed the upward capillary flux from the shallow aquifer helps to maintain a high rate of evaporation balugani et al 2017 yeh famiglietti 2009 chen et al 2018 suggested that shallower groundwater contributes more to soil surface evaporation based on their evaluation the relationship between evaporation rate and surface soil moisture at wtd of 0 4 1 4 2 2 m the extinction depth of etg was approximately 3 8 m was reported in luo and sophocleous 2010 at the same time our results show that it is reasonable to consider the empirical formula of the impact of shallow groundwater on the soil surface resistance which shows a better performance in capturing et dynamics in the study of application of sw model the soil surface resistance has been achieved through models formulated as a function of the soil water contents poyatos et al 2007 dzikiti et al 2018 nyolei et al 2021 further work was needed to better quantify the resistance parameters some studies optimized the parameters in the model using the monte carlo algorithmas wu et al 2020 or hierarchical bayesian model evidence wei et al 2020 in the shallow groundwater zone the parameter was usually recalibrated to improve the accuracy of et estimations in paddy xu et al 2020 peat lands yurova et al 2014 schwärzel et al 2006 and wetlands mezbahuddin et al 2016 despite efforts to build accurate s w models errors can still occur such as in the case of wetlands wessel and rouse 1994 found that s w model gave the poorest agreement with e due to its tendency to underestimate the observed values the s w model even performed worse than pm model in simulating rice et liu et al 2022b x liu et al 2020 y liu et al 2020 accordingly the modification of resistance parameters including r s c and r s s under the response of groundwater dynamic is worth further study which may be more effective in the shallow groundwater area 4 3 optimum wtd for crops the soil e under the crop canopy is affected by the atmosphere soil groundwater and crop conditions such as temperature solar radiation soil texture soil water content wtd crop type and lai it is invalid consumed in the form of soil e which is an important factor affecting the water carbon coupling relationship and water use efficiency wang and liu 2007 pointed out that the soil e is mainly determined by the surface net radiation and lai under the crop canopy in the vigorous growth period lai is the main factor affecting the change of e et bao et al 2021 the normalized evaporation could eliminate the interferences of energy and crop growth conditions the optimum wtd for sunflower was determined as about 1 5 2 0 m some studies have come to similar conclusions kahlown and ashraf 2005 shown that the wtd of 1 5 2 0 m was found to be optimum for studied sorghum and sugarcane talebnejad and sepaskhah 2015 reported that the groundwater depth of 1 62 m is favorable to the water use of quinoa in greenhouse an optimum wtd of 1 4 2 0 m was suggested for the growing seasons of tamarisk by ren et al 2019 it is generally believed that vegetables and grass have a lower optimal wtd and higher for trees wtd of 0 6 m was thought to be optimum for edible green vegetables studied ghamarnia and khodaei 2016 mueller et al 2005 showed that winter wheat of highest wue had optimum wtd in the range of 0 8 1 6 m and 0 8 1 2 m for soybean bogino and jobbágy 2011 shown that enhancing forest growth at optimum depths 2 8 m but depressing it or even killing trees when it approaches the surface 2 m the optimum groundwater level for desert riparian trees growth was 2 4 m along the middle and lower reaches of the tarim river hao et al 2010 and was about 4 m rassam et al 2008 for maroochy catchment these results help understand the water saving potential of agriculture and improve the farmland wue 5 conclusions in this study three years detailed measurement data and an improved swg model were used for partitioning plant t and bare soil e in a shallow groundwater sunflower cropland our results showed that the model could well describe the dynamics of t and et the et of the sunflower was founded to be 353 5 15 0 mm and it derived approximately 48 3 7 4 of the water from the groundwater evaporation it reveals that groundwater resources strongly supports crop water requirement in the semi arid area we found that e was approximately 145 6 mm over the sunflower growth season and around 47 2 of which was lost during the seeding stage these large amounts of non productive soil evaporation had a negative impact on the water carbon coupling in addition the study showed that regulating wtd could improve wuee by increasing wuec and reducing soil e an optimum wtd was determined by assessing the normalized evaporation difference with the varying wtd and it was about 1 5 2 0 m for border irrigated sunflower field grown on sandy loam in this area in conclusion these results shed light on the understanding of the interaction between evapotranspiration components of crop with shallow groundwater and the guidance for precision agriculture irrigation more investigations are urgently needed on other crops and

8881,deficits in soil moisture and low soil fertility are the major constraints to smallholder farming systems in the ssa sub saharan africa region this study evaluated the effects of tied ridging and selected soil fertility inputs on soil water content at different depths maize yields and economic returns the treatments were tithonia diversifolia inorganic fertilizer manure inorganic fertilizer inorganic fertilizer and control with or without tied ridging as the soil water conservation factor data were subjected to analysis of variance and the means were separated using lsd at p 0 05 treatments with tithonia diversifolia or manure combined with inorganic fertilizer with or without tied ridging consistently affected soil water content positively the effect of tied ridging on soil water content was greater during the short rain season compared to the long rains in addition there was evidence that tied ridging and organic soil inputs resulted in greater soil moisture conservation during the critical silking and tasselling maize phenological stages during the short rain season treatments had significant effects on grain and stover yields during the long rain 2016 season p 0 0001 and p 0 0477 respectively and the short rain 2016 season p 0 0001 and p 0 0035 respectively the highest 4 87 mg ha 1 maize grain yield was recorded in tithonia diversifolia plus inorganic fertilizer under tied ridging in the long rain 2016 season while manure inorganic fertilizer without tied ridging gave the highest yields 1 27 mg ha 1 in the short rain 2016 season the highest net benefits of us 1229 90 ha 1 and us 171 57 ha 1 were recorded under tithonia diversifolia plus inorganic fertilizer with tied ridging during the long and short rain seasons respectively overall the best performing treatments in yields and profitability were those that combined organic and inorganic fertilizers regardless of the presence or absence of tied ridging climate smart

data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the ssa region farming systems rely to a great extent on rain fed agriculture which exposes smallholder farmers to increasingly erratic rainfall patterns and unpredictable climate conditions mairura et al 2021 more than 95 of the arable land area in the ssa is rain fed providing food security and livelihood strategies for more than 80 of the population in the region serdeczny et al 2019 however changing climatic patterns characterized by erratic rainfall prolonged dry spells and frequent droughts have contributed to reduced

to reduce by 10 in 2050 leading to reductions in drainage by 17 de wit and stankiewicz 2006 the changes in climate patterns and increased soil water stress experienced over the last few years have equally become a major limiting factor to maize production hadebe et al 2017 this is because of the inadequate erratic and unreliable rainfall due to climate variability experienced in the region abrams 2018 coupled with inadequate soil water conservation practices mwaura et al 2021 mairura et al 2022 most smallholder farmers depend on rain fed agriculture making them vulnerable to partial or total crop failures ngetich et al 2014a the main effect of climate change in africa is likely to be altered in precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water balances muluneh et al 2020 small scale farmers are exposed to unmitigated socio economic risks because the effects of drought on agricultural productivity are incredibly severe and farmers lack appropriate soil water management options thornton et al 2017 according to meteorological legacy data the temperature in tharaka nithi county increased while the annual rainfall declined between 1960 and 2009 gioto et al 2016 in addition soil moisture stress and temperature increases will likely occur with greater frequency in tharaka nithi county and several arid and semiarid ssa regions in the future moalf ministry of agriculture livestock and forestry 2017 this calls for strategies to enhance the capacity of small scale farmers to cope with changing climatic conditions including efficient and cost effective soil water conservation options zougmoré et al 2014 tied ridging is a successful climate smart agricultural technology under various cereal and legume cropping systems in arid and semiarid areas thornton et al 2017 ngetich et al 2014b the technology can improve moisture storage and enhance crops efficient water and nutrient utilization kiboi et al 2021 tied ridging saves soil moisture within the root zone improving the probability of crop survival during extended periods of dry spells and meteorological drought gan et al 2013 applying farmyard manure combined with tied ridges increased grain yield in kenya compared to farms without tied ridges mwende et al 2019 ngetich et al 2014b found that tied ridges significantly improved soil properties and crop yields in the semiarid conditions of kenya the economic benefits of climate smart agricultural technologies such as tied ridges are essential for farmer adoption many studies on tied ridging have focused on the relationship between tied ridging and crop yield while few studies have addressed their effects on soil water status under different soils rainfall regimes and crops muluneh 2020 observed that future climate change in the ethiopian drylands is likely to affect the maize yield negatively and proposed tied ridges and better soil fertility adaptation measures to offset the negative impacts of climate change studies must examine the productivity and profitability of tied ridging and input application under different soil types and climates characterized by variable dry spells and meteorological drought regimes an integrated method intended to achieve an adequate supply of soil water and nutrients efficiently and cost effectively is necessary for semiarid small scale agricultural systems in addition integrated tillage and nutrient management practices are required for sustainable crop production especially in agroecological zones where soil fertility and moisture stress limit crop response to input applications the objectives of this study were as follows i to determine the impacts of tied ridging and integrated soil fertility management technologies on soil water conservation and maize yields and ii to estimate the economic returns of tied ridging and integrated soil fertility management technologies we hypothesized that combining organic resources manure or tithonia with inorganic fertilizer and tied ridging can increase maize yields and net benefits for small scale farmers in semiarid agricultural systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this field experiment was implemented in

forest ecosystem 2 2 experiment design and management the experiment implemented a randomized complete block design rcbd with eight treatments replicated four times table 2 the selected treatments included tithonia diversifolia inorganic fertilizer cattle manure inorganic fertilizer sole inorganic fertilizer and control in combination with tied ridging or no tied ridging tithonia and cattle manure organic resources were selected to capture the varying organic resource qualities lignin c and n contents including high quality organic resources tithonia and low quality organic resources cattle manure palm et al 2001 the gross plot dimensions were 6 m by 4 5 m with a 1 m wide path left between plots maize zea mays l variety h516 was the test crop it was planted at 0 75 m x 0 50 m spacing between and within maize rows respectively three seeds per hill were sown to guarantee the greatest plant population and thinned out two weeks after germination to retain two plants per hill hence a plant population density of 53333 plants ha 1 was attained npk 23 23 0 was applied at a full rate of 60 kg n ha 1 and 60 kg p ha 1 for treatments without organic inputs while this was applied

diversifolia and animal manure were incorporated in the soil using a hand hoe two weeks before planting tithonia diversifolia was locally harvested from nearby biomass transfer hedges weighed chopped then incorporated into the soil representative samples from the organic inputs were taken to the laboratory for n content determination tithonia diversifolia had 3 8 n while animal manure had 2 1 n using a cn analyzer from these results the amount of organic inputs to be applied to give an equivalent of 30 kg n ha 1 was calculated weeding was carried out twice in each season using a hand hoe tillage was also done by hand hoeing to a depth of about 0 15 m before the onset of the season tied ridges were constructed at the commencement of each cropping season for required experimental plots and reconstructed during weeding and when they collapsed during heavy rainfall events throughout the season 2 3 soil sampling and soil moisture and rainfall measurement soil sampling for soil characterization was composited for each plot using the zigzag sampling framework at 0 20 cm depth using a soil auger at the start of the experiment soil water content measurements were determined

profitability determination maize grain and stover samples were harvested from a net plot area of 21 m2 in the middle of the gross plot area and the total maize grain weight was determined after threshing the grain weights were adjusted to 12 5 moisture content after two weeks of air drying the samples using a moisture meter ten maize plants were randomly selected and harvested within the net plot area after which their dry weights were extrapolated to estimate the total above ground biomass for each plot the net benefits returns to labor and benefit cost ratios were used as the economic assessment tools following cimmyt 1988 guidelines to assess the profitability of different treatments benefits and costs associated with each treatment were evaluated relative to not using different

labor productivity over the control treatment 81 the lowest returns to labor were recorded in the trif treatment 3 63 with the highest negative returns over the control 52 8 during the short rains there were significant treatment effects on all economic performance measures the highest net benefit was recorded in trtif 172 with 80 extra net benefits over the control meanwhile the lowest bcr was also recorded in trtif 1 21 15 benefit over the control while the least bcr was observed in trif 0 3 with the highest negative benefits over the control 50 8 across treatments regarding returns to labor in the short rain season the highest was observed in ntrmif 1 32 with 50 gains over the control while the least returns to labor were observed in trc 0 44 with the highest negative difference relative to the control 50 economic returns over the control treatment were the least in trif followed by trc in all seasons in general the rankings in terms of economic gains over the control tended to be highest in trtif followed by ntrtif ntrmif trmif ntrif trc and trif during the sr season net benefits were higher in soil management treatments with no tied ridging than those with tied ridging except the tithonia diversifolia treatment trtif which had higher benefits than the ntrtif treatment 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content intra seasonal drought periods were experienced in the study during both seasons the short rains had two events during 47 114 dap and 117 144 dap respectively there were dry spell events between 31 and 44 dap days after planting 50 77 dap and 83 97 dap during the long rain cropping season a meteorological drought defined as the absence of rainfall for a duration 28 days during the growing season and dry spells absence of rainfall in periods ranging between 10 and 28 days during the cropping season kiboi et al 2017 were experienced dry spells were more common in the long rains while meteorological droughts were more prominent in the short rains consistent with mucheru muna et al 2014 seasonal rainfall amount and distribution were highly significant in all the parameters under investigation in this study as mucheru muna et al 2014 observed dry spells mostly occurred during the peak periods of crop water requirement rockström et al 2010 reported that sub humid agroecosystems experience a high frequency of droughts dry spells and rainfall variability thus adequate soil crop water management strategies are needed adequate climate smart agricultural management strategies are required in the ssa region s small scale semiarid agroecosystems which typically lack supplementary irrigation and are likely to experience extreme weather and climate extremes essential to crop growth and productivity start days and the end of a rainy period and thus its length plus rainfall amounts and risk of dry spells within the season are pertinent aspects because they strongly affect crop yields ngetich et al 2014b during all seasons the meteorological drought and dry spell conditions influenced soil moisture distribution in the 0 30 cm soil depth during these periods tied ridging without organic inputs was insufficient in soil moisture conservation since there was little or no rainwater to be held in the basins tied ridging is likely to benefit the maize crop in fine textured soils and for seasonal rainfall between 500 and 900 mm during drought or dry years wiyo et al 2000 the results therefore did not agree with similar studies that recorded higher soil water storage where tied ridges were employed gan et al 2013 this was due to the rainfall amounts in these studies either being higher or better distributed as well compared to patterns observed in this study treatments with organic inputs performed best in holding soil water relative to those without while tied ridges without organics led to the least aggregate soil moisture gains this was likely due to the improved soil physical conditions under these treatments increasing the available soil water holding capacity enfors et al 2011 this finding was supported by hudson 1994 who found that soil organic matter and soil moisture content had a highly significant positive correlation manure is well known to build up soil organic matter leading to improved soil physical conditions resulting from enhanced soil aggregation porosity hydrophobicity infiltration rate and water holding capacity abiven et al 2009 these results were in tandem with adeleye et al 2010 and brar et al 2015 who observed that manure conserved soil moisture improved soil physicochemical properties and reduced soil temperature which minimized evaporation celik et al 2004 also observed that the application of manure increased soil organic matter contents and soil water content by 56 the integrated application of tithonia diversifolia and inorganic fertilizer manifested higher soil moisture levels than the control treatment this was likely due to increased soil organic matter and reductions in soil temperature and evaporation resulting from plant residue decomposition babajide et al 2008 being a high quality organic soil resource the high rate of tithonia diversifolia decay and integration results in improved soil hydrological properties during the short term compared to other organic materials kolawole et al 2014 soil organic matter reduces soil bulk density and compaction adekalu and osunbitan 1995 improving soil aggregation resulting in greater soil porosity thus retaining more soil moisture osunbitan and adekalu 1999 during the cropping season improvements in soil organic matter improved the soil structure which enhanced the infiltration capacity of rainwater thereby increasing soil water retention and availability for crop growth kolawole et al 2014 tithonia diversifolia is likely to have improved the soil s organic and hydrologic characteristics after its rapid decomposition larger soil moisture gains were achieved in the short rain season 2 3 which included meteorological droughts compared to the long rain season 0 6 characterized by dry spells and higher rainfall distribution aggregated across depth treatment and time over the control this represented a much greater moisture gain in the short rain season compared to the long rains relative to the control motsi et al 2004 found that tied ridges retained significantly higher soil moisture than conventional tillage systems especially during the dry months the effect of the ridges was reported to be generally higher in drier seasons and more so when the ends of the ridges were tied compared to open ridges in southern africa belay et al 1998 the observed higher soil water content in the long rains than the short rains resulted from higher rainfall that was better distributed than in the short rain season mchugh et al 2007 observed fluctuations in soil water content due to rainfall variability between and within seasons due to the rainfall pattern the soil profile was characterized by water accumulation and depletion throughout the two seasons each season the first half received much of the rainfall with the rest experiencing drier periods following rainfall events treatments under tied ridging retained more rainwater than those without also treatments with organic resources manure or tithonia contributed to significant soil water conservation especially in the short rains evidence also suggests that tied ridges and organic soil inputs were critical in conserving soil moisture in the dry season during the critical maize tasselling and silking growth stage this could be due to the tied ridges ability to trap rainwater instead of the flatbeds okeyo et al 2014 ngetich et al 2014b the penetration of rainwater and the resultant retention in the soil profile is influenced by several factors including the amount intensity and distribution of rainfall in addition to the soil s physical properties moraru and rusu 2013 4 2 maize yields tithonia diversifolia with inorganic fertilizer and manure generally improved grain and stover yields in both cropping seasons relative to the control treatment the good grain yields achieved by tithonia could be attributed to nutrient supply by rapid decomposition providing an effective source of n p and k as well as ca k and mg mugwe et al 2009 mucheru muna et al 2014 jama et al 2000 found that tithonia biomass increased maize yields compared to inorganic fertilizers at equivalent n p and k rates several other studies have reported increased maize yield where tithonia diversifolia was used in combination with inorganic fertilizer as compared to sole inorganic fertilizers nziguheba and mutuo 2000 mucheru muna et al 2007 gikonyo et al 2010 however tithonia diversifolia is labor intensive in cutting carrying and incorporating jama et al 2000 though tithonia is labor demanding its opportunity cost is relatively low because farmers will cut it when it is dry with no other activities compared to manure which has a higher opportunity cost it s high quality organic content and nutrient values justify its application as a soil fertility management resource integrating manure with inorganic fertilizers also increased maize grain and stover yields during 2016 than the control treatment combining manure with inorganic fertilizers increases nutrient availability and enables better synchronization of nutrient release and uptake chivenge et al 2011 gicheru 2012 mucheru muna et al 2014 an increase of 650 in maize grain yields was reported by mwende et al 2019 after applying manure combined with inorganic fertilizers compared to the control treatment the study affirmed that using organic resources combined with inorganic fertilizers is a better option for increasing maize and stover yields several authors in the ssa agreed that mixing inorganic fertilizer and organic inputs produced the highest and most sustainable gains in yields per unit of applied nutrients mugwe et al 2009 vanlauwe et al 2010 mucheru muna et al 2014 mugwe et al 2019 gachengo et al 1999 reported that in most cases combined treatments would lead to higher yields because of the additive effect of the organic and inorganic nutrients compared to organic or inorganic treatments applied solely moreover fertilizer use efficiency is increased by these combinations as they supply nutrients more balanced and other multiple agroecological benefits sanginga and woomer 2009 vanlauwe et al 2010 a meta analysis indicated that combined applications of inorganic and organic fertilizers led to greater productivity and agronomic efficiency responses compared to sole applications gram et al 2020 tied ridging performed better in enhancing grain yields during the long rain season than in the short rain this can be attributed to the higher amount of rainfall received which was better distributed than the short rain season fig 1 the better performance of tied ridging corroborates the findings of belay et al 1998 who reported maize yield increases on vertisols of eastern ethiopia where tied ridges were employed relative to flat planting in mbeere south sub county similar results were observed where tied ridging had the highest increase in maize grain yields 1 23 mg ha 1 compared to mulching and the control ngetich 2012 araya and stroosnijder 2010 also reported a 44 increase in maize grain yield under tied ridging relative to the control the low performance of soil fertility treatments under tied ridging in the short rains may have resulted from poor rainfall distribution and meteorological droughts observed during the season hulugalle 1987 obtained similar results where treatments with tied ridging had no significant effect compared to those without tied ridging in other studies bayu et al 2012 did not observe significant responses of crop growth and yields to tied ridges the immensity of the growth and yield response to the relative performance of tied ridges varies with several factors including fertilization total amount and rainfall distribution among others during the cropping season bayu et al 2012 4 3 economic benefits of treatments the low performance of economic benefits in the short rain season was connected with lower yields realized due to changes in rainfall after farm investments had been incurred at the season onset higher economic net benefits were realized under integrated organic and inorganic fertilizer treatments relative to fertilizer and control treatments in both seasons this is likely the result of higher maize yields that were observed under these treatments these findings agree with nziguheba et al 2002 and mucheru muna et al 2014 who found greater benefits when combining tithonia diversifolia with inorganic fertilizer integrating organic inputs and inorganic fertilizers generated positive net benefits bcr and returns to labor in all seasons denise and meike 2020 found that integrated soil fertility management strategies resulted in higher labor demand but the approach also increased labor productivity and financial returns mutegi et al 2012 highlighted that combined organic inputs and inorganic fertilizers exhibited higher net benefits and bcr than sole fertilizer applications this can be associated with the ability of this integration to greatly increase crop yields in tandem generating higher economic proceeds jama et al 2000 nonetheless this approach may also be hindered by the high proportional requirements for organic inputs and labor necessities for cutting carrying and incorporating these organics jama et al 2000 during the short rains all the treatments besides the sole inorganic fertilizer with and without tied ridging treatments had a bcr 2 considered the minimum bcr in determining the adoption of a given farming practice in smallholder farming systems fao 2006 this means that the yields and the accrued benefits associated with the soil fertility inputs with and without tied ridging in this study could offset the labor and non labor costs incurred however due to the low benefits realized the soil fertility inputs with and without tied ridging could not reach the minimum bcr of 2 during the short rain season 5 conclusions dry spells characterized the long rain season in the experiment while the short rain period featured meteorological droughts results showed enhanced soil water content and maize grain yields under soil fertility inputs treatments with tithonia diversifolia or manure combined with inorganic fertilizer with or without tied ridging consistently positively affected soil water content the effect of soil moisture conservation on soil water content was greater in the short rain season compared to the long rains in terms of soil moisture gains relative to the control tied ridging and organic applications led to soil moisture conservation during critical maize tasselling and silking stages in both seasons in aggregate terms across soil moisture yield and economic benefits over the control treatment integrated treatments recorded the highest moisture benefits relative to the control integrated treatments recorded the highest moisture benefits over the control across time at 10 30 cm depths ntrif contributed the highest moisture benefits over the control at 10 30 cm across time while trif recorded the least benefits across soil moisture yield and profit measures sole fertilizer and tied ridging tended to register intermediate benefits over the control across agronomic and economic measures in the study emerging from the study is the lack of a consistent advantage of tied ridging over no ridging within the period under consideration these underpin the need to research long term effects 4 seasons of tied ridging and soil fertility inputs on soil physical properties crop performance and profitability under erratic and changing rainfall regimes of the central highlands of kenya tied ridging and organic treatments potentially contribute to soil moisture conservation under dry spells and meteorological drought conditions especially in the short rain season therefore climate smart

8881,deficits in soil moisture and low soil fertility are the major constraints to smallholder farming systems in the ssa sub saharan africa region this study evaluated the effects of tied ridging and selected soil fertility inputs on soil water content at different depths maize yields and economic returns the treatments were tithonia diversifolia inorganic fertilizer manure inorganic fertilizer inorganic fertilizer and control with or without tied ridging as the soil water conservation factor data were subjected to analysis of variance and the means were separated using lsd at p 0 05 treatments with tithonia diversifolia or manure combined with inorganic fertilizer with or without tied ridging consistently affected soil water content positively the effect of tied ridging on soil water content was greater during the short rain season compared to the long rains in addition there was evidence that tied ridging and organic soil inputs resulted in greater soil moisture conservation during the critical silking and tasselling maize phenological stages during the short rain season treatments had significant effects on grain and stover yields during the long rain 2016 season p 0 0001 and p 0 0477 respectively and the short rain 2016 season p 0 0001 and p 0 0035 respectively the highest 4 87 mg ha 1 maize grain yield was recorded in tithonia diversifolia plus inorganic fertilizer under tied ridging in the long rain 2016 season while manure inorganic fertilizer without tied ridging gave the highest yields 1 27 mg ha 1 in the short rain 2016 season the highest net benefits of us 1229 90 ha 1 and us 171 57 ha 1 were recorded under tithonia diversifolia plus inorganic fertilizer with tied ridging during the long and short rain seasons respectively overall the best performing treatments in yields and profitability were those that combined organic and inorganic fertilizers regardless of the presence or absence of tied ridging climate smart

to reduce by 10 in 2050 leading to reductions in drainage by 17 de wit and stankiewicz 2006 the changes in climate patterns and increased soil water stress experienced over the last few years have equally become a major limiting factor to maize production hadebe et al 2017 this is because of the inadequate erratic and unreliable rainfall due to climate variability experienced in the region abrams 2018 coupled with inadequate soil water conservation practices mwaura et al 2021 mairura et al 2022 most smallholder farmers depend on rain fed agriculture making them vulnerable to partial or total crop failures ngetich et al 2014a the main effect of climate change in africa is likely to be altered in precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water balances muluneh et al 2020 small scale farmers are exposed to unmitigated socio economic risks because the effects of drought on agricultural productivity are incredibly severe and farmers lack appropriate soil water management options thornton et al 2017 according to meteorological legacy data the temperature in tharaka nithi county increased while the annual rainfall declined between 1960 and 2009 gioto et al 2016 in addition soil moisture stress and temperature increases will likely occur with greater frequency in tharaka nithi county and several arid and semiarid ssa regions in the future moalf ministry of agriculture

conservation options zougmoré et al 2014 tied ridging is a successful climate smart agricultural technology under various cereal and legume cropping systems in arid and semiarid areas thornton et al 2017 ngetich et al 2014b the technology can improve moisture storage and enhance crops efficient water and nutrient utilization kiboi et al 2021 tied ridging saves soil moisture within the root zone improving the probability of crop survival during extended periods of dry spells and meteorological drought gan et al 2013 applying farmyard manure combined with tied ridges increased grain yield in kenya compared to farms without tied ridges mwende et al 2019 ngetich et al 2014b found that tied ridges significantly improved soil properties and crop yields in the semiarid conditions of kenya the economic benefits of climate smart agricultural technologies such as tied ridges are essential for farmer adoption many studies on tied ridging have focused on the relationship between tied ridging and crop yield while few studies have addressed their effects on soil water status under different soils rainfall regimes and crops muluneh 2020 observed that future climate change in the ethiopian drylands is likely to affect the maize yield negatively and proposed tied ridges and better soil fertility adaptation measures to offset the negative impacts of climate change studies must examine the productivity and profitability of tied ridging and input application under different soil types and climates characterized by variable dry spells and meteorological drought regimes an integrated method intended to achieve an adequate supply of soil water and nutrients efficiently and cost effectively is necessary for semiarid small scale agricultural systems in addition integrated tillage and nutrient management practices are required for sustainable crop production especially in agroecological zones where soil fertility and moisture stress limit crop response to input applications the objectives of this study were as follows i to determine the impacts of tied ridging and integrated soil fertility management technologies on soil water conservation and maize yields and ii to estimate the economic returns of tied ridging and integrated soil fertility management technologies we hypothesized that combining organic resources manure or tithonia with inorganic fertilizer and tied ridging can increase maize yields and net benefits for small scale farmers in semiarid agricultural systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this field experiment was implemented in

forest ecosystem 2 2 experiment design and management the experiment implemented a randomized complete block design rcbd with eight treatments replicated four times table 2 the selected treatments included tithonia diversifolia inorganic fertilizer cattle manure inorganic fertilizer sole inorganic fertilizer and control in combination with tied ridging or no tied ridging tithonia and cattle manure organic resources were selected to capture the varying organic resource qualities lignin c and n contents including high quality organic resources tithonia and low quality organic resources cattle manure palm et al 2001 the gross plot dimensions were 6 m by 4 5 m with a 1 m wide path left between plots maize zea mays l variety h516 was the test crop it was planted at 0 75 m x 0 50 m spacing between and within maize rows respectively three seeds per hill were sown to guarantee the greatest plant population and thinned out two weeks after germination to retain two plants per hill hence a plant population density of 53333 plants ha 1 was attained npk 23 23 0 was applied at a full rate of 60 kg n ha 1 and 60 kg p ha 1 for treatments without organic inputs while this was applied at a half rate of 30 kg n ha 1 and 30 kg p ha 1 fertilizer use recommendation project furp furp 1987 for treatments that integrated organic and inorganic soil inputs organic inputs including tithonia diversifolia and animal manure were incorporated in the soil using a hand hoe two weeks before planting tithonia diversifolia was locally harvested from nearby biomass transfer hedges weighed chopped then incorporated into the soil representative samples from the organic inputs were taken to the laboratory for n content determination tithonia diversifolia had 3 8 n while animal manure had 2 1 n using a cn analyzer from these results the amount of organic inputs to be applied to give an equivalent of 30 kg n ha 1 was calculated weeding was carried out twice in each season using a hand hoe tillage was also done by hand hoeing to a depth of about 0 15 m before the onset of the season tied ridges were constructed at the commencement of each cropping season for required experimental plots and reconstructed during weeding and when they collapsed during heavy rainfall events throughout the season 2 3 soil sampling and soil moisture and rainfall measurement soil sampling for soil characterization was composited for each plot using the zigzag sampling framework at 0 20 cm depth using a soil auger at the start of the experiment soil water content measurements were determined using a diviner 2000 capacitance sensor sentek sensor technologies stepney south australia at regular 10 cm depths in a pvc access tube installed in the middle net plot area of the experimental plots the rainfall data were measured on a daily basis using a hobo automatic weather station tipping bucket rain gauge smart sensor with a resolution of 0 2 mm the daily rainfall was determined as a product of the daily number of bucket tips logged in by 0 2 mm resolution 2 4 soil sample analysis in the laboratory the soil samples were oven dried at 40 c for 72 h after which they were ground

soil texture was determined by the hydrometer method okalebo et al 2002 both total soil nitrogen and soil carbon were determined using the flash combustion method with the cn elemental analyzer krotz et al 2013 the soil p was determined using mehlich 3 mehlich 1984 method while exchangeable cations were determined using the ammonium acetate extraction method field capacity and wilting point thresholds were estimated from soil texture and organic carbon content using pedo transfer functions available in the hydraulic properties calculator after saxton and rawls 2006 2 5 crop yields and profitability determination maize grain and stover samples were harvested from a net plot area of 21 m2 in the middle of the gross plot area and the total maize grain weight was determined after threshing the grain weights were adjusted to 12 5 moisture content after two weeks of air drying the samples using a moisture meter ten maize plants were randomly selected and harvested within the net plot area after which their dry weights were extrapolated to estimate the total above ground biomass for each plot the net benefits returns to labor and benefit cost ratios were used as the economic assessment tools following cimmyt 1988 guidelines to assess the profitability of different treatments benefits and costs associated with each treatment were evaluated relative to not using different soil fertility inputs with tied ridging the cost of farm inputs was estimated using local farm input dealers prices while manure prices were based on local valuation with farmers and converted to us

rains and 0 53 mg ha 1 short rains while maize stover yields were 4 7 and 3 3 mg ha 1 in both seasons respectively due to the impacts of the seasonal decline in rainfall maize grain and stover yields ranged from 0 52 mg ha 1 to 4 87 mg ha 1 and 2 89 mg ha 1 to 5 77 mg ha 1 respectively table 4 the highest grain and stover yields 4 87 mg ha 1 and 5 76 mg ha 1 were observed during the long rains trtif there were significant differences in tied ridging and soil fertility management inputs on maize grain yields during the long rain season p 0 0001 table 4 while there were no differences observed in stover yield among treatments manure and tithonia diversifolia plus inorganic fertilizer recorded the highest grain yields significant differences were not observed in grain yield among all treatments without tied ridging in the long rains in the long rains treatments with tied ridging fertilizer and organic soil inputs recorded significantly higher maize grain yields than treatments without tied ridging during the short rain season treatments similarly recorded significant p 0 0001 and p 0 0035 respectively effects on grain and stover yields the highest grain yields were observed in manure or tithonia diversifolia inorganic fertilizer with and with no tied ridging in the same season maize grain yields increased by 100 under manure inorganic fertilizer with and with no tied ridging table 4 compared with the control the trtif treatment contributed 169 more grain yield over the control while trmif contributed 127 extra grain yield in the long rains ntrmif and trmif generated 140 and 121 extra grain in the short rain season for stover ntrtif and trtif generated over 20 gains long rains while the same treatments contributed over 65 more stover over the control in the short rains generally soil treatments that integrated organic inputs and inorganic fertilizers performed better than sole inorganic fertilizers or those without tied ridging in addition treatments with tied ridging tended to record lower standard deviation values in grain and stover yields than treatments without tied ridging table 4 3 4 economic returns soil management treatments recorded significant p 0 05 effects with net benefits bcr benefit cost ratios and returns to labor during all cropping seasons tithonia diversifolia with inorganic fertilizer and tied ridging recorded the

to be highest in trtif followed by ntrtif ntrmif trmif ntrif trc and trif during the sr season net benefits were higher in soil management treatments with no tied ridging than those with tied ridging except the tithonia diversifolia treatment trtif which had higher benefits than the ntrtif treatment 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content intra seasonal drought periods were experienced in the study during both seasons the short rains had two events during 47 114 dap and 117 144 dap respectively there were dry spell events between 31 and 44 dap days after planting 50 77 dap and 83 97 dap during the long rain cropping season a meteorological drought defined as the absence of rainfall for a duration 28 days during the growing season and dry spells absence of rainfall in periods ranging between 10 and 28 days during the cropping season kiboi et al 2017 were experienced dry spells were more common in the long rains while meteorological droughts were more prominent in the short rains consistent with mucheru muna et al 2014 seasonal rainfall amount and distribution were highly significant in all the parameters under investigation in this study as mucheru muna et al 2014 observed dry spells mostly occurred during the peak periods of crop water requirement rockström et al 2010 reported that sub humid agroecosystems experience a high frequency of droughts dry spells and rainfall variability thus adequate soil crop water management strategies are needed adequate climate smart agricultural management strategies are required in the ssa region s small scale semiarid agroecosystems which typically lack supplementary irrigation and are likely to experience extreme weather and climate extremes essential to crop growth and productivity start days and the end of a rainy period and thus its length plus rainfall amounts and risk of dry spells within the season are pertinent aspects because they strongly affect crop yields ngetich et al 2014b during all seasons the meteorological drought and dry spell conditions influenced soil moisture distribution in the 0 30 cm soil depth during these periods tied ridging without organic inputs was insufficient in soil moisture conservation since there was little or no rainwater to be held in the basins tied ridging is likely to benefit the maize crop in fine textured soils and for seasonal rainfall between 500 and 900 mm during drought or dry years wiyo et al 2000 the results therefore did not agree with similar studies that recorded higher soil water storage where tied ridges were employed gan et al 2013 this was due to the rainfall amounts in these studies either being higher or better distributed as well compared to patterns observed in this study treatments with organic inputs performed best in holding soil water relative to those without while tied ridges without organics led to the least aggregate soil moisture gains this was likely due to the improved soil physical conditions under these treatments increasing the available soil water holding capacity enfors et al 2011 this finding was supported by hudson 1994 who found that soil organic matter and soil moisture content had a highly significant positive correlation manure is well known to build up soil organic matter leading to improved soil physical conditions resulting from enhanced soil aggregation porosity hydrophobicity infiltration rate and water holding capacity abiven et al 2009 these results were in tandem with adeleye et al 2010 and brar et al 2015 who observed that manure conserved soil moisture improved soil physicochemical properties and reduced soil temperature which minimized evaporation celik et al 2004 also observed that the application of manure increased soil organic matter contents and soil water content by 56 the integrated application of tithonia diversifolia and inorganic fertilizer manifested higher soil moisture levels than the control treatment this was likely due to increased soil organic matter and reductions in soil temperature and evaporation resulting from plant residue decomposition babajide et al 2008 being a high quality organic soil resource the high rate of tithonia diversifolia decay and integration results in improved soil hydrological properties during the short term compared to other organic materials kolawole et al 2014 soil organic matter reduces soil bulk density and compaction adekalu and osunbitan 1995 improving soil aggregation resulting in greater soil porosity thus retaining more soil moisture osunbitan and adekalu 1999 during the cropping season improvements in soil organic matter improved the soil structure which enhanced the infiltration capacity of rainwater thereby increasing soil water retention and availability for crop growth kolawole et al 2014 tithonia diversifolia is likely to have improved the soil s organic and hydrologic characteristics after its rapid decomposition larger soil moisture gains were achieved in the short rain season 2 3 which included meteorological droughts compared to the long rain season 0 6 characterized by dry spells and higher rainfall distribution aggregated across depth treatment and time over the control this represented a much greater moisture gain in the short rain season compared to the long rains relative to the control motsi et al 2004 found that tied ridges retained significantly higher soil moisture than conventional tillage systems especially during the dry months the effect of the ridges was reported to be generally higher in drier seasons and more so when the ends of the ridges were tied compared to open ridges in southern africa belay et al 1998 the observed higher soil water content in the long rains than the short rains resulted from higher rainfall that was better distributed than in the short rain season mchugh et al 2007 observed fluctuations in soil water content due to rainfall variability between and within seasons due to the rainfall pattern the soil profile was characterized by water accumulation and depletion throughout the two seasons each season the first half received much of the rainfall with the rest experiencing drier periods following rainfall events treatments under tied ridging retained more rainwater than those without also treatments with organic resources manure or tithonia contributed to significant soil water conservation especially in the short rains evidence also suggests that tied ridges and organic soil inputs were critical in conserving soil moisture in the dry season during the critical maize tasselling and silking growth stage this could be due to the tied ridges ability to trap rainwater instead of the flatbeds okeyo et al 2014 ngetich et al 2014b the penetration of rainwater and the resultant retention in the soil profile is influenced by several factors including the amount intensity and distribution of rainfall in addition to the soil s physical properties moraru and rusu 2013 4 2 maize yields tithonia diversifolia with inorganic fertilizer and manure generally improved grain and stover yields in both cropping seasons relative to the control treatment the good grain yields achieved by tithonia could be attributed to nutrient supply by rapid decomposition providing an effective source of n p and k as well as ca k and mg mugwe et al 2009 mucheru muna et al 2014 jama et al 2000 found that tithonia biomass increased maize yields compared to inorganic fertilizers at equivalent n p and k rates several other studies have reported increased maize yield where tithonia diversifolia was used in combination with inorganic fertilizer as compared to sole inorganic fertilizers nziguheba and mutuo 2000 mucheru muna et al 2007 gikonyo et al 2010 however tithonia diversifolia is labor intensive in cutting carrying and incorporating jama et al 2000 though tithonia is labor demanding its opportunity cost is relatively low because farmers will cut it when it is dry with no other activities compared to manure which has a higher opportunity cost it s high quality organic content and nutrient values justify its application as a soil fertility management resource integrating manure with inorganic fertilizers also increased maize grain and stover yields during 2016 than the control treatment combining manure with inorganic fertilizers increases nutrient availability and enables better synchronization of nutrient release and uptake chivenge et al 2011 gicheru 2012 mucheru muna et al 2014 an increase of 650 in maize grain yields was reported by mwende et al 2019 after applying manure combined with inorganic fertilizers compared to the control treatment the study affirmed that using organic resources combined with inorganic fertilizers is a better option for increasing maize and stover yields several authors in the ssa agreed that mixing inorganic fertilizer and organic inputs produced the highest and most sustainable gains in yields per unit of applied nutrients mugwe et al 2009 vanlauwe et al 2010 mucheru muna et al 2014 mugwe et al 2019 gachengo et al 1999 reported that in most cases combined treatments would lead to higher yields because of the additive effect of the organic and inorganic nutrients compared to organic or inorganic treatments applied solely moreover fertilizer use efficiency is increased by these combinations as they supply nutrients more balanced and other multiple agroecological benefits sanginga and woomer 2009 vanlauwe et al 2010 a meta analysis indicated that combined applications of inorganic and organic fertilizers led to greater productivity and agronomic efficiency responses compared to sole applications gram et al 2020 tied ridging performed better in enhancing grain yields during the long rain season than in the short rain this can be attributed to the higher amount of rainfall received which was better distributed than the short rain season fig 1 the better performance of tied ridging corroborates the findings of belay et al 1998 who reported maize yield increases on vertisols of eastern ethiopia where tied ridges were employed relative to flat planting in mbeere south sub county similar results were observed where tied ridging had the highest increase in maize grain yields 1 23 mg ha 1 compared to mulching and the control ngetich 2012 araya and stroosnijder 2010 also reported a 44 increase in maize grain yield under tied ridging relative to the control the low performance of soil fertility treatments under tied ridging in the short rains may have resulted from poor rainfall distribution and meteorological droughts observed during the season hulugalle 1987 obtained similar results where treatments with tied ridging had no significant effect compared to those without tied ridging in other studies bayu et al 2012 did not observe significant responses of crop growth and yields to tied ridges the immensity of the growth and yield response to the relative performance of tied ridges varies with several factors including fertilization total amount and rainfall distribution among others during the cropping season bayu et al 2012 4 3 economic benefits of treatments the low performance of economic benefits in the short rain season was connected with lower yields realized due to changes in rainfall after farm investments had been incurred at the season onset higher economic net benefits were realized under integrated organic and inorganic fertilizer treatments relative to fertilizer and control treatments in both seasons this is likely the result of higher maize yields that were observed under these treatments these findings agree with nziguheba et al 2002 and mucheru muna et al 2014 who found greater benefits when combining tithonia diversifolia with inorganic fertilizer integrating organic inputs and inorganic fertilizers generated positive net benefits bcr and returns to labor in all seasons denise and meike 2020 found that integrated soil fertility management strategies resulted in higher labor demand but the approach also increased labor productivity and financial returns mutegi et al 2012 highlighted that combined organic inputs and inorganic fertilizers exhibited higher net benefits and bcr than sole fertilizer applications this can be associated with the ability of this integration to greatly increase crop yields in tandem generating higher economic proceeds jama et al 2000 nonetheless this approach may also be hindered by the high proportional requirements for organic inputs and labor necessities for cutting carrying and incorporating these organics jama et al 2000 during the short rains all the treatments besides the sole inorganic fertilizer with and without tied ridging treatments had a bcr 2 considered the minimum bcr in determining the adoption of a given farming practice in smallholder farming systems fao 2006 this means that the yields and the accrued benefits associated with the soil fertility inputs with and without tied ridging in this study could offset the labor and non labor costs incurred however due to the low benefits realized the soil fertility inputs with and without tied ridging could not reach the minimum bcr of 2 during the short rain season 5 conclusions dry spells characterized the long rain season in the experiment while the short rain period featured meteorological droughts results showed enhanced soil water content and maize grain yields under soil fertility inputs treatments with tithonia diversifolia or manure combined with inorganic fertilizer with or without tied ridging consistently positively affected soil water content the effect of soil moisture conservation on soil water content was greater in the short rain season compared to the long rains in terms of soil moisture gains relative to the control tied ridging and organic applications led to soil moisture conservation during critical maize tasselling and silking stages in both seasons in aggregate terms across soil moisture yield and economic benefits over the control treatment integrated treatments recorded the highest moisture benefits relative to the control integrated treatments recorded the highest moisture benefits over the control across time at 10 30 cm depths ntrif contributed the highest moisture benefits over the control at 10 30 cm across time while trif recorded the least benefits across soil moisture yield and profit measures sole fertilizer and tied ridging tended to register intermediate benefits over the control across agronomic and economic measures in the study emerging from the study is the lack of a consistent advantage of tied ridging over no ridging within the period under consideration these underpin the need to research long term effects 4 seasons of tied ridging and soil fertility inputs on soil physical properties crop performance and profitability under erratic and changing rainfall regimes of the central highlands of kenya tied ridging and organic treatments potentially contribute to soil moisture conservation under dry spells and meteorological drought conditions especially in the short rain season therefore climate smart in situ soil water conservation interventions are needed in the ssa region s semiarid zones to reduce the risk of crop failure under erratic drought conditions and variable climatic scenarios

8882,organic inorganic fouling in brackish water drip irrigation systems bwdis reduces the irrigation and fertigation uniformity resulting in decreased crop yield and quality this study investigates the effect of chelated fertilizers on organic inorganic fouling compared with control group ck application of fe ethylenediamine di o hydroxy phenyl acetic acid eddha fe effectively prevented the multiple fouling by reducing the deposition of inorganic precipitate and particulate and organic fouling fulvic acid chelated iron fertilizer fa fe alleviated multiple fouling by drastically decreasing the precipitate and particulate fouling although organic fouling was slightly increased conversely amino acid chelated iron fertilizer aa fe slightly decreased the precipitate fouling while drastically accelerated the particulate and organic fouling leading to severe clogging accordingly eddha fe and fa fe prevented the bwdis fouling by 32 6 41 8 and 16 1 29 0 while aa fe accelerated by 36 9 45 4 moreover chelated fertilizers fa fe aa fe and eddha fe demonstrated better anti fouling than inorganic iron fertilizer feso4 however eddha fe would have negative environmental impact hence fa fe is strongly recommended from the perspectives of fouling mitigation and soil environmental health improvement efficiency these results may provide a new guideline for applying chelated fertilizers in bwdis to prevent organic inorganic fouling and overcome agricultural pollution keywords emitter clogging brackish water multiple fouling fertilizer type irrigation uniformity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwater scarcity has emerged a major threat to global environmental sustainability and agricultural safety boretti and rosa 2019 ma et al 2020b rosa et al 2020 appropriate utilization of brackish water bw for agricultural irrigation is a promising solution to address the global freshwater crisis liu et al 2021a yan et al 2021 however bw contained a huge quantity of scaling ions e g ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 colloidal particles and natural organic matter nom resulting in organic and inorganic fouling in brackish water drip irrigation systems bwdis muhammad et al 2022a park et al 2019 pipeline clogging and corrosion increased energy expenditure and bwdis flow resistance are the major consequences fouling song et al 2021 xiao et al 2020b furthermore clogging of bwdis will directly affect the irrigation and fertigation uniformity enhance soil salinization and excessive fertilizer applications wang et al 2022b thus leads to environmental risks accelerated replacement cycles of plastic pipelines which will eventually exacerbate the plastic input to the environment kawecki and nowack 2019 sang et al 2021 at present chemical regents e g scale inhibitors acidification and chlorination are the key approaches to prevent fouling ketrane et al 2009 song et al 2017 yan et al 2019 yu et al 2018 however these methods are being restricted due to harmful human health risk of chemical storage and handling the long term microbial tolerance negative impacts on soil and crops and other adverse environmental issues guo et al 2022 song et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore the development of alternate eco friendly approaches for fouling mitigation in bwdis is in urgent need recently the breakthroughs in the fertilizer sector offer a viable strategy to overcome the fouling associated issues in bwdis muhammad et al 2021 xiao et al 2020a chelating fertilizers due to their ability to remediate agricultural soil and improve the crop production and quality are being widely used in agricultural applications huang et al 2021 xu et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 furthermore chelated fertilizers due to low cost eco friendly and effectiveness attracted wide attention for fouling mitigation ang et al 2011 kim et al 2020 yoon et al 1998 wang et al 2022a reported that adding edta cu could prevent formation of calcium and silica fouling li et al 2022 showed that fulvic acid chelated fertilizers altered the gypsum crystal structure and effectively delay precipitation consequently reducing the scaling inorganic fouling ge et al 2020 found that humic acid chelated agent inhibited the phosphate adsorption on caco3 scaling surfaces thus prevented the calcium and phosphorus precipitation the previous research on chelated fertilizers antifouling abilities mainly focused on inorganic fouling however bw not only contains active amounts of dissolved salts and suspended particles muhammad et al 2022a but also natural organic matter park et al 2019 thus resulting in multi type combined fouling organic and inorganic the effects of chelated fertilizers on organic and inorganic fouling in bwdis still remain largely unknown moreover the complicated behaviors of multiple fouling mostly resulted from intense interactions among organic and inorganic foulants quay et al 2018 this study hypothesizes chelating fertilizers based adsorption removing ca2 binding with organic fouling reducing potential interaction between organic and inorganic fouling however the interaction mechanisms of chelated fertilizer effects multiple fouling are still elusive iron is a vital ingredient for crop development to promote chlorophyll synthesis nitrogen fixation and respiration suzuki et al 2021 although fe is enriched in soil it is typically restricted by the precipitation of insoluble fe iii oxyhydroxide complexes in saline alkali soil rajniak et al 2018 thus chelated iron fertilizer use in saline alkali soils is unavoidable two types of natural chelated iron fertilizers fulvic acid chelated iron fertilizer fa fe and amino acid chelated iron fertilizer aa fe and one type of synthetics chelate iron fertilizers fe ethylenediamine di o hydroxy phenyl acetic acid eddha fe were investigated the main objectives of this study was to a evaluate the efficiency of different chelated iron fertilizer on mitigation of organic inorganic fouling b reveal the mechanism of chelated iron fertilizer influence on organic inorganic fouling c propose the appropriate mode of chelated iron fertilizer application in bwdis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental infrastructure an outdoor experimental platform which resembles bwdis was used to cultivate multiple fouling fig 1 each testing platform consisted of four layers and each layer was facilitated with 18 m drip irrigation pipelines having 55 emitters uniformly distributed along each pipeline a total of three types of emitters were installed being their structural parameters shown in table s3 total trial duration was 840 h testing systems were operated for 12 h each day 7 00 am 7 00 pm the bw for experiment came from local groundwater located in tongzhou experimental station beijing china the bw water quality parameters of bw are illustrated in table s1 the bw was stored temporarily in the storage tanks and filtered by laminated filter 150 mesh before entering into drip irrigation systems 2 2 experimental treatments this study selected two types of natural fe complex fertilizers fulvic acid chelated iron fertilizer fa fe and amino acid chelated iron fertilizer aa fe one type of synthetic iron chelate fertilizers eddha fe and one inorganic iron fertilizer feso4 table s2 overall five different treatments were designated as follows fa fe aa fe eddha fe feso4 and ck non fertilization the concentrations of fertilizers were maintained as 0 30 g l the system was operated once a day to mimic irrigation conditions in agriculture throughout the system operation fertilization was applied every other day the total amount of fertilizer and irrigation water applied in each drip irrigation pipeline was 33 75 g day and 0 45 m3 day respectively 2 3 evaluation of bwdis hydraulic performance the multiple fouling directly affects the bwdis hydraulic performance the average discharge variation ratio dra was used to evaluate the hydraulic performance of bwdis the test method was based on li et al 2019b the detailed calculation methods are described in section 1 1 of supplemental materials 2 4 water

international group beijing china according to gb 5749 2006 water quality samples were obtained every 120 h during the system operation 2 5 detection and evaluation of multiple fouling multiple fouling samples each treatment was collected after every 120 h during the experiment at each sampling time a single drip irrigation pipeline was retrieved from the testing platform and 18 emitters were randomly chosen from drip irrigation pipelines the detection method of multiple fouling was based on muhammad et al 2022b 2 5 1 fouling weights the collected emitters were dried at 70 c the emitter samples with fouling on them dw1 were weighed using a high precision electronic weight balance accuracy 10 4 g hereafter the emitter samples were placed in a plastic bag with a zip lock closure added 20 ml of deionized water and bags were placed inside of an ultrasonic cleaning bath granbo china type gbs gw1530 working power 900 w frequency 40 khz for 65 min to completely eliminate the fouling the cleaned and dried emitters were reweighed again to determine the dw2 the difference between dw1 and dw2 was the total weight of fouling substance 2 5 2 minerals components in fouling the mineral components in fouling were measured using an x ray diffractometer bruker ger type jv qcvelox the test parameters of the machine were similar as liu et al 2021c the obtained polycrystalline diffraction patterns were analyzed using the supporting topas software bruker axs 2009 to determine the relative proportions of precipitate fouling and particulate fouling 2 5 3 organic matter components in fouling fouling was dried at 110 c to a consistent weight then burned for 4 h at 550 c the burning temperature of 550 c was chosen to completely decompose the organic components while avoiding the loss of inorganic components tang et al 2016 the weight of the fouling after ignition at 550 c showed the amount of inorganic fouling and the weight of the mass loss during ignition at 550 c showed the amount of organic fouling the test method was based on khan et al 2013 2 5 4 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 usa thermo 400 was applied to investigate the organic functional groups of fouling from 4000 500 cm 1 a range of wavenumbers was tested the test method was based on cai et al 2022 2 5 5 excitation emission matrix eem analysis a three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem hitachi japan f7000 used to analyze the organic matter composition of fouling the wavelength of excitation

the surface morphologies of multiple fouling were examined by scanning electron microscopy jeol japan jsm 6510a elemental mapping using energy dispersive spectrometry eds was used to investigate the elemental presence of multiple fouling 2 6 statistical analysis spss ver 22 0 ibm usa was used for basic statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was applied to determine significant differences in dry weights organic and inorganic content among different treatments the correlation between water quality parameters and organic inorganic content were also examined by spearman analyses structural equation modelling analysis sema was conducted by amos v 24 to analyze the direct and indirect correlations between chelated fertilizer water quality metrics organic inorganic fouling content and dra of bwdis 3 results 3 1 influence of chelated fertilizer on water quality bwdis hydraulic performance and fouling content the results indicate that chelated fertilizers obvious changed the water quality parameters fig 2a i compared with non fertilization treatment ck eddha fe treatment decreased the content of sm fig 2a cod fig 2b ca2 fig 2d mg2 fig 2e ec fig 2 g and d50 fig

content of sm ca2 mg2 ec ph and d50 while increased cod zeta and fe3 furthermore differences obvious were found between chelated fertilizers treatments and inorganic iron fertilizer compared with feso4 chelated fertilizers decreased the content of sm mg2 ca2 ec fe3 ph and psd while increased the zeta and cod the dynamic changes of bwdis hydraulic performance and fouling total content are shown in fig 3a b with system operation the total amount of fouling was continuously increased while dra of bwdis was continuously decreased moreover the chelated fertilizers significantly p 0 05 affected the total fouling fig 3b compared with ck eddha fe and fa fe obviously controlled the total amount of fouling by 32 6 41 8 and 16 1 29 0 and increased the dra of bwdis by 12 6 16 7 and 6 9 9 4 fig 3a b however aa fe accelerated the total amount of fouling by 36 9 45 4 and decreased the dra of bwdis by 8 3 14 6 fig 3a b moreover significant differences p 0 05 were found among chelated and inorganic iron fertilizer compared with feso4 treatment chelated fertilizers reduced the total amount of fouling by 7 4 62 9 consequently increased the dra of bwdis by 4 9 25 8 3 2 influence of chelated fertilizer on fouling component proportions and surface morphology fig 3f shows multiple fouling contained inorganic and organic fouling which accounted for 52 4 90 1 and 9 9 47 6 of total content of fouling chelated fertilizers significantly influenced the proportions of fouling compared to ck fa fe aa fe treatment increased the proportions of organic fouling by 10 6 14 1 and 21 4 28 4 while decreased the proportions of inorganic fouling by 10 6 14 1 and 21 4 28 4 eddha fe treatment decreased the proportions of organic fouling by 5 3 7 4 while increased the proportions of inorganic fouling by 5 3 7 4 the surface morphologies of multiple fouling fig 4a were visualized by scanning electron microscopy sem compared to ck the fouling surface morphologies were found loose and more porous when eddha fe and fa fe were applied in contrast the application of aa fe made the fouling layer denser the results of fig s4 further show that chelated fertilizers treatment has an obvious effect on the fouling particle size compared with ck eddha fe and fa fe reduced d50 of particle size by 22 1 34 2 µm and 12 6 28 4 µm while aa fe increased d50 of particle size by 4 3 18 5 µm moreover the d50 of particle size treated with chelated fertilizers is 14 8 63 3 µm less than that of inorganic iron fertilizer 3 3 influence of chelated fertilizer on inorganic fouling xrd patterns shown fig 3e seven mineral components appeared in inorganic fouling precipitate fouling i e calcite aragonite and monohydrate calcite particulate fouling muscovite feldspar silica and chlorites the proportions of precipitate fouling and particulate fouling were 47 5 72 2 and 27 8 52 5 respectively fig s2 the accumulative contents of precipitate particulate fouling are shown in fig 5 the results indicate that the content of the precipitate and particulate fouling generally increased as the system operates moreover the results of this study show that chelated fertilizer significantly p 0 05 affected precipitate fouling fig 5e f and g compared to ck eddha fe fa fe and aa fe decreased the precipitate fouling by 7 8 8 4 mg cm2 5 5 6 1 mg cm2 and 3 4 4 1 mg cm2 fig s2a meanwhile chelated fertilizer also significantly p 0 05 affected particulates fouling fig 5a b c and d compared to ck eddha fe and fa fe decreased the content of particulates fouling by 4 9 5 3 mg cm2 and 3 4 4 0 mg cm2 while aa fe increased the content of particulates fouling by 0 6 0 9 mg cm2 fig s2b 3 4 influence of chelated fertilizer on organic fouling the continuous changes in organic fouling fig 3c indicated that chelated fertilizer significantly p 0 05 influenced the content of organic fouling compared to ck the organic fouling in fa fe and aa fe treatment increased by 2 8 5 3 mg cm2 and 16 7 22 1 mg cm2 while the organic fouling in eddha fe treatment decreased 3 8 6 8 mg cm2 in addition significant differences were found in the effects of chelated and inorganic iron fertilizers on fouling compared to feso4 treatment chelated fertilizer reduced the contents of organic fouling by 5 5 13 7 mg cm2 ftir spectra fig 6a can reveal some information about the characteristic function groups in multiple fouling the ftir showed the characteristic peaks of polysaccharide and protein appeared in the fouling under all treatments such as the o h stretching vibration band of polysaccharides at 3380 cm 1 asymmetric stretching of the coo band at 1610 cm 1 amide iii infrared band at 1340 cm 1 c h out of plane bending band at 833 cm 1 compared to ck the fa fe and aa fe treatments made the peak intensities of polysaccharide and protein higher while the eddha fe treatment made them lower this was similar with what fig 3c showed which indicated eddha fe treatment reduced polysaccharide protein fouling while fa fe and aa fe enhanced it fig 6b shows the three dimensional fluorescence spectrum of the fouling the major organic matters in ck treatment are aromatic proteins like tyrosine regions i tryptophan regions ii fulvic acids regions iii soluble microbial products regions iv humic acids regions iv compared to ck the eddha fe reduced the intensity of organic fluorescence peaks regions i ii iii iv v in addition the variations in fluorescence response proved that fa fe mainly enhanced intensity fluorescence peaks of fulvic acids regions iii and aa fe enhanced intensity fluorescence peaks of aromatic proteins regions i ii compared to ck 3 5 controlling pathway of chelated fertilizer on multiple fouling chelated fertilizer has a considerable impact on water quality parameters fig 2 which directly affected to the formation of multiple fouling spearmen s correlation shown in fig 7a indicated the correlations between water quality parameters inorganic i e calcite aragonite monohydrate calcite muscovite feldspar silica and chlorites and organic fouling particularly ca2 mg2 fe3 sm cod zeta and ph had significant correlations p 0 05 with inorganic and organic fouling that demonstrated these water quality parameters were the most critical factors in multiple fouling formation structural equation modelling analysis fig 7b demonstrated the significance of the relevant correlations between water quality parameters inorganic and organic fouling overall chelated fertilizer application directly alters the concentrations of ca2 mg2 fe3 sm cod zeta and ph in bw and also indirectly changed the content of inorganic fouling and organic fouling which then changed total amount of fouling in bwdis furthermore the structural equation model revealed that organic and inorganic fouling obvious interacted with one another with a correlation coefficient of 0 71 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of chelated fertilizer on organic fouling this study revealed eddha fe fertilizer decrease the content of organic fouling by 3 8 6 8 mg cm2 when compared with ck eddha fe was capable of direct separation of organically bound calcium from organic fouling to form a stable water soluble chelate via the chelation of the eddha fe functional groups block et al 1974 which significantly reduced the synergistic interaction between organic and inorganic foulants li et al 2019a consequently the organic calcium gel networks being destroyed the fouling structure eventually became loose and decreased the particle size fig 4 the loose structure of fouling was easily flushed out with water in bwdis liu et al 2019 compared to ck the fa fe increased the organic fouling by 2 8 5 3 mg cm2 this might be due to fa fe fertilizers contain a high concentration of organic molecules fulvic acid which dissolve as colloids in bw fulvic acid tendency to aggregate organic fouling fig 2c when present in bw containing high concentration of salt ion e g ca2 mg2 tang et al 2014 the carboxylic groups in fulvic acid form complexes with ca2 known as the egg box model neutralizing the negative charge of fulvic acid molecules resulting in a thick compact gel fouling layer on the surface of membrane park et al 2021 moreover the fulvic acid particles settled on pipe surfaces will alter the surface roughness causing more natural organic matter nom in natural water sources to be adsorbed and forming a large amount of organic fouling guo et al 2020 ly et al 2019 the aa fe caused the worst organic fouling compared to ck the reason for the growth in organic fouling was similar the application of fa fe the aa fe fertilizer resulted in high concentrations of amino acids in bw leads to increase the organic fouling however the content organic fouling of aa fe was higher than fa fe by 18 4 23 6 mg cm2 fig 3d one possible reason could be the molecular weight of amino acids was smaller than fulvic acid resulting in more compact amino acid flocs than fulvic acid flocs in bw ren et al 2021 amino acid formation of compact flocs may make the fouling on pipe surfaces less porous and much more resistant fig 4a dense and compact fouling are comparatively difficult to remove shen et al 2022 on the other hand due to the weaker ability of amino acids to chelate metals than fulvic acids the amino acid fe colloid released by aa fe fertilizer in bw is less stable than the fulvic acid fe colloid released by fa fe in bw orsetti et al 2013 consequently the amino acid fe colloid releases more fe2 in the bw than the fulvic acid fe colloid fig s1 and these fe2 ions are rapidly oxidized to fe3 ions fig 2h fe3 ion preferentially forms coordination bonds with organic matter terminal carboxyl groups resulting in a massive increase in organic fouling 4 2 mechanism of chelated fertilizer on inorganic fouling this study fig 3c demonstrated that eddha fe mitigated inorganic fouling in bwdis mainly decreasing the content of precipitate and particulate fouling the reduction in precipitate fouling was due to the various active functional groups present in eddha fe e g coo oh yehuda et al 2003 active functional groups of distinct structure eddha fe could chelate ca2 mg2 and other metal cations which reduced the probability of that scaling anions reactions with ca2 and mg2 and significantly decreases the formation of precipitate fouling nowack 2008 the chelation reaction of eddha is shown in fig s5 moreover the decrease in particulate fouling was probably due to the application of eddha fe increased the absolute value of zeta potential in bw fig 2f leading to reduce the degree of flocculation of particles which ultimately leads to the reduction of particulate fouling muhammad et al 2022a in addition the chelate complex formed by eddha fe could be adsorbed on the surface of precipitate fouling which hinders the adhesion and aggregation between precipitate and particulate fouling jegatheesan et al 2012 compared to ck fa fe fertilizer also dramatically decreased the content of precipitate and particulate fouling fig 3c precipitate fouling control mechanisms were similar to eddha fe fa fe has a significant number of active functional groups with high adsorption capability active functional groups may alter the crystal shape and extend the crystallization induction time which could limit the growth of precipitate fouling wang et al 2022b the acidic character of the fa fe solution also contributed responsible for the reduced carbonate levels fig 2i since it facilitates the conversion of co3 2 to hco3 preventing precipitate fouling production ma et al 2020a after the application of aa fe the content of precipitate fouling reduced similar to fa fe this was mainly due to reduce water ph and competitive adsorption of ca2 and mg2 ions however fa fe and aa fe treatments differed significantly p 0 01 in precipitate fouling the fa fe treatments had higher inhibitory capacity on precipitate than the aa fe treatments the reason was that fa fe fertilizer has a stronger functional group activity than aa fe henrichs and sugai 1993 nantsis and carper 1998 consequently aa fe has a lesser chelating activity for calcium and magnesium ions than fa fe resulting in a weaker precipitate fouling inhibition capacity on the other hand compared to ck aa fe promoted the particulate fouling this may be due to the fact that as compared to eddha fe and fa fe the use of aa fe increased the most organic fouling organic fouling would adhere to suspended particles aggravate particle deposition li et al 2021 and ultimately accelerate the development of particulate fouling li et al 2021 4 3 practical implications although this study showed how chelated fertilizer application affected fouling of bwdis it is still important to assess the practical implications at the agricultural field level feso4 fertilizer most frequently applied inorganic iron fertilizer in bwdis was compared with chelated fertilizer our findings show that chelated fertilizer has a higher anti fouling ability than feso4 fertilizer 7 4 62 9 moreover fe2 ions in feso4 fertilizer easily oxidized to fe3 plants absorb fe3 ions less effectively due to their restricted solubility and ease of forming insoluble complexes in neutral or alkaline soil shenker and chen 2005 while chelated fertilizer can more effectively increase the utilization efficiency of fe ions and therefore improve the crop yield and quality fakharzadeh et al 2020 therefore the chelated fertilizer could be more suitable to apply in bwdis this study also found there were significant differences in fouling inhibition ability of various chelated fertilizers fig 2b synthetic chelated fertilizer eddha fe inhibited fouling better than natural chelated fertilizer fa fe aa fe in addition eddha fe fertilizer are comparatively cheaper china fertilizer website 2019 accessed http www fert cn which is another important factor to be considered however eddha fe degraded slowly in the environment could long term chelate harmful heavy metal ions enhance their activity and enter the biological cycle endangering human health rehman et al 2017 thus eddha fe as fertilizer is recommended in soils with minimum concentration of heavy metals fa fe could be generally regarded a cleaner and more eco friendly fertilizer than eddha fe due to it biodegrade characteristics li et al 2018 in addition the application of fa fe to saline soils increased soil structural stability and soil bulk density and can significantly improve the absorption efficiency of iron by plants promote the synthesis of chlorophyll in plants and improve the absorption of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus by plants wu et al 2021 moreover fa fe has better fouling control ability but slightly less effective than eddha fe fig 2b consequently this strongly suggests that fa fe fertilizer be applied although aa fe has many benefits including improving the physical and chemical properties of soil and reducing iron deficiency in plants however the results of this experiment show that this aa fe was sure to trigger organic inorganic fouling which poses a serious threat to the normal use of bwdis therefore aa fe fertilizer is not recommended 5 conclusions this study investigated the effectiveness and mechanisms of chelated fertilizer for mitigating organic inorganic fouling the results show that chelated fertilizer fa fe aa fe and eddha fe significantly reduce the fouling content by 7 4 62 9 compared with inorganic iron fertilizer feso4 furthermore significant differences in fouling content were found among different chelated fertilizer treatments compared with ck eddha fe not only significantly reduce the organic fouling but also obviously decreased the inorganic fouling thereby reducing multiple fouling by 32 6 41 8 fa fe significantly reduces inorganic fouling while slightly increased organic fouling thus effectively controls multiple fouling by 16 1 29 0 in contrast aa fe slightly decreased precipitate fouling while drastically accelerated the particulate and organic fouling which aggravated the multiple fouling by 36 9 45 4 non biodegradable chelating fertilizers eddha fe cause heavy metal reactivation in soil sediments resulting in detrimental environmental impacts from the perspectives of fouling mitigation and soil environmental health biodegradable chelating fertilizers fa fe are strongly suggested these results bring an insight about the relative importance of chelated fertilizer application in bwdis for developing appropriate and eco friendly emitter anti clogging

the effect of chelated fertilizers on organic inorganic fouling compared with control group ck application of fe ethylenediamine di o hydroxy phenyl acetic acid eddha fe effectively prevented the multiple fouling by reducing the deposition of inorganic precipitate and particulate and organic fouling fulvic acid chelated iron fertilizer fa fe alleviated multiple fouling by drastically decreasing the precipitate and particulate fouling although organic fouling was slightly increased conversely amino acid chelated iron fertilizer aa fe slightly decreased the precipitate fouling while drastically accelerated the particulate and organic fouling leading to severe clogging accordingly eddha fe and fa fe prevented the bwdis fouling by 32 6 41 8 and 16 1 29 0 while aa fe accelerated by 36 9 45 4 moreover chelated fertilizers fa fe aa fe and eddha fe demonstrated better anti fouling than inorganic iron fertilizer feso4 however eddha fe would have negative environmental impact hence fa fe is strongly recommended from the perspectives of fouling mitigation and soil environmental health improvement efficiency these results may provide a new guideline for applying chelated fertilizers in bwdis to prevent organic inorganic fouling and overcome agricultural pollution keywords emitter clogging brackish water multiple fouling fertilizer type irrigation uniformity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwater scarcity has emerged a major threat to global environmental sustainability and agricultural safety boretti and rosa 2019 ma et al 2020b rosa et al 2020 appropriate utilization of brackish water bw for agricultural irrigation is a promising solution to address the global freshwater crisis liu et al 2021a yan et al 2021 however bw contained a huge quantity of scaling ions e g ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 colloidal particles and natural organic matter nom resulting in organic and inorganic fouling in brackish water drip irrigation systems bwdis muhammad et al 2022a park et al 2019 pipeline clogging and corrosion increased energy expenditure and bwdis flow resistance are the major consequences fouling song et al 2021 xiao et al 2020b furthermore clogging of bwdis will directly affect the irrigation and fertigation uniformity enhance soil salinization and excessive fertilizer applications wang et al 2022b thus leads to environmental risks accelerated replacement cycles of plastic pipelines which will eventually exacerbate the plastic input to the environment kawecki and nowack 2019 sang et al 2021 at present chemical regents e g scale inhibitors acidification and chlorination are the key approaches to prevent fouling ketrane et al 2009 song et al 2017 yan et al 2019 yu et al 2018 however these methods are being restricted due to harmful human health risk of chemical storage and handling the long term microbial tolerance negative impacts on soil and crops and other adverse environmental issues guo et al 2022 song et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore the development of alternate eco friendly approaches for fouling mitigation in bwdis is in urgent need recently the breakthroughs in the fertilizer sector offer a viable strategy to overcome the fouling associated issues in bwdis muhammad et al 2021 xiao et al 2020a chelating fertilizers due to their ability to remediate agricultural soil and improve the crop production and quality are being widely used in agricultural applications huang et al 2021 xu et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 furthermore chelated fertilizers due to low cost eco friendly and effectiveness attracted wide attention for fouling mitigation ang et al 2011 kim et al 2020 yoon et al 1998 wang et al 2022a reported that adding edta cu could prevent formation of calcium and silica fouling li et al 2022 showed that fulvic acid chelated fertilizers altered the gypsum crystal structure and effectively delay precipitation consequently reducing the scaling inorganic fouling ge et al 2020 found that humic acid chelated agent inhibited the phosphate adsorption on caco3 scaling surfaces thus prevented the calcium and phosphorus precipitation the previous research on chelated fertilizers antifouling abilities mainly focused on inorganic fouling however bw not only contains active amounts of dissolved salts and suspended particles muhammad et al 2022a but also natural organic matter park et al 2019 thus resulting in multi type combined fouling organic and inorganic the effects of chelated fertilizers on organic and inorganic fouling in bwdis still remain largely unknown moreover the complicated behaviors of multiple fouling mostly resulted from intense interactions among organic and inorganic foulants quay et al 2018 this study hypothesizes chelating fertilizers based adsorption removing ca2 binding with organic fouling reducing potential interaction between organic and inorganic fouling however the interaction mechanisms of chelated fertilizer effects multiple fouling are still elusive iron is a vital ingredient for crop development to promote chlorophyll synthesis nitrogen fixation and respiration suzuki et al 2021 although fe is enriched in soil it is typically restricted by the precipitation of insoluble fe iii oxyhydroxide complexes in saline alkali soil rajniak et al 2018 thus chelated iron fertilizer use in saline alkali soils is unavoidable two types of natural chelated iron fertilizers fulvic acid chelated iron fertilizer fa fe and amino acid chelated iron fertilizer aa fe and one type of synthetics chelate iron fertilizers fe ethylenediamine di o hydroxy phenyl acetic acid eddha fe were investigated the main objectives of this study was to a evaluate the efficiency of different chelated iron fertilizer on mitigation of organic inorganic fouling b reveal the mechanism of chelated iron fertilizer influence on organic inorganic fouling c propose the appropriate mode of chelated iron fertilizer application in bwdis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental infrastructure an outdoor experimental platform which resembles bwdis was used to cultivate multiple fouling fig 1 each testing platform consisted of four layers and each layer was facilitated with 18 m drip irrigation pipelines having 55 emitters uniformly distributed along each pipeline a total of three types of emitters

groundwater located in tongzhou experimental station beijing china the bw water quality parameters of bw are illustrated in table s1 the bw was stored temporarily in the storage tanks and filtered by laminated filter 150 mesh before entering into drip irrigation systems 2 2 experimental treatments this study selected two types of natural fe complex fertilizers fulvic acid chelated iron fertilizer

fouling samples each treatment was collected after every 120 h during the experiment at each sampling time a single drip irrigation pipeline was retrieved from the testing platform and 18 emitters were randomly chosen from drip irrigation pipelines the detection method of multiple fouling was based on muhammad et al 2022b 2 5 1 fouling weights the collected emitters were dried at 70 c the emitter samples with fouling on them dw1 were weighed using a high precision electronic weight balance accuracy 10 4 g hereafter the emitter samples were placed in a plastic bag with a zip lock closure added 20 ml of deionized water and bags were placed inside of an ultrasonic cleaning bath granbo china type gbs gw1530 working power 900 w frequency 40 khz for 65 min to completely eliminate the fouling the cleaned and dried emitters were reweighed again to determine the dw2 the difference between dw1 and dw2 was the total weight of fouling substance 2 5 2 minerals components in fouling the mineral components in fouling were measured using an x ray diffractometer bruker ger type jv qcvelox the test parameters of the machine were similar as liu et al 2021c the obtained polycrystalline diffraction patterns were analyzed using the supporting topas software bruker axs 2009 to determine the relative proportions of precipitate fouling and particulate fouling 2 5 3 organic matter components in fouling fouling was dried at 110 c to a consistent weight then burned for 4 h at 550 c the burning temperature of 550 c was chosen to completely decompose the organic components while avoiding the loss of inorganic components tang et al 2016 the weight of the fouling after ignition at 550 c showed the amount of inorganic fouling and the weight of the mass loss during ignition at 550 c showed the amount of organic fouling the test method was based on khan et al 2013 2 5 4 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet

fouling content and dra of bwdis 3 results 3 1 influence of chelated fertilizer on water quality bwdis hydraulic performance and fouling content the results indicate that chelated fertilizers obvious changed the water quality parameters fig 2a i compared with non fertilization treatment ck eddha fe treatment decreased the content of sm fig 2a cod fig 2b ca2 fig 2d mg2 fig 2e ec fig 2 g and d50 fig

content of sm ca2 mg2 ec ph and d50 while increased cod zeta and fe3 furthermore differences obvious were found between chelated fertilizers treatments and inorganic iron fertilizer compared with feso4 chelated fertilizers decreased the content of sm mg2 ca2 ec fe3 ph and psd while increased the zeta and cod the dynamic changes of bwdis hydraulic performance and fouling total content are shown in fig 3a b with system operation the total amount of fouling was continuously increased while dra of bwdis was continuously decreased moreover the chelated fertilizers significantly p 0 05 affected the total fouling fig 3b compared with ck eddha fe and fa fe obviously controlled the total amount of fouling by 32 6 41 8 and 16 1 29 0 and increased the dra of bwdis by 12 6 16 7 and 6 9 9 4 fig 3a b however aa fe accelerated the total amount of fouling by 36 9 45 4 and decreased the dra of bwdis by 8 3 14 6 fig 3a b moreover significant differences p 0 05 were found among chelated and inorganic iron fertilizer compared with feso4 treatment chelated fertilizers reduced the total amount of fouling by 7 4 62 9 consequently increased the dra of bwdis by 4 9 25 8 3 2 influence of chelated fertilizer on fouling component proportions and surface morphology fig 3f shows multiple fouling contained inorganic and organic fouling which accounted for 52 4 90 1 and 9 9 47 6 of total content of fouling chelated fertilizers significantly influenced the proportions of fouling compared to ck fa fe aa fe treatment increased the proportions of organic fouling by 10 6 14 1 and 21 4 28 4 while decreased the proportions of inorganic fouling by 10 6 14 1 and 21 4 28 4 eddha fe treatment decreased the proportions of organic fouling by 5 3 7 4 while increased the proportions of inorganic fouling by 5 3 7 4 the surface morphologies of multiple fouling fig 4a were visualized by scanning electron microscopy sem compared to ck the fouling surface morphologies were found loose and more porous when eddha fe and fa fe were applied in contrast the application of aa fe made the fouling layer denser the results of fig s4 further show that chelated fertilizers treatment has an obvious effect on the fouling particle size compared with ck eddha fe and fa fe reduced d50 of particle size by 22 1 34 2 µm and 12 6 28 4 µm while aa fe increased d50 of particle size by 4 3 18 5 µm moreover the d50 of particle size treated with chelated fertilizers is 14 8 63 3 µm less than that of inorganic iron fertilizer 3 3 influence of chelated fertilizer on inorganic fouling xrd patterns shown fig 3e seven mineral components appeared in inorganic fouling precipitate fouling i e calcite aragonite and monohydrate calcite particulate fouling muscovite feldspar silica and chlorites the proportions of precipitate fouling and particulate fouling were 47 5 72 2 and 27 8 52 5 respectively fig s2 the accumulative contents of precipitate particulate fouling are shown in fig 5 the results indicate that the content of the precipitate and particulate fouling generally increased as the system operates moreover the results of this study show that chelated fertilizer significantly p 0 05 affected precipitate fouling fig 5e f and g compared to ck eddha fe fa fe and aa fe decreased the precipitate fouling by 7 8 8 4 mg cm2 5 5 6 1 mg cm2 and 3 4 4 1 mg cm2 fig s2a meanwhile chelated fertilizer also significantly p 0 05 affected particulates fouling fig 5a b c and d compared to ck eddha fe and fa fe decreased the content of particulates fouling by 4 9 5 3 mg cm2 and 3 4 4 0 mg cm2 while aa fe increased the content of particulates fouling by 0 6 0 9 mg cm2 fig s2b 3 4 influence of chelated fertilizer on organic fouling the continuous changes in organic fouling fig 3c indicated that chelated fertilizer significantly p 0 05 influenced the content of organic fouling compared to ck the organic fouling in fa fe and aa fe treatment increased by 2 8 5 3 mg cm2 and 16 7 22 1 mg cm2 while the organic fouling in eddha fe treatment decreased 3 8 6 8 mg cm2 in addition significant differences were found in the effects of chelated and inorganic iron fertilizers on fouling compared to feso4 treatment chelated fertilizer reduced the contents of organic fouling by 5 5 13 7 mg cm2 ftir spectra fig 6a can reveal some information about the characteristic function groups in multiple fouling the ftir showed the characteristic peaks of polysaccharide and protein appeared in the fouling under all treatments such as the o h stretching vibration band of polysaccharides at 3380 cm 1 asymmetric stretching of the coo band at 1610 cm 1 amide iii infrared band at 1340 cm 1 c h out of plane bending band at 833 cm 1 compared to ck the fa fe and aa fe treatments made the peak intensities of polysaccharide and protein higher while the eddha fe treatment made them lower this was similar with what fig 3c showed which indicated eddha fe treatment reduced polysaccharide protein fouling while fa fe and aa fe enhanced it fig 6b shows the three dimensional fluorescence spectrum of the fouling the major organic matters in ck treatment are aromatic proteins like tyrosine regions i tryptophan regions ii fulvic acids regions iii soluble microbial products regions iv humic acids regions iv compared to ck the eddha fe reduced the intensity of organic fluorescence peaks regions i ii iii iv v in addition the variations in fluorescence response proved that fa fe mainly enhanced intensity fluorescence peaks of fulvic acids regions iii and aa fe enhanced intensity fluorescence peaks of aromatic proteins regions i ii compared to ck 3 5 controlling pathway of chelated fertilizer on multiple fouling chelated fertilizer has a considerable impact on water quality parameters fig 2 which directly affected to the formation of multiple fouling spearmen s correlation shown in fig 7a indicated the correlations between water quality parameters inorganic i e calcite aragonite monohydrate calcite muscovite feldspar silica and chlorites and organic fouling particularly ca2 mg2 fe3 sm cod zeta and ph had significant correlations p 0 05 with inorganic and organic fouling that demonstrated these water quality parameters were the most critical factors in multiple fouling formation structural equation modelling analysis fig 7b demonstrated the significance of the relevant correlations between water quality parameters inorganic and organic fouling overall chelated fertilizer application directly alters the concentrations of ca2 mg2 fe3 sm cod zeta and ph in bw and also indirectly changed the content of inorganic fouling and organic fouling which then changed total amount of fouling in bwdis furthermore the structural equation model revealed that organic and inorganic fouling obvious interacted with one another with a correlation coefficient of 0 71 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of chelated fertilizer on organic fouling this study revealed eddha fe fertilizer decrease the content of organic fouling by 3 8 6 8 mg cm2 when compared with ck eddha fe was capable of direct separation of organically bound calcium from organic fouling to form a stable water soluble chelate via the chelation of the eddha fe functional groups block et al 1974 which significantly reduced the synergistic interaction between organic and inorganic foulants li et al 2019a consequently the organic calcium gel networks being destroyed the fouling structure eventually became loose and decreased the particle size fig 4 the loose structure of fouling was easily flushed out with water in bwdis liu et al 2019 compared to ck the fa fe increased the organic fouling by 2 8 5 3 mg cm2 this might be due to fa fe fertilizers contain a high concentration of organic molecules fulvic acid which dissolve as colloids in bw fulvic acid tendency to aggregate organic fouling fig 2c when present in bw containing high concentration of salt ion e g ca2 mg2 tang et al 2014 the carboxylic groups in fulvic acid form complexes with ca2 known as the egg box model neutralizing the negative charge of fulvic acid molecules resulting in a thick compact gel fouling layer on the surface of membrane park et al 2021 moreover the fulvic acid particles settled on pipe surfaces will alter the surface roughness causing more natural organic matter nom in natural water sources to be adsorbed and forming a large amount of organic fouling guo et al 2020 ly et al 2019 the aa fe caused the worst organic fouling compared to ck the reason for the growth in organic fouling was similar the application of fa fe the aa fe fertilizer resulted in high concentrations of amino acids in bw leads to increase the organic fouling however the content organic fouling of aa fe was higher than fa fe by 18 4 23 6 mg cm2 fig 3d one possible reason could be the molecular weight of amino acids was smaller than fulvic acid resulting in more compact amino acid flocs than fulvic acid flocs in bw ren et al 2021 amino acid formation of compact flocs may make the fouling on pipe surfaces less porous and much more resistant fig 4a dense and compact fouling are comparatively difficult to remove shen et al 2022 on the other hand due to the weaker ability of amino acids to chelate metals than fulvic acids the amino acid fe colloid released by aa fe fertilizer in bw is less stable than the fulvic acid fe colloid released by fa fe in bw orsetti et al 2013 consequently the amino acid fe colloid releases more fe2 in the bw than the fulvic acid fe colloid fig s1 and these fe2 ions are rapidly oxidized to fe3 ions fig 2h fe3 ion preferentially forms coordination bonds with organic matter terminal carboxyl groups resulting in a massive increase in organic fouling 4 2 mechanism of chelated fertilizer on inorganic fouling this study fig 3c demonstrated that eddha fe mitigated inorganic fouling in bwdis mainly decreasing the content of precipitate and particulate fouling the reduction in precipitate fouling was due to the various active functional groups present in eddha fe e g coo oh yehuda et al 2003 active functional groups of distinct structure eddha fe could chelate ca2 mg2 and other metal cations which reduced the probability of that scaling anions reactions with ca2 and mg2 and significantly decreases the formation of precipitate fouling nowack 2008 the chelation reaction of eddha is shown in fig s5 moreover the decrease in particulate fouling was probably due to the application of eddha fe increased the absolute value of zeta potential in bw fig 2f leading to reduce the degree of flocculation of particles which ultimately leads to the reduction of particulate fouling muhammad et al 2022a in addition the chelate complex formed by eddha fe could be adsorbed on the surface of precipitate fouling which hinders the adhesion and aggregation between precipitate and particulate fouling jegatheesan et al 2012 compared to ck fa fe fertilizer also dramatically decreased the content of precipitate and particulate fouling fig 3c precipitate fouling control mechanisms were similar to eddha fe fa fe has a significant number of active functional groups with high adsorption capability active functional groups may alter the crystal shape and extend the crystallization induction time which could limit the growth of precipitate fouling wang et al 2022b the acidic character of the fa fe solution also contributed responsible for the reduced carbonate levels fig 2i since it facilitates the conversion of co3 2 to hco3 preventing precipitate fouling production ma et al 2020a after the application of aa fe the content of precipitate fouling reduced similar to fa fe this was mainly due to reduce water ph and competitive adsorption of ca2 and mg2 ions however fa fe and aa fe treatments differed significantly p 0 01 in precipitate fouling the fa fe treatments had higher inhibitory capacity on precipitate than the aa fe treatments the reason was that fa fe fertilizer has a stronger functional group activity than aa fe henrichs and sugai 1993 nantsis and carper 1998 consequently aa fe has a lesser chelating activity for calcium and magnesium ions than fa fe resulting in a weaker precipitate fouling inhibition capacity on the other hand compared to ck aa fe promoted the particulate fouling this may be due to the fact that as compared to eddha fe and fa fe the use of aa fe increased the most organic fouling organic fouling would adhere to suspended particles aggravate particle deposition li et al 2021 and ultimately accelerate the development of particulate fouling li et al 2021 4 3 practical implications although this study showed how chelated fertilizer application affected fouling of bwdis it is still important to assess the practical implications at the agricultural field level feso4 fertilizer most frequently applied inorganic iron fertilizer in bwdis was compared with chelated fertilizer our findings show that chelated fertilizer has a higher anti fouling ability than feso4 fertilizer 7 4 62 9 moreover fe2 ions in feso4 fertilizer easily oxidized to fe3 plants absorb fe3 ions less effectively due to their restricted solubility and ease of forming insoluble complexes in neutral or alkaline soil shenker and chen 2005 while chelated fertilizer can more effectively increase the utilization efficiency of fe ions and therefore improve the crop yield and quality fakharzadeh et al 2020 therefore the chelated fertilizer could be more suitable to apply in bwdis this study also found there were significant differences in fouling inhibition ability of various chelated fertilizers fig 2b synthetic chelated fertilizer eddha fe inhibited fouling better than natural chelated fertilizer fa fe aa fe in addition eddha fe fertilizer are comparatively cheaper china fertilizer website 2019 accessed http www fert cn which is another important factor to be considered however eddha fe degraded slowly in the environment could long term chelate harmful heavy metal ions enhance their activity and enter the biological cycle endangering human health rehman et al 2017 thus eddha fe as fertilizer is recommended in soils with minimum concentration of heavy metals fa fe could be generally regarded a cleaner and more eco friendly fertilizer than eddha fe due to it biodegrade characteristics li et al 2018 in addition the application of fa fe to saline soils increased soil structural stability and soil bulk density and can significantly improve the absorption efficiency of iron by plants promote the synthesis of chlorophyll in plants and improve the absorption of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus by plants wu et al 2021 moreover fa fe has better fouling control ability but slightly less effective than eddha fe fig 2b consequently this strongly suggests that fa fe fertilizer be applied although aa fe has many benefits including improving the physical and chemical properties of soil and reducing iron deficiency in plants however the results of this experiment show that this aa fe was sure to trigger organic inorganic fouling which poses a serious threat to the normal use of bwdis therefore aa fe fertilizer is not recommended 5 conclusions this study investigated the effectiveness and mechanisms of chelated fertilizer for mitigating organic inorganic fouling the results show that chelated fertilizer fa fe aa fe and eddha fe significantly reduce the fouling content by 7 4 62 9 compared with inorganic iron fertilizer feso4 furthermore significant differences in fouling content were found among different chelated fertilizer treatments compared with ck eddha fe not only significantly reduce the organic fouling but also obviously decreased the inorganic fouling thereby reducing multiple fouling by 32 6 41 8 fa fe significantly reduces inorganic fouling while slightly increased organic fouling thus effectively controls multiple fouling by 16 1 29 0 in contrast aa fe slightly decreased precipitate fouling while drastically accelerated the particulate and organic fouling which aggravated the multiple fouling by 36 9 45 4 non biodegradable chelating fertilizers eddha fe cause heavy metal reactivation in soil sediments resulting in detrimental environmental impacts from the perspectives of fouling mitigation and soil environmental health biodegradable chelating fertilizers fa fe are strongly suggested these results bring an insight about the relative importance of chelated fertilizer application in bwdis for developing appropriate and eco friendly emitter anti clogging

used by smallholder and large farmers to increase the land utilization rate of wheat production in the north china plain ncp however little information is available on its superiority in crop productivity resource utilization efficiency and net return in comparison with flat cultivation fc a field experiment was conducted in the ncp in the 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 wheat seasons to determine whether hlsc would increase crop productivity evapotranspiration et intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar crop nitrogen uptake and resource use efficiency two treatments were established i e fc and hlsc respectively the results showed that hlsc significantly increased tiller development leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass compared with fc although hlsc did not increase et relative to fc p 0 05 it increased ipar by 5 5 6 6 and grain nitrogen uptake by 12 1 12 6 p 0 05 pearson correlation analysis indicated that grain yield and biomass yield were regulated by

cultivation crop productivity resource use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the agricultural resources available for crop production mainly include solar radiation soil moisture and nitrogen ashraf and harris 2013 zhang et al 2019a raza et al 2021 in general crop grain yield and biomass yield are strongly related to the utilization of production resources i e photosynthetically active radiation interception ipar manevski et al 2017 crop water productivity wp fernández et al 2020 and nitrogen use efficiency nue kareem et al 2022 it has been shown that varying the crop cultivation area greatly affects the ipar wp and nue zhang et al 2019a haro et al 2022 han et al 2023 therefore it is critical to maximize the efficient utilization of production resources to facilitate higher crop productivity and resource use efficiency eldoma et al 2016 du et al 2021b du et al 2022a winter wheat is the second most important food crop in the north china plain ncp contributing nearly 70 of the national wheat yield national bureau of statistics of china 2018 the abundant solar radiation in the ncp provides the energy needed for high crop productivity however uneven and sparse rainfall during the winter wheat growing season in this region 60 180 mm each season is far less than the requirement for winter wheat development si et al 2020 to maximize wheat grain yield supplementary irrigation in the critical growing stage is thus necessary to address the problem of low water productivity wp caused by flood irrigation with wide and flat seedbed cultivation of winter wheat border irrigation with narrow and flat seedbed cultivation has been adopted to improve wp and field water distribution systems have improved to facilitate irrigation wu et al 2021 however the cropping area is insufficient with the narrow and flat seedbed cultivation because a certain percentage of soil area needs to be constructed as borders to facilitate irrigation especially in the well irrigation area fig 1 moreover the decrease in planting area would weaken the ability of light to penetrate the lower canopy jia et al 2018b resulting in poor ventilation wang et al 2004 as well as a decrease in canopy expansion and the apparent photosynthetic rate teixeira et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a ultimately this significantly reduces the conversion of production resources into grain yield and biomass yield si et al 2020 the research on raised bed cultivation is relatively recent and conducted on winter wheat yadvinder et al 2014 yigezu et al 2021 few on potato zhang et al 2018 and orchard systems funt et al 1997 simpson et al 2023 although the method dates back from ancient times of permaculture gardening from the crop production perspective raised bed cultivation has been found to alleviate water logging and production problems of winter wheat following rice with positive prospects for growth and radiation capture yield and net revenue du et al 2022b this is because the furrows used in raised bed fields allow optimal drainage runoff and the beds allow suitable growing areas and conditions indeed raised bed cultivation has been reported to significantly improve surface runoff and reduce soil loss compared to flat seedbed cultivation garg et al 2022 the method has also been shown to diversify the cropping systems temporarily under humid conditions where water collected in the furrow bed is utilized for supplemental irrigation of the raised bed gogoi et al 2022 further from the irrigation perspective the use of raised cultivation is expanding as adopters of this cultivation method report sizeable grain yields and gross margins under semi arid conditions or in regions prone to drought yigezu et al 2021 a recent study revealed that yield reduction caused by deficit irrigation 20 of evapotranspiration can be remunerated by the raised bed cultivation due to increased growth characteristics leaf chlorophyll contents and their efficiency stomatal conductance yield and its components compared to flat cultivation rady et al 2021 therefore the raised bed cultivation alters the physiological responses and the resources capture and utilization which is further modulated by the irrigation method ahmadi et al 2020 rady et al 2021 du et al 2022b and more studies are needed to fully reveal the effect on growth resource capture and use efficiency and eventually irrigation water saving potentials and economic profile of raised beds however according to statistic the noncropping area i e borders of flat cultivation or furrows of ridge cultivation account for 20 50 of the total area of the field recently researchers have developed a wheat production practice based on the concepts of flat and ridge cultivation i e high and low seedbed cultivation hlsc to address the problem of low land utilization this cultivation pattern is analogous to the ridge cultivation that is popularly used in northwest mexico egypt the mid southern united states australia india and northwest china daryanto et al 2017 fischer et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 bryant et al 2021 du et al 2022a the hlsc pattern consists of alternate high seedbeds 12 cm high 50 cm wide and low seedbeds 90 cm wide completed by a specially designed machine fig 1 the crops are planted on both high and low seedbeds and irrigation is only performed in low seedbeds this technology not only effectively eliminates borders in flat cultivation but also successfully forms a water channel similar to furrow irrigation of ridge cultivation which favors increasing the cropping area liu et al 2021 it has been shown that hlsc can significantly improve crop productivity compared to flat cultivation liu et al 2020a wu et al 2021 we hypothesized that the spike density and resource water nitrogen and radiation use efficiency can be enhanced under hlsc due to the improvement of its cropping area ultimately increasing grain yield however few studies have focused on the characteristics of key production resource utilization in the hlsc pattern to verify this hypothesis a 2 year field experiment was conducted in the ncp to 1 investigate the effects of cultivation patterns on soil water and temperature canopy light distribution and wheat growth and 2 analyze the effects of two cultivation patterns on crop yield economic benefits and resource use efficiency the results will help improve crop productivity and resource use efficiency in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were conducted

of exchangeable potassium on average over the two growing seasons 2 2 experimental design in this study two cultivation patterns were tested for wheat production i e flat cultivation fc and high and low seedbed cultivation hlsc fig 1 for the hlsc pattern two rows of winter wheat were sown in the high bed hlsc h and four rows were sown in the low bed hlsc l the soil of high seedbeds is transported from the low seedbeds by a sowing planter of hlsc fig 1d the machine of the hlsc integrates the five processes of making the high and low seedbeds ditching fertilizing sowing and suppression and completes all the procedures simultaneously for the fc pattern a traditional sowing planter was used fig 1c and the above processes were included except for the fabrication of the high low beds each treatment was repeated three times and arranged within 6 plots each plot in the experimental area was 135 m2 15 m 9 m a 0 5 m wide ridge was built around each plot to prevent runoff experimental plots were precision land leveled to a longitudinal slope of 1 25 and transverse slopes of 0 67 the winter wheat cultivar zhoumai 22 was sown at 180 kg ha 1 on october 18th 2020 and october 30th 2021 the crops were harvested on june 3rd 2021 and june 6th 2022 before sowing urea 46 n calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 60 k2o was applied at 150 120 and 120 kg ha 1 as basal fertilization and mixed into the subsoil with a rotary cultivator the remaining 50 n 150 kg ha 1 was applied before the first irrigation after reviving when the average soil moisture to a depth of 100 cm in the fc pattern decreased to 60 of the field capacity irrigation of 90 mm was applied to the two cultivation patterns the scheduling of irrigation and fertilization applications in the two seasons is shown in table 1 the irrigation water channel in fc and hlsc are shown in fig 1 2 3 methods for field investigation in this study we investigated three production resources water solar radiation and nitrogen under the two cultivation patterns and calculated the crop yield economic benefit and resource use efficiency 2 3 1 soil sampling gravimetric soil water content swc in the top

from a soil depth of 140 200 cm at the sowing greening jointing and maturity stages respectively for each plot three random soil core samples were manually taken using a 5 cm diameter auger and sealed in an aluminum case to account for the soil heterogeneity for the hlsc treatment samples were collected from the high seedbed hlsc h and low seedbed hlsc l for the fc treatment soil cores were sampled from the middle of the seedbed soil water storage sws mm is calculated as follows 1 sws swc λ sd where λ g cm 3 is the soil bulk density of each soil layer and sd mm is the soil depth three automatic temperature probes tr 51i thermo recorder t d cooperation japan were buried at 6 cm in the border of the fc and 5 and 15 cm soil depths in the middle of the seedbed in the fc pattern fig 1a similarly five automatic temperature probes were buried at 6 cm in hlsc h and at 5 and 15 cm soil depths in both hlsc h and hlsc l fig 1b the soil temperature was recorded daily at six hour intervals from 0 00 23 00 during the wheat growing season to determine the dynamic of soil moisture after the irrigation soil samples were taken from the 0 200 cm profile at 1 day before irrigation at 1 3 and 7 days after irrigation also the soil no 3 n samples were taken from the 0 120 cm profile at 1 day before irrigation and 7 days after irrigation the three points were randomly selected from each plot for the sampling the no 3 n sample was extracted using 2 mol l 1 kcl solution and measured using a flow analyzer seal analytical inc aa3 hr usa 2 3 2 tiller number lai and accumulated dry matter the tiller

heading flowering filling and maturity stages respectively from the seedling stage to the overwintering stage twenty plants in each treatment were sampled and the lai was determined following a previously described method si et al 2020 after the greening stage the measurements were taken at midday 11 00 13 00 h on sunny days using a sunscan canopy analyzer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk to measure the lai at both treatments the canopy analyzer was placed parallel to the row direction and near the ground of each plot in six different positions fig 1 the average of these six measurements was considered the lai of each treatment the aboveground biomass of winter wheat was measured at the same stage as the lai measurement twenty wheat plants were randomly collected from the hlsc h and hlsc l and the middle of the seedbed in the fc pattern after sampling all samples were cut into small pieces dried and weighed to determine the constant weight 2 3 3 wheat yield determination at physiological maturity three quadrats were randomly selected to determine the grain yield of each treatment the area of the quadrat was 1 m2 for the hlsc h 0 5 m 2 m and hlsc l 1 0 m 1 0 m and 1 5 m2

converted into weight with a moisture content of 14 2 3 4 light interception li intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar and radiation use efficiency rue photosynthetically active radiation par 0 4 0 7 µm in wavelength transmission above and below the wheat canopy was simultaneously observed using a sunscan canopy analyzer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk tsubo et al 2001 the analyzer has a linear quantum sensor 1 m long with 64 photodiodes equally spaced along its length and a single quantum sensor the beam fraction sensor for measuring par above and beneath plant canopies respectively to measure the transmitted radiation of both treatments the canopy analyzer was placed parallel to the row direction and near the ground of each plot in six different positions fig 1 the average of these six measurements was considered the radiation transmitted by the canopy of each treatment light interception li was calculated as follows du et al 2021b 3 li 1 i 0 i t 100 where i0 and it are the par μmol m 2 s 1 above and below the wheat canopy respectively the daily li was estimated by fitting binomial functions between the measured li and das days after sowing and the li on each day was calculated with the fitted model fig 4 the daily incident par was calculated by multiplying the solar radiation by 0 5 du et al 2015 du et al 2021b the total par intercepted

usa 3 results 3 1 soil water and temperature as shown in fig 2 the soil temperature of the fc pattern was higher than that under the hlsc pattern but no significant difference in daily temperature was observed between the two cultivation patterns on average the hlsc pattern decreased the soil temperature by 0 29 and 0 51 compared with fc in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively similarly there was no significant difference in soil water storage between hlsc and fc in both seasons fig 3 at the early stage of wheat from sowing to greening there was no significant difference in sws between hlsc and fc in both years after that the sws in hlsc was higher than that in fc in 2021 2022 p 0 05 while no significant difference was observed in 2020 2021 at the late growth stages the sws in fc was higher than that in hlsc in 2021 2022 p 0 05 while no significant difference was observed in 2020 2021 fig s1 showed the distribution of swc and soil no3 n with depth before and after irrgation swc varied obviously at the vertical direction but indistinctively in horizontal direction before irrigation 1 d under the fc pattern fig s1e while swc under the hlsc changes significantly in both directions except for the shallow layer fig s1a for the hlsc pattern the swc varied significantly both in horizontal direction and the vertical direction after irrigation fig s1b d however the swc in fc was uniform in the horizontal direction fig s1f h further the no 3 n was primarily concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer while the no 3 n of 0 40 cm soil layer under hlsc was higher than that under fc fig s1j l 3 2 li and horizontal distribution of par within the canopy the li of winter wheat was significantly p 0 05 affected by cultivation pattern in most sampling periods in both seasons fig 4 however few differences were observed during 160 180 das in both two seasons and during 190 210 das in the 2021 2022 season fig 4 compared with that in fc the mean li in hlsc was increased by 4 9 and 4 1 in both the 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 seasons respectively the amount of par intercepted ipar by the wheat crop canopy in the two cultivation patterns over the two growing seasons is shown in fig 5 in this study wheat under the hlsc pattern exhibited a significantly higher ipar than that under fc at different growth periods in 2020 2021 p 0 05 similarly hlsc exhibited highly significant differences in ipar at the filling and harvest stages in 2021 2022 it is worth noting that the ipar in border gaps under the fc pattern was significantly lower than that in other wheat rows compared with that under fc the mean ipar under hlsc increased by 9 1 in 2020 2021 and 9 5 in the 2021 2022 wheat season 3 3 tiller number lai and accumulated dry matter as shown in fig 6a b significant differences in tiller numbers were observed between the hlsc and fc patterns from the flowering to harvest stages p 0 05 while no significant differences were observed from seedling to jointing p 0 05 except for the jointing stage in 2021 2022 in comparison with the fc pattern hlsc increased the tiller number by 11 0 and 12 4 during the jointing to harvest stage in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 seasons respectively the lai of winter wheat increased rapidly during the early growth stage peaked at the filling stage and declined at the maturity stage in both seasons fig 6c d and fig 7 from the wintering to jointing stages the lai under the hlsc pattern was similar to that under the fc pattern however a significant difference in wheat lai was observed between the two cultivation patterns from the heading to filling stages in both seasons at maturity no significant difference in lai was observed between the two cultivation patterns further the rank of lai during jointing to maturity stage was hlsc l fc then hlsc h respectively fig 7 compared with that under the fc treatment the average lai under hlsc increased by 6 5 in the 2020 2021 season and by 4 3 in the 2021 2022 season as shown in fig 6e f no significant differences in aboveground biomass were observed between the hlsc and fc patterns from the wintering to jointing stages p 0 05 while significant differences were observed from the heading to maturity stages in both seasons p 0 05 in comparison with that under the fc pattern the average aboveground biomass under hlsc increased by 11 7 in the 2020 2021 season and by 11 1 in the 2021 2022 season 3 4 grain yield and yield components as shown in table 3 the hlsc treatment markedly improved the grain and biomass yields of wheat p 0 05 compared with the fc pattern the hlsc pattern increased grain yield by 18 3 and 14 5 in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively a similar improvement was observed in biomass yield 20 9 23 0 in both seasons furthermore the hlsc pattern increased the spike density sd by 11 6 and 9 8 relative to fc in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively which contributed to grain yield improvement however no significant differences in the 1000 grain weight and the number of grains per ear were observed between the two cultivation patterns 3 5 wp and rue the et and wp of the wheat in the two cultivation patterns over the two growing seasons are shown in table 4 there was no significant difference in et between hlsc and fc in both seasons furthermore hlsc facilitated wp gy and wp by in both seasons compared with the fc pattern hlsc increased wp gy by 15 6 and 13 2 and wp by by 18 0 and 21 7 in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively as shown in table 4 the wheat ipar was affected by the cultivation patterns in both seasons p 0 05 the wheat ipar under the hlsc pattern was significantly higher than that of wheat under the fc compared with the fc pattern the ipar of wheat in the hlsc treatment increased by 6 6 for the 2020 2021 and 5 5 for the 2021 2022 wheat season respectively in addition the wheat under the hlsc pattern exhibited higher rue than that under fc in both seasons the increase in rue gy under hlsc increased by 11 0 in 2020 2021 and by 8 5 in 2021 2022 respectively the increase in rue by under hlsc increased by 13 4 in 2020 2021 and by 16 6 in 2021 2022 3 6 crop nitrogen uptake and npfp the hlsc pattern distinctly improved crop n uptake relative to the fc pattern table 5 compared with the fc pattern the hlsc pattern increased the total n uptake in biomass n by by 12 8 and 27 2 in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively similarly the increase in total n uptake by grain n gy in the hlsc was 12 1 12 6 meanwhile the hlsc treatment enhanced npfp due to the much higher grain and biomass yields than the fc treatment hlsc significantly increased npfp gy and npfp by in both seasons compared with the fc pattern the hlsc increased npfp gy by 18 3 and 14 5 and npfp by by 20 9 and 23 0 in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively 3 7 economic benefits over the two consecutive growing seasons there was a 4 5 673 8 cny ha 1 reduction on average in the cost of input for the hlsc pattern compared with the fc pattern table 6 this was attributed to the difference in machinery labor and pesticide additionally the hlsc pattern exhibited an obvious increase in the output value of 14 5 18 3 3724 3 4313 9 cny ha 1 compared to the fc pattern consequently the hlsc pattern increased economic benefit by 45 4 59 3 4414 0 4971 8 cny ha 1 in comparison with the fc pattern further there was a 19 6 23 7 increase in hlsc compared to fc 3 8 relationships between grain yield and resource use efficiency the correlations between wheat gy by sd et n gy n by and ipar were determined for the two cultivation patterns fig 8 wheat gy were significantly and positively correlated with by sd n gy n by and ipar in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 seasons p 0 05 similarly the by were clearly and positively correlated with sd n gy n by and ipar in both two seasons these results suggested that increasing the utilization of key resources nitrogen radiation etc will increase crop productivity 4 discussion 4 1 crop growth et ipar and nitrogen uptake increasing crop yield is a priority of agricultural production in countries all over the world in the 21st century for a long time the fc pattern has been adopted in most areas of crop production in the ncp the disadvantages of fc are insufficient land utilization and plant growth restricted by irrigation channels which in turn reduce crop yield wu et al 2021 therefore hlsc was proposed as a wheat production practice based on the concepts of flat and ridge cultivation to address the problem of low land utilization in this study the hlsc pattern significantly increased the grain yield by 14 5 18 3 and enhanced the efficient use of resources by 13 2 15 6 in water 14 5 18 3 in nitrogen and 8 5 11 0 in radiation compared to the fc pattern meanwhile the hlsc pattern achieved greater net profit by 45 4 59 3 than the fc pattern this was similar to the previous studies showing that ridge cultivation can improve crop productivity by enhancing the ability of resource capture du et al 2021a du et al 2022b garg et al 2022 gogoi et al 2022 overall these results indicate that the hlsc is more profitable in obtaining a higher crop yield and net return with similar input and it would be a reliable economic cultivation pattern in areas of limited water resources which conformed to our hypothesis previous studies have proven that ridge cultivation collects surface runoff generated by irrigation and precipitation reduces ineffective evaporation and raises the soil temperature ali et al 2019 fischer et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a liu et al 2020b in this study however there were no significant differences p 0 05 in soil water storage or et and soil temperature between the hlsc and fc patterns this was mainly attributed to the lai and root water uptake ahmadi et al 2020 the hlsc pattern produced higher lai and aboveground biomass from the heading to maturity stage than the fc pattern while no significant differences were observed during the seedling to the jointing stage figs 6 7 this may be related to crop growth jia et al 2018b zhang et al 2019a and effective planting area fig 1 from the seedling to the jointing stage the wheat grew in sufficient seedbed space in both treatments after that crowding among plants under fc gradually increased with crop development which was detrimental to both tiller development and production resource utilization wang et al 2004 dai et al 2022 taking the 2020 2021 season as an example the actual spike number per ha 1 in effective planting area for hlsc was 703 6 104 while the actual spike number per ha 1 for fc is 788 3 104 the increase in effective planting area would lead to improving tiller development and lai which contributed to greater canopy photosynthetic capacity and accelerated dry matter accumulation from heading to maturity figs 6 7 consequently there was no significant difference in et between hlsc and fc p 0 05 but there were significant differences in grain yield and biomass yield p 0 05 this may prove that hlsc is a high yield and high efficiency planting pattern in the ncp although the planting density and average row spacing of winter wheat under the hlsc pattern were the same as those under the fc pattern fig 1 the amount of ipar under hlsc increased by 5 5 6 6 in both seasons compared with that under the fc pattern table 4 this can be mainly understood as follows 1 the high seedbed of hlsc hlsc h effectively eliminated the border gaps of fc which enhanced wheat lai leading to the increase in li and radiation capture fig 4 and figs 6 7 moreover hlsc increased the effective area of solar radiation resulting in a significant increase in radiation capture fig 5 2 for fc wheat crowding caused by insufficient land utilization inhibits tiller development and lai figs 6 7 and border gaps also directly reduced ipar due to the lack of wheat canopy interception fig 5 these interpretations were supported by studies of crops under ridge cultivation in areas with water shortages worldwide wang et al 2004 fischer et al 2019 du et al 2021b we also observed that the lai and aboveground biomass of wheat under hlsc were similar to those under fc during the wintering to the jointing stage while the lai and biomass under hlsc were significantly higher than those under fc in the late growing season a possible explanation may be that improving ipar in the late growing season was crucial for enhancing crop productivity du et al 2021b furthermore the wheat plants under hlsc intercepted more solar par in the critical period thus enhancing the photosynthetic capacity of crop leaves and resulting in obvious increase in biomass yield table 4 and fig 6 previous research has suggested that crop nitrogen uptake was related to its growth period soil moisture and temperature and nutrient availability liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b czaban et al 2023 in this study the hlsc treatment increased wheat nitrogen uptake relative to the fc treatment table 5 this may be caused by differences in water and nitrogen distribution between hlsc and fc fig s1 also hlsc significantly promoted aboveground biomass accumulation fig 6 which may increase nitrogen uptake or availability and stimulated nitrogen transport from vegetative organs to grains galanopoulou et al 2019 czaban et al 2023 thus ultimately enhancing nitrogen uptake by biomass and grain table 5 4 2 crop yield and resource use efficiency in this study the wheat grain yield and spike density were significantly p 0 05 higher under hlsc than under fc while no significant differences in kernel weight and kernels per head were observed between the two cultivation patterns previous studies showed that the increase in spike density may result in a decrease in kernels per spike and 1000 grain weight geleta et al 2002 bastos et al 2020 however a high spike number per unit area did not result in a loss in kernels per spike and 1000 grain weight in this study likely the interception of more resources radiation water and nitrogen under hlsc has a positive impact on the spike mwale et al 2007b mwale et al 2007a zhang et al 2019a hyles et al 2020 from an agronomic perspective the spike density of wheat is a predominant component in yield determination chakraborty et al 2008 du et al 2021a du et al 2021b ding et al 2022 this result indicated that hlsc has high yield and high efficiency characteristics we also found that the grain yield in the 2020 2021 season was considerably higher than that in the 2021 2022 season p 0 05 the reason may be that the relatively low rainfall input in 2021 2022 caused significant soil desiccation at the middle filling stage figs 2 3 which reduced grain yield and biomass yield to some extent these interpretations were consistent with previous studies li et al 2001 zhang et al 2019b they found that soil water deficit can induce stomatal closure by weakening the plant transpiration rate to effectively utilize limited soil water but this leads to limitation of photosynthesis and inhibition of crop growth in addition to production resource capture resource use efficiency has also been considered by scientists to develop sustainable water saving agricultural production eldoma et al 2016 manevski et al 2017 fischer et al 2019 raza et al 2021 messina et al 2022 in the present study although hlsc and fc had similar et hlsc increased wp gy and wp by in both years table 4 as indicated by its grain and biomass yield higher than that of fc a possible explanation may be the optimization of et components zhang et al 2019b the irrigation for hlsc was only performed in hlsc l hlsc generates an impermeable barrier i e hlsc h to essentially decline soil evaporation fig s1 but raises physiologically significant transpiration of the crop gan et al 2013 liu et al 2020c zhang et al 2020 thus promoting photosynthetic matter production eventually provides the total biomass i e root and straw foundation for high grain yield these explanations agreed with previous studies wang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 they suggested that increasing the coverage ratio or lai can enhance resource use efficiency and crop productivity therefore an accurate estimation of e and t for hlsc during the growth period should be investigated to improve crop productivity and resource use efficiency in future research in this study the wheat rue gy increased from 1 2 to 1 3 g mj 1 in the fc to 1 3 1 5 g mj 1 in the hlsc while rue by increased from 2 8 to 3 2 g mj 1 in the fc to 3 2 3 7 g mj 1 in the hlsc this difference was mainly related to the difference in ipar table 4 and fig 5 and crop nitrogen uptake fletcher et al 2013 additionally the relatively wide crop spacing in the hlsc was conducive to ventilation and sufficient carbon dioxide which benefits the photosynthetic capacity of crop leaves and photosynthetic performance driven by stomata hou et al 2015 du et al 2021b however the border gaps in fc and narrow crop spacing can result in lower ipar and rue similarly compared to that under fc the wheat under hlsc increased by 14 5 18 0 in npfp gy and by 20 8 23 0 in npfp by p 0 05 this was mainly due to hlsc enhancing the dry matter accumulation and total nitrogen of crop nitrogen table 5 at the same time the reason for the increase in npfp could be the improved ipar amount which stimulated the biomass transportation process from the vegetative organs to grains thus eventually increasing npfp these explanations agreed with previous studies negin and moshelion 2016 fischer et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a du et al 2021b they found that the nitrogen uptake of crops was also related to root growth and physiological characteristics jia et al 2018a zhang et al 2019b in agriculture net profits are the ultimate goal in this study the input of insecticide fungicide and labor of fc was higher than that of hlsc this is mainly attributed to the poor ventilation under fc which can increase pests and diseases wu et al 2021 however the input of machinery including fuel cost of hlsc was higher than that of fc taken together there was no significant difference for total input between hlsc and fc nevertheless the hlsc exhibited an obvious increase in net return of 45 4 59 3 in comparison with the fc table 6 indeed the improvement mainly depends on the economic price of agricultural input and output the sensitivity analyses showed that the fluctuation of the market price will significantly affect the net return of hlsc and fc table 7 further the net return of hlsc was greater than 30 relative to fc neither the market price increase nor decreases thus it is reasonable to conclude that the improvement of net return in hlsc was mainly attributed to the rise of grain yield overall hlsc effectively eliminates border gaps of flat cultivation and increases the seedbed area leading to enhanced tiller and lai development and aboveground biomass accumulation which contributes to resource utilization and grain yield in this study hlsc significantly increased grain yield by 14 5 18 3 and net return by 45 4 59 3 and enhanced the efficient use of resources by 13 2 15 6 in water 8 5 11 1 in radiation and 14 5 18 3 in nitrogen compared with fc these findings suggest that the hlsc pattern could be a promising planting pattern for improving crop productivity and resource use efficiency for wheat production relative to fc approximately 175 million hectares of winter wheat are planted in the ncp national bureau of statistics of china 2018 if the hlsc is widely used as the only cultivation pattern it can improve grain yield by 17 billion kg in wheat production relative to fc however one challenge is that it is a two year field experiment performed on a small spatial scale more studies are required to optimize water and fertilizer management with various precipitation years as well as in different soil types the next step is not only to develop appropriate machinery to realize the integration of sowing and harvest for the winter wheat summer maize cropping system but also to invest in the dissemination of hlsc yigezu et al 2021 5 conclusion high and low seedbed cultivation hlsc not only effectively eliminates the borders of flat cultivation fc but also improves the cropping area for wheat production in the study area the results of this two year experiment showed that compared with the fc pattern the hlsc pattern consumed similar et but it significantly increased ipar and crop nitrogen uptake these improvements in hlsc were ascribed primarily to the increased seedbed area and improved canopy light capture moreover hlsc significantly increased grain yield by 14 5 18 3 and net return by 45 4 59 3 and enhanced the efficient use of resources by 13 2 15 6 in water 8 5 11 1 in radiation and 14 5 18 3 in nitrogen compared with fc therefore the hlsc would be a promising planting system for improving crop

used by smallholder and large farmers to increase the land utilization rate of wheat production in the north china plain ncp however little information is available on its superiority in crop productivity resource utilization efficiency and net return in comparison with flat cultivation fc a field experiment was conducted in the ncp in the 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 wheat seasons to determine whether hlsc would increase crop productivity evapotranspiration et intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar crop nitrogen uptake and resource use efficiency two treatments were

shown that varying the crop cultivation area greatly affects the ipar wp and nue zhang et al 2019a haro et al 2022 han et al 2023 therefore it is critical to maximize the efficient utilization of production resources to facilitate higher crop productivity and resource use efficiency eldoma et al 2016 du et al 2021b du et al 2022a winter wheat is the second most important food crop in the north china plain ncp contributing nearly 70 of the national wheat yield national bureau of statistics of china 2018 the abundant solar radiation in the ncp provides the energy needed for high crop productivity however uneven and sparse rainfall during the winter wheat growing season in this region 60 180 mm each season is far less than the requirement for winter wheat development si et al 2020 to maximize wheat grain yield supplementary irrigation in the critical growing stage is thus necessary to address the problem of low water productivity wp caused by flood irrigation with wide and flat seedbed cultivation of winter wheat border irrigation with narrow and flat seedbed cultivation has been adopted to improve wp and field water distribution systems have improved to facilitate irrigation wu et al 2021 however the cropping area is insufficient with the narrow and flat seedbed cultivation because a certain percentage of soil area needs to be constructed as borders to facilitate irrigation especially in the well irrigation area fig 1 moreover the decrease in planting area would weaken the ability of light to penetrate the lower canopy jia et al 2018b resulting in poor ventilation wang et al 2004 as well as a decrease in canopy expansion and the apparent photosynthetic rate teixeira et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a ultimately this significantly reduces the conversion of production resources into grain yield and biomass yield si et al 2020 the research on raised bed cultivation is relatively recent and conducted on winter wheat yadvinder et al 2014 yigezu et al 2021 few on potato zhang et al 2018 and orchard systems funt et al 1997 simpson et al 2023 although the method dates back from ancient times of permaculture gardening from the crop production perspective raised bed cultivation has been found to alleviate water logging and production problems of winter wheat following rice with positive prospects for growth and radiation capture yield and net revenue du et al 2022b this is because the furrows used in raised bed fields allow optimal drainage runoff and the beds allow suitable growing areas and conditions indeed raised bed cultivation has been reported to significantly improve surface runoff and reduce soil loss compared to flat seedbed cultivation garg et al 2022 the method has also been shown to diversify the cropping systems temporarily under humid conditions where water collected in the furrow bed is utilized for supplemental irrigation of the raised bed gogoi et al 2022 further from the irrigation perspective the use of raised cultivation is expanding as adopters of this cultivation method report sizeable grain yields and gross margins under semi arid conditions or in regions prone to drought yigezu et al 2021 a recent study revealed that yield reduction caused by deficit irrigation 20 of evapotranspiration can be remunerated by the raised bed cultivation due to increased growth characteristics leaf chlorophyll contents and their efficiency stomatal conductance yield and its components compared to flat cultivation rady et al 2021 therefore the raised bed cultivation alters the physiological responses and the resources capture and utilization which is further modulated by the irrigation method ahmadi et al 2020 rady et al 2021 du et al 2022b and more studies are needed to fully reveal the effect on growth resource capture and use efficiency and eventually irrigation water saving potentials and economic profile of raised beds however according to statistic the noncropping area i e borders of flat cultivation or furrows of ridge cultivation account for 20 50 of the total area of the field recently researchers have developed a wheat production practice based on the concepts of flat and ridge cultivation i e high and low seedbed cultivation hlsc to address the problem of low land utilization this cultivation pattern is analogous to the ridge cultivation that is popularly used in northwest mexico egypt the mid southern united states australia india and northwest china daryanto et al 2017 fischer et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 bryant et al 2021 du et al 2022a the hlsc pattern consists of alternate high seedbeds 12 cm high 50 cm wide and low seedbeds 90 cm wide completed by a specially designed machine fig 1 the crops are planted on both high and low seedbeds and irrigation is only performed in low seedbeds this technology not only effectively eliminates borders in flat cultivation but also successfully forms a water channel similar to furrow irrigation of ridge cultivation which favors increasing the cropping area liu et al 2021 it has been shown that hlsc can significantly improve crop productivity compared to flat cultivation liu et al 2020a wu et al 2021 we hypothesized that the spike density and resource water nitrogen and radiation use efficiency can be enhanced under hlsc due to the improvement of its cropping area ultimately increasing grain yield however few studies have focused on the characteristics of key production resource utilization in the hlsc pattern to verify this hypothesis a 2 year field experiment was conducted in the ncp to 1 investigate the effects of cultivation patterns on soil water and temperature canopy light distribution and wheat growth and 2 analyze the effects of two cultivation patterns on crop yield economic benefits and resource use efficiency the results will help improve crop productivity and resource use efficiency in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were conducted during the 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 wheat growing seasons at a demonstration site of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences located in qiliying town 35 15 n 113 80 e 81 m altitude xinxiang county henan province china the area has a semihumid climate with a 14 mean annual air temperature with a 9 9 for the wheat season and 582 mm mean annual rainfall the peak occurs in june october the mean rainfall and air temperature during the two seasons are shown in fig 2 the 0 100 cm soil layer is silty loam with a bulk density of 1 51 g cm 3 and a field water capacity of 31 volumetric water content the basic nutrient contents in the 0 40 cm soil layer before sowing were 16 1 g kg 1 of soil organic matter 1 05 g kg 1 of total nitrogen 23 4 mg kg 1 of available phosphorus and 229 5 mg kg 1 of exchangeable potassium on average over the two growing seasons 2 2 experimental design in this study two cultivation patterns were tested for wheat production i e flat cultivation fc and high and low seedbed cultivation hlsc fig 1 for the hlsc pattern two rows of winter wheat were sown in the high bed hlsc h and four rows were sown in the low bed hlsc l the soil of high seedbeds is transported from the low seedbeds by a sowing planter of hlsc fig 1d the machine of the hlsc integrates the five processes of making the high and low seedbeds ditching fertilizing sowing and suppression and completes all the procedures simultaneously for the fc pattern a traditional sowing planter was used fig 1c and the above processes were included except for the fabrication of the high low beds each treatment was repeated three times and arranged within 6 plots each plot in the experimental area was 135 m2 15 m 9 m a 0 5 m wide ridge was built around each plot to prevent runoff experimental plots were precision land leveled to a longitudinal slope of 1 25 and transverse slopes of 0 67 the winter wheat cultivar zhoumai 22 was sown at 180 kg ha 1 on october 18th 2020 and october 30th 2021 the crops were harvested on june 3rd 2021 and june 6th 2022 before sowing urea 46 n calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 60 k2o was applied at 150 120 and 120 kg ha 1 as basal fertilization and mixed into the subsoil with a rotary cultivator the remaining 50 n 150 kg ha 1 was applied before the first irrigation after reviving when the average soil moisture to a depth of 100 cm in the fc pattern decreased to 60 of the field capacity irrigation of 90 mm was applied to the two cultivation patterns the scheduling of irrigation and fertilization applications in the two seasons is shown in table 1 the irrigation water channel in fc and hlsc are shown in fig 1 2 3 methods for field investigation in this study we investigated three production resources water solar radiation and nitrogen under the two cultivation patterns and calculated the crop yield economic benefit and resource use efficiency 2 3 1 soil sampling gravimetric soil water content swc in the top 200 cm depth was determined during both growing seasons soil samples were taken at 20 cm increments from a soil depth of 0 100 cm 40 cm increments from a soil depth of 100 140 cm and 60 cm increments from a soil depth of 140 200 cm at the sowing greening jointing and maturity stages respectively for each plot three random soil core samples were manually taken using a 5 cm diameter auger and sealed in an aluminum case to account for the soil heterogeneity for the hlsc treatment samples were collected from the high seedbed hlsc h and low seedbed hlsc l for the fc treatment soil cores were sampled from the middle of the seedbed soil water storage sws mm is calculated as follows 1 sws swc λ sd where λ g cm 3 is the soil bulk density of each soil layer and sd mm is the soil depth three automatic temperature probes tr 51i thermo recorder t d cooperation japan were buried at 6 cm in the border of the fc and 5 and 15 cm soil depths in the middle of the seedbed in the fc pattern fig 1a similarly five automatic temperature probes were buried at 6 cm in hlsc h and at 5 and 15 cm soil depths in both hlsc h and hlsc l fig 1b the soil temperature was recorded daily at six hour intervals from 0 00 23 00 during the wheat growing season to determine the dynamic of soil moisture after the irrigation soil samples were taken from the 0 200 cm profile at 1 day before irrigation at 1 3 and 7 days after irrigation also the soil no 3 n samples were taken from the 0 120 cm profile at 1 day before irrigation and 7 days after irrigation the three points were randomly selected from each plot for the sampling the no 3 n sample was extracted using 2 mol l 1 kcl solution and measured using a flow analyzer seal analytical inc aa3 hr usa 2 3 2 tiller number lai and accumulated dry matter the tiller number was measured at the seedling greening jointing flowering and maturity stages and a 1 m length per wheat row was randomly selected to count the number of plants the tiller number per ha is determined as follows jha et al 2019 2 tiller number per ha tillers per meter 10000 s 1 where s is the row spacing m and s 0 25 m in the study lai was measured in the wintering greening jointing heading flowering filling and maturity stages respectively from the seedling stage to the overwintering stage twenty plants in each treatment were sampled and the lai was determined following a previously described method si et al 2020 after the greening stage the measurements were taken at midday 11 00 13 00 h on sunny days using a sunscan canopy analyzer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk to measure the lai at both treatments the canopy analyzer was placed parallel to the row direction and near the ground of each plot in six different positions fig 1 the average of these six measurements was considered the lai of each treatment the aboveground biomass of winter wheat was measured at the same stage as the lai measurement twenty wheat plants were randomly collected from the hlsc h and hlsc l and the middle of the seedbed in the fc pattern after sampling all samples were cut into small pieces dried and weighed to determine the constant weight 2 3 3 wheat yield determination at physiological maturity three quadrats were randomly selected to determine the grain yield of each treatment the area of the quadrat was 1 m2 for the hlsc h 0 5 m 2 m and hlsc l 1 0 m 1 0 m and 1 5 m2

converted into weight with a moisture content of 14 2 3 4 light interception li intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar and radiation use efficiency rue photosynthetically active radiation par 0 4 0 7 µm in wavelength transmission above and below the wheat canopy was simultaneously observed using a sunscan canopy analyzer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk tsubo et al 2001 the analyzer has a linear quantum sensor 1 m long with 64 photodiodes equally spaced along its length and a single quantum sensor the beam fraction sensor for measuring par above and beneath plant canopies respectively to measure the transmitted radiation of both treatments the canopy analyzer was placed parallel to the row direction and near the ground of each plot in six different positions fig 1 the average of these six measurements was considered the radiation transmitted by the canopy of each treatment light interception li was calculated as follows du et al 2021b 3 li 1 i 0 i t 100 where i0 and it are the par μmol m 2 s 1 above and below the wheat canopy respectively the daily li was estimated by fitting binomial functions between the measured li and das days after sowing and the li on each day was calculated with the fitted model fig 4 the daily incident par was calculated by multiplying the solar radiation by 0 5 du et al 2015 du et al 2021b the total par intercepted

usa 3 results 3 1 soil water and temperature as shown in fig 2 the soil temperature of the fc pattern was higher than that under the hlsc pattern but no significant difference in daily temperature was observed between the two cultivation patterns on average the hlsc pattern decreased the soil temperature by 0 29 and 0 51 compared with fc in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively similarly there was no significant difference in soil water storage between hlsc and fc in both seasons fig 3 at the early stage of wheat from sowing to greening there was no significant difference in sws between hlsc and fc in both years after that the sws in hlsc was higher than that in fc in 2021 2022 p 0 05 while no significant difference was observed in 2020 2021 at the late growth stages the sws in fc was higher than that in hlsc in 2021 2022 p 0 05 while no significant difference was observed in 2020 2021 fig s1 showed the distribution of swc and soil no3 n with depth before and after irrgation swc varied obviously at the vertical direction but indistinctively in horizontal direction before irrigation 1 d under the fc pattern fig s1e while swc under the hlsc changes significantly in both directions except for the shallow layer fig s1a for the hlsc pattern the swc varied significantly both in horizontal direction and the vertical direction after irrigation fig s1b d however the swc in fc was uniform in the horizontal direction fig s1f h further the no 3 n was primarily concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer while the no 3 n of 0 40 cm soil layer under hlsc was higher than that under fc fig s1j l 3 2 li and horizontal distribution of par within the canopy the li of winter wheat was significantly p 0 05 affected by cultivation pattern in most sampling periods in both seasons fig 4 however few differences were observed during 160 180 das in both two seasons and during 190 210 das in the 2021 2022 season fig 4 compared with that in fc the mean li in hlsc was increased by 4 9 and 4 1 in both the 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 seasons respectively the amount of par intercepted ipar by the wheat crop canopy in the two cultivation patterns over the two growing seasons is shown in fig 5 in this study wheat under the hlsc pattern exhibited a significantly higher ipar than that under fc at different growth periods in 2020 2021 p 0 05 similarly hlsc exhibited highly significant differences in ipar at the filling and harvest stages in 2021 2022 it is worth noting that the ipar in border gaps under the fc pattern was significantly lower than that in other wheat rows compared with that under fc the mean ipar under hlsc increased by 9 1 in 2020 2021 and 9 5 in the 2021 2022 wheat season 3 3 tiller number lai and accumulated dry matter as shown in fig 6a b significant differences in tiller numbers were observed between the hlsc and fc patterns from the flowering to harvest stages p 0 05 while no significant differences were observed from seedling to jointing p 0 05 except for the jointing stage in 2021 2022 in comparison with the fc pattern hlsc increased the tiller number by 11 0 and 12 4 during the jointing to harvest stage in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 seasons respectively the lai of winter wheat increased rapidly during the early growth stage peaked at the filling stage and declined at the maturity stage in both seasons fig 6c d and fig 7 from the wintering to jointing stages the lai under the hlsc pattern was similar to that under the fc pattern however a significant difference in wheat lai was observed between the two cultivation patterns from the heading to filling stages in both seasons at maturity no significant difference in lai was observed between the two cultivation patterns further the rank of lai during jointing to maturity stage was hlsc l fc then hlsc h respectively fig 7 compared with that under the fc treatment the average lai under hlsc increased by 6 5 in the 2020 2021 season and by 4 3 in the 2021 2022 season as shown in fig 6e f no significant differences in aboveground biomass were observed between the hlsc and fc patterns from the wintering to jointing stages p 0 05 while significant differences were observed from the heading to maturity stages in both seasons p 0 05 in comparison with that under the fc pattern the average aboveground biomass under hlsc increased by 11 7 in the 2020 2021 season and by 11 1 in the 2021 2022 season 3 4 grain yield and yield components as shown in table 3 the hlsc treatment markedly improved the grain and biomass yields of wheat p 0 05 compared with the fc pattern the hlsc pattern increased grain yield by 18 3 and 14 5 in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively a similar improvement was observed in biomass yield 20 9 23 0 in both seasons furthermore the hlsc pattern increased the spike density sd by 11 6 and 9 8 relative to fc in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively which contributed to grain yield improvement however no significant differences in the 1000 grain weight and the number of grains per ear were observed between the two cultivation patterns 3 5 wp and rue the et and wp of the wheat in the two cultivation patterns over the two growing seasons are shown in table 4 there was no significant difference in et between hlsc and fc in both seasons furthermore hlsc facilitated wp gy and wp by in both seasons compared with the fc pattern hlsc increased wp gy by 15 6 and 13 2 and wp by by 18 0 and 21 7 in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively as shown in table 4 the wheat ipar was affected by the cultivation patterns in both seasons p 0 05 the wheat ipar under the hlsc pattern was significantly higher than that of wheat under the fc compared with the fc pattern the ipar of wheat in the hlsc treatment increased by 6 6 for the 2020 2021 and 5 5 for the 2021 2022 wheat season respectively in addition the wheat under the hlsc pattern exhibited higher rue than that under fc in both seasons the increase in rue gy under hlsc increased by 11 0 in 2020 2021 and by 8 5 in 2021 2022 respectively the increase in rue by under hlsc increased by 13 4 in 2020 2021 and by 16 6 in 2021 2022 3 6 crop nitrogen uptake and npfp the hlsc pattern distinctly improved crop n uptake relative to the fc pattern table 5 compared with the fc pattern the hlsc pattern increased the total n uptake in biomass n by by 12 8 and 27 2 in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively similarly the increase in total n uptake by grain n gy in the hlsc was 12 1 12 6 meanwhile the hlsc treatment enhanced npfp due to the much higher grain and biomass yields than the fc treatment hlsc significantly increased npfp gy and npfp by in both seasons compared with the fc pattern the hlsc increased npfp gy by 18 3 and 14 5 and npfp by by 20 9 and 23 0 in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively 3 7 economic benefits over the two consecutive growing seasons there was a 4 5 673 8 cny ha 1 reduction on average in the cost of input for the hlsc pattern compared with the fc pattern table 6 this was attributed to the difference in machinery labor and pesticide additionally the hlsc pattern exhibited an obvious increase in the output value of 14 5 18 3 3724 3 4313 9 cny ha 1 compared to the fc pattern consequently the hlsc pattern increased economic benefit by 45 4 59 3 4414 0 4971 8 cny ha 1 in comparison with the fc pattern further there was a 19 6 23 7 increase in hlsc compared to fc 3 8 relationships between grain yield and resource use efficiency the correlations between wheat gy by sd et n gy n by and ipar were determined for the two cultivation patterns fig 8 wheat gy were significantly and positively correlated with by sd n gy n by and ipar in 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 seasons p 0 05 similarly the by were clearly and positively correlated with sd n gy n by and ipar in both two seasons these results suggested that increasing the utilization of key resources nitrogen radiation etc will increase crop productivity 4 discussion 4 1 crop growth et ipar and nitrogen uptake increasing crop yield is a priority of agricultural production in countries all over the world in the 21st century for a long time the fc pattern has been adopted in most areas of crop production in the ncp the disadvantages of fc are insufficient land utilization and plant growth restricted by irrigation channels which in turn reduce crop yield wu et al 2021 therefore hlsc was proposed as a wheat production practice based on the concepts of flat and ridge cultivation to address the problem of low land utilization in this study the hlsc pattern significantly increased the grain yield by 14 5 18 3 and enhanced the efficient use of resources by 13 2 15 6 in water 14 5 18 3 in nitrogen and 8 5 11 0 in radiation compared to the fc pattern meanwhile the hlsc pattern achieved greater net profit by 45 4 59 3 than the fc pattern this was similar to the previous studies showing that ridge cultivation can improve crop productivity by enhancing the ability of resource capture du et al 2021a du et al 2022b garg et al 2022 gogoi et al 2022 overall these results indicate that the hlsc is more profitable in obtaining a higher crop yield and net return with similar input and it would be a reliable economic cultivation pattern in areas of limited water resources which conformed to our hypothesis previous studies have proven that ridge cultivation collects surface runoff generated by irrigation and precipitation reduces ineffective evaporation and raises the soil temperature ali et al 2019 fischer et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a liu et al 2020b in this study however there were no significant differences p 0 05 in soil water storage or et and soil temperature between the hlsc and fc patterns this was mainly attributed to the lai and root water uptake ahmadi et al 2020 the hlsc pattern produced higher lai and aboveground biomass from the heading to maturity stage than the fc pattern while no significant differences were observed during the seedling to the jointing stage figs 6 7 this may be related to crop growth jia et al 2018b zhang et al 2019a and effective planting area fig 1 from the seedling to the jointing stage the wheat grew in sufficient seedbed space in both treatments after that crowding among plants under fc gradually increased with crop development which was detrimental to both tiller development and production resource utilization wang et al 2004 dai et al 2022 taking the 2020 2021 season as an example the actual spike number per ha 1 in effective planting area for hlsc was 703 6 104 while the actual spike number per ha 1 for fc is 788 3 104 the increase in effective planting area would lead to improving tiller development and lai which contributed to greater canopy photosynthetic capacity and accelerated dry matter accumulation from heading to maturity figs 6 7 consequently there was no significant difference in et between hlsc and fc p 0 05 but there were significant differences in grain yield and biomass yield p 0 05 this may prove that hlsc is a high yield and high efficiency planting pattern in the ncp although the planting density and average row spacing of winter wheat under the hlsc pattern were the same as those under the fc pattern fig 1 the amount of ipar under hlsc increased by 5 5 6 6 in both seasons compared with that under the fc pattern table 4 this can be mainly understood as follows 1 the high seedbed of hlsc hlsc h effectively eliminated the border gaps of fc which enhanced wheat lai leading to the increase in li and radiation capture fig 4 and figs 6 7 moreover hlsc increased the effective area of solar radiation resulting in a significant increase in radiation capture fig 5 2 for fc wheat crowding caused by insufficient land utilization inhibits tiller development and lai figs 6 7 and border gaps also directly reduced ipar due to the lack of wheat canopy interception fig 5 these interpretations were supported by studies of crops under ridge cultivation in areas with water shortages worldwide wang et al 2004 fischer et al 2019 du et al 2021b we also observed that the lai and aboveground biomass of wheat under hlsc were similar to those under fc during the wintering to the jointing stage while the lai and biomass under hlsc were significantly higher than those under fc in the late growing season a possible explanation may be that improving ipar in the late growing season was crucial for enhancing crop productivity du et al 2021b furthermore the wheat plants under hlsc intercepted more solar par in the critical period thus enhancing the photosynthetic capacity of crop leaves and resulting in obvious increase in biomass yield table 4 and fig 6 previous research has suggested that crop nitrogen uptake was related to its growth period soil moisture and temperature and nutrient availability liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b czaban et al 2023 in this study the hlsc treatment increased wheat nitrogen uptake relative to the fc treatment table 5 this may be caused by differences in water and nitrogen distribution between hlsc and fc fig s1 also hlsc significantly promoted aboveground biomass accumulation fig 6 which may increase nitrogen uptake or availability and stimulated nitrogen transport from vegetative organs to grains galanopoulou et al 2019 czaban et al 2023 thus ultimately enhancing nitrogen uptake by biomass and grain table 5 4 2 crop yield and resource use efficiency in this study the wheat grain yield and spike density were significantly p 0 05 higher under hlsc than under fc while no significant differences in kernel weight and kernels per head were observed between the two cultivation patterns previous studies showed that the increase in spike density may result in a decrease in kernels per spike and 1000 grain weight geleta et al 2002 bastos et al 2020 however a high spike number per unit area did not result in a loss in kernels per spike and 1000 grain weight in this study likely the interception of more resources radiation water and nitrogen under hlsc has a positive impact on the spike mwale et al 2007b mwale et al 2007a zhang et al 2019a hyles et al 2020 from an agronomic perspective the spike density of wheat is a predominant component in yield determination chakraborty et al 2008 du et al 2021a du et al 2021b ding et al 2022 this result indicated that hlsc has high yield and high efficiency characteristics we also found that the grain yield in the 2020 2021 season was considerably higher than that in the 2021 2022 season p 0 05 the reason may be that the relatively low rainfall input in 2021 2022 caused significant soil desiccation at the middle filling stage figs 2 3 which reduced grain yield and biomass yield to some extent these interpretations were consistent with previous studies li et al 2001 zhang et al 2019b they found that soil water deficit can induce stomatal closure by weakening the plant transpiration rate to effectively utilize limited soil water but this leads to limitation of photosynthesis and inhibition of crop growth in addition to production resource capture resource use efficiency has also been considered by scientists to develop sustainable water saving agricultural production eldoma et al 2016 manevski et al 2017 fischer et al 2019 raza et al 2021 messina et al 2022 in the present study although hlsc and fc had similar et hlsc increased wp gy and wp by in both years table 4 as indicated by its grain and biomass yield higher than that of fc a possible explanation may be the optimization of et components zhang et al 2019b the irrigation for hlsc was only performed in hlsc l hlsc generates an impermeable barrier i e hlsc h to essentially decline soil evaporation fig s1 but raises physiologically significant transpiration of the crop gan et al 2013 liu et al 2020c zhang et al 2020 thus promoting photosynthetic matter production eventually provides the total biomass i e root and straw foundation for high grain yield these explanations agreed with previous studies wang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 they suggested that increasing the coverage ratio or lai can enhance resource use efficiency and crop productivity therefore an accurate estimation of e and t for hlsc during the growth period should be investigated to improve crop productivity and resource use efficiency in future research in this study the wheat rue gy increased from 1 2 to 1 3 g mj 1 in the fc to 1 3 1 5 g mj 1 in the hlsc while rue by increased from 2 8 to 3 2 g mj 1 in the fc to 3 2 3 7 g mj 1 in the hlsc this difference was mainly related to the difference in ipar table 4 and fig 5 and crop nitrogen uptake fletcher et al 2013 additionally the relatively wide crop spacing in the hlsc was conducive to ventilation and sufficient carbon dioxide which benefits the photosynthetic capacity of crop leaves and photosynthetic performance driven by stomata hou et al 2015 du et al 2021b however the border gaps in fc and narrow crop spacing can result in lower ipar and rue similarly compared to that under fc the wheat under hlsc increased by 14 5 18 0 in npfp gy and by 20 8 23 0 in npfp by p 0 05 this was mainly due to hlsc enhancing the dry matter accumulation and total nitrogen of crop nitrogen table 5 at the same time the reason for the increase in npfp could be the improved ipar amount which stimulated the biomass transportation process from the vegetative organs to grains thus eventually increasing npfp these explanations agreed with previous studies negin and moshelion 2016 fischer et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a du et al 2021b they found that the nitrogen uptake of crops was also related to root growth and physiological characteristics jia et al 2018a zhang et al 2019b in agriculture net profits are the ultimate goal in this study the input of insecticide fungicide and labor of fc was higher than that of hlsc this is mainly attributed to the poor ventilation under fc which can increase pests and diseases wu et al 2021 however the input of machinery including fuel cost of hlsc was higher than that of fc taken together there was no significant difference for total input between hlsc and fc nevertheless the hlsc exhibited an obvious increase in net return of 45 4 59 3 in comparison with the fc table 6 indeed the improvement mainly depends on the economic price of agricultural input and output the sensitivity analyses showed that the fluctuation of the market price will significantly affect the net return of hlsc and fc table 7 further the net return of hlsc was greater than 30 relative to fc neither the market price increase nor decreases thus it is reasonable to conclude that the improvement of net return in hlsc was mainly attributed to the rise of grain yield overall hlsc effectively eliminates border gaps of flat cultivation and increases the seedbed area leading to enhanced tiller and lai development and aboveground biomass accumulation which contributes to resource utilization and grain yield in this study hlsc significantly increased grain yield by 14 5 18 3 and net return by 45 4 59 3 and enhanced the efficient use of resources by 13 2 15 6 in water 8 5 11 1 in radiation and 14 5 18 3 in nitrogen compared with fc these findings suggest that the hlsc pattern could be a promising planting pattern for improving crop productivity and resource use efficiency for wheat production relative to fc approximately 175 million hectares of winter wheat are planted in the ncp national bureau of statistics of china 2018 if the hlsc is widely used as the only cultivation pattern it can improve grain yield by 17 billion kg in wheat production relative to fc however one challenge is that it is a two year field experiment performed on a small spatial scale more studies are required to optimize water and fertilizer management with various precipitation years as well as in different soil types the next step is not only to develop appropriate machinery to realize the integration of sowing and harvest for the winter wheat summer maize cropping system but also to invest in the dissemination of hlsc yigezu et al 2021 5 conclusion high and low seedbed cultivation hlsc not only effectively eliminates the borders of flat cultivation fc but also improves the cropping area for wheat production in the study area the results of this two year experiment showed that compared with the fc pattern the hlsc pattern consumed similar et but it significantly increased ipar and crop nitrogen uptake these improvements in hlsc were ascribed primarily to the increased seedbed area and improved canopy light capture moreover hlsc significantly increased grain yield by 14 5 18 3 and net return by 45 4 59 3 and enhanced the efficient use of resources by 13 2 15 6 in water 8 5 11 1 in radiation and 14 5 18 3 in nitrogen compared with fc therefore the hlsc would be a promising planting system for improving crop

8884,to further analyze the accuracy and applicability of empirical cwsi e and theoretical cwsi t crop water stress index calculation methods study was conducted at the usda ars limited irrigation research farm lirf colorado usa during two maize growing seasons in 2013 and 2015 the growth stage and seasonal changes of non water stressed baseline nwsb and non transpiration baseline ntb the effects of environmental factors and the estimation performances of water stress grain yield and wue were analyzed results show that significant correlations p 0 001 with vapor pressure deficit vpd were found for two baselines however the distributions with the changes of vpd and growth stage and seasonal changes of nwsb and ntb were different between two methods specifically neither growth stage nor growing season significantly affects the baselines of cwsi e indicating that the baselines of the empirical method were more stable than those of the theoretical method the lower baselines and smaller difference between nwsb and ntb were more likely to be observed in the theoretical method than the empirical method the greater cwsi values were observed for the theoretical method because of the relatively smaller difference between nwsb and ntb vpd with values greater than 1 5 kpa may a suitable environmental criterion to be used to indicate the applicability of the two cwsi methods for crop water stress estimation both methods could track maize water stress with r2 of 0 55 for cwsi e and 0 49 for cwsi t n 236 with sap flow measurements and could estimate grain yield with the highest r2 of 0 95 and wue with the highest r2 of 0 87 n 24 however greater values and a clear downtrend for three one hour periods were observed for cwsi t because of the relatively smaller difference between nwsb t and ntb t this study contributes to the knowledge in the area of stable and accurate monitoring of crop water status based on cwsi keywords empirical and theoretical cwsi non water stressed baseline sap flow grain yield water use efficiency data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction water availability is becoming the most limiting factor for crop production evans and lawson 2020 the yield of maize has decreased by 40 because of drought on a global scale daryanto et al 2016 comprehensively understanding crop response and crop water use under water stress and adjusting the water supply according to the water needs of the crop are required to achieve the best balance between irrigation water use and crop yield geerts and raes 2009 accurately estimating crop water status is one of the key steps to achieving this goal the traditional methods for crop water status detection including monitoring soil water content and crop physiological characteristics e g stem leaf water potential sap flow and stomatal conductance always rely on specialized equipment and point measurements under field conditions virnodkar et al 2020 the disadvantages of time consuming destructive and labor intensive have prevented producers from using these methods ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 canopy temperature tc which is closely related to crop transpiration rate could address such limitations gautam and pagay 2020 and has been acknowledged as a reliable and non destructive alternative to the methods based on soil moisture and crop physiological characteristics berni et al 2009 osroosh et al 2016 tanner 1963 because tc is not only regulated by the water supply but also by the micro meteorological condition within the field clawson et al 1989 gerhards et al 2018 it is necessary to remove the influence of environmental conditions when tc is adopted to indicate crop water status crop water stress index cwsi derived from tc and several meteorological parameters provides a way to eliminate the influence of environmental conditions idso et al 1981 two methods for calculating cwsi have been widely used and evaluated the empirical method cwsi e developed by idso et al 1981 and the theoretical method cwsi t developed by jackson et al 1981 although the two methods have been widely used to indicate crop water status and schedule irrigations for different crops ballester et al 2013 colaizzi et al 2012 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 efforts are still needed to further analyze the accuracy and applicability of these methods considering the following three aspects firstly the growth stage and seasonal changes of cwsi e baselines for the same crop in the same field are still uncertain significant differences p 0 01 between the baseline equations in 1986 and 1987 were reported for common bermuda grass buffalo grass and tall fescue horst et al 1989 different baseline equations were established for three maize growth stages khorsand et al 2019 however some studies reported that the same baselines could be successfully used in different growing seasons for example the same non water stressed baseline nwsb was used successfully in two growing seasons summer 2012 and 2013 to estimate maize water status dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014a even reported that the same nwsbs could be used for similar varieties of maize in regions with similar climatic conditions secondly the more specific criteria of environmental factors under which reliable cwsi values could be produced need to be determined in the previous study of han et al 2018 conducted at the same research site with this study it was observed that both the empirical and theoretical cwsi methods should not be applied under low vpd conditions the influences of other environmental factors e g wind speed and solar radiation on the accuracy of cwsi values were observed in previous studies o toole and hatfield 1983 stockle and dugas 1992 to ensure the reliability of the cwsi method researchers suggested that data collection should be done under high solar radiation a clear sky high vpd and low wind speed conditions ajayi and olufayo 2004 gardner et al 1992b testi et al 2008 however the specific critical values for solar radiation vpd and wind speed to determine whether reliable cwsi values could be produced were missing in current research further study is needed to determine the above criteria and thus it will be helpful for guiding the informed irrigation management based on cwsi finally to save water with informed irrigation management while maintaining or even improving crop quality and yield fixed critical values of cwsi have been used to indicate the timing of irrigation previous studies conducted for different crops showed that this critical value of cwsi was 0 5 for well irrigated olive orchards and vineyards bellvert et al 2015 berni et al 2009 and 0 4 for coffee and potato plants rinza et al 2019 venturin et al 2020 except for the influences of different crops osroosh et al 2015 variation of this specific cwsi value was also observed for the same crop species as for maize 0 22 was found by irmak et al 2000 under the semi arid mediterranean condition to avoid a decrease of crop yield three values of 0 13 0 55 and 0 15 were found by khorsand et al 2019 for the control treatment in three different maize growth stages to reduce the application difficulty of cwsi for farmers it is necessary to investigate of the reason for the variation of this critical cwsi value for maize therefore the objectives of this study were to further analyze the accuracy and applicability of the two cwsi methods for maize from the following three aspects 1 the growth stage and seasonal changes of cwsi baselines 2 the effects of environmental factors on the performance of cwsi methods and 3 reasons for variation of the critical cwsi value indicating the timing of irrigation 2 materials and methods 2

computed as the ratio of grain yield and seasonal total etc expressed in unit of kg ha 1 mm 1 2 4 crop water stress index crop water stress index cwsi is defined by the non water stressed baseline nwsb and non transpiration baseline ntb and calculated as 1 c w s i t c t a n w s b n t b n w s b where tc ta is the difference between canopy and air temperature nwsb and ntb are the lower and upper limits of tc ta according to the definition cwsi value depends on the position of tc ta value between nwsb and ntb when tc ta value is close to nwsb cwsi value is close to 0 indicating a non water stress condition when tc ta value is close to ntb cwsi value is close to 1 indicating a severe water stress condition occasionally due to tc ta value could be slightly lower than nwsb or greater than ntb the actual cwsi value could be slightly lower than 0 or greater than 1 gardner et al 1992a 2 4 1 empirical method cwsi e nwsb and ntb for cwsi e hereafter noted as nwsb e and ntb e could be defined as idso et al 1981 2 n w s b e a b v p d 3 n t b e a b v p g where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere intercept a and slope b are the linear regression parameters of nwsb on vpd vpg vapor pressure gradient is the change in saturation vapor pressure if the air temperature increases by an amount equal to intercept a in eq 2 2 4 2 theoretical method cwsi t the theoretical development of cwsi is based on surface energy balance equation which includes the following assumption aerodynamic resistance ra adequately represents the resistance to turbulent transport of heat water vapor and momentum jackson et al 1981 jackson et al 1988 then the temperature difference between canopy and air could be defined as 4 t c t a r a ρ c p γ 1 r c r a δ γ 1 r c r a r n g e e δ γ 1 r c r a where tc is the canopy temperature c ta is the air temperature c ra is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 ρ is the air density k g m 3 c p is the heat capacity of air j k g 1 c 1 γ is the psychometric constant p a c 1 δ is the change slope of saturation vapor pressure with temperature p a c 1 r c is the canopy resistance s m 1 r n is the net radiation w m 2 g is heat flux consumed by soil w m 2 e is the air saturated vapor pressure at tc pa and e is the air vapor pressure pa then the ntb t is calculated when r c 5 n t b t r a ρ c p r n g and the nwsb t is calculated when r c r c p 6 n w s b t r a ρ c p γ 1 r c p r a δ γ 1 r c p r a r n g e e δ γ 1 r c p r a where r c p is the canopy resistance under full transpiration condition as for the calculation of r a and r c p several studies have found that the theoretical approach performed well when given a mean r a and r c p during the study period clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 thus the nwsb t and ntb t were calculated by using seasonal average r a and r c p in this study they were estimated by the following equations o toole and real 1986 7 r a ρ c p a r n b δ 1 b 8 r c p r a δ 1 b γ 1 where r n is the seasonal average net radiation δ is the seasonal average slope of saturated vapor pressure temperature relationship and a and b are parameters from eq 2 2 4 3 establishment of the two cwsi methods hourly tc and meteorological data collected in 2013 and 2015 from 10 00 14 00 h mst mountain standard time were adopted for the establishment and evaluation of the two cwsi methods specifically to establish the nwsb e and ntb e tc ta and rh data measured on one or two days after effective irrigation rainfall were adopted to depict tc ta v s vpd dates of data collection were distributed in the late vegetative v reproductive r and maturation m stages in both seasons it is assumed that the soil water deficit is fully replenished after effective irrigation rainfall event and crop could obtain sufficient water irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 thus measured tc ta values could be treated as nwsb e values in addition graph of hourly tc ta vs vpd has a linear segment during 10 00 14 00 h mst this linear segment could be extracted to obtain the coefficients of intercept a and slope b of eq 2 by using the simple linear regression taghvaeian et al 2014a then ntb e could be calculated according to eq 3 based on vpg and the above extracted coefficients to establish the cwsi t ntb t was calculated according to eq 5 and nwsb t was calculated according to eqs 6 8 based on the data collected at the same time with cwsi e 2 5 statistical analysis all data analyses were performed in r language r core team 2020 to explore growth stage and seasonal changes of nwsbs and ntbs for cwsi e and cwsi t one way analysis of variance anova was adopted by using maize growth stage v r and m or season 2013 and 2015 as the independent factor respectively namely nwsbs maize growth stage nwsbs season ntbs maize growth stage and ntbs season anova test was conducted at a significance level of 5 using the aov function the correlation analyses between tc ta and vpd and between the two cwsi methods and maize parameters sap flow grain yield and wue were conducted using the lm function 3 results 3 1 nwsb and ntb of cwsi e and cwsi t 3 1 1 distributions of nwsbs to compare the baselines distributions for the two cwsi methods the changes of nwsbs and ntbs with vpd were shown in fig 2 significant negative correlations were found between nwsb e and vpd with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 for 2013 and 0 94 for 2015 the corresponding slope and intercept were 2 36 c kpa and 5 00 c for 2013 and 2 99 c kpa and 6 71 c for 2015 when data collected in two seasons were pooled together fig 2c significant negative correlation was also found with r2 slope and intercept values of 0 91 2 64 c kpa and 5 74 c respectively as for nwsb t significant negative correlations were found for 2013 2015 and two years with r2 of 0 88 0 95 and 0 91 respectively the slope and intercept for the corresponding relationships were 1 66 c kpa and 1 82 c 1 60 c kpa and 1 57 c and 1 64 c kpa and 1 73 c respectively the larger negative slopes and smaller intercepts were found for nwsb t than nwsb e 3 1 2 distributions of ntbs as shown in figs 2a and 1b significant positive correlations were found between ntb e and vpd with r2 of 0 97 for 2013 and 0 92 for 2015 the corresponding slope and intercept were 0 58 c kpa and 6 60 c for 2013 and 0 97 c kpa and 9 66 c for 2015 when data collected in two seasons were pooled together fig 2c significant positive correlation was also found with r2 slope and intercept values of 0 94 0 73 c kpa and 7 88 c respectively as for ntb t significant positive correlations were also found for 2013 2015 and two years with r2 of 0 35 0 65 and 0 47 respectively the slope and intercept for the corresponding relationships were 0 85 c kpa and 3 71 c 0 97 c kpa and 3 26 c and 0 89 c kpa and 3 54 c respectively smaller r2 values with differences of 0 62 0 27 and 0 47 and smaller intercept values with differences of 2 98 6 40 and 4 34 c for 2013 2015 and two years were found for ntb t than ntb e 3 1 3 growth stage and seasonal changes of nwsb and ntb as shown in table 3 the baselines of the empirical method were not influenced by maize growth stage v r and m or by maize growing season 2013 and 2015 as for the theoretical method only in 2013 nwsb t was influenced by maize growth stage only in 2015 ntb t was not influenced by maize growth stage when maize growing season was taken as the factor nwsb t was significantly influenced with p value of 0 012 and ntb t was not influenced with p value of 0 687 because of the insignificant effects of maize growth stage and season on baselines of the empirical method in this study nwsb e and ntb e established based on the data collected in two years fig 2c were adopted to establish cwsi e 3 2 effects of environmental factors on performance of cwsi e and cwsi t the data collected from the control treatment trt1 in 2013 and 2015 were used to calculate cwsi values for non water stress condition as shown in figs 3a and 2b all outliers were concentrated in the part where vpd was approximately less than 1 5 kpa in figs 3c and 2d most outliers were concentrated when solar radiation was approximately less than 600 w m 2 however the outliers did not show a concentrated distribution with the change of wind speed figs 3e and 2f as they did with vpd or solar radiation therefore the outliers of cwsi e and cwsi t values are mainly caused by the relatively low vpd approximately less than 1 5 kpa and solar radiation approximately less than 600 w m 2 in addition compared to solar radiation the criterion of vpd greater than 1 5 kpa was more suitable to determine the applicability of the two cwsi methods 3 3 relationships between cwsi values and maize sap flow to further compare the performance of cwsi e and cwsi t the corresponding sap flow data were taken as references of maize water status to eliminate the effects of environmental factors on performances of the two methods the data with vpd values less than 1 5 kpa were omitted as shown in fig 4 significant negative correlations were observed for both methods with maize sap flow with r2 of 0 55 for cwsi e and 0 49 for cwsi t n 236 a slightly higher correlation was observed for cwsi e than cwsi t 3 4 seasonal average cwsi values due to most of the vpd values during 10 00 11 00 h mst were less than 1 5 kpa the data collected during 11 00 12 00 h 12 00 13 00 h and 13 00 14 00 h mst were adopted to calculate seasonal average cwsi values table 4 shows the seasonal average cwsi e and cwsi t values observed during the above three one hour periods for trt1 3 8 and 12 respectively in 2015 clear differences were observed for all four treatments during each one hour period using both methods indicating that different water stress has been applied to each water treatment for example cwsi e values were 0 05 0 12 0 30 and 0 45 for trt1 3 8 and 12 respectively during 11 00 12 00 h mst however in 2013 no clear difference was observed among trt1 3 and 8 implying that water stress treatment was not successful except for trt12 for example cwsi t values for trt1 3 8 and 12 were 0 35 0 34 0 32 and 0 64 respectively during 11 00 12 00 h mst another interesting phenomenon was observed that data collection time should be taken into consideration when cwsi t was used to indicate maize water status table 4 specifically similar seasonal average cwsi e values were observed in each water treatment for three one hour periods for example in 2015 average cwsi e values were 0 30 0 29 and 0 29 in trt8 for 11 00 12 00 h 12 00 13 00 h and 13 00 14 00 h mst respectively however the cwsi t value shows a clear downtrend in each water treatment for three one hour periods for example in 2015 average cwsi t values were 0 74 0 59 and 0 50 in trt8 for 11 00 12 00 h 12 00 13 00 h and 13 00 14 00 h mst respectively 3 5 relationships between seasonal average cwsi and grain yield and wue table 5 shows r2 of seasonal average cwsi e and cwsi t with grain yield and wue which were derived by the simple linear regression in 2013 and 2015 significant negative correlations were found for both cwsi e and cwsi t with grain yield p 0 01 and wue p 0 05 when data obtained in two seasons were pooled together the negative correlations for both cwsi e and cwsi t with grain yield and wue became more significant p 0 001 in addition the r2 differences between the two methods were small with the biggest differences of 0 01 for grain yield and 0 02 for wue therefore cwsi e and cwsi t had similar performance for estimation of grain yield and wue 4 discussion 4 1 reasons for the growth stage and seasonal change of the empirical method baselines both growth stage and season did not have significant effects on baselines of the empirical method fig 2 therefore baselines of the empirical method could be established based on the data collected in two seasons as in the following equations 9 n w s b e 5 74 2 64 v p d 10 n t b e 5 74 2 64 v p g the following parts focus on the growth stage and seasonal changes of nwsb e because ntb e and nwsb e share the same coefficients previous studies conducted in maize dejonge et al 2015 vineyard bellvert et al 2014 colak and yazar 2017 grimes and williams 1990 soybean candogan et al 2013 and groundnut kar and kumar 2007 etc have also observed that the same nwsb e could be successfully used in different growing seasons a nwsb e baseline established 25 years ago could be used successfully for the calculation of cwsi e in the same vineyard in 2009 zarco tejada et al 2013 however seasonal and growth stage changes of the empirical method baselines were also observed by other studies alghory and yazar 2019 orta et al 2003 according to jackson et al 1981 1988 the nwsb is a function of solar radiation vpd wind speed and crop resistance therefore significant growth stage and seasonal changes of climate will cause the shift of nwsb e in the study conducted by ajayi and olufayo 2004 for sorghum during three consecutive years 1990 1992 the data collected in 1992 were used separately to establish the nwsb e because of the wet condition with the lowest climatic deficit different nwsb e baselines were established for the reproductive and maturation stages for maize due to the cooler condition in the maturation stage with a significant decrease of 5 85 c of the average daily maximum temperature in 2017 zhang et al 2019 another reason accounts for the growth stage and seasonal shift of nwsb e may be the significant change of transpiration rate during crop growing cycle gonzalez dugo et al 2014 found that data collected in 2010 could not be pooled together to establish the baselines of the empirical method in the orange and mandarin orchards due to the higher transpiration rate than 2009 and 2011 al kayssi et al 2011 found that the lower baseline with a less steep slope was established for the post heading stage because cumin has a relatively lower transpiration rate compared to the pre heading stage similar results that the pre heading and post heading stages had different baselines of the empirical method were found for barely tubaileh et al 1986 wheat gontia and tiwari 2008 and sunflowers nielsen 1994 taghvaeian et al 2014b etc in this study daily average maximum temperature was 29 7 28 5 and 29 5 c in 2013 and 30 4 30 2 and 30 5 c in 2015 for the late vegetative reproductive and maturation stage respectively table 2 indicating that there was not obvious growth stage and seasonal change of climate in 2013 and 2015 the close relationship between sap flow and transpiration rate was reported by venturin et al 2020 so it is reasonable to use sap flow to evaluate the change of maize transpiration rate during different growth stages in 2015 the average sap flow of trt1 were 1 09 1 05 and 1 16 mm h 1 for the late vegetative reproductive and maturation stages respectively during 10 00 14 00 h mst there was no significant growth stage change of maize transpiration rate with the biggest sap flow difference of 0 11 mm h 1 same maize variety and similar climate were in two seasons so insignificant seasonal change of maize transpiration rate should be also observed in 2013 therefore both maize growth stage and season did not have significant effects on the baselines of the empirical method 4 2 effects of different baselines distribution on cwsi e and cwsi t values to analyze the effects of different baselines distribution on the values of cwsi e and cwsi t fig 5 was drawn based on data collected in trt1 on one or two days after effective irrigation rainfall events in most cases cwsi e values were distributed around 0 0 10 to 0 10 outliers beyond the range of 0 10 to 0 10 appeared when vpd was approximately less than 1 5 kpa fig 5a it is reasonable as shown in fig 2c because the coefficients of nswb e and ntb e were obtained based on the linear segment of hourly tc ta v s vpd by the simple linear regression when vpd were approximately less than 1 5 kpa the distance between nwsb e and ntb e would become smaller however the distance between corresponding measured tc ta and nwsb e was relatively stable therefore higher absolute cwsi values would be obtained according to the definition of cwsi eq 1 as shown in fig 5b in most cases cwsi t values were beyond the range of 0 10 to 0 10 an exponential increasing trend was observed for cwsi t with the decrease of vpd even values greater than 1 started to appear when vpd was approximately less than 1 5 kpa as shown in fig 5c in most cases measured tc ta distributed above the nwsb t and even distributed above ntb t when vpd was approximately less than 1 5 kpa therefore greater values would be observed for cwsi t because of the relatively smaller difference between nwsb t and ntb t similarly in the study by khorsand et al 2019 the relatively smaller difference between nwsb and ntb observed for seed seating to seed filling growth stage resulted in an extremely higher average cwsi value of 0 55 for the control treatment the different baseline distribution is another reason for the variation of cwsi values there was an hourly increasing trend of vpd fig 6 and an exponential increasing trend of cwsi t values with the decrease of vpd fig 5b therefore lower values would be observed for cwsi t with the delay of data collection time similarly baselines distribution of the two cwsi methods with vpd also interpreted why the criterion of vpd greater than 1 5 kpa could be used to indicate the applicability of the two cwsi methods for crop water stress estimation in the future the criterion of vpd greater than 1 5 kpa still needs to be tested in specific climate for other crop varieties when data collection time was taken into account only slight differences of r2 were observed for both methods with sap flow with the biggest difference of 0 05 fig 7 therefore although data collection time influences the value of cwsi t it does not influence the ability of cwsi t to estimate maize water stress similar phenomena were also observed that effects were not applied by data collection time on the estimation performance of grain yield and wue by using the two cwsi methods table 5 5 conclusions the results show that both cwsi e and cwsi t can track maize water stress with significant positive correlations with sap flow measurements with r2 of 0 55 and 0 49 n 236 respectively the significant negative correlations are also observed for both methods with grain yield with the highest r2 of 0 95 and with wue with the highest r2 of 0 87 however different distribution and growth stage and seasonal change of nwsb and ntb were observed for the two cwsi methods neither maize growth stage nor growing season significantly affects the baselines of the empirical method the unobvious growth stage and seasonal changes of climate condition and crop transpiration rate may be reasons accounted for this for the two cwsi methods to be used to indicate crop water stress vpd should be greater than 1 5 kpa in the future this criterion still needs to be tested in specific climate for other crop varieties the greater values and a clear downtrend for three one hour periods were observed for cwsi t because of the relatively smaller difference between nwsb t and ntb t although influences were observed on the value of cwsi t its ability to estimate maize water stress grain yield and wue remains unaffected to minimize the variation in the critical cwsi value that indicate the timing of irrigation future research on cwsi t is required in the future funding this study was supported by national key r d program of china 2022zd0115801 and key r d project of jiangsu

8884,to further analyze the accuracy and applicability of empirical cwsi e and theoretical cwsi t crop water stress index calculation methods study was conducted at the usda ars limited irrigation research farm lirf colorado usa during two maize growing seasons in 2013 and 2015 the growth stage and seasonal changes of non water stressed baseline nwsb and non transpiration baseline ntb the effects of environmental factors and the estimation performances of water stress grain yield and wue were analyzed results show that significant correlations p 0 001 with vapor pressure deficit vpd were found for two baselines however the distributions with the changes of vpd and growth stage and seasonal changes of nwsb and ntb were different between two methods specifically neither growth stage nor growing season significantly affects the baselines of cwsi e indicating that the baselines of the empirical method were more stable than those of the theoretical method the lower baselines and smaller difference between nwsb and ntb were more likely to be observed in the theoretical method than the empirical method the greater cwsi values were observed for the theoretical method because of the relatively smaller difference between nwsb and ntb vpd with values greater than 1 5 kpa may a suitable environmental criterion to be used to indicate the applicability of the two cwsi methods for crop water stress estimation both methods could track maize water stress with r2 of 0 55 for cwsi e and 0 49 for cwsi t n 236 with sap flow measurements and could estimate grain yield with the highest r2 of 0 95 and wue with the highest r2 of 0 87 n 24 however greater values and a clear downtrend for three one hour periods were observed for cwsi t because of the relatively smaller difference between nwsb t and ntb t this study contributes to the knowledge in the area of stable and accurate monitoring of crop water status based on cwsi keywords empirical and theoretical cwsi non water stressed baseline sap flow grain yield water use efficiency data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction water availability is becoming the most limiting factor for crop production evans and lawson 2020 the yield of maize has decreased by 40 because of drought on a global scale daryanto et al 2016 comprehensively understanding crop response and crop water use under water stress and adjusting the water supply according to the water needs of the crop are required to achieve the best balance between irrigation water use and crop yield geerts and raes 2009 accurately estimating crop water status is one of the key steps to achieving this goal the traditional methods for crop water status detection including monitoring soil water content and crop physiological characteristics e g stem leaf water potential sap flow and stomatal conductance always rely on specialized equipment and point measurements under field conditions virnodkar et al 2020 the disadvantages of time consuming destructive and labor intensive have prevented producers from using these methods ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 canopy temperature tc which is closely related to crop transpiration rate could address such limitations gautam and pagay 2020 and has been acknowledged as a reliable and non destructive alternative to the methods based on soil moisture and crop physiological characteristics berni et al 2009 osroosh et al 2016 tanner 1963 because tc is not only regulated by the water supply but also by the micro meteorological condition within the field clawson et al 1989 gerhards et al 2018 it is necessary to remove the influence of environmental conditions when tc is adopted to indicate crop water status crop water stress index cwsi derived from tc and several meteorological parameters provides a way to eliminate the influence of environmental conditions idso et al 1981 two methods for calculating cwsi have been widely used and evaluated the empirical method cwsi e developed by idso et al 1981 and the theoretical method cwsi t developed by jackson et al 1981 although the two methods have been widely used to indicate crop water status and schedule irrigations for different crops ballester et al 2013 colaizzi et al 2012 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 efforts are still needed to further analyze the accuracy and applicability of these methods considering the following three aspects firstly the growth stage and seasonal changes of cwsi e baselines for the same crop in the same field are still uncertain significant differences p 0 01 between the baseline equations in 1986 and 1987 were reported for common bermuda grass buffalo grass and tall fescue horst et al 1989 different baseline equations were established for three maize growth stages khorsand et al 2019 however some studies reported that the same baselines could be successfully used in different growing seasons for example the same non water stressed baseline nwsb was used successfully in two growing seasons summer 2012 and 2013 to estimate maize water status dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014a even reported that the same nwsbs could be used for similar varieties of maize in regions with similar climatic conditions secondly the more specific criteria of environmental factors under which reliable cwsi values could be produced need to be determined in the previous study of han et al 2018 conducted at the same research site with this study it was observed that both the empirical and theoretical cwsi methods should not be applied under low vpd conditions the influences of other environmental factors e g wind speed and solar radiation on the accuracy of cwsi values were observed in previous studies o toole and hatfield 1983 stockle and dugas 1992 to ensure the reliability of the cwsi method researchers suggested that data collection should be done under high solar radiation a clear sky high vpd and low wind speed conditions ajayi and olufayo 2004 gardner et al 1992b testi et al 2008 however the specific critical values for solar radiation vpd and wind speed to determine whether reliable cwsi values could be produced were missing in current research further study is needed to determine the above criteria and thus it will be helpful for guiding the informed irrigation management based on cwsi finally to save water with informed irrigation management while maintaining or even improving crop quality and yield fixed critical values of cwsi have been used to indicate the timing of irrigation previous studies conducted for different crops showed that this critical value of cwsi was 0 5 for well irrigated olive orchards and vineyards bellvert et al 2015 berni et al 2009 and 0 4 for coffee and potato plants rinza et al 2019 venturin et al 2020 except for the influences of different crops osroosh et al 2015 variation of this specific cwsi value was also observed for the same crop species as for maize 0 22 was found by irmak et al 2000 under the semi arid mediterranean condition to avoid a decrease of crop yield three values of 0 13 0 55 and 0 15 were found by khorsand et al 2019 for the control treatment in three different maize growth stages to reduce the application difficulty of cwsi for farmers it is necessary to investigate of the reason for the variation of this critical cwsi value for maize therefore the objectives of this study were to further analyze the accuracy and applicability of the two cwsi methods for maize from the following three aspects 1 the growth stage and seasonal changes of cwsi baselines 2 the effects of environmental factors on the performance of cwsi methods and 3 reasons for variation of the critical cwsi value indicating the timing of irrigation 2 materials and methods 2

computed as the ratio of grain yield and seasonal total etc expressed in unit of kg ha 1 mm 1 2 4 crop water stress index crop water stress index cwsi is defined by the non water stressed baseline nwsb and non transpiration baseline ntb and calculated as 1 c w s i t c t a n w s b n t b n w s b where tc ta is the difference between canopy and air temperature nwsb and ntb are the lower and upper limits of tc ta according to the definition cwsi value depends on the position of tc ta value between nwsb and ntb when tc ta value is close to nwsb cwsi value is close to 0 indicating a non water stress condition when tc ta value is close to ntb cwsi value is close to 1 indicating a severe water stress condition occasionally due to tc ta value could be slightly lower than nwsb or greater than ntb the actual cwsi value could be slightly lower than 0 or greater than 1 gardner et al 1992a 2 4 1 empirical method cwsi e nwsb and ntb for cwsi e hereafter noted as nwsb e and ntb e could be defined as idso et al 1981 2 n w s b e a b v p d 3 n t b e a b v p g where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere intercept a and slope b are the linear regression parameters of nwsb on vpd vpg vapor pressure gradient is the change in saturation vapor pressure if the air temperature increases by an amount equal to intercept a in eq 2 2 4 2 theoretical method cwsi t the theoretical development of cwsi is based on surface energy balance equation which includes the following assumption aerodynamic resistance ra adequately represents the resistance to turbulent transport of heat water vapor and momentum jackson et al 1981 jackson et al 1988 then the temperature difference between canopy and air could be defined as 4 t c t a r a ρ c p γ 1 r c r a δ γ 1 r c r a r n g e e δ γ 1 r c r a where tc is the canopy temperature c ta is the air temperature c ra is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 ρ is the air density k g m 3 c p is the heat capacity of air j k g 1 c 1 γ is the psychometric constant p a c 1 δ is the change slope of saturation vapor pressure with temperature p a c 1 r c is the canopy resistance s m 1 r n is the net radiation w m 2 g is heat flux consumed by soil w m 2 e is the air saturated vapor pressure at tc pa and e is the air vapor pressure pa then the ntb t is calculated when r c 5 n t b t r a ρ c p r n g and the nwsb t is calculated when r c r c p 6 n w s b t r a ρ c p γ 1 r c p r a δ γ 1 r c p r a r n g e e δ γ 1 r c p r a where r c p is the canopy resistance under full transpiration condition as for the calculation of r a and r c p several studies have found that the theoretical approach performed well when given a mean r a and r c p during the study period clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 thus the nwsb t and ntb t were calculated by using seasonal average r a and r c p in this study they were estimated by the following equations o toole and real 1986 7 r a ρ c p a r n b δ 1 b 8 r c p r a δ 1 b γ 1 where r n is the seasonal average net radiation δ is the seasonal average slope of saturated vapor pressure temperature relationship and a and b are parameters from eq 2 2 4 3 establishment of the two cwsi methods hourly tc and meteorological data collected in 2013 and 2015 from 10 00 14 00 h mst mountain standard time were adopted for the establishment and evaluation of the two cwsi methods specifically to establish the nwsb e and ntb e tc ta and rh data measured on one or two days after effective irrigation rainfall were adopted to depict tc ta v s vpd dates of data collection were distributed in the late vegetative v reproductive r and maturation m stages in both seasons it is assumed that the soil water deficit is fully replenished after effective irrigation rainfall event and crop could obtain sufficient water irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 thus measured tc ta values could be treated as nwsb e values in addition graph of hourly tc ta vs vpd has a linear segment during 10 00 14 00 h mst this linear segment could be extracted to obtain the coefficients of intercept a and slope b of eq 2 by using the simple linear regression taghvaeian et al 2014a then ntb e could be calculated according to eq 3 based on vpg and the above extracted coefficients to establish the cwsi t ntb t was calculated according to eq 5 and nwsb t was calculated according to eqs 6 8 based on the data collected at the same time with cwsi e 2 5 statistical analysis all data analyses were performed in r language r core team 2020 to explore growth stage and seasonal changes of nwsbs and ntbs for cwsi e and cwsi t one way analysis of variance anova was adopted by using maize growth stage v r and m or season 2013 and 2015 as the independent factor respectively namely nwsbs maize growth stage nwsbs season ntbs maize growth stage and ntbs season anova test was conducted at a significance level of 5 using the aov function the correlation analyses between tc ta and vpd and between the two cwsi methods and maize parameters sap flow grain yield and wue were conducted using the lm function 3 results 3 1 nwsb and ntb of cwsi e and cwsi t 3 1 1 distributions of nwsbs to compare the baselines distributions for the two cwsi methods the changes of nwsbs and ntbs with vpd were shown in fig 2 significant negative correlations were found between nwsb e and vpd with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 for 2013 and 0 94 for 2015 the corresponding slope and intercept were 2 36 c kpa and 5 00 c for 2013 and 2 99 c kpa and 6 71 c for 2015 when data collected in two seasons were pooled together fig 2c significant negative correlation was also found with r2 slope and intercept values of 0 91 2 64 c kpa and 5 74 c respectively as for nwsb t significant negative correlations were found for 2013 2015 and two years with r2 of 0 88 0 95 and 0 91 respectively the slope and intercept for the corresponding relationships were 1 66 c kpa and 1 82 c 1 60 c kpa and 1 57 c and 1 64 c kpa and 1 73 c respectively the larger negative slopes and smaller intercepts were found for nwsb t than nwsb e 3 1 2 distributions of ntbs as shown in figs 2a and 1b significant positive correlations were found between ntb e and vpd with r2 of 0 97 for 2013 and 0 92 for 2015 the corresponding slope and intercept were 0 58 c kpa and 6 60 c for 2013 and 0 97 c kpa and 9 66 c for 2015 when data collected in two seasons were pooled together fig 2c significant positive correlation was also found with r2 slope and intercept values of 0 94 0 73 c kpa and 7 88 c respectively as for ntb t significant positive correlations were also found for 2013 2015 and two years with r2 of 0 35 0 65 and 0 47 respectively the slope and intercept for the corresponding relationships were 0 85 c kpa and 3 71 c 0 97 c kpa and 3 26 c and 0 89 c kpa and 3 54 c respectively smaller r2 values with differences of 0 62 0 27 and 0 47 and smaller intercept values with differences of 2 98 6 40 and 4 34 c for 2013 2015 and two years were found for ntb t than ntb e 3 1 3 growth stage and seasonal changes of nwsb and ntb as shown in table 3 the baselines of the empirical method were not influenced by maize growth stage v r and m or by maize growing season 2013 and 2015 as for the theoretical method only in 2013 nwsb t was influenced by maize growth stage only in 2015 ntb t was not influenced by maize growth stage when maize growing season was taken as the factor nwsb t was significantly influenced with p value of 0 012 and ntb t was not influenced with p value of 0 687 because of the insignificant effects of maize growth stage and season on baselines of the empirical method in this study nwsb e and ntb e established based on the data collected in two years fig 2c were adopted to establish cwsi e 3 2 effects of environmental factors on performance of cwsi e and cwsi t the data collected from the control treatment trt1 in 2013 and 2015 were used to calculate cwsi values for non water stress condition as shown in figs 3a and 2b all outliers were concentrated in the part where vpd was approximately less than 1 5 kpa in figs 3c and 2d most outliers were concentrated when solar radiation was approximately less than 600 w m 2 however the outliers did not show a concentrated distribution with the change of wind speed figs 3e and 2f as they did with vpd or solar radiation therefore the outliers of cwsi e and cwsi t values are mainly caused by the relatively low vpd approximately less than 1 5 kpa and solar radiation approximately less than 600 w m 2 in addition compared to solar radiation the criterion of vpd greater than 1 5 kpa was more suitable to determine the applicability of the two cwsi methods 3 3 relationships between cwsi values and maize sap flow to further compare the performance of cwsi e and cwsi t the corresponding sap flow data were taken as references of maize water status to eliminate the effects of environmental factors on performances of the two methods the data with vpd values less than 1 5 kpa were omitted as shown in fig 4 significant negative correlations were observed for both methods with maize sap flow with r2 of 0 55 for cwsi e and 0 49 for cwsi t n 236 a slightly higher correlation was observed for cwsi e than cwsi t 3 4 seasonal average cwsi values due to most of the vpd values during 10 00 11 00 h mst were less than 1 5 kpa the data collected during 11 00 12 00 h 12 00 13 00 h and 13 00 14 00 h mst were adopted to calculate seasonal average cwsi values table 4 shows the seasonal average cwsi e and cwsi t values observed during the above three one hour periods for trt1 3 8 and 12 respectively in 2015 clear differences were observed for all four treatments during each one hour period using both methods indicating that different water stress has been applied to each water treatment for example cwsi e values were 0 05 0 12 0 30 and 0 45 for trt1 3 8 and 12 respectively during 11 00 12 00 h mst however in 2013 no clear difference was observed among trt1 3 and 8 implying that water stress treatment was not successful except for trt12 for example cwsi t values for trt1 3 8 and 12 were 0 35 0 34 0 32 and 0 64 respectively during 11 00 12 00 h mst another interesting phenomenon was observed that data collection time should be taken into consideration when cwsi t was used to indicate maize water status table 4 specifically similar seasonal average cwsi e values were observed in each water treatment for three one hour periods for example in 2015 average cwsi e values were 0 30 0 29 and 0 29 in trt8 for 11 00 12 00 h 12 00 13 00 h and 13 00 14 00 h mst respectively however the cwsi t value shows a clear downtrend in each water treatment for three one hour periods for example in 2015 average cwsi t values were 0 74 0 59 and 0 50 in trt8 for 11 00 12 00 h 12 00 13 00 h and 13 00 14 00 h mst respectively 3 5 relationships between seasonal average cwsi and grain yield and wue table 5 shows r2 of seasonal average cwsi e and cwsi t with grain yield and wue which were derived by the simple linear regression in 2013 and 2015 significant negative correlations were found for both cwsi e and cwsi t with grain yield p 0 01 and wue p 0 05 when data obtained in two seasons were pooled together the negative correlations for both cwsi e and cwsi t with grain yield and wue became more significant p 0 001 in addition the r2 differences between the two methods were small with the biggest differences of 0 01 for grain yield and 0 02 for wue therefore cwsi e and cwsi t had similar performance for estimation of grain yield and wue 4 discussion 4 1 reasons for the growth stage and seasonal change of the empirical method baselines both growth stage and season did not have significant effects on baselines of the empirical method fig 2 therefore baselines of the empirical method could be established based on the data collected in two seasons as in the following equations 9 n w s b e 5 74 2 64 v p d 10 n t b e 5 74 2 64 v p g the following parts focus on the growth stage and seasonal changes of nwsb e because ntb e and nwsb e share the same coefficients previous studies conducted in maize dejonge et al 2015 vineyard bellvert et al 2014 colak and yazar 2017 grimes and williams 1990 soybean candogan et al 2013 and groundnut kar and kumar 2007 etc have also observed that the same nwsb e could be successfully used in different growing seasons a nwsb e baseline established 25 years ago could be used successfully for the calculation of cwsi e in the same vineyard in 2009 zarco tejada et al 2013 however seasonal and growth stage changes of the empirical method baselines were also observed by other studies alghory and yazar 2019 orta et al 2003 according to jackson et al 1981 1988 the nwsb is a function of solar radiation vpd wind speed and crop resistance therefore significant growth stage and seasonal changes of climate will cause the shift of nwsb e in the study conducted by ajayi and olufayo 2004 for sorghum during three consecutive years 1990 1992 the data collected in 1992 were used separately to establish the nwsb e because of the wet condition with the lowest climatic deficit different nwsb e baselines were established for the reproductive and maturation stages for maize due to the cooler condition in the maturation stage with a significant decrease of 5 85 c of the average daily maximum temperature in 2017 zhang et al 2019 another reason accounts for the growth stage and seasonal shift of nwsb e may be the significant change of transpiration rate during crop growing cycle gonzalez dugo et al 2014 found that data collected in 2010 could not be pooled together to establish the baselines of the empirical method in the orange and mandarin orchards due to the higher transpiration rate than 2009 and 2011 al kayssi et al 2011 found that the lower baseline with a less steep slope was established for the post heading stage because cumin has a relatively lower transpiration rate compared to the pre heading stage similar results that the pre heading and post heading stages had different baselines of the empirical method were found for barely tubaileh et al 1986 wheat gontia and tiwari 2008 and sunflowers nielsen 1994 taghvaeian et al 2014b etc in this study daily average maximum temperature was 29 7 28 5 and 29 5 c in 2013 and 30 4 30 2 and 30 5 c in 2015 for the late vegetative reproductive and maturation stage respectively table 2 indicating that there was not obvious growth stage and seasonal change of climate in 2013 and 2015 the close relationship between sap flow and transpiration rate was reported by venturin et al 2020 so it is reasonable to use sap flow to evaluate the change of maize transpiration rate during different growth stages in 2015 the average sap flow of trt1 were 1 09 1 05 and 1 16 mm h 1 for the late vegetative reproductive and maturation stages respectively during 10 00 14 00 h mst there was no significant growth stage change of maize transpiration rate with the biggest sap flow difference of 0 11 mm h 1 same maize variety and similar climate were in two seasons so insignificant seasonal change of maize transpiration rate should be also observed in 2013 therefore both maize growth stage and season did not have significant effects on the baselines of the empirical method 4 2 effects of different baselines distribution on cwsi e and cwsi t values to analyze the effects of different baselines distribution on the values of cwsi e and cwsi t fig 5 was drawn based on data collected in trt1 on one or two days after effective irrigation rainfall events in most cases cwsi e values were distributed around 0 0 10 to 0 10 outliers beyond the range of 0 10 to 0 10 appeared when vpd was approximately less than 1 5 kpa fig 5a it is reasonable as shown in fig 2c because the coefficients of nswb e and ntb e were obtained based on the linear segment of hourly tc ta v s vpd by the simple linear regression when vpd were approximately less than 1 5 kpa the distance between nwsb e and ntb e would become smaller however the distance between corresponding measured tc ta and nwsb e was relatively stable therefore higher absolute cwsi values would be obtained according to the definition of cwsi eq 1 as shown in fig 5b in most cases cwsi t values were beyond the range of 0 10 to 0 10 an exponential increasing trend was observed for cwsi t with the decrease of vpd even values greater than 1 started to appear when vpd was approximately less than 1 5 kpa as shown in fig 5c in most cases measured tc ta distributed above the nwsb t and even distributed above ntb t when vpd was approximately less than 1 5 kpa therefore greater values would be observed for cwsi t because of the relatively smaller difference between nwsb t and ntb t similarly in the study by khorsand et al 2019 the relatively smaller difference between nwsb and ntb observed for seed seating to seed filling growth stage resulted in an extremely higher average cwsi value of 0 55 for the control treatment the different baseline distribution is another reason for the variation of cwsi values there was an hourly increasing trend of vpd fig 6 and an exponential increasing trend of cwsi t values with the decrease of vpd fig 5b therefore lower values would be observed for cwsi t with the delay of data collection time similarly baselines distribution of the two cwsi methods with vpd also interpreted why the criterion of vpd greater than 1 5 kpa could be used to indicate the applicability of the two cwsi methods for crop water stress estimation in the future the criterion of vpd greater than 1 5 kpa still needs to be tested in specific climate for other crop varieties when data collection time was taken into account only slight differences of r2 were observed for both methods with sap flow with the biggest difference of 0 05 fig 7 therefore although data collection time influences the value of cwsi t it does not influence the ability of cwsi t to estimate maize water stress similar phenomena were also observed that effects were not applied by data collection time on the estimation performance of grain yield and wue by using the two cwsi methods table 5 5 conclusions the results show that both cwsi e and cwsi t can track maize water stress with significant positive correlations with sap flow measurements with r2 of 0 55 and 0 49 n 236 respectively the significant negative correlations are also observed for both methods with grain yield with the highest r2 of 0 95 and with wue with the highest r2 of 0 87 however different distribution and growth stage and seasonal change of nwsb and ntb were observed for the two cwsi methods neither maize growth stage nor growing season significantly affects the baselines of the empirical method the unobvious growth stage and seasonal changes of climate condition and crop transpiration rate may be reasons accounted for this for the two cwsi methods to be used to indicate crop water stress vpd should be greater than 1 5 kpa in the future this criterion still needs to be tested in specific climate for other crop varieties the greater values and a clear downtrend for three one hour periods were observed for cwsi t because of the relatively smaller difference between nwsb t and ntb t although influences were observed on the value of cwsi t its ability to estimate maize water stress grain yield and wue remains unaffected to minimize the variation in the critical cwsi value that indicate the timing of irrigation future research on cwsi t is required in the future funding this study was supported by national key r d program of china 2022zd0115801 and key r d project of jiangsu
