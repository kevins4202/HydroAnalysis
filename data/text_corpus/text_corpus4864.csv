24320,fish that engage in mutualistic cleaning behaviour cleaner fishes have recently been popularized as a nature based method of controlling ectoparasite outbreaks in fish farms outbreaks impact animal welfare and threaten wild fish populations due to this millions of cleaner fish especially wrasses from the family labridae are wild caught each year and transferred into atlantic salmon salmo salar farms to remove ectoparasitic sea lice predominantly lepeophtheirus salmonis from farmed salmon and reduce spillover i e parasites transferring from farmed to wild fish onto vulnerable wild salmonid populations however we hypothesize that this practice may result in no net benefit to the infestation pressure on wild fish if gains in farm based control trade off against the removal of lice from wild fish by wrasse moved from the wild into net pens such a scenario would entail a zero sum game we test our hypothesis using an ecological simulation of wrasse as cleaners of farmed atlantic salmon and wild sea trout salmo trutta we parameterized our simulation based on published models of sea lice epidemics from farms to calculate the relative impact of lice when wrasse are removed from the ecosystem to serve as cleaners our simulations revealed that a zero sum game can emerge from this system at unexpectedly infrequent rates of cleaning by wrasse in the wild scandinavian wrasses are relatively data poor and parameterizing our simulation revealed a need for better data on the ecological role of these fishes in coastal ecosystems for the first time we suggest that wrasse fisheries may be a zero sum game and that under a plausible set of conditions fishing wrasse out of coastal ecosystems may do more harm than good for modulating sea lice epidemics however we emphasize that these results do not suggest that wrasse alone will play a role in resolving high infestation pressure of lice emanating from fish farms keywords sea trout wrasse sea lice parasitism aquaculture estuaries and coasts data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction pathogens play a key role in ecosystems by feeding on their hosts parasites contribute to natural mortality in a population thereby regulating abundance and driving selection lafferty et al 2006 2008 however the establishment spread and outbreak of pathogenic species is a critical challenge confronted by domestic farming that threatens sustainability blaylock and bullard 2014 to reduce the spread of pathogens from reservoirs of farmed fish to wild populations aquaculture management aims to limit the density of sea lice in cages and thereby the reproductive rate of lice reducing export of infective stages into the environment parsons et al 2020 confronting sustainability challenges from parasite outbreaks on farms open net pen fish farm aquaculture is now increasingly relying on the use of cleaner fish that are stocked into net pens to eat parasitic lice and reduce infestation pressure in the area within and adjacent to the farm labridae and cyclopteridae kristoffersen et al 2014 these cleaner fishes are stocked into the net pens and expected to feed on the lice to reduce density and epidemic potential original research by bjordal 1991 based on observations in potts 1973 samuelsen 1981 hilld√©n 1981 1983 there is a thriving wild capture fishery that transports wild wrasse from fjords to fish farms for lice management these wild wrasse fisheries move millions of wild wrasse from the fjords into net pens skiftesvik et al 1996 gonzalez and de boer 2017 in norway the fisheries directorate reported 54 million wrasse captured in wild fisheries for aquaculture cleaner fish from 2018 2020 concerns about recruiting wild wrasse are manifold including the condition of the fish in cages geitung et al 2020 overfishing of wild wrasses d arcy et al 2013 phenotypic changes to wrasse populations halvorsen et al 2017 and genetic introgression of alien wrasse that escape cages and interbreed with wild populations faust et al 2018 also troubling is recent evidence questioning whether cleaner fish currently manage sea lice epidemics in cages sufficiently to justify their use barrett et al 2020 however ecosystem impacts of wrasse fisheries have not been adequately explored philis et al 2021 wild wrasses are important to coastal ecosystems and are known to engage in cleaning behaviour in the wild hillden et al 1983 breen 1996 we hypothesize that the role of wrasse in the wild as cleaners is a potentially valuable ecosystem service that is not adequately accounted for and may therefore represent an ecosystem impact of wrasse fisheries in game theory zero sum games emerge when benefits in one realm are enjoyed at the costs of another a sum netting zero to test our hypothesis we conceptualized wrasse fishing as a game that transfers the benefits of direct lice cleaning behaviour on wild fish to indirect effects of reducing infestation pressure from fish farms by picking lice in sea cages the outcome of the simulated game would resolve how active wrasse must be at directly picking lice in the wild to offset the benefits of moving them into sea cages where they have a known effect on infestation pressure calculable from published data simulations were parameterized with empirical data from the literature and realistic values for unknown parameters based on our own research the simulation aims to determine how suitable wild capture fisheries are for establishing cleaner fish for use in aquaculture and inform efforts to enhance industry sustainability 2 methods 2 1 model parameterization we developed a model to simulate the result of a game between moving wrasse and leaving wrasse in place to determine whether a zero sum solution emerged using r programming software r core team 2022 the simulation was parameterized based on the transport of cleaner fish from the wild into fish farms fig 1 table 1 the model of wrasse cleaning behaviour relies on several key assumptions about wrasse sea trout and their interaction the model parameters included the wrasse population in a fjord rate and functional response of lice predation in cages and in the wild sea trout abundance and infestation pressure of sea lice in fjords as a function of lice abundance in cages we describe below the evidence underlying these model parameters and our strategy for parameterizing the model the model has two components 1 indirect contribution of cleaner wrasse to wild salmonids first we modeled the extent to which stocking wild wrasse into the cages reduced infestation pressure of lice on wild fish based on published data infestation pressure in this context is the number of adult lice available to parasitize salmonids in a defined area reduced infestation pressure is a function of how many lice originating from farms will attach and develop on wild fish in a situation without the cleaner fish present in cages and how much stocking wrasse will reduce this number the difference between these two scenarios is the environmental effect of fishing and stocking wild wrasse in net pens 2 direct relief of sea lice by wild wrasse on wild salmonids second we modeled how many lice are removed from the wild fish if the wrasse is allowed to remain and interact with the wild fish cleaning them of lice at some variable rate the aim of this model was to estimate in what parameter space the effect of wrasse picking sea lice in the wild generates a zero sum game or whether there are net gains or losses with respect to lice burdens on wild fish from the lice management approach of moving wrasse into net pens table 2 2 1 1 indirect contribution of cleaner wrasse to wild salmonids 2 1 1 1 effect of cleaner wrasse on louse populations in salmon farms barrett et al 2020 constructed a statistical model of cleaner fish efficiency across 488 norwegian salmon farms that completed a full grow out cycle during 2016 2018 they compared the rate of change in adult female salmon louse density according to the number of cleaner fish stocked finding that the detectable effect of cleaner fish in fish farms was highly variable and that on average cleaner fish slowed but did not stop louse population growth to parameterize the first component of the model we required a similar function to barrett et al 2020 but one that predicted louse densities rather than population growth rates according to wrasse use starting with the same dataset of 488 grow out cycles we constrained the data to a defined season of wrasse use spanning weeks 20 40 about mid may to mid october in each year from 2016 to 2018 for each week of this wrasse season at each farm we summed the number of wrasse stocked from week 20 up until the current week and corrected for farm size using maximum allowable biomass as a proxy to improve our ability to detect a wrasse effect on lice we omitted weekly records where i the farm was thought to be less than 30 weeks into the grow out cycle at the time louse infestations vary with grow out phase and season ii delousing had been reported in the current or previous 2 weeks or iii more than 20 wrasse per t had been used as such high rates of cleaner fish use are not typical and are not expected to be efficient the function was only fitted to data from weeks 31 to 40 when sea temperatures have typically warmed sufficiently for wrasse to be active feeders using the nls function in r we fitted a negative exponential regression model in which the density of adult female sea lice at a farm was predicted by cumulative wrasse stocking effort the fitted function was significant df 351 p 0 01 1 y 0 5247 e x p 0 1082 w p t where y is louse density expressed as adult female sea lice per farmed salmon and wpt is the number of wrasse stocked over the season to date expressed per t of allowable biomass for context an average salmon farm has a maximum allowable biomass of 3500 t the wrasse effect was then further simplified into a reduction in the density of adult female sea lice which it is assumed will lead to a corresponding reduction in the number of louse eggs released from salmon farms to infest wild fish this reduction in infestation pressure is given as 2 r e l r e d 1 y y 0 where rel red is the relative reduction from a scenario with no wrasse stocked y0 to a scenario with a given number of wrasse stocked y 2 1 1 2 lice attachment to adult salmonids the population dynamics of lice are highly dependent on water temperature stien et al 2005 external infestation pressure from fish farms are known to influence the lice dynamics in adjacent populations that infect wild fish kristoffersen et al 2014 vollset et al 2019 several models exist that use a number of gravid female lice in fish farms to calculate the infestation pressure on adjacent farms or wild fish sandvik et al 2020 a simple model was developed by aldrin et al 2013 and further applied by kristoffersen et al 2014 which used a dataset on number of lice attached to fish in sentinel cages to develop a risk equation that predicted number of lice attaching to adjacent wild fish as a function of the distance from the farm where the infestation pressure is a function of number of gravid female lice and the temperature the decrease in infestation pressure by distance is as follows 3 r r i p e 1 44 0 351 d 57 1 0 57 e 1 44 0 351 0 57 1 0 57 where r r i p is the risk reduction and d is the distance in kilometers from the fish farm to estimate the number of lice on a sea trout at a given distance from the source i e fish farm we use the fitted equation between lice in cages and the log transformed external infestation pressure from kristoffersen et al 2014 the equation is a as follows 4 l i c e e 14 603 l o g 7 d a y s 0 843 l o g i p r r i p p r o p a d u l t where weeks is the number of weeks up to 10 weeks the wild fish has been in the area ip is the infestation pressure estimated from female lice as described in kristoffersen et al 2014 r r i p is explained above while propadult is a correction for mortality of lice during development where we argue that only 70 of the lice that is counted on fish in sentinel cages will develop to adult stages grimnes and jakobsen 1996 bjorn and finstad 1997 1998 ip rrip is equivalent to ipc t in kristofferesen et al 2014 i e distance corrected external infestation pressure 2 1 1 3 what is the reduction of lice on wild fish from stocking wrasse by combining the estimation of reduction in infestation pressure 1 1 and the effect of infestation pressure on number of lice on wild fish 1 2 we calculate the reduction in lice on wild fish due to stocking of cleaner fish as follows 5 r e d u c t i o n l i c e r e l r e d where reduction is the number of lice alleviated from wild fish due to stocking of wrasse in the adjacent fish farms at some distance km from farm 2 1 2 direct relief of sea lice by wild wrasse on wild salmonids 2 1 2 1 spatiotemporal association of wrasse and trout kelts and smolts of both sea trout and atlantic salmon salmo salar exit freshwater and enter coastal seas in springtime when water temperatures in the ocean are approximately 8 c hvidsten et al 1998 jensen et al 2012 klemetsen et al 2003 at approximately the same time sea lice begin to proliferate tully and nolan 2002 and wrasse become active once again after a period of winter dormancy gonzalez and de boer 2017 sayer and davenport 1996 atlantic salmon mostly pass through coastal areas for the open ocean during spring whereas trout forage along coastal flats during spring and summer and return to freshwater for the spawning migration beginning in summer and until spawning in september november depending on latitude the temporal overlap between these salmonids and wrasse depends on spatiotemporal dynamics but in general is longer for sea trout than salmon armstrong et al 2003 skiftesvik et al 2014 in some instances we have observed that the trout use the fresher upper part of the water column as opposed to the wrasses often found in the more saline water underneath this behaviour is probably a consequence of the infection and the resulting ionic disturbance caused by the lice feeding on the skin of trout this causes the fish to become dehydrated and seek freshwater in order to restore its ionic balance birkeland and jacobsen 1997 2 1 2 2 sea lice predation by wrasse in the wild wrasse are generalist invertivores and have been confirmed to act as cleaner fish in the wild breen et al 1996 observed ballan wrasse performing as cleaners and hilld√©n et al 1983 observed goldsinny wrasse cleaning fish in sweden ballan and corkwing wrasse caught in ireland and france were generalists that ate decapods bivalves and gastropods as well as a little bit of algae deady and fives 1995 sayer et al 1995 goldsinny in scotland ate a broad variety of invertebrates including hydrozoans polychaetes echinoderms gastropods bivalves insects amphipods isopods decapods and a small amount of copepods specifically metis ignea i e not sea lice sayer et al 1995 captive wrasse can consume a large number of lice up to 58 in an individual recorded by deady et al 1995 1 2 2 7 of the body weight treasurer 1994 however wrasse in cages seem to prefer to forage on alternative food sources rather than on lice deady et al 1995 insufficient work has been published on nutritional needs of wrasse or the energy content of lice making it challenging to determine how efficient a food source they are for wrasse in captivity wrasse display a linear feeding response to the abundance of lice leclercq et al 2014 showed a density dependent response of wrasse to lice infestations on atlantic salmon smolts in experimental trials but the functional response was linear type i the type i functional response of wrasse in cages suggested that there was no prey switching at low lice densities in captivity and no satiation at high densities there is also an important effect of temperature because wrasse have higher metabolic demands in warmer water swimming performance maximized at 25 c yuen et al 2019 indeed wild goldsinny had fuller stomachs later in the year june november than earlier in the year december may sayer et al 1995 availability of alternative prey opened blue mussels mytilus edulis did not affect lice consumption by wrasse leclercq et al 2014 given the available data on wrasse feeding responses to lice density we have used a constant rate of cleaning where each wrasse removes a constant number of lice per week per trout which we call cleaning rate 2 1 2 3 how many sea trout are in a typical norwegian fjord our simulation is not parameterized for all of norway but one discrete marine unit perhaps best conceptualized as a fjord that is homogeneous with respect to habitat and with a fish farm at the centre fig 1 with approximately 1000 sea trout rivers catalogued in norway yielding about 700 sea trout per home river by simple division we assumed a sea trout population in our simulated fjord to be approximately 10 000 individuals representing the populations of about 14 rivers 2 1 2 4 rate of sea lice predation by wrasse in the wild we have only anecdotal observations of wrasse removing sea lice from salmonids in the wild none of which have been captured on video it is unrealistic to think that this behaviour never occurs in the wild given that wrasse will readily engage in cleaning in cages and tanks and have been observed cleaning other species in the wild hilld√©n et al 1983 breen 1996 the pivotal question in this context is not whether or not the behaviour occurs but rather how effective it is in removing lice from wild trout in this study we estimated how many sea lice could be removed from each sea trout in an area by wrasse that potentially would be extracted from an area during fishing 6 l i c e r e m o v a l c l e a n i n g r a t e n w r a s s e n s e a t r o u t w e e k s where nwrasse is the number of wrasse within the impacted area nseatrout is the number of sea trout in the area and weeks is the number of weeks this cleaning event takes place based on the indications from tank and cage studies in 1 1 we suggest that cleaning rate should either be estimated as a constant i e that each wrasse removes a constant number of lice per week or a type i functional response where 7 c l e a n i n g r a t e l i c e lice taken per wrasse per week is the cleaning rate in which lice is the average number of lice on each sea trout and is the slope where the intercept is 0 the rate is the lice cleaned per lice on a sea trout by an individual wrasse 2 1 3 estimating the result of a game when stocking wild wrasse into salmon cages with these two estimates indirect effects of wrasse on sea lice on wild fish due to stocking of wrasse in fish farms and direct lice removal from the same wrasse in the wild it is possible to estimate when fishing wrasse becomes a zero sum game this is simply parameter space where 8 r e d u c t i o n l i c e r e m o v a l to investigate the parameter space in which the effect of fishing and stocking wrasse in fish farms equals the effect of allowing the same wrasse to remove lice on wild fish we used the optimize function in r to minimize value abs reduction lice removal we focused on the unknown parameter cleaning rate either as constant removal per week or the slope in the functional i response and plot the value of where the mean lice reduction on wild fish due to stocking of cleaner fish is equal to lice removed from sea trout in the wild according to distance from the fish farm d in eq 3 number of cleaner fish nwrasse in eq 1 number of sea trout in the area of impact nseatrout in eq 6 and infestation pressure calculated at the fish farm log ip in eq 4 see kristoffersen et al 2014 3 results 3 1 what cleaning rates must wrasse have in the wild for wrasse fisheries to be zero sum game according to our simulations cleaning by wrasse on sea trout in the wild does not have to occur frequently for the effect of moving wrasse to farms to have a zero sum result on the wild sea trout lice infestation for most parametrizations of the model each wrasse would only have to engage in cleaning activity once per week for these two activities i e stocking or cleaning behavior in the wild to be equally beneficial to the wild trout based on known benefits of the wrasse in sea cages fig 2 when parameterizing the cleaning behaviour of wrasse in the wild with a type i functional response in general each wrasse would have to remove 5 of the lice on sea trout each week to achieve the zero sum result in the game fig 3 3 2 does the distance between the farm and the wild sea trout matter the simulation yields a zero sum at a lower cleaning rate the farther away the trout is from the fish farm at a cleaning rate of 5 lice per week per wrasse the game suggests moving wrasse to fish farms if sea trout are restricted within 10 km of the farm in contrast if cleaning behaviour occurs according to a type i functional response the effect would not depend on distance from the fish farm because the cleaning behaviour of wrasse in the wild would be scaled according to the number of lice released from the farm 3 3 would it be better to stock more or less cleaner fish from the wild into fish farms our simulation does not appear to be sensitive to how many wrasse are fished and stocked the more wrasse that are stocked the more important the wild wrasse seem to become suggesting that stocking should be limited in order to preserve cleaning in wild wrasse 3 4 does it matter whether there are few or many wild sea trout the more trout that there are in the vicinity of the fish farms the more effective stocking becomes in the net pen the wrasse remove a constant number of lice independent of the trout in the wild therefore decreasing the infestation pressure from fish farms by having cleaner wrasse in the net pens will be increasingly positive the more sea trout are around the fish farm 3 5 is the zero sum game equal across different lice numbers on the farm along the same logic as the distance from a fish farm if infestation pressure increases due to higher outbreaks levels in the net pen it is more effective to stock wrasse because the effect of wrasse in the net pen is a constant relative effect however if there is a type i functional response such that wrasse scale the number of lice that they eat to increase their foraging on lice at high infestation pressure the effect of cleaning behaviour of wrasse in the wild is constant and the effect of infestation pressure disappears fig 3 4 discussion game theory is often applied to study wild wrasse systems and the power dynamic between cleaners and clients e g bshary 2002 gingins et al 2013 bshary and oliveira 2015 the dynamic between direct and indirect effects of cleaner wrasse on lice infestations was parameterized as a game in the simulation to determine whether lice picking behaviour in the wild could be an important ecosystem interaction and indeed we illustrate how moving wild wrasse into net pens can have zero or even negative outcomes for the ecosystem when considering the broader impact of wrasse the direct benefits of wrasse cleaning lice have not been considered when evaluating the costs and benefits of using cleaner fish for open net pen aquaculture parasite management and merit further study as a potential ecosystem impact of wrasse fisheries philis et al 2021 our model suggests that average cleaning rates of wrasse on wild fish direct effects can be low but still comparably efficient in lowering infestation pressure on wild fish when wrasse are moved to farms indirect effects despite great interest in the behaviour of cleaner fish such as wrasse in tropical systems little data have been collected on the cleaning behaviour of temperate wrasses and there were no values available for cleaning rates with which we could parameterize our model instead we opted to have the model optimize the cleaning rate in the wild which settled at around 0 5 lice per wrasse per week type 0 fr or 5 of lice per sea trout per wrasse per week i e the slope in the type i fr both models suggested that infrequent cleaning behaviour by wrasse can still provide a key ecosystem service in the wild with respect to reducing lice loads on trout perhaps paradoxically the model suggests that if there are more sea trout in the fjord then it is better to place a wrasse in a farm than leave it to do the work directly upon wild trout this result can be explained by the model parameterization which increases the number of lice proportionally with the increase in abundance of trout the underlying mechanism is the assumption that sea lice infestations are host limited such that more hosts will facilitate greater attachment and lice reproduction it further assumes that cleaning behaviour of wrasse is density dependent with respect to parasite abundance we have very little data to support or refute this assumption but if our model is correct areas where trout populations are struggling may benefit from having a thriving wild wrasse population to help as cleaners nevertheless our model does not suggest that wild wrasse can save sea trout from lice infestations caused by fish farming the zero sum outcome occurred faster i e at a slower cleaning rate when the wild sea trout were distributed further away from the farm if wrasse were removed from a location where they were functioning as cleaner fish on wild trout without farms and placed in a net pen to clean salmon in a sea cage in an area without sea trout the effect of removing wrasse from the wild would be this occurs because the wrasse has a beneficial effect on the infestation pressure on the wild sea trout in nature by removing lice while it has no effect on the wild sea trout in the net pen because the net pen is too far away when the model was parameterized with a simple type i fr this effect was eliminated because the wrasse would remove the same proportion of lice independent of the lice numbers on the wild sea trout the effect of infestation pressure at the farm had a strong influence on the outcome of the game if wrasse in the wild always removed a constant number of sea lice but was eliminated when a type i fr was applied we have no empirical knowledge about the functional response of temperate wrasse in the wild cleaning rates in tanks and cages appear to be positively correlated with lice densities and in tanks with very high lice densities ballan wrasse ate upwards of 200 lice per day without evidence of satiation i e a type i functional response leclercq et al 2014 in small sea cages deady et al 1995 estimated between 6 and 41 lice were eaten per goldsinny wrasse per day at starting lice levels of 2 5 4 6 per salmon whereas skiftesvik et al 2013 estimated at least 23 lice eaten per ballan wrasse per day at infestation levels that resulted in nine lice per salmon attached in control cages despite little experimental evidence at commercial scale overton et al 2020 slower feeding rates may be expected in commercial farms than in experimental settings barrett et al 2020 in 120 m circumference cages gentry et al 2020 found only 0 3 1 8 lice per corkwing wrasse gut at infestation levels between 0 5 and 1 3 mobile lice per salmon corresponding to a daily feeding rate of approximately 0 6 3 6 mobile lice assuming lice are detectable in the gut for 12 h le et al 2019 lice feeding rates by wrasse can be expected to differ in laboratory experiments compared to in real world applications for five reasons 1 low encounter rates modulated by requirements that farms maintain low lice densities 0 2 0 5 adult females per salmon leclercq et al 2014 2 larger spatial scale of sea cages promoting segregation of wrasse into deeper layers of farms thereby limiting encounter rates between wrasse and affected farmed salmon discussed in tully et al 1996 3 cool temperatures in farms that reduce wrasse feeding activity and increase wrasse mortality bjelland et al 1996 geitung et al 2020 yuen et al 2019 4 poor acclimation to the sea environment or commercial cleaning duties brooker et al 2020 5 death or disappearance of wrasse from sea cages 19 32 lost after 3 months stien et al 2020 our model has several limitations that warn against over interpreting the effects to make decisions about lice management strategies at farms importantly this model does not account for effects of lice infestation pressure on wild atlantic salmon and the optimal settings for reduction of parasite loads on wild sea trout revealed by the simulation may not be beneficial for wild salmon wild wrasse are unlikely to do any significant cleaning of migrating post smolt salmon that are in coastal zones and have limited overlap with wrasse our model also does not consider alternative scenarios in which wrasse are not used as cleaner fish alternative lice management tactics include chemical mechanical and thermal treatments of farmed fish to kill lice and limit reproduction and infestation pressure from farms overton et al 2019 alternative methods have welfare implications on farmed fish and chemical treatments can spillover to wild animals e g parsons et al 2020 cleaner fish are still viewed as an important component of an integrated lice management strategy on fish farms ballan wrasse are the only wrasse species being commercially reared and while production is slowly increasing 681 000 sold in 2019 they were only a fraction of the wrasse stocked into farms in norway in 2019 fisheries directorate 2020 philis et al 2021 suggested that wild captured wrasse have a lower environmental impact than farmed wrasse or lumpfish based on a life cycle analysis but noted that the environmental impacts of removing wrasse from the wild were unaccounted for and required research our results amplify this need for knowledge considering fishing and moving wild wrasse to net pens is supported by such bioeconomic perspectives it will be challenging to compare the effects of wrasse fishing on ecosystems compared to alternatives such as chemical and physical treatments because our results do not suggest that simply leaving wrasse in the wild is sufficient to alleviate infestation pressure from fish farms 5 conclusions simulations and game theory are effective tools in ecology for studying challenging processes that are difficult to observe indeed models and simulations are very important tools for modelling salmon migrations and lice dynamics for aquaculture management in norway e g kristoferssen et al 2014 we optimized lice cleaning rates in the model rather than using empirical values and we acknowledge that our thesis and conclusions depend to the assumption that wild wrasse perform non negligible cleaning services to wild sea trout our efforts will hopefully stimulate increased interest into the potential ecosystem effects of wrasse fisheries and support additional studies on the behaviour of putative cleaner fish in coastal areas and fjords of norway scotland sweden canada and other countries where sea lice impact wild salmonids with millions of wrasse being fished each year ecosystem impacts of this exploitation should be additionally scrutinized alongside the phenotypic and genotypic effects and life cycle considerations of moving wrasse from the wild into net pens finally we reiterate that this model does not suggest that wild wrasse can save sea trout from lice infestations caused by fish farming but that there may be a heretofore unrecognized interaction that merits further investigation given the urgency of impacts caused by lice outbreaks from farms on wild salmonids data

24320,fish that engage in mutualistic cleaning behaviour cleaner fishes have recently been popularized as a nature based method of controlling ectoparasite outbreaks in fish farms outbreaks impact animal welfare and threaten wild fish populations due to this millions of cleaner fish especially wrasses from the family labridae are wild caught each year and transferred into atlantic salmon salmo salar farms to remove ectoparasitic sea lice predominantly lepeophtheirus salmonis from farmed salmon and reduce spillover i e parasites transferring from farmed to wild fish onto vulnerable wild salmonid populations however we hypothesize that this practice may result in no net benefit to the infestation pressure on wild fish if gains in farm based control trade off against the removal of lice from wild fish by wrasse moved from the wild into net pens such a scenario would entail a zero sum game we test our hypothesis using an ecological simulation of wrasse as cleaners of farmed atlantic salmon and wild sea trout salmo trutta we parameterized our simulation based on published models of sea lice epidemics from farms to calculate the relative impact of lice when wrasse are removed from the ecosystem to serve as cleaners our simulations revealed that a zero sum game can emerge from this system at unexpectedly infrequent rates of cleaning by wrasse in the wild scandinavian wrasses are relatively data poor and parameterizing our simulation revealed a need for better data on the ecological role of these fishes in coastal ecosystems for the first time we suggest that wrasse fisheries may be a zero sum game and that under a plausible set of conditions fishing wrasse out of coastal ecosystems may do more harm than good for modulating sea lice epidemics

ecosystem service that is not adequately accounted for and may therefore represent an ecosystem impact of wrasse fisheries in game theory zero sum games emerge when benefits in one realm are enjoyed at the costs of another a sum netting zero to test our hypothesis we conceptualized wrasse fishing as a game that transfers the benefits of direct lice cleaning behaviour on wild fish to indirect effects of reducing infestation pressure from fish farms by picking lice in sea cages the outcome of the simulated game would resolve how active wrasse must be at directly picking lice in the wild to offset the benefits of moving them into sea cages where they have a known effect on infestation pressure calculable from published data simulations were parameterized with empirical data from the literature and realistic values for unknown parameters based on our own research the simulation aims to determine how suitable wild capture fisheries are for establishing cleaner fish for use in aquaculture and inform efforts to enhance industry sustainability 2 methods 2 1 model parameterization we developed a model to simulate the result of a game between moving wrasse and leaving wrasse in place to determine whether a zero sum solution emerged using r programming software r core team 2022 the simulation was parameterized based on the transport of cleaner fish from the wild into fish farms fig 1 table 1 the model of wrasse cleaning behaviour relies on several key assumptions about wrasse sea trout and their interaction the model parameters included the wrasse population in a fjord rate and functional response of lice predation in cages and in the wild sea trout abundance and infestation pressure of sea lice in fjords as a function of lice abundance in cages we describe below the evidence underlying these model parameters and our strategy for parameterizing the model the model has two components 1 indirect contribution of cleaner wrasse to wild salmonids first we modeled the extent to which stocking wild wrasse into the cages reduced infestation pressure of lice on wild fish based on published data infestation pressure in this context is the number of adult lice available to parasitize salmonids in a defined area reduced infestation pressure is a function of how many lice originating from farms will attach and develop on wild fish in a situation without the cleaner fish present in cages and how much stocking wrasse will reduce this number the difference between these two scenarios is the environmental effect of fishing and stocking wild wrasse in net pens 2 direct relief of sea lice by wild wrasse on wild salmonids second we modeled how many lice are removed from the wild fish if the wrasse is allowed to remain and interact with the wild fish cleaning them of lice at some variable rate the aim of this model was to estimate in what parameter space the effect of wrasse picking sea lice in the wild generates a zero sum game or whether there are net gains or losses with respect to lice burdens on wild fish from the lice management approach of moving wrasse into net pens table 2 2 1 1 indirect contribution of cleaner wrasse to wild salmonids 2 1 1 1 effect of cleaner wrasse on louse populations in salmon farms barrett et al 2020 constructed a statistical model of cleaner fish efficiency across 488 norwegian salmon farms that completed a full grow out cycle during 2016 2018 they compared the rate of change in adult female salmon louse density according to the number of cleaner fish stocked finding that the detectable effect of cleaner fish in fish farms was highly variable and that on average cleaner fish slowed but did not stop louse population growth to parameterize the first component of the model we required a similar function to barrett et al 2020 but one that predicted louse densities rather than population growth rates according to wrasse use starting with the same dataset of 488 grow out cycles we constrained the data to a defined season of wrasse use spanning weeks 20 40 about mid may to mid october in each year from 2016 to 2018 for each week of this wrasse season at each farm we summed the number of wrasse stocked from week 20 up until the current week and corrected for farm size using maximum allowable biomass as a proxy to improve our ability to detect a wrasse effect on lice we omitted weekly records where i the farm was thought to be less than 30 weeks into the grow out cycle at the time louse infestations vary with grow out phase and season ii delousing had been reported in the current or previous 2 weeks or iii more than 20 wrasse per t had been used as such high rates of cleaner fish use are not typical and are not expected to be efficient the function was only fitted to data from weeks 31 to 40 when sea temperatures have typically warmed sufficiently for wrasse to be active feeders using the nls function in r we fitted a negative exponential regression model in which the density of adult female sea lice at a farm was predicted by cumulative wrasse stocking effort the fitted function was significant df 351 p 0 01 1 y 0 5247 e x p 0 1082 w p t where y is louse density expressed as adult female sea lice per farmed salmon and wpt is the number of wrasse stocked over the season to date expressed per t of allowable biomass for context an average salmon farm has a maximum allowable biomass of 3500 t the wrasse effect was then further simplified into a reduction in the density of adult female sea lice which it is assumed will lead to a corresponding reduction in the number of louse eggs released from salmon farms to infest wild fish this reduction in infestation pressure is given as 2 r e l r e d 1 y y 0 where rel red is the relative reduction from a scenario with no wrasse stocked y0 to a scenario with a given number of wrasse stocked y 2 1 1 2 lice attachment to adult salmonids the population dynamics of lice are highly dependent on water temperature stien et al 2005 external infestation pressure from fish farms are known to influence the lice dynamics in adjacent populations that infect wild fish kristoffersen et al 2014 vollset et al 2019 several models exist that use a number of gravid female lice in fish farms to calculate the infestation pressure on adjacent farms or wild fish sandvik et al 2020 a simple model was developed by aldrin et al 2013 and further applied by kristoffersen et al 2014 which used a dataset on number of lice attached to fish in sentinel cages to develop a risk equation that predicted number of lice attaching to adjacent wild fish as a function of the distance from the farm where the infestation pressure is a function of number of gravid female lice and the temperature the decrease in infestation pressure by distance is as follows 3 r r i p e 1 44 0 351 d 57 1 0 57 e 1 44 0 351 0 57 1 0 57 where r r i p is the risk reduction and d is the distance in kilometers from the fish farm to estimate the number of lice on a sea trout at a given distance from the source i e fish farm we use the fitted equation between lice in cages and the log transformed external infestation pressure from kristoffersen et al 2014 the equation is a as follows 4 l i c e e 14 603 l o g 7 d a y s 0 843 l o g i p r r i p p r o p a d u l t where weeks is the number of weeks up to 10 weeks the wild fish has been in the area ip is the infestation pressure estimated from female lice as described in kristoffersen et al 2014 r r i p is explained above while propadult is a correction for mortality of lice during development where we argue that only 70 of the lice that is counted on fish in sentinel cages will develop to adult stages grimnes and jakobsen 1996 bjorn and finstad 1997 1998 ip rrip is equivalent to ipc t in kristofferesen et al 2014 i e distance corrected external infestation pressure 2 1 1 3 what is the reduction of lice on wild fish from stocking wrasse by combining the estimation of reduction in infestation pressure 1 1 and the effect of infestation pressure on number of lice on wild fish 1 2 we calculate the reduction in lice on wild fish due to stocking of cleaner fish as follows 5 r e d u c t i o n l i c e r e l r e d where reduction is the number of lice alleviated from wild fish due to stocking of wrasse in the adjacent fish farms at some distance km from farm 2 1 2 direct relief of sea lice by wild wrasse on wild salmonids 2 1 2 1 spatiotemporal association of wrasse and trout kelts and smolts of both sea trout and atlantic salmon salmo salar exit freshwater and enter coastal seas in springtime when water temperatures in the ocean are approximately 8 c hvidsten et al 1998 jensen et al 2012 klemetsen et al 2003 at approximately the same time sea lice begin to proliferate tully and nolan 2002 and wrasse become active once again after a period of winter dormancy gonzalez and de boer 2017 sayer and davenport 1996 atlantic salmon mostly pass through coastal areas for the open ocean during spring whereas trout forage along coastal flats during spring and summer and return to freshwater for the spawning migration beginning in summer and until spawning in september november depending on latitude the temporal overlap between these salmonids and wrasse depends on spatiotemporal dynamics but in general is longer for sea trout than salmon armstrong et al 2003 skiftesvik et al 2014 in some instances we have observed that the trout use the fresher upper part of the water column as opposed to the wrasses often found in the more saline water underneath this behaviour is probably a consequence of the infection and the resulting ionic disturbance caused by the lice feeding on the skin of trout this causes the fish to become dehydrated and seek freshwater in order to restore its ionic balance birkeland and jacobsen 1997 2 1 2 2 sea lice predation by wrasse in the wild wrasse are generalist invertivores and have been confirmed to act as cleaner fish in the wild breen et al 1996 observed ballan wrasse performing as cleaners and hilld√©n et al 1983 observed goldsinny wrasse cleaning fish in sweden ballan and corkwing wrasse caught in ireland and france were generalists that ate decapods bivalves and gastropods as well as a little bit of algae deady and fives 1995 sayer et al 1995 goldsinny in scotland ate a broad variety of invertebrates including hydrozoans polychaetes echinoderms gastropods bivalves insects amphipods isopods decapods and a small amount of copepods specifically metis ignea i e not sea lice sayer et al 1995 captive wrasse can consume a large number of lice up to 58 in an individual recorded by deady et al 1995 1 2 2 7 of the body weight treasurer 1994 however wrasse in cages seem to prefer to forage on alternative food sources rather than on lice deady et al 1995 insufficient work has been published on nutritional needs of wrasse or the energy content of lice making it challenging to determine how efficient a food source they are for wrasse in captivity wrasse display a linear feeding response to the abundance of lice leclercq et al 2014 showed a density dependent response of wrasse to lice infestations on atlantic salmon smolts in experimental trials but the functional response was linear type i the type i functional response of wrasse in cages suggested that there was no prey switching at low lice densities in captivity and no satiation at high densities there is also an important effect of temperature because wrasse have higher metabolic demands in warmer water swimming performance maximized at 25 c yuen et al 2019 indeed wild goldsinny had fuller stomachs later in the year june november than earlier in the year december may sayer et al 1995 availability of alternative prey opened blue mussels mytilus edulis did not affect lice consumption by wrasse leclercq et al 2014 given the available data on wrasse feeding responses to lice density we have used a constant rate of cleaning where each wrasse removes a constant number of lice per week per trout which we call cleaning rate 2 1 2 3 how many sea trout are in a typical norwegian fjord our simulation is not parameterized for all of norway but one discrete marine unit perhaps best conceptualized as a fjord that is homogeneous with respect to habitat and with a fish farm at the centre fig 1 with approximately 1000 sea trout rivers catalogued in norway yielding about 700 sea trout per home river by simple division we assumed a sea trout population in our simulated fjord to be approximately 10 000 individuals representing the populations of about 14 rivers 2 1 2 4 rate of sea lice predation by wrasse in the wild we have only anecdotal observations of wrasse removing sea lice from salmonids in the wild none of which have been captured on video it is unrealistic to think that this behaviour never occurs in the wild given that wrasse will readily engage in cleaning in cages and tanks and have been observed cleaning other species in the wild hilld√©n et al 1983 breen 1996 the pivotal question in this context is not whether or not the behaviour occurs but rather how effective it is in removing lice from wild trout in this study we estimated how many sea lice could be removed from each sea trout in an area by wrasse that potentially would be extracted from an area during fishing 6 l i c e r e m o v a l c l e a n i n g r a t e n w r a s s e n s e a t r o u t w e e k s where nwrasse is the number of wrasse within the impacted area nseatrout is the number of sea trout in the area and weeks is the number of weeks this cleaning event takes place based on the indications from tank and cage studies in 1 1 we suggest that cleaning rate should either be estimated as a constant i e that each wrasse removes a constant number of lice per week or a type i functional response where 7 c l e a n i n g r a t e l i c e lice taken per wrasse per week is the cleaning rate in which lice is the average number of lice on each sea trout and is the slope where the intercept is 0 the rate is the lice cleaned per lice on a sea trout by an individual wrasse 2 1 3 estimating the result of a game when stocking wild wrasse into salmon cages with these two estimates indirect effects of wrasse on sea lice on wild fish due to stocking of wrasse in fish farms and direct lice removal from the same wrasse in the wild it is possible to estimate when fishing wrasse becomes a zero sum game this is simply parameter space where 8 r e d u c t i o n l i c e r e m o v a l to investigate the parameter space in which the effect of fishing and stocking wrasse in fish farms equals the effect of allowing the same wrasse to remove lice on wild fish we used the optimize function in r to minimize value abs reduction lice removal we focused on the unknown parameter cleaning rate either as constant removal per week or the slope in the functional i response and plot the value of where the mean lice reduction on wild fish due to stocking of cleaner fish is equal to lice removed from sea trout in the wild according to distance from the fish farm d in eq 3 number of cleaner fish nwrasse in eq 1 number of sea trout in the area of impact nseatrout in eq 6 and infestation pressure calculated at the fish farm log ip in eq 4 see kristoffersen et al 2014 3 results 3 1 what cleaning rates must wrasse have in the wild for wrasse fisheries to be zero sum game according to our simulations cleaning by wrasse on sea trout in the wild does not have to occur frequently for the effect of moving wrasse to farms to have a zero sum result on the wild sea trout lice infestation for most parametrizations of the model each wrasse would only have to engage in cleaning activity once per week for these two activities i e stocking or cleaning behavior in the wild to be equally beneficial to the wild trout based on known benefits of the wrasse in sea cages fig 2 when parameterizing the cleaning behaviour of wrasse in the wild with a type i functional response in general each wrasse would have to remove 5 of the lice on sea trout each week to achieve the zero sum result in the game fig 3 3 2 does the distance between the farm and the wild sea trout matter the simulation yields a zero sum at a lower cleaning rate the farther away the trout is from the fish farm at a cleaning rate of 5 lice per week per wrasse the game suggests moving wrasse to fish farms if sea trout are restricted within 10 km of the farm in contrast if cleaning behaviour occurs according to a type i functional response the effect would not depend on distance from the fish farm because the cleaning behaviour of wrasse in the wild would be scaled according to the number of lice released from the farm 3 3 would it be better to stock more or less cleaner fish from the wild into fish farms our simulation does not appear to be sensitive to how many wrasse are fished and stocked the more wrasse that are stocked the more important the wild wrasse seem to become suggesting that stocking should be limited in order to preserve cleaning in wild wrasse 3 4 does it matter whether there are few or many wild sea trout the more trout that there are in the vicinity of the fish farms the more effective stocking becomes in the net pen the wrasse remove a constant number of lice independent of the trout in the wild therefore decreasing the infestation pressure from fish farms by having cleaner wrasse in the net pens will be increasingly positive the more sea trout are around the fish farm 3 5 is the zero sum game equal across different lice numbers on the farm along the same logic as the distance from a fish farm if infestation pressure increases due to higher outbreaks levels in the net pen it is more effective to stock wrasse because the effect of wrasse in the net pen is a constant relative effect however if there is a type i functional response such that wrasse scale the number of lice that they eat to increase their foraging on lice at high infestation pressure the effect of cleaning behaviour of wrasse in the wild is constant and the effect of infestation pressure disappears fig 3 4 discussion game theory is often applied to study wild wrasse systems and the power dynamic between cleaners and clients e g bshary 2002 gingins et al 2013 bshary and oliveira 2015 the dynamic between direct and indirect effects of cleaner wrasse on lice infestations was parameterized as a game in the simulation to determine whether lice picking behaviour in the wild could be an important ecosystem interaction and indeed we illustrate how moving wild wrasse into net pens can have zero or even negative outcomes for the ecosystem when considering the broader impact of wrasse the direct benefits of wrasse cleaning lice have not been considered when evaluating the costs and benefits of using cleaner fish for open net pen aquaculture parasite management and merit further study as a potential ecosystem impact of wrasse fisheries philis et al 2021 our model suggests that average cleaning rates of wrasse on wild fish direct effects can be low but still comparably efficient in lowering infestation pressure on wild fish when wrasse are moved to farms indirect effects despite great interest in the behaviour of cleaner fish such as wrasse in tropical systems little data have been collected on the cleaning behaviour of temperate wrasses and there were no values available for cleaning rates with which we could parameterize our model instead we opted to have the model optimize the cleaning rate in the wild which settled at around 0 5 lice per wrasse per week type 0 fr or 5 of lice per sea trout per wrasse per week i e the slope in the type i fr both models suggested that infrequent cleaning behaviour by wrasse can still provide a key ecosystem service in the wild with respect to reducing lice loads on trout perhaps paradoxically the model suggests that if there are more sea trout in the fjord then it is better to place a wrasse in a farm than leave it to do the work directly upon wild trout this result can be explained by the model parameterization which increases the number of lice proportionally with the increase in abundance of trout the underlying mechanism is the assumption that sea lice infestations are host limited such that more hosts will facilitate greater attachment and lice reproduction it further assumes that cleaning behaviour of wrasse is density dependent with respect to parasite abundance we have very little data to support or refute this assumption but if our model is correct areas where trout populations are struggling may benefit from having a thriving wild wrasse population to help as cleaners nevertheless our model does not suggest that wild wrasse can save sea trout from lice infestations caused by fish farming the zero sum outcome occurred faster i e at a slower cleaning rate when the wild sea trout were distributed further away from the farm if wrasse were removed from a location where they were functioning as cleaner fish on wild trout without farms and placed in a net pen to clean salmon in a sea cage in an area without sea trout the effect of removing wrasse from the wild would be this occurs because the wrasse has a beneficial effect on the infestation pressure on the wild sea trout in nature by removing lice while it has no effect on the wild sea trout in the net pen because the net pen is too far away when the model was parameterized with a simple type i fr this effect was eliminated because the wrasse would remove the same proportion of lice independent of the lice numbers on the wild sea trout the effect of infestation pressure at the farm had a strong influence on the outcome of the game if wrasse in the wild always removed a constant number of sea lice but was eliminated when a type i fr was applied we have no empirical knowledge about the functional response of temperate wrasse in the wild cleaning rates in tanks and cages appear to be positively correlated with lice densities and in tanks with very high lice densities ballan wrasse ate upwards of 200 lice per day without evidence of satiation i e a type i functional response leclercq et al 2014 in small sea cages deady et al 1995 estimated between 6 and 41 lice were eaten per goldsinny wrasse per day at starting lice levels of 2 5 4 6 per salmon whereas skiftesvik et al 2013 estimated at least 23 lice eaten per ballan wrasse per day at infestation levels that resulted in nine lice per salmon attached in control cages despite little experimental evidence at commercial scale overton et al 2020 slower feeding rates may be expected in commercial farms than in experimental settings barrett et al 2020 in 120 m circumference cages gentry et al 2020 found only 0 3 1 8 lice per corkwing wrasse gut at infestation levels between 0 5 and 1 3 mobile lice per salmon corresponding to a daily feeding rate of approximately 0 6 3 6 mobile lice assuming lice are detectable in the gut for 12 h le et al 2019 lice feeding rates by wrasse can be expected to differ in laboratory experiments compared to in real world applications for five reasons 1 low encounter rates modulated by requirements that farms maintain low lice densities 0 2 0 5 adult females per salmon leclercq et al 2014 2 larger spatial scale of sea cages promoting segregation of wrasse into deeper layers of farms thereby limiting encounter rates between wrasse and affected farmed salmon discussed in tully et al 1996 3 cool temperatures in farms that reduce wrasse feeding activity and increase wrasse mortality bjelland et al 1996 geitung et al 2020 yuen et al 2019 4 poor acclimation to the sea environment or commercial cleaning duties brooker et al 2020 5 death or disappearance of wrasse from sea cages 19 32 lost after 3 months stien et al 2020 our model has several limitations that warn against over interpreting the effects to make decisions about lice management strategies at farms importantly this model does not account for effects of lice infestation pressure on wild atlantic salmon and the optimal settings for reduction of parasite loads on wild sea trout revealed by the simulation may not be beneficial for wild salmon wild wrasse are unlikely to do any significant cleaning of migrating post smolt salmon that are in coastal zones and have limited overlap with wrasse our model also does not consider alternative scenarios in which wrasse are not used as cleaner fish alternative lice management tactics include chemical mechanical and thermal treatments of farmed fish to kill lice and limit reproduction and infestation pressure from farms overton et al 2019 alternative methods have welfare implications on farmed fish and chemical treatments can spillover to wild animals e g parsons et al 2020 cleaner fish are still viewed as an important component of an integrated lice management strategy on fish farms ballan wrasse are the only wrasse species being commercially reared and while production is slowly increasing 681 000 sold in 2019 they were only a fraction of the wrasse stocked into farms in norway in 2019 fisheries directorate 2020 philis et al 2021 suggested that wild captured wrasse have a lower environmental impact than farmed wrasse or lumpfish based on a life cycle analysis but noted that the environmental impacts of removing wrasse from the wild were unaccounted for and required research our results amplify this need for knowledge considering fishing and moving wild wrasse to net pens is supported by such bioeconomic perspectives it will be challenging to compare the effects of wrasse fishing on ecosystems compared to alternatives such as chemical and physical treatments because our results do not suggest that simply leaving wrasse in the wild is sufficient to alleviate infestation pressure from fish farms 5 conclusions simulations and game theory are effective tools in ecology for studying challenging processes that are difficult to observe indeed models and simulations are very important tools for modelling salmon migrations and lice dynamics for aquaculture management in norway e g kristoferssen et al 2014 we optimized lice cleaning rates in the model rather than using empirical values and we acknowledge that our thesis and conclusions depend to the assumption that wild wrasse perform non negligible cleaning services to wild sea trout our efforts will hopefully stimulate increased interest into the potential ecosystem effects of wrasse fisheries and support additional studies on the behaviour of putative cleaner fish in coastal areas and fjords of norway scotland sweden canada and other countries where sea lice impact wild salmonids with millions of wrasse being fished each year ecosystem impacts of this exploitation should be additionally scrutinized alongside the phenotypic and genotypic effects and life cycle considerations of moving wrasse from the wild into net pens finally we reiterate that this model does not suggest that wild wrasse can save sea trout from lice infestations caused by fish farming but that there may be a heretofore unrecognized interaction that merits further investigation given the urgency of impacts caused by lice outbreaks from farms on wild salmonids data

24321,marine phytoplankton possess a key position in multiple ecological biological and environmental processes therefore constructing a systematic and comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the leading mechanisms and key biophysical drivers of phytoplankton dynamics is crucial for evaluating biophysical forcings and ecological responses here we develop a process based model to improve the characterization of controlling mechanisms and assess the relative importance of nutrients light temperature and oceanic mixing for explaining chlorophyll a variability in the western north pacific ocean the model is calibrated using 20 year observational data of chlorophyll a concentrations from 1993 to 2012 in a bayesian framework to provide data driven inference and a rigorous uncertainty quantification of important biophysical rates the model explains approximately 61 of the variability in chlorophyll a our results supported by cross validation show that the chlorophyll a concentration is much more responsive to temperature variability than nutrients light or mixing by synthesizing the effects of multiple nutrients i e nitrogen phosphorus silica and iron on phytoplankton dynamics we find that iron and nitrogen largely determine the chlorophyll a variability sensitivity analysis shows that future warming conditions with 3 c change in temperature will impede phytoplankton production by 24 due to an intensified phytoplankton mortality impact our findings highlight the potential of deductive and inductive modeling approaches combining embedded biophysical mechanisms and probabilistic uncertainty quantification to effectively integrate and leverage sporadic ocean monitoring efforts and ultimately improve the marine water quality predictions

introduction marine phytoplankton which are responsible for approximately half of the global net primary production drive the oceanic food web the biological carbon pump fishery production and harmful algal blooms field et al 1998 lutz et al 2007 their production is largely determined by the interactions between environmental dynamics and biogeochemical cycles litchman et al 2015 understanding key biophysical drivers and underpinning processes of phytoplankton production are essential steps for quantifying and predicting their contributions to the future evolution of biogeochemical cycles litchman et al 2015 nutrients including macronutrients e g nitrogen phosphorus silica and micronutrients e g iron are known drivers of the development and proliferation of phytoplankton anderson et al 2012 generally nutrient concentrations nutrient ratios or nutrient to chlorophyll a chl a ratios are utilized to provide insights into nutrient limitation for example a nitrogen to phosphorus n p stoichiometry of approximately 7 2 by mass redfield 1958 appears to be universally stable for the global ocean average however empirical evidence suggests that the n p ratios are highly flexible among species and across a range of longitudinal and latitudinal scales martiny et al 2013 implying spatio temporal fluctuations and ecological variabilities daines et al 2014 klausmeler et al 2004 thus melding environmental controls e g light temperature with related biophysical mechanisms and processes may provide further insights into how which nutrients are limiting to phytoplankton growth klausmeler et al 2004 sauterey and ward 2022 light limitation is another mechanism controlling phytoplankton production and this control usually occurs in the surface mixed layer edwards et al 2015 huisman et al 1999 generally dynamic oceanic processes occurring in the mixed layer such as surface forcing wind induced mixing and circulations are directly related to the temporal and spatial variabilities in the mixed layer depth mld de boyer mont√©gut et al 2004 the mld can vary on a diurnal a seasonal or an interannual cycle for example in the subtropics and midlatitudes the mld exhibits a strong seasonal cycle ranging from approximately 20 m in summer to more than 100 m in winter de boyer mont√©gut et al 2004 a deep mixed layer leads to intensified light limitation on phytoplankton beckmann and hense 2007 while summer thermal stratification with a stable water column promotes phytoplankton growth with favorable light conditions thus understanding the prevailing factors driving mld variability e g wind stress and heat flux is key to exploring the light environment of phytoplankton hopkins et al 2021 huisman et al 1999 additionally temperature is linked to changes in the productivity and composition of marine phytoplankton communities thomas et al 2012 toseland et al 2013 under global climate change conditions increasing temperatures will directly impact phytoplankton growth and respiration and indirectly affect the nutrient supply and light regime through thermal stratification and mixing thomas et al 2012 several studies have identified that future global warming is projected to decrease phytoplankton production as a result of intensified stratification and in turn stronger nutrient limitation boyce et al 2010 while other studies have presented opposite results with increased phytoplankton production under climate warming conditions sarmiento et al 2004 schmittner et al 2008 overall the synergistic effects of temperature nutrients light and mixing on phytoplankton dynamics remain to be fully understood modeling efforts for understanding the biophysical triggers of marine phytoplankton dynamics have been well researched boyce et al 2010 fasham et al 2006 flynn and mcgillicuddy 2018 pan et al 2017 however deficiencies exist in either model structure or systematic representation of model parameters and uncertainty quantifications empirical models emphasize the correlative relationships between phytoplankton and associated biophysical drivers but do not explicitly reflect the biophysical processes and underlying mechanisms boyce et al 2010 mechanistic process based models with intermediate and high complexity mainly focus on representing physical or biological interactions and are more flexible in incorporating novel behaviors and individual processes fasham et al 2006 litchman et al 2006 ward et al 2014 although complex mechanistic models can more comprehensively reproduce observations and resolve detailed system behaviors uncertainty will increase with complexity flynn and mcgillicuddy 2018 thus the growing uncertainty may offset the benefits of increased model complexity meanwhile the uncertainties induced by the model framework and parameters usually fail to be systematically represented and quantified flynn and mcgillicuddy 2018 van nes and scheffer 2005 additionally model validation an important process used to ensure a model s reliability predictive capacity and broad applicability is often neglected or apparently not fully understood thus integrating mechanistic processes with systematic uncertainty quantification and reliability evaluation i e validation is crucial for enhancing the progress of marine ecosystem modeling particularly for large scale simulations flynn and mcgillicuddy 2018 the aim of this study is to demonstrate the utility of a mechanistic bayesian approach to probabilistically reveal the leading mechanisms and underlying physiological and ecological controls on marine phytoplankton accumulation in the subtropical and subarctic western north pacific ocean this region shows remarkable differences in chl a nutrient concentrations and the physical environment however the relative role and the overall effect of different controls e g nutrients light temperature and mixing on marine phytoplankton dynamics remain uncertain thus a new parsimonious bayesian process based model assimilating prior knowledge and observational data was developed to provide probabilistic parameter estimates and phytoplankton predictions in this study the model was applied to simulate the chl a concentrations based on discrete cruise measurements over a 20 year period as well as across a wide range of longitudinal and latitudinal western north pacific regions a unique quasi dynamic approach was applied to address the general lack of continuous nutrient measurements specifically we 1 developed a parsimonious mechanistic model to simulate the chl a concentrations 2 calibrated the mechanistic model to a multidecadal dataset 1993 2012 using bayesian inference 3 assessed model robustness through cross

quasi dynamic simulation was applied for each water quality sample we ran the model a certain number of days prior to the observation date based on a model calibrated time scale parameter œÑ d in these simulations the physical conditions such as light intensity air temperature wind velocity and mixed layer depth varied over time the initial concentrations of chl a n p si fe and z were determined as the observed 25th percentile we used the 25th percentile to allow phytoplankton to develop based on observed nutrient and physical conditions preliminary results indicated that our model

inference table 1 in bayesian inference posterior parameter distributions are determined based on prior knowledge and the fitness of the observational data to the model i e the likelihood most priors are assigned normal distributions based on previous literatures and truncated at zero to avoid unrealistic negative values we applied a noninformative prior to the time scale parameter œÑ due to

remaining 3 000 iterations convergence was considered to be achieved when the square of the ratio of total posterior variance to within chain variance was less than 1 1 for all model parameters gelman and rubin 1992 additionally a log transformation was applied to the response variable of chl a to address the heteroscedasticity and non normality faraway 2014 2 5 performance assessment and sensitivity analysis we quantified the predictability of the chl a concentration using the coefficient of determination r 2 faraway 2014 and root mean square error rmse willmott 1981 the robustness of the model was evaluated through cross validation chatfield 2006 here we split the whole dataset into two subsets based on year subset 1 s1 included the data from 1993 to 2004 and subset 2 s2 included the remaining data from 2005 to 2012 for each subset sj j 1 2 we calibrated the model with sj data removed and then used the calibrated model to make validation predictions on sj repeating the test for the two subsets we then calculated the performance statistics i e r 2 and rmse for all validation predictions finally the sensitivity of predicted chl a to changes in environmental conditions was investigated perturbing temperature by 3 c while other environmental variables i e the limiting nutrient wind velocity meridional wind velocity and zonal momentum by 30 3 results 3 1 chl a and

events e g kuroshio and oyashio other remaining variability might be due to small scale open ocean circulation submesoscale motions l√©vy et al 2018 qiu et al 2017 and some spatio temporal variations that could not be captured given the available input data model predictive performance was further investigated through a 2 fold cross validation table a 2 the validation results demonstrated that out of sample performance was satisfactory r 2 of 0 50 for log transformed chl a and rmse of 0 66 ln ¬µg l in general the marginal posterior distributions of most model parameters i e biophysical rates were tighter than the priors fig 3 indicating that a substantial amount of knowledge was gained through calibration to the observational data however parameters such as the algal p to chl a ratio rpa and si to chl a ratio rsa whose posterior distributions were largely driven by the priors rather than by the observed data could potentially be further resolved by simultaneously calibrating to multiple nutrient measurements the same prior was assigned to both temperature adjustment factors but an opposite shift of the central tendency was observed with the posterior of Œ∏g being lower than Œ∏d indicating a stronger impact of temperature on phytoplankton mortality the time scale parameter œÑ had a vague prior and the posterior variance decreased compared to the study of global oceanic iron nitrogen limitation browning et al 2017 our model estimated n fe ratio n fe 55 converted from rna rfa fig 3 agreed well with the finding for the same region and this relatively high ratio implied phytoplankton depleted fe before n additionally parameter estimates did not vary substantially i e less than 58 across cross validation folds table a 2 implying a relatively robust parameter estimation based on our modeling results the n p ratio was estimated to be approximately 4 7 and 6 8 converted from rna rpa table a 2 between cross validation folds i e former versus latter years the estimated n p ratio was approximately 6 4 fig 3 when calibrated to the whole dataset which was slightly below the redfield value redfield 1958 indicating a long term adjustment of n to match p levels that might be controlled by denitrification and n fixation processes moore and doney 2007 tyrrell 1999 3 2 inferred nutrients and light limitation our results suggested that iron and or nitrogen rather than phosphorus and silica were the limiting nutrients for the growth of phytoplankton in the study area fig 4 substantial iron limitation i e mean standard deviation —Ñfe of 0 3 0 14 was mainly dominated from april to august nitrogen was identified as the limiting nutrient in fall and early spring reducing the phytoplankton growth rates of september october and february march by 53 and 56 respectively phosphorus and silica with mean concentrations of 48 56 Œºg l and 826 922 Œºg l respectively were barely identified as limiting nutrients in our study area where was mainly dominated by nanophytoplankton ward et al 2013 light limitation presented a smaller temporal variability than the nutrient effect light was generally more limited in high latitudes and winter months reducing phytoplankton growth by an average of 52 in addition 50 of the light limitation was simply due to sundown during nighttime while the attenuation of light contributed to the additional light limitation 2 3 3 sensitivity to biophysical drivers the chl a concentration was much more responsive to temperature t variability than to limiting nutrients ln or light related variables i e uw uv and œàu table 2 when changing the temperature from 3 to 3 c chl a was reduced by 24 suggesting that phytoplankton production would be mitigated in a warming climate as expected as the limiting nutrients were increased from 30 to 30 the chl a was slightly stimulated change from 3 to 3 indicating a nonlinear relationship between chl a and nutrients i e changes in nutrients produced inequivalent changes in chl a as the wind uw changed from 30 to 30 the chl a was reduced by approximately 3 5 indicating that more dynamic waterbodies induced by increased winds could impede the growth of phytoplankton in addition we tested the sensitivity of the meridional wind uv and zonal momentum œàu to chl a the results demonstrated that when increasing uv from 30 to 30 the chl a would be reduced by 3 resulting in a stronger southerly component of wind in summer or a stronger northerly component of wind in winter which either intensified nutrient limitation or created a pool of cold water as œàu increased from 30 to 30 the chl a was reduced by 1 implying a weakened north pacific subtropical gyre npsg induced by weakened tropical easterlies additionally we tested how chl a responded to changes in photosynthetically available light intensity i as i increased from 30 to 30 the chl a increased by 4 which was consistent with the sensitivity results of uw uv and œàu the role of above biophysical factors in impacting chl a was also validated through the global sensitivity analysis which considered non linear interactions and provided generally consistent results see appendix section 4 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient effects on chl a iron and nitrogen were identified as the key limiting nutrients for the phytoplankton growth in the western north pacific ocean which was consistent with previous studies for this region browning et al 2022 li et al 2015 moore et al 2020 the role of iron limitation in phytoplankton production in the subarctic region known as a high nutrient and low chlorophyll domain has been well established strom et al 2000 suzuki et al 2002 iron limitation is commonly related to the growth of nitrogen fixers diazotrophs sohm et al 2011 tanita et al 2021 in the subtropical western north pacific summer iron limitation is likely a result of inorganic nitrogen depletion 32 ug l and elevated nitrogen fixation caused by diazotrophs e g crocosphaera trichodesmium richelia and synechococcus dutkiewicz et al 2012 fujiki et al 2009 tanita et al 2021 however diazotrophs become iron limited after the thorough depletion of iron sources dutkiewicz et al 2012 sohm et al 2011 therefore diazotrophs are ultimately outcompeted by small phytoplankton and diatoms resulting in nitrogen limitation in the fall letelier et al 2019 ward et al 2013 according to our results phosphorus was not recognized as a predominant limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth however phosphorus limiting events occurred in the east china sea huang et al 2019 and pacific coastal area of japan hashihama et al 2009 in late winter and spring in these coastal areas freshwater discharge introduces large loadings of nitrogen and silica fujiki et al 2004 howarth et al 2011 in contrast phosphorus primarily released from coastal sediments via deep mixing or upwelling processes cullen et al 2002 would be quickly used up by phytoplankton with an excess supply of nitrogen and silica from riverine freshwater inflow however the sparse sampling data used in our model were derived from ship based cruises with each individual cruise usually conducted over a limited area and for a relatively short period of time e g days weeks making it difficult to identify seasonal or intra seasonal variability thus for those studies that focus on the coastal regions our model s boarder applicability and the inclusion of the coastal related processes e g riverine discharge upwelling would need to be revisited and verified 4 2 light effects on chl a the phytoplankton community in our study area is well acclimated to low light conditions photosynthetically available light averaged 127 32 w m2 within the mixed layer depth compared to 176 36 w m2 at the water surface the half saturation parameter of light ksi was estimated to be 23 w m2 through bayesian inference indicating that the available light is typically much higher than that required by the phytoplankton community in our study area dominant species such as small phytoplankton and diatoms are known as being low light adapted edwards et al 2015 meanwhile this low light adaptation feature might be stronger in the open ocean than in coastal areas due to less turbidity and vertical mixing e g upwelling in oceanic areas edwards et al 2015 additionally the role of oceanic mixing in regulating the phytoplankton light regime was explored in the mechanistic model by considering variations in photosynthetically available light intensity and the mixed layer depth the mixed layer irradiance includes information from wind stress and momentum flux reflecting the light levels experienced by phytoplankton under dynamic ocean conditions e g mixing currents and turbulence consistent with above findings the mechanistic model sensitivity analyses demonstrated when changing the oceanic mixing related variables i e wind meridional wind and zonal momentum by 30 chl a did not vary substantially 5 4 3 temperature effects on chl a temperature substantially impacted the loss rate of phytoplankton but only slightly affected the growth rate in the mechanistic model the model estimated temperature adjustment factor Œ∏g of 1 0 for growth was lower than the Œ∏d of 1 1 for death suggesting a stronger relationship between temperature and phytoplankton mortality especially under warming conditions these results are generally consistent with previous studies that outlined the increasingly intensified effect of warming temperature on phytoplankton mortality baker and geider 2021 boyd et al 2013 our estimate of Œ∏d reflecting an integrated effect of temperature on the phytoplankton loss rate within the whole thermal range provides an overall evaluation of temperature impacts on mortality consistently our sensitivity analysis suggested a decline in phytoplankton production under future global warming conditions agrees well with previous studies boyce et al 2010 toseland et al 2013 a possible mechanism regulating phytoplankton production with increased temperature may be a stronger nutrient limitation resulting from the strengthened water column stability and stratification additionally phytoplankton physiological traits including low light adaptation edwards et al 2015 and nitrogen fixation brauer et al 2013 stal 2009 might be impacted by temperature fluctuations and could benefit from further investigation in addition the optimal temperatures thermal ranges and temperature adjustments may vary across different phytoplankton populations anderson et al 2021 edwards et al 2013 which were not explicitly represented in the current model and will be incorporated and discussed in forthcoming work 4 4 methodological implications and limitations the modeling approach presented here a mechanistic and statistical hybrid modeling framework advances our understanding of the biophysical drivers of phytoplankton dynamics and the spatio temporal distribution of phytoplankton production in the western north pacific the model explained a substantial amount of the chl a variability across a wide range of longitudinal and latitudinal western north pacific region and over multiple decades model robustness was further validated through cross validation a quasi dynamic model solution through œÑ the time scale parameter allowed an automatic determination of the time that phytoplankton growth reached a steady state and uniquely leveraged measured macronutrient i e nitrogen phosphorus and silica concentrations reduces the computational burden and uncertainty of modeling them within the bayesian framework prior literature findings and multidecadal observational data were synthetized to systematically inform estimates and probabilistically quantify the uncertainty of important biophysical rates another unique aspect of this study was the incorporation of the time series of mixed layer depth estimates this parsimonious approach assumes that the variability in the mixed layer depth is ocean circulation and mixing dependent thus the mixed layer irradiance includes information from winds and momentum flux reflecting the light levels experienced by phytoplankton as they mix vertically through the mixed layer other representations of the mixed layer de boyer mont√©gut et al 2004 solano and fan 2022 could be further tested and compared compared to relatively complicated models e g gregg 2008 ward et al 2014 our model has limitations in simply or implicitly representing zooplankton grazing and other certain processes e g denitrification zooplankton grazing although complex models could reflect more detailed ecosystem interactions they usually have higher input requirements and be computationally more challenging our bayesian mechanistic model with intermediate model complexity uniquely incorporates quasi dynamic approach by improving computational efficiency and providing flexibility regarding the observational data requirements the meteorological and nutrient variables for our model are easy to obtain meanwhile our hybrid model has advantages over purely data driven statistical models without embedded biophysical mechanisms or purely mechanistic models without probabilistic uncertainty quantification future investigation on how biophysical factors impacting spatial variability of phytoplankton abundance would be useful for understanding the spatial distribution of the most triggering factors in the western north pacific region additionally unexplained variability in chl a particularly in the open ocean might depend on the available input data thus spatially and temporally rich data e g remote sensing data could be assimilated into our mechanistic model to improve the model performance and provide insights on higher resolution spatial and temporal dynamics of chl a 5 conclusions in this study we develop a process based formulation with intermediate model complexity to improve the characterization of underlying physiological and ecological mechanisms and disentangle biophysical controls i e nutrients light temperature and mixing on marine phytoplankton dynamics in the western north pacific ocean the bayesian framework is incorporated into the mechanistic model to leverage data driven inference and provide systematic uncertainty quantification on important biophysical rates moreover aiming at the general lack of observational data in the marine environment the unique quasi dynamic model solution effectively integrates and leverages sporadic ocean monitoring efforts and provides flexibility regarding the observational data requirements the mechanistic model explains 61 of the variability in chl a concentration and the cross validation indicates the robustness of the model in general the model results suggest that temperature largely determines the chl a variability and can substantially impacts phytoplankton mortality than the growth particularly under the global warming conditions additionally iron and nitrogen are identified as the key limiting nutrients for the phytoplankton growth in the study area the bayesian mechanistic approach developed here could be transferred to other marine systems particularly with scattered and sparse monitoring data using the posterior parameter distributions obtained here as priors credit authorship contribution statement

24321,marine phytoplankton possess a key position in multiple ecological biological and environmental processes therefore constructing a systematic and comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the leading mechanisms and key biophysical drivers of phytoplankton dynamics is crucial for evaluating biophysical forcings and ecological responses here we develop a process based model to improve the characterization of controlling mechanisms and assess the relative importance of nutrients light temperature and oceanic mixing for explaining chlorophyll a variability in the western north pacific ocean the model is calibrated using 20 year observational data of chlorophyll a concentrations from 1993 to 2012 in a bayesian framework to provide data driven inference and a rigorous uncertainty quantification of important biophysical rates the model explains approximately 61 of the variability in chlorophyll a our results supported by cross validation show that the chlorophyll a concentration is much more responsive to temperature variability than nutrients light or mixing by synthesizing the effects of multiple nutrients i e nitrogen phosphorus silica and iron on phytoplankton dynamics we find that iron and nitrogen largely determine the chlorophyll a variability sensitivity analysis shows that future warming conditions with 3 c change in temperature will impede phytoplankton production by 24 due to an intensified phytoplankton mortality impact our findings highlight the potential of deductive and inductive modeling approaches combining embedded biophysical mechanisms and probabilistic uncertainty quantification to effectively integrate and leverage sporadic ocean monitoring efforts and ultimately improve the marine water quality predictions

introduction marine phytoplankton which are responsible for approximately half of the global net primary production drive the oceanic food web the biological carbon pump fishery production and harmful algal blooms field et al 1998 lutz et al 2007 their production is largely determined by the interactions between environmental dynamics and biogeochemical cycles litchman et al 2015 understanding key biophysical drivers and underpinning processes of phytoplankton production are essential steps for quantifying and predicting their contributions to the future evolution of biogeochemical cycles litchman et al 2015 nutrients including macronutrients e g nitrogen phosphorus silica and micronutrients e g iron are known drivers of the development and proliferation of phytoplankton anderson et al 2012 generally nutrient concentrations nutrient ratios or nutrient to chlorophyll a chl a ratios are utilized to provide insights into nutrient limitation for example a nitrogen to phosphorus n p stoichiometry of approximately 7 2 by mass redfield 1958 appears to be universally stable for the global ocean average however empirical evidence suggests that the n p ratios are highly flexible among species and across a range of longitudinal and latitudinal scales martiny et al 2013 implying spatio temporal fluctuations and ecological variabilities daines et al 2014 klausmeler et al 2004 thus melding environmental controls e g light temperature with related biophysical mechanisms and processes may provide further insights into how which nutrients are limiting to phytoplankton growth klausmeler et al 2004 sauterey and ward 2022 light limitation is another mechanism controlling phytoplankton production and this control usually occurs in the surface mixed layer edwards et al 2015 huisman et al 1999 generally dynamic oceanic processes occurring in the mixed layer such as surface forcing wind induced mixing and circulations are directly related to the temporal and spatial variabilities in the mixed layer depth mld de boyer mont√©gut et al 2004 the mld can vary on a diurnal a seasonal or an interannual cycle for example in the subtropics and midlatitudes the mld exhibits a strong seasonal cycle ranging from approximately 20 m in summer to more than 100 m in winter de boyer mont√©gut et al 2004 a deep mixed layer leads to intensified light limitation on phytoplankton beckmann and hense 2007 while summer thermal stratification with a stable water column promotes phytoplankton growth with favorable light conditions thus understanding the prevailing factors driving mld variability e g wind stress and heat flux is key to exploring the light environment of phytoplankton hopkins et al 2021 huisman et al 1999 additionally temperature is linked to changes in the productivity and composition of marine phytoplankton communities thomas et al 2012 toseland et al 2013 under global climate change conditions increasing temperatures will directly impact phytoplankton growth and respiration and indirectly affect the nutrient supply and light regime through thermal stratification and mixing thomas et al 2012 several studies have identified that future global warming is projected to decrease phytoplankton production as a result of intensified stratification and in turn stronger nutrient limitation boyce et al 2010 while other studies have presented opposite results with increased phytoplankton production under climate warming conditions sarmiento et al 2004 schmittner et al 2008 overall the synergistic effects of temperature nutrients light and mixing on phytoplankton dynamics remain to be fully understood modeling efforts for understanding the biophysical triggers of marine phytoplankton dynamics have been well researched boyce et al 2010 fasham et al 2006 flynn and mcgillicuddy 2018 pan et al 2017 however deficiencies exist in either model structure or systematic representation of model parameters and uncertainty quantifications empirical models emphasize the correlative relationships between phytoplankton and associated biophysical drivers but do not explicitly reflect the biophysical processes and underlying mechanisms boyce et al 2010 mechanistic process based models with intermediate and high complexity mainly focus on representing physical or biological interactions and are more flexible in incorporating novel behaviors and individual processes fasham et al 2006 litchman et al 2006 ward et al 2014 although complex mechanistic models can more comprehensively reproduce observations and resolve detailed system behaviors uncertainty will increase with complexity flynn and mcgillicuddy 2018 thus the growing uncertainty may offset the benefits of increased model complexity meanwhile the uncertainties induced by the model framework and parameters usually fail to be systematically represented and quantified flynn and mcgillicuddy 2018 van nes and scheffer 2005 additionally model validation an important process used to ensure a model s reliability predictive capacity and broad applicability is often neglected or apparently not fully understood thus integrating mechanistic processes with systematic uncertainty quantification and reliability evaluation i e validation is crucial for enhancing the progress of marine ecosystem modeling particularly for large scale simulations flynn and mcgillicuddy 2018 the aim of this study is to demonstrate the utility of a mechanistic bayesian approach to probabilistically reveal the leading mechanisms and underlying physiological and ecological controls on marine phytoplankton accumulation in the subtropical and subarctic western north pacific ocean this region shows remarkable differences in chl a nutrient concentrations and the physical environment however the relative role and the overall effect of different controls e g nutrients light temperature and mixing on marine phytoplankton dynamics remain uncertain thus a new parsimonious bayesian process based model assimilating prior knowledge and observational data was developed to provide probabilistic parameter estimates and phytoplankton predictions in this study the model was applied to simulate the chl a concentrations based on discrete cruise measurements over a 20 year period as well as across a wide range of longitudinal and latitudinal western north pacific regions a unique quasi dynamic approach was applied to address the general lack of continuous nutrient measurements specifically we 1 developed a parsimonious mechanistic model to simulate the chl a concentrations 2 calibrated the mechanistic model to a multidecadal dataset 1993 2012 using bayesian inference 3 assessed model robustness through cross

for the two subsets we then calculated the performance statistics i e r 2 and rmse for all validation predictions finally the sensitivity of predicted chl a to changes in environmental conditions was investigated perturbing temperature by 3 c while other environmental variables i e the limiting nutrient wind velocity meridional wind velocity and zonal momentum by 30 3 results 3 1 chl a and

that could not be captured given the available input data model predictive performance was further investigated through a 2 fold cross validation table a 2 the validation results demonstrated that out of sample performance was satisfactory r 2 of 0 50 for log transformed chl a and rmse of 0 66 ln ¬µg l in general the marginal posterior distributions of most model parameters i e biophysical rates were tighter than the priors fig 3 indicating that a substantial amount of knowledge was gained through calibration to the observational data however parameters such as the algal p to chl a ratio rpa and si to chl a ratio rsa whose posterior distributions were largely driven by the priors rather than by the observed data could potentially be further resolved by simultaneously calibrating to multiple nutrient measurements the same prior was assigned to both temperature adjustment factors but an opposite shift of the central tendency was observed with the posterior of Œ∏g being lower than Œ∏d indicating a stronger impact of temperature on phytoplankton mortality the time scale parameter œÑ had a vague prior and the posterior variance decreased compared to the study of global oceanic iron nitrogen limitation browning et al 2017 our model estimated n fe ratio n fe 55 converted from rna rfa fig 3 agreed well with the finding for the same region and this relatively high ratio implied phytoplankton depleted fe before n additionally parameter estimates did not vary substantially i e less than 58 across cross validation folds table a 2 implying a relatively robust parameter estimation based on our modeling results the n p ratio was estimated to be approximately 4 7 and 6 8 converted from rna rpa table a 2 between cross validation folds i e former versus latter years the estimated n p ratio was approximately 6 4 fig 3 when calibrated to the whole dataset which was slightly below the redfield value redfield 1958 indicating a long term adjustment of n to match p levels that might be controlled by denitrification and n fixation processes moore and doney 2007 tyrrell 1999 3 2 inferred nutrients and light limitation our results suggested that iron and or nitrogen rather than phosphorus and silica were the limiting nutrients for the growth of phytoplankton in the study area fig 4 substantial iron limitation i e mean standard deviation —Ñfe of 0 3 0 14 was mainly dominated from april to august nitrogen was identified as the limiting nutrient in fall and early spring reducing the phytoplankton growth rates of september october and february march by 53 and 56 respectively phosphorus and silica with mean concentrations of 48 56 Œºg l and 826 922 Œºg l respectively were barely identified as limiting nutrients in our study area where was mainly dominated by nanophytoplankton ward et al 2013 light limitation presented a smaller temporal variability than the nutrient effect light was generally more limited in high latitudes and winter months reducing phytoplankton growth by an average of 52 in addition 50 of the light limitation was simply due to sundown during nighttime while the attenuation of light contributed to the additional light limitation 2 3 3 sensitivity to biophysical drivers the chl a concentration was much more responsive to temperature t variability than to limiting nutrients ln or light related variables i e uw uv and œàu table 2 when changing the temperature from 3 to 3 c chl a was reduced by 24 suggesting that phytoplankton production would be mitigated in a warming climate as expected as the limiting nutrients were increased from 30 to 30 the chl a was slightly stimulated change from 3 to 3 indicating a nonlinear relationship between chl a and nutrients i e changes in nutrients produced inequivalent changes in chl a as the wind uw changed from 30 to 30 the chl a was reduced by approximately 3 5 indicating that more dynamic waterbodies induced by increased winds could impede the growth of phytoplankton in addition we tested the sensitivity of the meridional wind uv and zonal momentum œàu to chl a the results demonstrated that when increasing uv from 30 to 30 the chl a would be reduced by 3 resulting in a stronger southerly component of wind in summer or a stronger northerly component of wind in winter which either intensified nutrient limitation or created a pool of cold water as œàu increased from 30 to 30 the chl a was reduced by 1 implying a weakened north pacific subtropical gyre npsg induced by weakened tropical easterlies additionally we tested how chl a responded to changes in photosynthetically available light intensity i as i increased from 30 to 30 the chl a increased by 4 which was consistent with the sensitivity results of uw uv and œàu the role of above biophysical factors in impacting chl a was also validated through the global sensitivity analysis which considered non linear interactions and provided generally consistent results see appendix section 4 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient effects on chl a iron and nitrogen were identified as the key limiting nutrients for the phytoplankton growth in the western north pacific ocean which was consistent with previous studies for this region browning et al 2022 li et al 2015 moore et al 2020 the role of iron limitation in phytoplankton production in the subarctic region known as a high nutrient and low chlorophyll domain has been well established strom et al 2000 suzuki et al 2002 iron limitation is commonly related to the growth of nitrogen fixers diazotrophs sohm et al 2011 tanita et al 2021 in the subtropical western north pacific summer iron limitation is likely a result of inorganic nitrogen depletion 32 ug l and elevated nitrogen fixation caused by diazotrophs e g crocosphaera trichodesmium richelia and synechococcus dutkiewicz et al 2012 fujiki et al 2009 tanita et al 2021 however diazotrophs become iron limited after the thorough depletion of iron sources dutkiewicz et al 2012 sohm et al 2011 therefore diazotrophs are ultimately outcompeted by small phytoplankton and diatoms resulting in nitrogen limitation in the fall letelier et al 2019 ward et al 2013 according to our results phosphorus was not recognized as a predominant limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth however phosphorus limiting events occurred in the east china sea huang et al 2019 and pacific coastal area of japan hashihama et al 2009 in late winter and spring in these coastal areas freshwater discharge introduces large loadings of nitrogen and silica fujiki et al 2004 howarth et al 2011 in contrast phosphorus primarily released from coastal sediments via deep mixing or upwelling processes cullen et al 2002 would be quickly used up by phytoplankton with an excess supply of nitrogen and silica from riverine freshwater inflow however the sparse sampling data used in our model were derived from ship based cruises with each individual cruise usually conducted over a limited area and for a relatively short period of time e g days weeks making it difficult to identify seasonal or intra seasonal variability thus for those studies that focus on the coastal regions our model s boarder applicability and the inclusion of the coastal related processes e g riverine discharge upwelling would need to be revisited and verified 4 2 light effects on chl a the phytoplankton community in our study area is well acclimated to low light conditions photosynthetically available light averaged 127 32 w m2 within the mixed layer depth compared to 176 36 w m2 at the water surface the half saturation parameter of light ksi was estimated to be 23 w m2 through bayesian inference indicating that the available light is typically much higher than that required by the phytoplankton community in our study area dominant species such as small phytoplankton and diatoms are known as being low light adapted edwards et al 2015 meanwhile this low light adaptation feature might be stronger in the open ocean than in coastal areas due to less turbidity and vertical mixing e g upwelling in oceanic areas edwards et al 2015 additionally the role of oceanic mixing in regulating the phytoplankton light regime was explored in the mechanistic model by considering variations in photosynthetically available light intensity and the mixed layer depth the mixed layer irradiance includes information from wind stress and momentum flux reflecting the light levels experienced by phytoplankton under dynamic ocean conditions e g mixing currents and turbulence consistent with above findings the mechanistic model sensitivity analyses demonstrated when changing the oceanic mixing related variables i e wind meridional wind and zonal momentum by 30 chl a did not vary substantially 5 4 3 temperature effects on chl a temperature substantially impacted the loss rate of phytoplankton but only slightly affected the growth rate in the mechanistic model the model estimated temperature adjustment factor Œ∏g of 1 0 for growth was lower than the Œ∏d of 1 1 for death suggesting a stronger relationship between temperature and phytoplankton mortality especially under warming conditions these results are generally consistent with previous studies that outlined the increasingly intensified effect of warming temperature on phytoplankton mortality baker and geider 2021 boyd et al 2013 our estimate of Œ∏d reflecting an integrated effect of temperature on the phytoplankton loss rate within the whole thermal range provides an overall evaluation of temperature impacts on mortality consistently our sensitivity analysis suggested a decline in phytoplankton production under future global warming conditions agrees well with previous studies boyce et al 2010 toseland et al 2013 a possible mechanism regulating phytoplankton production with increased temperature may be a stronger nutrient limitation resulting from the strengthened water column stability and stratification additionally phytoplankton physiological traits including low light adaptation edwards et al 2015 and nitrogen fixation brauer et al 2013 stal 2009 might be impacted by temperature fluctuations and could benefit from further investigation in addition the optimal temperatures thermal ranges and temperature adjustments may vary across different phytoplankton populations anderson et al 2021 edwards et al 2013 which were not explicitly represented in the current model and will be incorporated and discussed in forthcoming work 4 4 methodological implications and limitations the modeling approach presented here a mechanistic and statistical hybrid modeling framework advances our understanding of the biophysical drivers of phytoplankton dynamics and the spatio temporal distribution of phytoplankton production in the western north pacific the model explained a substantial amount of the chl a variability across a wide range of longitudinal and latitudinal western north pacific region and over multiple decades model robustness was further validated through cross validation a quasi dynamic model solution through œÑ the time scale parameter allowed an automatic determination of the time that phytoplankton growth reached a steady state and uniquely leveraged measured macronutrient i e nitrogen phosphorus and silica concentrations reduces the computational burden and uncertainty of modeling them within the bayesian framework prior literature findings and multidecadal observational data were synthetized to systematically inform estimates and probabilistically quantify the uncertainty of important biophysical rates another unique aspect of this study was the incorporation of the time series of mixed layer depth estimates this parsimonious approach assumes that the variability in the mixed layer depth is ocean circulation and mixing dependent thus the mixed layer irradiance includes information from winds and momentum flux reflecting the light levels experienced by phytoplankton as they mix vertically through the mixed layer other representations of the mixed layer de boyer mont√©gut et al 2004 solano and fan 2022 could be further tested and compared compared to relatively complicated models e g gregg 2008 ward et al 2014 our model has limitations in simply or implicitly representing zooplankton grazing and other certain processes e g denitrification zooplankton grazing although complex models could reflect more detailed ecosystem interactions they usually have higher input requirements and be computationally more challenging our bayesian mechanistic model with intermediate model complexity uniquely incorporates quasi dynamic approach by improving computational efficiency and providing flexibility regarding the observational data requirements the meteorological and nutrient variables for our model are easy to obtain meanwhile our hybrid model has advantages over purely data driven statistical models without embedded biophysical mechanisms or purely mechanistic models without probabilistic uncertainty quantification future investigation on how biophysical factors impacting spatial variability of phytoplankton abundance would be useful for understanding the spatial distribution of the most triggering factors in the western north pacific region additionally unexplained variability in chl a particularly in the open ocean might depend on the available input data thus spatially and temporally rich data e g remote sensing data could be assimilated into our mechanistic model to improve the model performance and provide insights on higher resolution spatial and temporal dynamics of chl a 5 conclusions in this study we develop a process based formulation with intermediate model complexity to improve the characterization of underlying physiological and ecological mechanisms and disentangle biophysical controls i e nutrients light temperature and mixing on marine phytoplankton dynamics in the western north pacific ocean the bayesian framework is incorporated into the mechanistic model to leverage data driven inference and provide systematic uncertainty quantification on important biophysical rates moreover aiming at the general lack of observational data in the marine environment the unique quasi dynamic model solution effectively integrates and leverages sporadic ocean monitoring efforts and provides flexibility regarding the observational data requirements the mechanistic model explains 61 of the variability in chl a concentration and the cross validation indicates the robustness of the model in general the model results suggest that temperature largely determines the chl a variability and can substantially impacts phytoplankton mortality than the growth particularly under the global warming conditions additionally iron and nitrogen are identified as the key limiting nutrients for the phytoplankton growth in the study area the bayesian mechanistic approach developed here could be transferred to other marine systems particularly with scattered and sparse monitoring data using the posterior parameter distributions obtained here as priors credit authorship contribution statement

24322,oil spills can inflict mortality and injury on bird populations many of these deaths involve starvation resulting from thermoregulatory costs incurred by oiling of birds feathers however the fates and responses of sublethally oiled birds are poorly known due to this knowledge gap and the potential for birds to die far from the spill site resource risk and injury assessors need tools to make informed estimates for delayed deaths and lost reproductive capacity in these birds focusing on the thermoregulatory cost of oiled feathers we present a model addressing one facet of the effects of sublethal oiling on birds using mallard like ducks as a model organism we combined values from previous laboratory studies of oiled birds with a modified version of an existing temperature influenced avian migration energetics model using this model we examined the potential effects of oiling on general migration patterns changes in energetic gains required to compensate for oiling and starvation we assessed all metrics across multiple oiling severities we assessed starvation across both oiling severity and body condition median estimates for delays in spring migration were one to two months for trace and lightly oiled birds and we predicted arrested spring migration in moderately oiled birds median estimates of required increases in energetic gains to offset costs of increased thermoregulation ranged from 20 3 to 88 6 depending on severity of oiling we predicted starvation within four weeks for most combinations of oiling severity and body condition at the median predicted minimum wintering temperature of unoiled birds 4 9 c however at the average winter temperature of the southernmost model latitude 10 8 c we predicted only moderately oiled birds in less than excellent body condition had the potential to starve within a four week time frame due to the potential for even trace oiling to delay spring migration and decrease body condition the thermoregulatory costs of sublethal oiling during spring migration could reduce a bird s reproductive capacity future research integrating this initial energetics based model into a spatially explicit population scale migration model could provide additional insight into the potential effects of sublethal oiling on reproduction and survival such an integrated model could strengthen risk predictions and injury

relatively common for marine oil spills but in extreme cases hundreds of thousands of birds can be killed burger 1993 haney et al 2014 munilla et al 2011 piatt et al 1990 each individual death can be traced back to one or more negative effects of oiling such as organ or body system failure due to toxicity severe dehydration or starvation balseiro et al 2005 cunningham et al 2017 jenssen 1994 oka and okuyama 2000 birds that become oiled and survive may experience sublethal effects such as hemolytic anemia increased flight cost additional thermoregulatory costs or behavioral changes burger and tsipoura 1998 fallon et al 2018 hartung 1967 maggini et al 2017 disruption to an individual s energetic balance is one of the primary causes of mortality and sublethal effects in oiled birds balseiro et al 2005 jenssen 1994 under unoiled conditions birds as endotherms maintain a constant internal body temperature across a range of environmental temperatures this range of temperatures is the thermoneutral zone tnz within the tnz incidental heat from a bird s basal metabolic rate bmr and insulation from feathers maintain body temperature the lower limit of the tnz is the lower critical temperature lct below the lct birds incur an energetic cost of thermoregulation cot in addition to the cost of bmr cot increases linearly as temperature decreases bicudo et al 2010 increased cot is one of the most well documented adverse energetic effects of external oiling on birds especially at cold ambient temperatures jenssen 1994 mathewson et al 2018 mcewan and koelink 1973 stephenson 1997 oiling reduces the insulative capacity of feathers this reduction increases cot by raising lct and accelerating the rate of heat loss at temperatures below that elevated lct jenssen 1994 mathewson et al 2018 mcewan and koelink 1973 this oiling induced cot increase can ultimately result in starvation if a bird cannot increase energy intake balseiro et al 2005 hartung 1967 oka and okuyama 2000 time of year location and the stage of a bird s annual cycle can all alter the type and magnitude of the consequences of oiling on a bird thermoregulatory costs from oiling compounded by cold ambient temperatures contribute to the phenomenon of oiling related avian mortality events occurring more frequently at upper latitudes and during winter bourne and bibby 1975 clark 1984 moving to lower latitudes may alleviate the energetic costs of oiling for lightly oiled birds dorr et al 2020 but it is unknown if birds can move to compensate for these costs oiling may also affect migration oiled birds may experience delayed arrival on the breeding grounds if they fail to sufficiently increase their pre migratory or stopover foraging activity to compensate for increased cot during colder early spring temperatures dorr et al 2020 delayed migration resulting from oiling could lower reproductive success if spring migrating birds arrive on the breeding grounds later or in poorer body condition henkel et al 2012 the effects of oiling on migration have yet to be adequately demonstrated by field studies to mitigate thermoregulatory effects on migration birds may be able to increase food intake to combat the energetic costs of oiling provided ad libitum food captive externally oiled double crested cormorants phalacrocorax auritus can increase food consumption to compensate for cot increases induced by oiling mathewson et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge it is unknown if any bird species can increase food consumption sufficiently to offset the energetic costs of oiling in a natural setting on the contrary research on wild sanderlings calidris alba and semipalmated plovers charadrius semipalmatus suggests that oiled birds may spend less time foraging than unoiled birds burger 1997 for resource agencies tasked with quantifying injury to birds in actual oil spills realistic estimates of mortality and lost reproductive output in live oiled birds are essential to assessing damages that fund restoration of lost resources deepwater horizon nrda trustees 2016 bursian et al 2017 however it is difficult to design and implement ethical and practical field studies on the impacts of oiling on migration and energetics in wild birds because of this difficulty energetics based simulation models offer a promising alternative means to assess the potential impacts of oiling on migratory birds dorr et al 2020 using a model duck with morphology physiology and behavior similar to a mallard anas platyrhynchos hereafter mallard like duck as a model organism we combine previous energetics research on oiled birds with the temperature influenced avian energetics model of aagaard et al 2018 to assess the potential effects of oiling on the energetics of migratory birds during winter and spring migration we made five predictions regarding the energetic effects of oiling on migratory birds and the hypothetical behavioral changes that might be used to offset these effects figure 1 first we predicted that altering migration patterns would be one possible method for birds to offset the energetic costs of oiling with potential alterations including more southerly wintering latitudes and delayed spring migration second we predicted that an increase in energetic gains i e increased food intake could balance the energetic costs of oiling third we predicted that oiled birds would starve if they experienced the environmental temperature of the predicted migratory path of unoiled birds and that even wintering at more southern latitudes than unoiled birds may not be sufficient to prevent starvation for some oiled birds fourth we predicted that starvation would occur more quickly in birds in lower body condition finally we predicted that there would be a positive relationship between the severity of negative consequences and oiling severity and that mitigation of negative effects of oiling may be impossible past a certain threshold of oiling severity 2 materials and methods 2 1 base model summary we modified the stationary energetics and migration timing portions of a previously published temperature energetics and migration model for mallard like ducks aagaard et al 2018 note that stationary only means that a bird is not actively migrating between latitudes this component implicitly includes local movements we chose a temperature modulated energetics based migration model because it allowed the incorporation of temperature dependent energetic effects of oiling the mallard like ducks used by aagaard et al 2018 were an appropriate model organism because the effects of sublethal external oiling on thermoregulation in mallards have been previously studied hartung 1967 mcewan and koelink 1973 we include all variables their definitions and associated sources presented throughout the materials and methods in table 1 a full description of the base model and the additional model components is available in the supporting information net stationary energetics can be summarized as 1 e fdr bmr cot where e is daily net energetics fdr is fuel deposition rate the net amount of energy per day that a bird gains from food that can be used for bmr and cot this value includes both energy intake and energy lost to activity and other non bmr and cot pathways bmr is basal metabolic rate and cot is the energetic cost of thermoregulation in addition to the energy used for the bmr note that fdr as defined in this model differs from some other definitions of fdr others use fdr to measure total accumulation of energy stores on migratory stopovers and include all energetic costs including bmr and cot within fdr klaassen et al 1997 schaub and jenni 2000 the migration timing portion of the model of aagaard et al 2018 effectively operates in one spatial dimension north to south longitudes are not used for migration timing with a daily temperature gradient that changes with both latitude and date the model s spatial units are arbitrary latitudes ranging from 1 to 78 south to north the distance between latitudes is defined as 32 187 km but note that these units are not mapped or scaled to real world locations the model year begins and ends in the northern hemisphere summer during the breeding season for mallards and lasts 363 days aagaard et al 2018 temperatures are coldest in midwinter at the northernmost latitude and warmest in midsummer at the southernmost latitude the seeds for temperature simulations are 2 sets of 12 real world latitudinal monthly mean temperatures 24 total corresponding to northern canada 12 temperatures and to the gulf coast of the united states 12 temperatures these temperatures were originally drawn from the national oceanic and atmospheric association s national centers for environmental prediction kalnay et al 1996 only model latitudes 78 northernmost and 1 southernmost are directly tied to these mean monthly temperatures all other temperatures are linearly extrapolated between these means across days and model latitudes the full calculation of the temperature gradient is in appendix a of aagaard et al 2018 and in the supporting information the southernmost breeding latitude is set at model latitude 50 the breeding ground and wintering ground centroids are fixed at 418 km from the southernmost breeding latitude at model latitudes 63 and 37 respectively the northern limit of migration in the model is driven by temperature and lies south of the curve over date and latitude below which net energetics exceed 0 this curve is termed the migration wave front migratory periods are defined as dates where the migration wavefront is between breeding ground centroid and wintering ground centroid latitudes aagaard et al 2018 based on this approach birds will only travel as far south as needed to maintain positive energetics the migration timing portion of the model does not model movement between locations only the most probable location for a bird on a given day assuming that a bird will remain as far north as possible while still maintaining positive energetics the migration wave front is calculated on a daily basis but it does not necessarily represent the location or movement pattern of a bird only the northern limit of where a bird would be expected on that day a bird could remain stationary at a latitude on stopover so long as it is south of the migration wave front in a telemetry study of spring migrating mallards the most frequently observed migration pattern was two migratory flights with a multiday stopover in between but non stop single day flights of up to 2 170 km were also recorded by the same study krementz et al 2011 this maximum observed flight distance spans most of the latitudinal extent of the model 2 478 km and exceeds the latitudinal distance from the southern extent of the model to the breeding centroid 1 966 km making a non stop migration plausible for a bird with sufficient energy reserves 2 2 modeling the effects of oiling 2 2 1 oiling and body condition factors oiled birds vary in the amount of oil covering the feathered surface and body condition at the onset of oiling to account for these sources of variation we modified aspects of the base model following a two way factorial approach the effects of oiling on energetics vary with severity of oiling hartung 1967 mathewson et al 2018 to model this variation we used oiling class as one factor with four levels unoiled trace light and moderate these classes correspond to 0 5 6 20 and 21 40 of feather area covered by oil deepwater horizon nrda trustees 2016 after the particularly well documented deepwater horizon oil spill dwh a relatively large number of surviving trace oiled birds were observed fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 a few months after dwh observations of lightly oiled birds were rare and there was a near absence of surviving moderately oiled birds fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 despite the rarity of light and moderate oiling classes after this particular spill we still chose to model these oiling classes for two reasons 1 lightly and moderately birds have been observed surviving encounters with different petroleum sources and self cleaning both in the wild camphuysen 2011 and in laboratory settings burger and tsipoura 1998 hartung 1967 maggini et al 2017 and 2 to provide comparisons to the more commonly observed trace oiling class we excluded heavily oiled birds 40 because almost all heavily oiled birds suffer acute mortality from spills and thus are not represented in surviving populations fallon et al 2018 helm et al 2015 paruk et al 2019 for the second factor initial body condition class we used a factor with three levels poor good and excellent body condition was chosen as a factor to encompass some of the population level variation in the amount of stored body fat because starvation in birds involves a nearly complete depletion of body fat jenni eiermann and schifferli 1989 variation in initial fat stores could affect starvation rates each initial body condition class used had different mean body masses and body fat percentages derived from the body condition classes of whyte and bolen 1988 to incorporate initial body condition class into the body mass formula of aagaard et al 2018 we calculate temperature and body condition dependent body mass mkg of mallard like ducks as 2 m k g 0 0042 t 1 1791 b where t is temperature of the surrounding environment 0 0042 is a modifier to temperature with units kg c that allows a good body condition bird to have a mass of 1 14 kg during breeding season temperatures and 1 1791 is that mass of a mallard like duck in good body condition at 0 c aagaard et al 2018 b is the intercept adjustment for body mass based on initial body condition class with possible values of 0 17 kg poor body condition mean body mass 1 00 kg 0 0 kg good mean body mass 1 17 kg or 0 10 kg excellent mean body mass 1 27 kg proportion of body mass composed of fat pfat also varied with body condition possible values for pfat were 0 047 poor mean fat mass 0 047 kg 0 130 good mean fat mass 0 152 kg and 0 178 excellent mean fat mass 0 226 kg additional details on how we derived and implemented body masses and body fat percentages for each body condition are in the supporting information we modeled each possible combination of oiling class and body condition resulting in twelve different model parameterizations each representing a single median individual within that oiling class initial body condition class combination 2 2 2 energetic balance calculations for this modeling exercise we targeted oiling induced increased cot we broke the thermoregulatory costs of oiling into two components an upward shift in lct and an increase in the heat loss rate below lct for baseline unoiled birds we wanted to mirror energetic parameters of control group mallards in laboratory oiling studies while still maintaining the predicted migration timing of unoiled ducks in the aagaard et al 2018 model to achieve these goals for unoiled birds and incorporate oiled birds we altered three components of the base model for the baseline unoiled birds lct rate of heat loss below lct i e thermal conductance and fdr these changes to the energetic balance components culminate in a series of equations used to calculate net energetic balance that directly depends on only three variables environmental temperature initial body condition class and oiling class figure 2 we changed lct from a static 20 c to a variable following the allometric equation based on body mass from kendeigh et al 1977 with an additional intercept component to account for oiling expressed as 3 lct 47 17 1000 m k g 0 1809 s 1 382 c where 47 17 is a multiplier with units c g 0 1809 1000 is a conversion factor from kilograms to grams s is an oiling class specific shift in lct of 0 c unoiled 3 c trace 7 c light and 12 c moderate the 1 382 c term is standard error of the estimate of lct and is meant to capture uncertainty in the measurement of lct by making lct dependent on body mass which is itself temperature dependent this change resulted in lct varying with date and latitude according to temperature estimates derived from this equation are commonly used in energetics studies involving ducks in the genus anas dalby et al 2013 klimas et al 2020 taylor et al 2019 thompson and baldassarre 1991 mcewan and koelink 1973 estimate a lct of 12 c from direct measurements on unoiled mallards neither the mass of these mallards nor the uncertainty about this estimate is noted wooley and owen 1977 report a range of directly measured lcts for closely related american black ducks anas rubripes of 8 to 13 c mean mass for these black ducks is 1 03 kg the value or range of possible values in both studies fall within two standard errors of mean lct values for unoiled birds calculated using equation 3 e g table 2 using multiple sources we determined changes in lct due to oiling table 2 we calculated a mean baseline unoiled lct of 13 1 c using the mean body mass of 1 17 kg from aagaard et al 2018 and equation 3 we chose an increase of 12 c for moderately oiled birds mcewan and koelink 1973 report an lct of 25 c for oiled mallards they don t specify a proportion of the feather area oiled but our assessment was that their oiling treatments were most likely to result in moderate oiling given this information we calculated a mean lct shift of 12 c 25 c 13 c for moderately oiled birds we chose a lct increase of 7 c for lightly oiled birds a review of literature failed to identify a mallard specific value for a lct shift in a lightly oiled bird but a study by mathewson et al 2018 on double crested cormorants reports lcts of 10 c 17 c and 22 c for unoiled lightly oiled and moderately oiled birds on land respectively using the observed difference of 3 c for mallards compared to cormorants for unoiled and moderately oiled classes we extrapolated a mean lct for lightly oiled mallards of approximately 20 c 17 c 3 c comparing this estimated mean to unoiled lct we calculated a mean lct shift of 7 c 20 c 13 c for lightly oiled birds we chose an increase of 3 c for trace oiled birds we did not find a published estimate for a shift in lct for trace oiled birds of any species this value is the mean of 0 c unoiled and 7 c lightly oiled rounded down to the nearest integer we rounded down because a median trace oiled bird 2 5 body coverage has less than half the oiling on its body compared to a median lightly oiled bird 12 5 we altered the cot equation to produce a formulation resembling the bicudo et al 2010 presentation of the scholander et al 1950 equation for cot we express this equation as 4 cot 4 184 c k c m k g lct t t l c t 0 l c t t u c t where cot has units kj individual 1 day 1 4 184 is a conversion ratio kcal to kj ckc is a taxon specific and feather condition specific value of thermal conductance with units kcal kg 1 c 1 day 1 mkg is body mass in kilograms and t is environmental temperature uct is upper critical temperature the temperature c above which an individual must expend energy to maintain internal body temperature we do not address temperatures above uct in this model this equation does not include energetic costs from other sources such as basal metabolism mkg is not part of the formula given by bicudo et al 2010 but both hartung 1967 and mcewan and koelink 1973 give thermal conductance for mallards in kcal kg 1 c 1 hartung 1967 and mcewan and koelink 1973 give similar ckc values for unoiled mallards 2 83 and 2 80 kcal kg 1 c 1 respectively to obtain a mean ckc for unoiled mallards we averaged these values and rounded to two decimal places table 2 for oiled birds we drew all ckc values from hartung 1967 for trace oiling we used a mean value of 3 85 kcal kg 1 day 1 c 1 the ckc for mallards exposed to 15 g of fuel oil after four days of recovery from oiling for light oiling we used a mean value of 5 21 kcal kg 1 day 1 c 1 the ckc for mallards exposed to 15 g of fuel oil on the day of oiling for moderate oiling we used a mean value of 6 05 kcal kg 1 day 1 c 1 the ckc for mallards exposed to 50 g of diesel oil on the day of oiling table 2 as noted by aagaard et al 2018 fdr is difficult to estimate precisely in wild birds and field estimates for mallards are lacking aagaard et al 2018 find that 1 8 bmr is the most parsimonious value for fdr with their model parameterization because it reduces starvation risk by sustaining energy reserves at greater than critical levels and compensates for long stopovers by adding fat more rapidly to maintain this optimal energetic balance while using lower thermoregulatory costs calculated from equations 3 and 4 we adjusted fdr to 1 526 bmr so that our migration wavefront curve for an average unoiled duck in good body condition matched that of aagaard et al 2018 2 2 3 accounting for uncertainty to account for uncertainty in the estimates of oiling related energetics parameters we performed 10 000 iterations of the model for each combination of initial body condition class and oiling class 120 000 iterations total randomly altering lct and ckc with each iteration we drew random values for both lct and ckc from oiling class specific normal distributions truncated at 2 99 sd from the mean using the r function rtruncnorm in the truncnorm package mersmann et al 2018 we chose 2 99 sd as our cutoff because we did not want to introduce outliers into our dataset an sd of 3 00 from the mean is a common definition of a statistical outlier in normally distributed data shiffler 1988 and 2 99 sd only excludes 0 3 of the values contained in a non truncated normal distribution in part due to small sample sizes in studies on the effects of oiling on mallards e g hartung 1967 we defined the standard deviation of our simulation sampling distributions as standard errors of means in previous studies thus centering our estimates on the value for a median bird in each discrete initial body condition class and oiling class without accounting for population level variation within classes for lct we used equal standard errors across all oiling classes following equation 3 we assumed equal standard errors across oiling classes because we were unable to find uncertainty estimates for the lct of the oiled mallard like ducks or cormorants used to derive lct means furthermore the standard error term given by kendeigh et al 1977 for lct of non passerines is independent of the lct estimate for ckc we used the mean ckc values defined in 2 2 2 and calculated pooled standard error for the unoiled ckc by pooling variances sample sd 2 and samples size between hartung 1967 and mcewan and koelink 1973 table 2 for oiled ckc values we calculated standard error from sample sd and sample size for each oiling class associated with the means from hartung 1967 detailed in 2 2 2 table 2 2 2 4 model assembly and prediction evaluation our model assembly comprised four main components 1 the energetics base model 2 a migration submodel 3 an increased energetic gain submodel and 4 a starvation submodel figure 3 for each submodel we assumed energetics drove a single behavioral response the energetics base model and migration submodel were derived directly from a modified version of the aagaard et al 2018 model the energetic gain and starvation submodels were created specifically for oiled birds but draw on components of the aagaard et al 2018 model the entire model was implemented in r r core team 2020 the r code used for this modeling effort along with detailed model documentation can be found in the supporting information the energetics base model fed into all submodels figure 3 two key components of the base model were the net energetic balance equation 1 figure 2 and energetically neutral temperature ent the environmental temperature at which e 0 the net energetic balance was used to link the energetics base model to the three submodels figure 2 to calculate ent we solved the series of equations in figure 2 for t e 0 using the optimize function in r package stats r core team 2020 ent is not explicitly addressed in aagaard et al 2018 but during the migration and wintering periods the migration wavefront curve lies along the combination of latitude and date just north of the ent thermocline the migration model submodel was used to test the first prediction that a change in migration patterns would be one possible method for birds to offset the energetic costs of oiling to do this assessment we calculated several parameters from the migration wave fronts described in 2 1 we assumed a bird would transition between wave fronts if its oiling severity changed i e a previously unoiled bird that became lightly oiled would be pushed below the light oiling severity wave front curve we do not explicitly address the timing or duration of oiling in this submodel to determine the potential for a southern shift in wintering range for oiled birds to offset oiling effects we found the minimum wintering latitude for each simulation which we defined as the northernmost latitude with positive energetics e 0 on the coldest i e most energetically demanding day of the model year note that this a conservative approach because wild birds may encounter and survive days where e 0 birds may also travel south of this latitude but an individual minimizing distance to breeding grounds while maintaining positive energetics will travel no further south than the minimum wintering latitude if there were no latitudes with positive energetics on the coldest day we set the minimum wintering latitude to the southernmost extent of the model to estimate the start of spring migration we calculated spring departure date from the wintering centroid as the first day in spring where energetics were positive at model latitude 38 1 model latitude north of the wintering centroid latitude note that to maintain a consistent definition of migration this wintering centroid latitude is fixed at model latitude 37 and does not vary between oiling classes to determine when birds could arrive at breeding grounds we calculated arrival dates to both the southernmost breeding latitude and the breeding centroid latitude as the first day in spring where a simulation s migration wave front passed through those latitudes to determine the likelihood that birds would need to forego or truncate spring migration due to oiling we also calculated the percentage of simulations where spring departure from the wintering centroid and arrival at both focal breeding latitudes would not result in positive net energetics by the last day of the model june 29 the increased energetic gain submodel was used to test the second prediction that an increase in energetic gains through increased foraging could balance the energetic costs of oiling this submodel assumed that oiled birds remained at the ent of an unoiled bird and it estimated the magnitude of the change in fdr needed to obtain additional energy to offset cot at this temperature the energetic gain submodel was a small offshoot of the energetics base model figure 3 it comprised a percent increase to fdr for oiled birds to reach the ent of an unoiled bird for each initial body condition class we calculated the median estimate of ent for unoiled birds as the median across 10 000 simulations we then calculated the multiplier to fdr f for simulations of trace light moderately oiled birds as 5 f bmr cot 1 526 bmr where bmr and cot were calculated using t median ent of an unoiled bird in same body condition following the series of equations in figure 2 the expression 1 526 bmr is unadjusted fdr as defined in section 2 2 2 it is important to note that fdr is a net metric including positive energy gains from food and negative all non bmr and non cot energetic losses components thus percent increase of fdr is not a strict percent increase of foraging rate the true increases to gross energy intake will be higher than those reported here the starvation submodel was used to test the third prediction that oiled birds would starve if forced to follow the same migratory trajectory as unoiled birds and that even altering movement patterns may not be sufficient to prevent starvation for some oiled birds it was also used to test the fourth prediction that birds in lower body condition would be at higher risk of starvation and that starvation would occur more quickly in birds in lower body condition we calculated days until starvation as 6 d s t a r v e 39 700 p f a t m k g e where dstarve is estimated days until starvation and 39 700 is the conversion factor from kg of fat to kj and pfat is the body condition dependent proportion of body mass composed of fat see 2 2 1 mkg is body mass in kilograms e is daily net energetic balance calculated using the initial mass of the bird we simplified the calculation by assuming constant e per the series of equations in figure 2 mkg depends upon environmental temperature and initial body condition class and e depends on environmental temperature oiling class and initial body condition class to make the results more interpretable we made the simplifying assumptions of constant ambient temperature and no long distance flight i e no flight related energy expenditure beyond foraging flights at a stopover or wintering latitude when calculating days until starvation to mimic oiled birds following the same migration trajectory as unoiled birds we calculated days until starvation for oiled birds using the median estimate of ent for an unoiled bird in the good initial body condition class to evaluate the efficacy of southward movement in preventing starvation we focused on simulations predicting negative net energetics at the southernmost model latitude using the mean temperature at this latitude between december 1 and february 28 this movement scenario represents the most extreme case of southward movement in our model meaning that less extreme southward movement would result in even faster starvation evidence suggests that birds may be able to remove oil from their plumage without intervention by humans via self cleaning burger and tsipoura 1998 camphuysen 2011 hartung 1967 maggini et al 2017 among studies documenting self cleaning the longest time period for a bird in a moderate or lower oiling severity class was for a wild moderately oiled lesser black backed gull larus fuscus the time period was 26 days based on this number we use four weeks 28 days as a likely threshold for self cleaning when interpreting our results we present further discussion of self cleaning in 4 3 1 the results associated with the first four predictions were used to test the final overarching prediction of a positive relationship between the severity of negative consequences and oiling severity and that mitigation of negative effects of oiling may be impossible past a certain threshold of oiling severity for each metric associated with our five predictions we calculated three metrics associated with either oiling classes pooled across body conditions 4 groups 30 000 simulations groups or oiling class initial body condition class combinations 12 groups 10 000 simulations group a median 0 025 quantile and 0 975 quantile across simulations the interval between the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles was the 95 interquartile range 95 iqr a 95 iqr was chosen as a realistic representation of uncertainty for each estimate it is comparable to a 95 bayesian credible interval meaning that it represents 95 certainty that a parameter estimate lies within the 95 iqr curran 2005 due to similarity in values between body conditions for most metrics we report pooled values across initial body condition classes within different oiling classes for all predictions not involving starvation starvation predictions relied upon fat energy which varied between body conditions necessitating the use of oiling class initial body condition class combinations for these metrics 2 2 5 model and data visualization flowcharts were created using a combination of microsoft powerpoint and microsoft visio we created all other figures with r packages ggplot2 ggnewscale ggpubr and viridis campitelli 2020 garnier 2018 kassambara 2020 r core team 2020 wickham 2016 distributions from simulations were plotted as frequency polygon histograms to plot distributions with long right tails we chose a value slightly larger than the 0 975 quantile converted all larger values to that value displayed the resulting compressed distribution and noted the compression in the x axis ticks as chosen value to visualize migration wavefront curves predicted latitudes median and 95 iqr were plotted on a daily basis across a model year for ease of interpretation latitudes were displayed in kilometers from breeding centroid using the conversion factor of 1 model latitude 32 187 km to visualize changes in temperature over latitude and date we included a temperature raster as the background of the migration wavefront plot 3 results 3 1 energetically neutral temperature energetically neutral temperatures reported in c as median 95 iqr for different oiling classes were as follows unoiled 4 9 7 6 2 2 trace 2 9 0 0 5 7 light 10 3 7 6 13 1 moderate 16 7 14 1 19 4 relative to an unoiled bird median estimates of ent increased by approximately 8 c 15 c and 22 c for trace light and moderate oiling classes respectively the 95 iqr for the ent of oiled birds was composed of temperatures strictly below freezing whereas the 95 iqrs for all oiling classes trace or higher did not contain any temperatures below freezing 3 2 altered migration patterns assuming that mallard like ducks can respond to oiling by altering migration patterns our simulations displayed an overarching trend of oiled birds moving further south in winter and delaying spring migration the degree of these effects generally differed between oiling classes and the magnitude of the effects increased with increased oiling severity figure 4 we predicted that trace oiled birds would move further south than unoiled birds during the coldest day of the year the difference between the median estimates of minimum wintering latitudes of unoiled and trace oiled birds was approximately 500 km 16 model latitudes across the simulated landscape figure 4 we predicted that lightly oiled and moderately oiled birds would travel to the southernmost model latitude on the coldest day of the year further south than unoiled and trace oiled birds figure 4 the migration wavefront curve for the moderate oiling class flatlines at the southernmost model latitude between november and april this flatlining indicates birds in the migration alteration scenario would have moved to warmer latitudes south of the current model extent if geographically energetically and behaviorally possible median estimates of spring departure dates from the wintering centroid became at least one month later per increase in oiling class and the median departure date for each oiling class was different from all others figure 5 estimates of spring departure date were relatively uncertain with 95 iqr widths ranging from 20 days moderate oiling to 50 days unoiled approximately 9 6 of simulations of unoiled birds predicted that an unoiled bird would stay north of the wintering centroid on all model dates these simulations did not have a spring departure date because they did not complete migration to the prescribed wintering centroid latitude all simulations of trace and light oiling classes had the migration wavefront pass south of the wintering centroid during fall migration and return to latitudes north of the wintering centroid during spring migration approximately 31 0 of simulations of moderately oiled birds predicted that a moderately oiled bird would stay at or below the wintering centroid through june 29 the last day of the model similar to spring departure arrival at both the southernmost breeding latitude and breeding centroid latitude were delayed by approximately one month per increase in oiling class for unoiled trace and light classes and these classes were different from each other within latitudes figure 5 uncertainty about estimates decreased slightly as latitude moved northward figure 5 all simulations for both unoiled and trace oiled birds predicted arrival at both targeted breeding latitudes for the light oiling class 0 1 and 21 1 of simulations predicted a lightly oiled bird would remain south of the southernmost breeding latitude and the breeding centroid latitude respectively through june 29 the majority of simulations for a moderately oiled bird 94 1 predicted that a bird in this class would remain south of the southernmost breeding latitude through june 29 and the remaining simulations for this predicted arrival at this latitude in late june figure 5 all simulations predicted that a moderately oiled bird would remain south of the breeding centroid latitude 3 3 energetic gain increases we predicted median percent increases to fdr of 20 3 trace 53 9 light and 88 6 moderate to maintain neutral energetics at the median estimate of energetically neutral temperature of an unoiled bird fdr multipliers differed between oiling classes figure 6 3 4 starvation timeframes the median energetically neutral temperature of an unoiled bird used for starvation calculations was 4 9 c and the mean winter temperature at the southernmost model latitude was 10 8 c all simulations for trace light and moderate oiling classes predicted that starvation was possible within a finite number of days at 4 9 c table 3 starvation within a finite number of days at 10 8 c was not predicted in any simulations for the trace oiling class for the light oiling class results were similar across body conditions 37 8 poor 37 9 good and 38 3 excellent of simulations predicted possible starvation within a finite number of days at 10 8 c across all body condition classes for lightly oiled birds at this temperature the 95 iqrs excluded values within the self cleaning period 28 days table 3 all starvation simulations for the moderate oiling class predicted possible starvation within a finite number of days at 10 8 c as a general trend days until starvation decreased with declining body condition and increasing oiling severity for oiled birds table 3 days until starvation were also usually lower at 4 9 c than 10 8 c across oiling initial body condition class combinations there were a few exceptions associated with the moderate oiling class for the 4 9 c simulations starvation timeframes for trace oiled birds in good and excellent body conditions were the only oiling initial body condition class combinations with 95 iqrs excluding values of 28 days table 3 trace oiled birds in good and excellent body condition were also the only oiled birds at 4 9 c to have starvation timeframe estimates with 95 iqrs excluding values of 28 days for the 10 8 c simulations the starvation timeframe for a moderately oiled bird in poor body condition was the only combination of oiling class and initial body condition class at 10 8 c to have a 95 iqr that was entirely 28 days table 3 the only other combination at 10 8 c to have starvation timeframe estimates with a 95 iqrs containing values of 28 days was a moderately oiled bird in good body condition but the median for this combination 34 days was more than 28 days table 3 4 discussion we provided a first principles evaluation of potential behavioral responses by waterfowl to oiling and estimated timeframes between the onset of oiling and starvation we demonstrated the potential for less severely oiled birds to offset the energetic effects of oiling by migrating further south and the possibility of delayed or truncated migration as a strategy to manage the energetic effects of oiling we also showed the necessity of significantly increasing fuel deposition rate to offset the energetic costs of oiling if birds do not or cannot seek warmer temperatures starvation was a consistent endpoint across all oiling classes at colder temperatures moderately oiled birds may even starve at relatively warm temperatures the necessary magnitude of behavioral response to oiling consistently increased with increased oiling and the threat of starvation was generally greater at lower body conditions increased oiling severities and lower temperatures 4 1 potential effects of oiling on wintering waterbirds wild mallards can withstand periods of subfreezing temperatures in the wild without loss of body condition boos et al 2007 whyte and bolen 1984 these field observations support our model prediction of an energetically neutral temperature below freezing for unoiled birds when oiled however we predicted energetically neutral temperatures at or above freezing for all oiling classes for mallard like ducks therefore even trace oiling has the potential to reduce the resilience of birds to subfreezing temperatures our predicted response to oiling was movement further south but it is unknown if oiled waterfowl have the behavioral or physical capacity to move further south in response to an abrupt change in their condition such as oiling if a poor condition mallard like duck were to become lightly or moderately oiled in subfreezing temperatures our model predicted starvation within one week the combination of generally low body condition in winter and cold temperatures are thought to be contributing factors to mass mortality in winter oil spills clark 1984 this hypothesis is supported by our model due to the negative effects of oiling on thermoregulation the energetically neutral temperatures predicted by our model indicate that oiled mallard like ducks attempting to withstand subfreezing temperatures would decrease in body condition in the best case scenario this loss in body condition would be sublethal in the worst case scenario an oiled bird would starve at a rapid rate 4 2 behavioral responses to oiling feasibility and consequences 4 2 1 altered migration and reproductive consequences for a bird to use changes in migratory patterns to cope with the energetic consequences of oiling these altered migration pathways must be energetically and behaviorally possible unoiled mallards ranging in total mass from 0 82 to 1 31 kg spend 0 066 to 0 100 kg of fat on a 1 000 km flight whyte and bolen 1988 this distance approximates a flight from the wintering centroid to the southernmost model latitude to the wintering centroid 1 127 km this flight would be energetically impossible for a poor body condition bird with 0 047 kg of fat stores but possible for good or excellent body condition birds with 0 152 or 0 226 kg of fat stores respectively without movement we predicted good and excellent body condition birds wintering at a temperature of 4 9 c that become lightly or moderately oiled would have median time to starvation of 9 to 21 days due to thermoregulatory cost of oiling this time frame indicated that southward movement to escape cold temperatures may be energetically favorable however oiling may increase the cost of flight as it does in western sandpipers calidris mauri maggini et al 2017 and homing pigeons columbia livia perez et al 2017 direct studies of migrating oiled birds have not yet been conducted meaning that it is unknown if these oiled birds have the behavior flexibility to travel further south than their normal wintering range or otherwise alter their migration trajectory other authors have predicted delayed or arrested migration resulting from oiling in waterbirds due to reduced ability to accumulate or maintain sufficient fuel stores dorr et al 2020 henkel et al 2012 maggini et al 2017 we present another related mechanism for oiling induced migration alteration increased cot at cooler northern destinations may dissuade oiled bird departures from areas where they can maintain neutral or positive net energetics compared to unoiled birds our simulations predicted a spring migration delay of about one month for trace oiled birds a delay of about two months for lightly oiled birds and arrested migration below even the southernmost breeding latitudes for moderately oiled birds in addition to potential migration delays caused by difficulty refueling and thermoregulatory costs there may be less food available at stopovers due to consumption by fall migrants decomposition and spring migrants that arrived earlier brasher et al 2007 straub et al 2012 these combined factors challenging oiled birds attempting migration could delay arrival beyond our simulations predictions and or more readily cause starvation due to the breadth of reproductive strategies in birds ricklefs 1977 we focus our discussion of the effects of migration delays on reproduction on our model organism the mallard and related dabbling duck species dabbling ducks including mallards have low annual survivorship krementz et al 1989 therefore effects on a single breeding season may substantially influence an individual duck s lifetime reproductive output if ducks delay migration to minimize energetic loss from oiling they could experience decreased reproductive success mallards initiating nests later have lower clutch sizes and are less likely to renest if their nest fails arnold et al 2010 instead of delaying breeding oiled mallards may be able to breed at more southern warmer latitudes reproductive success in mallards and other ducks varies with geographic location though there are no clear cut latitudinal patterns devries et al 2008 greenwood et al 1995 in lieu of delaying migration and reproduction oiled mallards may attempt to follow the normal schedule of an unoiled mallard however the consequence of this action would be a decrease in body condition due to increased energetic costs from oiling lower body condition is linked to decreased reproductive success devries et al 2008 no matter their behavioral approach even trace oiled female mallards are likely to have their reproductive capacity negatively affected by the energetic consequences of oiling if they become oiled while migrating to the breeding grounds in spring 4 2 2 increased energetic gains an increase in energetic gains requires at least three components a behavioral capacity to increase food consumption a physical capability to digest additional food and an ability to find additional food if faced with hard to digest foods such as alfalfa or a combination of oil tainted food and cold stress mallards held in captivity and fed ad libitum can consume up to 70 more food compared to control birds to maintain body weight holmes et al 1978 miller 1975 these findings indicate that mallards can alter their behavior to increase food consumption and that they are physically capable of processing that food assuming the necessary increase in the food consumption rate is not substantially larger than the necessary increase in fdr this increase could cover the 20 3 and 53 9 increases to fdr we predicted respectively for trace and light oiling classes however the 88 6 fdr increase for moderately oiled mallards to maintain the same energetically neutral temperature as an unoiled bird may be beyond the behavioral or physical capabilities of moderately oiled birds though it may be possible for mallards to increase their food consumption in captivity in the wild spring migrating ducks may face limited food resources due to previous consumption by fall migrating birds and decomposition brasher et al 2007 straub et al 2012 overall an increase in fdr may be biologically possible for oiled mallards but finding that food in the wild may be difficult 4 3 oiling and starvation 4 3 1 self cleaning in oiled birds studies across waterbird taxa document self cleaning in oiled birds burger and tsipoura 1998 camphuysen 2011 hartung 1967 maggini et al 2017 the timeframe of self cleaning varies based on the type of oil extent of oiling and bird species in captivity lightly oiled mallards can remove fuel oil a relatively fluid and non sticky type of oil from their plumage within seven days hartung 1967 when lightly oiled with more viscous weathered crude oils anitra and mc 252 sandpipers calidris spp in captivity can remove most or all of the oil from their plumage within fourteen days burger and tsipoura 1998 maggini et al 2017 when oiled offshore by an unknown type of oil trace oiled wild lesser black backed gulls can remove all visible oil within 13 to 15 days while moderately oiled gulls can remove all visible oil within 20 to 26 days camphuysen 2011 taken together these data suggest a timeframe of one to four weeks as the amount of time aquatic birds need to eliminate visible traces of oil from their plumage at ambient temperatures of 4 9 c we predicted starvation for the light oiling poor initial body condition class combination and all moderate oiling class body condition combinations within about two weeks or less therefore both lightly oiled birds in poor body condition and moderately oiled birds in any body condition wintering in colder climates are very likely to die from starvation unless they compensate for the additional energetic costs lightly oiled birds in good and excellent initial body condition classes and trace oiled birds in the poor initial body condition class all had predicted recovery estimates in the realm of two to four weeks meaning these class combinations were potentially vulnerable to starvation before recovering times to starvation in modeled trace oiled birds at 4 9 c did not fall within the four week window at good and excellent body conditions at 4 9 c starvation was expected across poorer body conditions for light oiling and was expected at all body conditions for moderate oiling at a warmer temperature of 10 8 c the only groups we simulated that were at risk of starvation in four weeks or fewer were the moderately oiled birds in poor or good body condition more studies of self cleaning rates including various oil types e g crude diluted bitumen various oiling classes and comparisons within the same bird species are needed to better inform the length of time birds will suffer thermoregulatory consequences of external oiling depending on the timing of an oiling event a bird may become oiled while molting feathers another possible mechanism for removing oil from plumage in most bird species insulative feathers are molted once annually during the prebasic molt because both molt and migration have high energetic cost prebasic molt in migratory bird species generally occurs before or after autumn migration dawson 2015 duration of molt also tends to increase with body size across species dawson 2015 in mallards a relatively large bird species prebasic molt occurs after fall migration generally over the course of 6 to 7 weeks between november and march heitmeyer 1987 mallards also halt prebasic molt if their diet is deficient in either calories or protein richardson and kaminski 1992 given the gradual nature of prebasic molt in mallard sized birds 6 to 7 weeks compared to a relatively short self cleaning time frame of 1 to 4 weeks molt is unlikely to be an efficient alternative to active self cleaning additionally if oiling causes impaired foraging or diverts energy toward thermoregulation molt may cease entirely 4 3 2 comparison to real world oil spills our model results regarding starvation resemble the mortality patterns observed in real world oil spills though mortality through starvation predicted by our model likely overestimates the amount of time needed for some bird species to starve our finding of likely starvation across many oiling class initial body condition class combinations at 4 9 c matches the observation that oiling related avian mortality events occur more frequently at upper latitudes and during winter bourne and bibby 1975 clark 1984 starvation appears to be a leading cause of death in such spills balseiro et al 2005 starvation of birds in cold water systems is even more likely than predicted by our model due to additional factors first some birds will become heavily oiled in such a spill leading to greater energetic costs and faster starvation or death from other causes balseiro et al 2005 hartung 1967 second avian victims of oil spills at upper latitudes largely comprise diving birds such as alcids and sea ducks balseiro et al 2005 piatt et al 1990 which due to spending much of their time underwater have higher thermoregulatory costs than the modeled dabbling ducks in our study fort et al 2009 mckinney and mcwilliams 2005 therefore some species such as diving ducks are likely to suffer greater thermoregulatory consequences from oiling and starve more quickly jenssen 1994 because we incorporated temperatures approximating the gulf coast of the united states at the southernmost model latitude our model results for this latitude can be compared to the deepwater horizon dwh oil spill our model predicted that trace oiled birds could remain north of southernmost model latitude year round without encountering negative energetics a model result which corresponds with the relatively large number of surviving trace oiled birds observed after the dwh oil spill fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 however surviving lightly oiled birds were rarely observed and surviving moderately oiled birds were virtually absent within a few months after the oil well was capped fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 this difference between our model and field observations suggests one or more of the following possibilities bird species common in the northern gulf of mexico may experience more extreme heat loss than mallards when oiled oiling may change birds ability to obtain food and convert it to energy or birds may die of factors other than starvation i e from increased predation or toxicological effects of exposure warming winter and spring temperatures resulting from changing climate may seem to benefit oiled birds by reducing thermoregulatory costs north american duck species and potentially other aquatic bird species globally have shifted their wintering ranges north over the last several decades a shift correlated with increasing temperatures meehan et al 2021 and aagaard et al 2018 predicted earlier spring migration in mallard like ducks with warming temperatures however ducks and potentially other taxa may continue to experience similar wintering temperatures while still being exposed to oiling hazards and thus experience similar risks of death from oiling at shifted wintering locations a spatially explicit model of avian migration e g lonsdorf et al 2016 would be needed to better address this possibility given the potential for wintering range compression due to climate change meehan et al 2021 and for the potential of landscape scale forage depletion by waterfowl baveco et al 2011 winter body condition could decline due to limited food resources this decline would make birds more susceptible to oiling even at warmer temperatures 4 4 model assumptions and limitations our model maintains most of the assumptions of the aagaard et al 2018 model one of the most influential assumptions inherited from the base model is a constant fuel deposition rate throughout the annual cycle we applied this assumption to both migration and starvation calculations and extended it to include multiple oiling classes and initial body condition classes data on fuel deposition and foraging rates with respect to oiling are sparse and conflicting burger 1997 holmes et al 1978 maggini et al 2017 mathewson et al 2018 therefore we assumed constant fuel deposition between oiling classes for lack of consistent data to inform otherwise we address potential increases to fuel deposition rate based on oiling classes as one of our model components our model exclusively deals with one energetic consequence of oiling and one source of mortality thermoregulatory effects resulting from oiled feathers and starvation respectively in addition to affecting thermoregulation oiling can cause other energetic effects on birds ingestion can lead to increased metabolic costs holmes et al 1978 however in situ ingestion rates of oil after a spill are to the best of our knowledge unknown oiling of feathers can also increase the cost of flight this effect has only recently been studied directly in the western sandpiper a relatively small 29 g long distance migrant maggini et al 2017 and the homing pigeon a mid sized 450 g domestic model organism perez et al 2017 additional studies are needed to measure the effects of oiling on flight efficiency in other taxa including waterfowl the energetic effects of oiling on migratory flight are likely to be most consequential in long distance migrants that require large increases in fuel stores to complete migration e g shorebirds with intercontinental migrations henkel et al 2012 maggini et al 2017 in terms of mortality oiling can cause death from factors beyond starvation such factors include lipid pneumonia body system failures from toxic effects and dehydration balseiro et al 2005 cunningham et al 2017 dean and bursian 2017 king et al 2021 independent of both oiling and direct mortality from starvation mallards and potentially other bird species have lower survivorship when in lower body condition bergan and smith 1993 davis et al 2011 yetter et al 2018 therefore oiling could increase mortality risk by decreasing body condition without causing complete starvation because of the additional energetic and toxic effects of oiling future modeling efforts designed to fully capture the effects of oiling on bird populations should incorporate these effects in addition to the thermoregulatory effects demonstrated by our present model in addition to only addressing single components of oiling effects on energetics and mortality our model relies on other simplifications we only addressed degree of oiling and body condition in twelve discrete combinations in reality both elements exist on continuous scales therefore despite our introduction of variability to account for uncertainty our estimates only represent the values for a single hypothetical median individual within an oiling class initial body condition class combination we would expect greater variability within a population of birds than is represented within our model the starvation equation we chose was relatively simple it involved a single constant temperature and did not account for the slight metabolic changes associated with body mass loss over time however given the simulated nature of the temperature landscape across latitudes and time originally developed by aagaard et al 2018 and the arbitrary nature of choosing appropriate start dates and locations from which to calculate starvation we opted for a simple calculation to facilitate ease of interpretation we also treated space one dimensionally assuming a linear relationship between latitude and environmental temperature and by proxy a linear relationship between latitude and thermoregulatory cost given environmental temperature is below a bird s lct dorr et al 2020 found similar linear or nearly linear relationships between latitude and thermoregulatory cost when averaging across latitudes but microclimates across each latitude differed we did not account for this source of variation in our current modeling framework for lower critical temperature lct we did not find mallard specific values for lct increases for trace or light oiling classes and estimated these values with supplementation of data from double crested cormorants we also assumed that standard errors for lct were constant between oiling classes while our inclusion of uncertainty about estimates does help mitigate this reliance on our professional judgement more laboratory research would be needed to determine the effects of oiling on this component of thermoregulation in dabbling ducks lastly our model uses a simulated temperature gradient and it is not spatially explicit the consequence of this generality is that our model predictions do not apply directly to real world oil spill locations but the overall patterns and proportional effects mirror reality further development of the approach incorporation into more realistic models and more study on the behavior of wild oiled birds could broaden the scope of inference for this model allowing greater confidence in statements about potential changes in migration behavior in oiled birds 4 5 potential model applications despite the generalized nature of our model the starvation portion could be used to inform rough time frames for responders aiming to rehabilitate oiled birds for a spill predicted to moderately oil many birds during colder weather in an area where birds are generally in poor body condition responders are only likely to have a few days to capture oiled birds for rehabilitation if most birds are only trace or lightly oiled during warmer weather birds may be able to recover on their own or with the help of supplemental food however more research is needed on the ability of wild oiled birds to consume supplemental food before this strategy is employed in our opinion the strongest application of this model would be as a module within a spatially explicit migration model incorporating temperatures based on climate data and real world locations of oil spills with endpoints of mortality and reproductive loss such a model could assist in predicting risk to populations for ecological risk assessment and it could be used to estimate additional population scale injury in the context of natural resource damage assessments the value of models in determining injury to avian populations in the context of oil spills was well demonstrated by the dwh oil spill in 2010 the injury assessments for the dwh oil spill s impact on bird populations applied multiple models including a shoreline deposition model offshore exposure model and a live oiled bird model these models are summarized by the deepwater horizon nrda trustees 2016 several components could be used to enhance this model to allow for predictions of mortality and reproductive loss in a spatially explicit context complementing existing models that assess population scale risk and injury for birds in the wake of oil spills the models of both lonsdorf et al 2016 and dorr et al 2020 contain components that could be combined with the current model to map findings to real world locations though we currently only use three initial body condition classes additional initial body condition classes could be incorporated and birds could be allowed to transition between those classes based on net energetic balances other causes of mortality could also be incorporated to account for the general phenomenon of declining survivorship with declining body condition additional energetic effects of oiling as discussed in 4 4 could also be incorporated as could morbidity and mortality from toxicological effects to balance model simplicity with model realism sensitivity analyses applied to each of these effects and exclusion of minimally influential effects would be valuable as model complexity increases additionally this effort would likely best be initially directed at trace oiled birds given the disruptions to migration predicted by our model and their higher observed survivorship compared to more heavily oiled birds in the aftermath of dwh fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 an extended version of this model could be generalized to additional species given sufficient data on thermal conductance of a bird s feathers lct and the effects of oiling on cot this model has the potential to be especially useful for waterbird species whose annual migration path varies between years due to temperature taxa whose migration correlates strongly with annual variations in temperature suggesting a temperature modulated and energetics based migration pattern include a variety of ducks lehikoinen et al 2013 meehan et al 2021 herring gulls larus argentatus hebert 1998 and some shorebird species charadrii that winter in temperate areas austin and rehfisch 2005 this model could still be valuable for nonmigratory species or species whose migration is not primarily mediated by temperature as the fuel deposition rate and starvation components apply to any bird species to apply this model to other less studied species thermoregulatory energetics can be modeled using museum specimen measurements and known or estimated thermal properties of a species feathers reducing or eliminating the need for laboratory studies on live birds dorr et al 2020 fort et al 2009 mckinney and mcwilliams 2005 oiling can also be simulated in these models by increasing thermal conductance of oiled feathers dorr et al 2020 by extending this model to be spatially explicit population scale inclusive of other effects of oiling on reproduction and mortality and generalized to multiple species it could allow for improved estimates of mortality and reproductive loss in the wake of oil spills this extended model could serve as a powerful management tool informing sublethal oiling associated additional deaths and decreased reproductive output not easily observed once a bird leaves the site of an oil spill better estimates of these effects can allow for more accurate ecological risk assessment predictions for citing of refineries pipelines and hubs for petroleum transportation activities as well as throughout the routes taken on land and sea by oil transporting carriers when spills occur better understanding and real time predictions of effects on sublethally exposed birds could improve situational awareness and response planning by incident coordinators and allow more accurate estimates of injury for natural resource damage assessments 5 conclusions over the past century oil spills have killed millions of aquatic birds and sublethally injured many others burger 1993 haney et al 2014 munilla et al 2011 piatt et al 1990 using a mallard like dabbling duck as a model organism we used energetics modeling to explore a single oiling related pathway that can lead to death and injury thermoregulatory consequences of the oiling of a bird s feathers as one possible mechanism to offset the thermoregulatory cost of oiling our model predicted either delayed or arrested spring migration in oiled birds this potential of oiling induced migration change could reduce reproductive success by delaying arrival on the breeding grounds increasing energetic gains provided another potential avenue for recouping energy lost through the thermoregulatory cost of oiling but the potential for wild birds to employ this strategy is currently unknown the consequences of oiling increased with increasing oiling severity the costs were especially dire for moderately oiled birds which were likely to forfeit their breeding season or die though our model was general and not spatially explicit it used temperature to emphasize the importance of the timing and location of an oil spill to determine energetic impacts on birds our predictions on the starvation of light and moderate oiling classes in subzero temperatures and the survival of trace oiled birds mirror observed results of past real world oil spills balseiro et al 2005 bourne and bibby 1975 paruk et al 2019 piatt et al 1990 by applying the components of this model to a spatially explicit framework future research could predict deaths and reproductive losses associated with the energetic costs of sublethal oiling in wild populations of birds thus increasing understanding of the population level effects of oil spills on bird life credit authorship contribution statement benjamin m west conceptualization methodology software formal

24322,oil spills can inflict mortality and injury on bird populations many of these deaths involve starvation resulting from thermoregulatory costs incurred by oiling of birds feathers however the fates and responses of sublethally oiled birds are poorly known due to this knowledge gap and the potential for birds to die far from the spill site resource risk and injury assessors need tools to make informed estimates for delayed deaths and lost reproductive capacity in these birds focusing on the thermoregulatory cost of oiled feathers we present a model addressing one facet of the effects of sublethal oiling on birds using mallard like ducks as a model organism we combined values from previous laboratory studies of oiled birds with a modified version of an existing temperature influenced avian migration energetics model using this model we examined the potential effects of oiling on general migration patterns changes in energetic gains required to compensate for oiling and starvation we assessed all metrics across multiple oiling severities we assessed starvation across both oiling severity and body condition median estimates for delays in spring migration were one to two months for trace and lightly oiled birds and we predicted arrested spring migration in moderately oiled birds median estimates of required increases in energetic gains to offset costs of increased thermoregulation ranged from 20 3 to 88 6 depending on severity of oiling we predicted starvation within four weeks for most combinations of oiling severity and body condition at the median predicted minimum wintering temperature of unoiled birds 4 9 c however at the average winter temperature of the southernmost model latitude 10 8 c we predicted only moderately oiled birds in less than excellent body condition had the potential to starve within a four week time frame due to the potential for even trace oiling to delay spring migration and decrease body condition the thermoregulatory costs of sublethal oiling during spring migration could reduce a bird s reproductive capacity future research integrating this initial energetics based model into a spatially explicit population scale migration model could provide additional insight into the potential effects of sublethal oiling on reproduction and survival such an integrated model could strengthen risk predictions and injury

relatively common for marine oil spills but in extreme cases hundreds of thousands of birds can be killed burger 1993 haney et al 2014 munilla et al 2011 piatt et al 1990 each individual death can be traced back to one or more negative effects of oiling such as organ or body system failure due to toxicity severe dehydration or starvation balseiro et al 2005 cunningham et al 2017 jenssen 1994 oka and okuyama 2000 birds that become oiled and survive may experience sublethal effects such as hemolytic anemia increased flight cost additional thermoregulatory costs or behavioral changes burger and tsipoura 1998 fallon et al 2018 hartung 1967 maggini et al 2017 disruption to an individual s energetic balance is one of the primary causes of mortality and sublethal effects in oiled birds balseiro et al 2005 jenssen 1994 under unoiled conditions birds as endotherms maintain a constant internal body temperature across a range of environmental temperatures this range of temperatures is the thermoneutral zone tnz within the tnz incidental heat from a bird s basal metabolic rate bmr and insulation from feathers maintain body temperature the lower limit of the tnz is the lower critical temperature lct below the lct birds incur an energetic cost of thermoregulation cot in addition to the cost of bmr cot increases linearly as temperature decreases bicudo et al 2010 increased cot is one of the most well documented adverse energetic effects of external oiling on birds especially at cold ambient temperatures jenssen 1994 mathewson et al 2018 mcewan and koelink 1973 stephenson 1997 oiling reduces the insulative capacity of feathers this reduction increases cot by raising lct and accelerating the rate of heat loss at temperatures below that elevated lct jenssen 1994 mathewson et al 2018 mcewan and koelink 1973 this oiling induced cot increase can ultimately result in starvation if a bird cannot increase energy intake balseiro et al 2005 hartung 1967 oka and okuyama 2000 time of year location and the stage of a bird s annual cycle can all alter the type and magnitude of the consequences of oiling on a bird thermoregulatory costs from oiling compounded by cold ambient temperatures contribute to the phenomenon of oiling related avian mortality events occurring more frequently at upper latitudes and during winter bourne and bibby 1975 clark 1984 moving to lower latitudes may alleviate the energetic costs of oiling for lightly oiled birds dorr et al 2020 but it is unknown if birds can move to compensate for these costs oiling may also affect migration oiled birds may experience delayed arrival on the breeding grounds if they fail to sufficiently increase their pre migratory or stopover foraging activity to compensate for increased cot during colder early spring temperatures dorr et al 2020 delayed migration resulting from oiling could lower reproductive success if spring migrating birds arrive on the breeding grounds later or in poorer body condition henkel et al 2012 the effects of oiling on migration have yet to be adequately demonstrated by field studies to mitigate thermoregulatory effects on migration birds may be able to increase food intake to combat the energetic costs of oiling provided ad libitum food captive externally oiled double crested cormorants phalacrocorax auritus can increase food consumption to compensate for cot increases induced by oiling mathewson et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge it is unknown if any bird species can increase food consumption sufficiently to offset the energetic costs of oiling in a natural setting on the contrary research on wild sanderlings calidris alba and semipalmated plovers charadrius semipalmatus suggests that oiled birds may spend less time foraging than unoiled birds burger 1997 for resource agencies tasked with quantifying injury to birds in actual oil spills realistic estimates of mortality and lost reproductive output in live oiled birds are essential to assessing damages that fund restoration of lost resources deepwater horizon nrda trustees 2016 bursian et al 2017 however it is difficult to design and implement ethical and practical field studies on the impacts of oiling on migration and energetics in wild birds because of this difficulty energetics based simulation models offer a promising alternative means to assess the potential impacts of oiling on migratory birds dorr et al 2020 using a model duck with morphology physiology and behavior similar to a mallard anas platyrhynchos hereafter mallard like duck as a model organism we combine previous energetics research on oiled birds with the temperature influenced avian energetics model of aagaard et al 2018 to assess the potential effects of oiling on the energetics of migratory birds during winter and spring migration we made five predictions regarding the energetic effects of oiling on migratory birds and the hypothetical behavioral changes that might be used to offset these effects figure 1 first we predicted that altering migration patterns would be one possible method for birds to offset the energetic costs of oiling with potential alterations including more southerly wintering latitudes and delayed spring migration second we predicted that an increase in energetic gains i e increased food intake could balance the energetic costs of oiling third we predicted that oiled birds would starve if they experienced the environmental temperature of the predicted migratory path of unoiled birds and that even wintering at more southern latitudes than unoiled birds may not be sufficient to prevent starvation for some oiled birds fourth we predicted that starvation would occur more quickly in birds in lower body condition finally we predicted that there would be a positive relationship between the severity of negative consequences and oiling severity and that mitigation of negative effects of oiling may be impossible past a certain threshold of oiling severity 2 materials and methods 2 1 base model summary we modified the stationary energetics and migration timing portions of a previously published temperature energetics and migration model for mallard like ducks aagaard et al 2018 note that stationary only means that a bird is not actively migrating between latitudes this component implicitly includes local movements we chose a temperature modulated energetics based migration model because it allowed the incorporation of temperature dependent energetic effects of oiling the mallard like ducks used by aagaard et al 2018 were an appropriate model organism because the effects of sublethal external oiling on thermoregulation in mallards have been previously studied hartung 1967 mcewan and koelink 1973 we include all variables their definitions and associated sources presented throughout the materials and methods in table 1 a full description of the base model and the additional model components is available in the supporting information net stationary energetics can be summarized as 1 e fdr bmr cot where e is daily net energetics fdr is fuel deposition rate the net amount of energy per day that a bird gains from food that can be used for bmr and cot this value includes both energy intake and energy lost to activity and other non bmr and cot pathways bmr is basal metabolic rate and cot is the energetic cost of thermoregulation in addition to the energy used for the bmr note that fdr as defined in this model differs from some other definitions of fdr others use fdr to measure total accumulation of energy stores on migratory stopovers and include all energetic costs including bmr and cot within fdr klaassen et al 1997 schaub and jenni 2000 the migration timing portion of the model of aagaard et al 2018 effectively operates in one spatial dimension north to south longitudes are not used for migration timing with a daily temperature gradient that changes with both latitude and date the model s spatial units are arbitrary latitudes ranging from 1 to 78 south to north the distance between latitudes is defined as 32 187 km but note that these units are not mapped or scaled to real world locations the model year begins and ends in the northern hemisphere summer during the breeding season for mallards and lasts 363 days aagaard et al 2018 temperatures are coldest in midwinter at the northernmost latitude and warmest in midsummer at the southernmost latitude the seeds for temperature simulations are 2 sets of 12 real world latitudinal monthly mean temperatures 24 total corresponding to northern canada 12 temperatures and to the gulf coast of the united states 12 temperatures these temperatures were originally drawn from the national oceanic and atmospheric association s national centers for environmental prediction kalnay et al 1996 only model latitudes 78 northernmost and 1 southernmost are directly tied to these mean monthly temperatures all other temperatures are linearly extrapolated between these means across days and model latitudes the full calculation of the temperature gradient is in appendix a of aagaard et al 2018 and in the supporting information the southernmost breeding latitude is set at model latitude 50 the breeding ground and wintering ground centroids are fixed at 418 km from the southernmost breeding latitude at model latitudes 63 and 37 respectively the northern limit of migration in the model is driven by temperature and lies south of the curve over date and latitude below which net energetics exceed 0 this curve is termed the migration wave front migratory periods are defined as dates where the migration wavefront is between breeding ground centroid and wintering ground centroid latitudes aagaard et al 2018 based on this approach birds will only travel as far south as needed to maintain positive energetics the migration timing portion of the model does not model movement between locations only the most probable location for a bird on a given day assuming that a bird will remain as far north as possible while still maintaining positive energetics the migration wave front is calculated on a daily basis but it does not necessarily represent the location or movement pattern of a bird only the northern limit of where a bird would be expected on that day a bird could remain stationary at a latitude on stopover so long as it is south of the migration wave front in a telemetry study of spring migrating mallards the most frequently observed migration pattern was two migratory flights with a multiday stopover in between but non stop single day flights of up to 2 170 km were also recorded by the same study krementz et al 2011 this maximum observed flight distance spans most of the latitudinal extent of the model 2 478 km and exceeds the latitudinal distance from the southern extent of the model to the breeding centroid 1 966 km making a non stop migration plausible for a bird with sufficient energy reserves 2 2 modeling the effects of oiling 2 2 1 oiling and body condition factors oiled birds vary in the amount of oil covering the feathered surface and body condition at the onset of oiling to account for these sources of variation we modified aspects of the base model following a two way factorial approach the effects of oiling on energetics vary with severity of oiling hartung 1967 mathewson et al 2018 to model this variation we used oiling class as one factor with four levels unoiled trace light and moderate these classes correspond to 0 5 6 20 and 21 40 of feather area covered by oil deepwater horizon nrda trustees 2016 after the particularly well documented deepwater horizon oil spill dwh a relatively large number of surviving trace oiled birds were observed fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 a few months after dwh observations of lightly oiled birds were rare and there was a near absence of surviving moderately oiled birds fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 despite the rarity of light and moderate oiling classes after this particular spill we still chose to model these oiling classes for two reasons 1 lightly and moderately birds have been observed surviving encounters with different petroleum sources and self cleaning both in the wild camphuysen 2011 and in laboratory settings burger and tsipoura 1998 hartung 1967 maggini et al 2017 and 2 to provide comparisons to the more commonly observed trace oiling class we excluded heavily oiled birds 40 because almost all heavily oiled birds suffer acute mortality from spills and thus are not represented in surviving populations fallon et al 2018 helm et al 2015 paruk et al 2019 for the second factor initial body condition class we used a factor with three levels poor good and excellent body condition was chosen as a factor to encompass some of the population level variation in the amount of stored body fat because starvation in birds involves a nearly complete depletion of body fat jenni eiermann and schifferli 1989 variation in initial fat stores could affect starvation rates each initial body condition class used had different mean body masses and body fat percentages derived from the body condition classes of whyte and bolen 1988 to incorporate initial body condition class into the body mass formula of aagaard et al 2018 we calculate temperature and body condition dependent body mass mkg of mallard like ducks as 2 m k g 0 0042 t 1 1791 b where t is temperature of the surrounding environment 0 0042 is a modifier to temperature with units kg c that allows a good body condition bird to have a mass of 1 14 kg during breeding season temperatures and 1 1791 is that mass of a mallard like duck in good body condition at 0 c aagaard et al 2018 b is the intercept adjustment for body mass based on initial body condition class with possible values of 0 17 kg poor body condition mean body mass 1 00 kg 0 0 kg good mean body mass 1 17 kg or 0 10 kg excellent mean body mass 1 27 kg proportion of body mass composed of fat pfat also varied with body condition possible values for pfat were 0 047 poor mean fat mass 0 047 kg 0 130 good mean fat mass 0 152 kg and 0 178 excellent mean fat mass 0 226 kg additional details on how we derived and implemented body masses and body fat percentages for each body condition are in the supporting information we modeled each possible combination of oiling class and body condition resulting in twelve different model parameterizations each representing a single median individual within that oiling class initial body condition class combination 2 2 2 energetic balance calculations for this modeling exercise we targeted oiling induced increased cot we broke the thermoregulatory costs of oiling into two components an upward shift in lct and an increase in the heat loss rate below lct for baseline unoiled birds we wanted to mirror energetic parameters of control group mallards in laboratory oiling studies while still maintaining the predicted migration timing of unoiled ducks in the aagaard et al 2018 model to achieve these goals for unoiled birds and incorporate oiled birds we altered three components of the base model for the baseline unoiled birds lct rate of heat loss below lct i e thermal conductance and fdr these changes to the energetic balance components culminate in a series of equations used to calculate net energetic balance that directly depends on only three variables environmental temperature initial body condition class and oiling class figure 2 we changed lct from a static 20 c to a variable following the allometric equation based on body mass from kendeigh et al 1977 with an additional intercept component to account for oiling expressed as 3 lct 47 17 1000 m k g 0 1809 s 1 382 c where 47 17 is a multiplier with units c g 0 1809 1000 is a conversion factor from kilograms to grams s is an oiling class specific shift in lct of 0 c unoiled 3 c trace 7 c light and 12 c moderate the 1 382 c term is standard error of the estimate of lct and is meant to capture uncertainty in the measurement of lct by making lct dependent on body mass which is itself temperature dependent this change resulted in lct varying with date and latitude according to temperature estimates derived from this equation are commonly used in energetics studies involving ducks in the genus anas dalby et al 2013 klimas et al 2020 taylor et al 2019 thompson and baldassarre 1991 mcewan and koelink 1973 estimate a lct of 12 c from direct measurements on unoiled mallards neither the mass of these mallards nor the uncertainty about this estimate is noted wooley and owen 1977 report a range of directly measured lcts for closely related american black ducks anas rubripes of 8 to 13 c mean mass for these black ducks is 1 03 kg the value or range of possible values in both studies fall within two standard errors of mean lct values for unoiled birds calculated using equation 3 e g table 2 using multiple sources we determined changes in lct due to oiling table 2 we calculated a mean baseline unoiled lct of 13 1 c using the mean body mass of 1 17 kg from aagaard et al 2018 and equation 3 we chose an increase of 12 c for moderately oiled birds mcewan and koelink 1973 report an lct of 25 c for oiled mallards they don t specify a proportion of the feather area oiled but our assessment was that their oiling treatments were most likely to result in moderate oiling given this information we calculated a mean lct shift of 12 c 25 c 13 c for moderately oiled birds we chose a lct increase of 7 c for lightly oiled birds a review of literature failed to identify a mallard specific value for a lct shift in a lightly oiled bird but a study by mathewson et al 2018 on double crested cormorants reports lcts of 10 c 17 c and 22 c for unoiled lightly oiled and moderately oiled birds on land respectively using the observed difference of 3 c for mallards compared to cormorants for unoiled and moderately oiled classes we extrapolated a mean lct for lightly oiled mallards of approximately 20 c 17 c 3 c comparing this estimated mean to unoiled lct we calculated a mean lct shift of 7 c 20 c 13 c for lightly oiled birds we chose an increase of 3 c for trace oiled birds we did not find a published estimate for a shift in lct for trace oiled birds of any species this value is the mean of 0 c unoiled and 7 c lightly oiled rounded down to the nearest integer we rounded down because a median trace oiled bird 2 5 body coverage has less than half the oiling on its body compared to a median lightly oiled bird 12 5 we altered the cot equation to produce a formulation resembling the bicudo et al 2010 presentation of the scholander et al 1950 equation for cot we express this equation as 4 cot 4 184 c k c m k g lct t t l c t 0 l c t t u c t where cot has units kj individual 1 day 1 4 184 is a conversion ratio kcal to kj ckc is a taxon specific and feather condition specific value of thermal conductance with units kcal kg 1 c 1 day 1 mkg is body mass in kilograms and t is environmental temperature uct is upper critical temperature the temperature c above which an individual must expend energy to maintain internal body temperature we do not address temperatures above uct in this model this equation does not include energetic costs from other sources such as basal metabolism mkg is not part of the formula given by bicudo et al 2010 but both hartung 1967 and mcewan and koelink 1973 give thermal conductance for mallards in kcal kg 1 c 1 hartung 1967 and mcewan and koelink 1973 give similar ckc values for unoiled mallards 2 83 and 2 80 kcal kg 1 c 1 respectively to obtain a mean ckc for unoiled mallards we averaged these values and rounded to two decimal places table 2 for oiled birds we drew all ckc values from hartung 1967 for trace oiling we used a mean value of 3 85 kcal kg 1 day 1 c 1 the ckc for mallards exposed to 15 g of fuel oil after four days of recovery from oiling for light oiling we used a mean value of 5 21 kcal kg 1 day 1 c 1 the ckc for mallards exposed to 15 g of fuel oil on the day of oiling for moderate oiling we used a mean value of 6 05 kcal kg 1 day 1 c 1 the ckc for mallards exposed to 50 g of diesel oil on the day of oiling table 2 as noted by aagaard et al 2018 fdr is difficult to estimate precisely in wild birds and field estimates for mallards are lacking aagaard et al 2018 find that 1 8 bmr is the most parsimonious value for fdr with their model parameterization because it reduces starvation risk by sustaining energy reserves at greater than critical levels and compensates for long stopovers by adding fat more rapidly to maintain this optimal energetic balance while using lower thermoregulatory costs calculated from equations 3 and 4 we adjusted fdr to 1 526 bmr so that our migration wavefront curve for an average unoiled duck in good body condition matched that of aagaard et al 2018 2 2 3 accounting for uncertainty to account for uncertainty in the estimates of oiling related energetics parameters we performed 10 000 iterations of the model for each combination of initial body condition class and oiling class 120 000 iterations total randomly altering lct and ckc with each iteration we drew random values for both lct and ckc from oiling class specific normal distributions truncated at 2 99 sd from the mean using the r function rtruncnorm in the truncnorm package mersmann et al 2018 we chose 2 99 sd as our cutoff because we did not want to introduce outliers into our dataset an sd of 3 00 from the mean is a common definition of a statistical outlier in normally distributed data shiffler 1988 and 2 99 sd only excludes 0 3 of the values contained in a non truncated normal distribution in part due to small sample sizes in studies on the effects of oiling on mallards e g hartung 1967 we defined the standard deviation of our simulation sampling distributions as standard errors of means in previous studies thus centering our estimates on the value for a median bird in each discrete initial body condition class and oiling class without accounting for population level variation within classes for lct we used equal standard errors across all oiling classes following equation 3 we assumed equal standard errors across oiling classes because we were unable to find uncertainty estimates for the lct of the oiled mallard like ducks or cormorants used to derive lct means furthermore the standard error term given by kendeigh et al 1977 for lct of non passerines is independent of the lct estimate for ckc we used the mean ckc values defined in 2 2 2 and calculated pooled standard error for the unoiled ckc by pooling variances sample sd 2 and samples size between hartung 1967 and mcewan and koelink 1973 table 2 for oiled ckc values we calculated standard error from sample sd and sample size for each oiling class associated with the means from hartung 1967 detailed in 2 2 2 table 2 2 2 4 model assembly and prediction evaluation our model assembly comprised four main components 1 the energetics base model 2 a migration submodel 3 an increased energetic gain submodel and 4 a starvation submodel figure 3 for each submodel we assumed energetics drove a single behavioral response the energetics base model and migration submodel were derived directly from a modified version of the aagaard et al 2018 model the energetic gain and starvation submodels were created specifically for oiled birds but draw on components of the aagaard et al 2018 model the entire model was implemented in r r core team 2020 the r code used for this modeling effort along with detailed model documentation can be found in the supporting information the energetics base model fed into all submodels figure 3 two key components of the base model were the net energetic balance equation 1 figure 2 and energetically neutral temperature ent the environmental temperature at which e 0 the net energetic balance was used to link the energetics base model to the three submodels figure 2 to calculate ent we solved the series of equations in figure 2 for t e 0 using the optimize function in r package stats r core team 2020 ent is not explicitly addressed in aagaard et al 2018 but during the migration and wintering periods the migration wavefront curve lies along the combination of latitude and date just north of the ent thermocline the migration model submodel was used to test the first prediction that a change in migration patterns would be one possible method for birds to offset the energetic costs of oiling to do this assessment we calculated several parameters from the migration wave fronts described in 2 1 we assumed a bird would transition between wave fronts if its oiling severity changed i e a previously unoiled bird that became lightly oiled would be pushed below the light oiling severity wave front curve we do not explicitly address the timing or duration of oiling in this submodel to determine the potential for a southern shift in wintering range for oiled birds to offset oiling effects we found the minimum wintering latitude for each simulation which we defined as the northernmost latitude with positive energetics e 0 on the coldest i e most energetically demanding day of the model year note that this a conservative approach because wild birds may encounter and survive days where e 0 birds may also travel south of this latitude but an individual minimizing distance to breeding grounds while maintaining positive energetics will travel no further south than the minimum wintering latitude if there were no latitudes with positive energetics on the coldest day we set the minimum wintering latitude to the southernmost extent of the model to estimate the start of spring migration we calculated spring departure date from the wintering centroid as the first day in spring where energetics were positive at model latitude 38 1 model latitude north of the wintering centroid latitude note that to maintain a consistent definition of migration this wintering centroid latitude is fixed at model latitude 37 and does not vary between oiling classes to determine when birds could arrive at breeding grounds we calculated arrival dates to both the southernmost breeding latitude and the breeding centroid latitude as the first day in spring where a simulation s migration wave front passed through those latitudes to determine the likelihood that birds would need to forego or truncate spring migration due to oiling we also calculated the percentage of simulations where spring departure from the wintering centroid and arrival at both focal breeding latitudes would not result in positive net energetics by the last day of the model june 29 the increased energetic gain submodel was used to test the second prediction that an increase in energetic gains through increased foraging could balance the energetic costs of oiling this submodel assumed that oiled birds remained at the ent of an unoiled bird and it estimated the magnitude of the change in fdr needed to obtain additional energy to offset cot at this temperature the energetic gain submodel was a small offshoot of the energetics base model figure 3 it comprised a percent increase to fdr for oiled birds to reach the ent of an unoiled bird for each initial body condition class we calculated the median estimate of ent for unoiled birds as the median across 10 000 simulations we then calculated the multiplier to fdr f for simulations of trace light moderately oiled birds as 5 f bmr cot 1 526 bmr where bmr and cot were calculated using t median ent of an unoiled bird in same body condition following the series of equations in figure 2 the expression 1 526 bmr is unadjusted fdr as defined in section 2 2 2 it is important to note that fdr is a net metric including positive energy gains from food and negative all non bmr and non cot energetic losses components thus percent increase of fdr is not a strict percent increase of foraging rate the true increases to gross energy intake will be higher than those reported here the starvation submodel was used to test the third prediction that oiled birds would starve if forced to follow the same migratory trajectory as unoiled birds and that even altering movement patterns may not be sufficient to prevent starvation for some oiled birds it was also used to test the fourth prediction that birds in lower body condition would be at higher risk of starvation and that starvation would occur more quickly in birds in lower body condition we calculated days until starvation as 6 d s t a r v e 39 700 p f a t m k g e where dstarve is estimated days until starvation and 39 700 is the conversion factor from kg of fat to kj and pfat is the body condition dependent proportion of body mass composed of fat see 2 2 1 mkg is body mass in kilograms e is daily net energetic balance calculated using the initial mass of the bird we simplified the calculation by assuming constant e per the series of equations in figure 2 mkg depends upon environmental temperature and initial body condition class and e depends on environmental temperature oiling class and initial body condition class to make the results more interpretable we made the simplifying assumptions of constant ambient temperature and no long distance flight i e no flight related energy expenditure beyond foraging flights at a stopover or wintering latitude when calculating days until starvation to mimic oiled birds following the same migration trajectory as unoiled birds we calculated days until starvation for oiled birds using the median estimate of ent for an unoiled bird in the good initial body condition class to evaluate the efficacy of southward movement in preventing starvation we focused on simulations predicting negative net energetics at the southernmost model latitude using the mean temperature at this latitude between december 1 and february 28 this movement scenario represents the most extreme case of southward movement in our model meaning that less extreme southward movement would result in even faster starvation evidence suggests that birds may be able to remove oil from their plumage without intervention by humans via self cleaning burger and tsipoura 1998 camphuysen 2011 hartung 1967 maggini et al 2017 among studies documenting self cleaning the longest time period for a bird in a moderate or lower oiling severity class was for a wild moderately oiled lesser black backed gull larus fuscus the time period was 26 days based on this number we use four weeks 28 days as a likely threshold for self cleaning when interpreting our results we present further discussion of self cleaning in 4 3 1 the results associated with the first four predictions were used to test the final overarching prediction of a positive relationship between the severity of negative consequences and oiling severity and that mitigation of negative effects of oiling may be impossible past a certain threshold of oiling severity for each metric associated with our five predictions we calculated three metrics associated with either oiling classes pooled across body conditions 4 groups 30 000 simulations groups or oiling class initial body condition class combinations 12 groups 10 000 simulations group a median 0 025 quantile and 0 975 quantile across simulations the interval between the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles was the 95 interquartile range 95 iqr a 95 iqr was chosen as a realistic representation of uncertainty for each estimate it is comparable to a 95 bayesian credible interval meaning that it represents 95 certainty that a parameter estimate lies within the 95 iqr curran 2005 due to similarity in values between body conditions for most metrics we report pooled values across initial body condition classes within different oiling classes for all predictions not involving starvation starvation predictions relied upon fat energy which varied between body conditions necessitating the use of oiling class initial body condition class combinations for these metrics 2 2 5 model and data visualization flowcharts were created using a combination of microsoft powerpoint and microsoft visio we created all other figures with r packages ggplot2 ggnewscale ggpubr and viridis campitelli 2020 garnier 2018 kassambara 2020 r core team 2020 wickham 2016 distributions from simulations were plotted as frequency polygon histograms to plot distributions with long right tails we chose a value slightly larger than the 0 975 quantile converted all larger values to that value displayed the resulting compressed distribution and noted the compression in the x axis ticks as chosen value to visualize migration wavefront curves predicted latitudes median and 95 iqr were plotted on a daily basis across a model year for ease of interpretation latitudes were displayed in kilometers from breeding centroid using the conversion factor of 1 model latitude 32 187 km to visualize changes in temperature over latitude and date we included a temperature raster as the background of the migration wavefront plot 3 results 3 1 energetically neutral temperature energetically neutral temperatures reported in c as median 95 iqr for different oiling classes were as follows unoiled 4 9 7 6 2 2 trace 2 9 0 0 5 7 light 10 3 7 6 13 1 moderate 16 7 14 1 19 4 relative to an unoiled bird median estimates of ent increased by approximately 8 c 15 c and 22 c for trace light and moderate oiling classes respectively the 95 iqr for the ent of oiled birds was composed of temperatures strictly below freezing whereas the 95 iqrs for all oiling classes trace or higher did not contain any temperatures below freezing 3 2 altered migration patterns assuming that mallard like ducks can respond to oiling by altering migration patterns our simulations displayed an overarching trend of oiled birds moving further south in winter and delaying spring migration the degree of these effects generally differed between oiling classes and the magnitude of the effects increased with increased oiling severity figure 4 we predicted that trace oiled birds would move further south than unoiled birds during the coldest day of the year the difference between the median estimates of minimum wintering latitudes of unoiled and trace oiled birds was approximately 500 km 16 model latitudes across the simulated landscape figure 4 we predicted that lightly oiled and moderately oiled birds would travel to the southernmost model latitude on the coldest day of the year further south than unoiled and trace oiled birds figure 4 the migration wavefront curve for the moderate oiling class flatlines at the southernmost model latitude between november and april this flatlining indicates birds in the migration alteration scenario would have moved to warmer latitudes south of the current model extent if geographically energetically and behaviorally possible median estimates of spring departure dates from the wintering centroid became at least one month later per increase in oiling class and the median departure date for each oiling class was different from all others figure 5 estimates of spring departure date were relatively uncertain with 95 iqr widths ranging from 20 days moderate oiling to 50 days unoiled approximately 9 6 of simulations of unoiled birds predicted that an unoiled bird would stay north of the wintering centroid on all model dates these simulations did not have a spring departure date because they did not complete migration to the prescribed wintering centroid latitude all simulations of trace and light oiling classes had the migration wavefront pass south of the wintering centroid during fall migration and return to latitudes north of the wintering centroid during spring migration approximately 31 0 of simulations of moderately oiled birds predicted that a moderately oiled bird would stay at or below the wintering centroid through june 29 the last day of the model similar to spring departure arrival at both the southernmost breeding latitude and breeding centroid latitude were delayed by approximately one month per increase in oiling class for unoiled trace and light classes and these classes were different from each other within latitudes figure 5 uncertainty about estimates decreased slightly as latitude moved northward figure 5 all simulations for both unoiled and trace oiled birds predicted arrival at both targeted breeding latitudes for the light oiling class 0 1 and 21 1 of simulations predicted a lightly oiled bird would remain south of the southernmost breeding latitude and the breeding centroid latitude respectively through june 29 the majority of simulations for a moderately oiled bird 94 1 predicted that a bird in this class would remain south of the southernmost breeding latitude through june 29 and the remaining simulations for this predicted arrival at this latitude in late june figure 5 all simulations predicted that a moderately oiled bird would remain south of the breeding centroid latitude 3 3 energetic gain increases we predicted median percent increases to fdr of 20 3 trace 53 9 light and 88 6 moderate to maintain neutral energetics at the median estimate of energetically neutral temperature of an unoiled bird fdr multipliers differed between oiling classes figure 6 3 4 starvation timeframes the median energetically neutral temperature of an unoiled bird used for starvation calculations was 4 9 c and the mean winter temperature at the southernmost model latitude was 10 8 c all simulations for trace light and moderate oiling classes predicted that starvation was possible within a finite number of days at 4 9 c table 3 starvation within a finite number of days at 10 8 c was not predicted in any simulations for the trace oiling class for the light oiling class results were similar across body conditions 37 8 poor 37 9 good and 38 3 excellent of simulations predicted possible starvation within a finite number of days at 10 8 c across all body condition classes for lightly oiled birds at this temperature the 95 iqrs excluded values within the self cleaning period 28 days table 3 all starvation simulations for the moderate oiling class predicted possible starvation within a finite number of days at 10 8 c as a general trend days until starvation decreased with declining body condition and increasing oiling severity for oiled birds table 3 days until starvation were also usually lower at 4 9 c than 10 8 c across oiling initial body condition class combinations there were a few exceptions associated with the moderate oiling class for the 4 9 c simulations starvation timeframes for trace oiled birds in good and excellent body conditions were the only oiling initial body condition class combinations with 95 iqrs excluding values of 28 days table 3 trace oiled birds in good and excellent body condition were also the only oiled birds at 4 9 c to have starvation timeframe estimates with 95 iqrs excluding values of 28 days for the 10 8 c simulations the starvation timeframe for a moderately oiled bird in poor body condition was the only combination of oiling class and initial body condition class at 10 8 c to have a 95 iqr that was entirely 28 days table 3 the only other combination at 10 8 c to have starvation timeframe estimates with a 95 iqrs containing values of 28 days was a moderately oiled bird in good body condition but the median for this combination 34 days was more than 28 days table 3 4 discussion we provided a first principles evaluation of potential behavioral responses by waterfowl to oiling and estimated timeframes between the onset of oiling and starvation we demonstrated the potential for less severely oiled birds to offset the energetic effects of oiling by migrating further south and the possibility of delayed or truncated migration as a strategy to manage the energetic effects of oiling we also showed the necessity of significantly increasing fuel deposition rate to offset the energetic costs of oiling if birds do not or cannot seek warmer temperatures starvation was a consistent endpoint across all oiling classes at colder temperatures moderately oiled birds may even starve at relatively warm temperatures the necessary magnitude of behavioral response to oiling consistently increased with increased oiling and the threat of starvation was generally greater at lower body conditions increased oiling severities and lower temperatures 4 1 potential effects of oiling on wintering waterbirds wild mallards can withstand periods of subfreezing temperatures in the wild without loss of body condition boos et al 2007 whyte and bolen 1984 these field observations support our model prediction of an energetically neutral temperature below freezing for unoiled birds when oiled however we predicted energetically neutral temperatures at or above freezing for all oiling classes for mallard like ducks therefore even trace oiling has the potential to reduce the resilience of birds to subfreezing temperatures our predicted response to oiling was movement further south but it is unknown if oiled waterfowl have the behavioral or physical capacity to move further south in response to an abrupt change in their condition such as oiling if a poor condition mallard like duck were to become lightly or moderately oiled in subfreezing temperatures our model predicted starvation within one week the combination of generally low body condition in winter and cold temperatures are thought to be contributing factors to mass mortality in winter oil spills clark 1984 this hypothesis is supported by our model due to the negative effects of oiling on thermoregulation the energetically neutral temperatures predicted by our model indicate that oiled mallard like ducks attempting to withstand subfreezing temperatures would decrease in body condition in the best case scenario this loss in body condition would be sublethal in the worst case scenario an oiled bird would starve at a rapid rate 4 2 behavioral responses to oiling feasibility and consequences 4 2 1 altered migration and reproductive consequences for a bird to use changes in migratory patterns to cope with the energetic consequences of oiling these altered migration pathways must be energetically and behaviorally possible unoiled mallards ranging in total mass from 0 82 to 1 31 kg spend 0 066 to 0 100 kg of fat on a 1 000 km flight whyte and bolen 1988 this distance approximates a flight from the wintering centroid to the southernmost model latitude to the wintering centroid 1 127 km this flight would be energetically impossible for a poor body condition bird with 0 047 kg of fat stores but possible for good or excellent body condition birds with 0 152 or 0 226 kg of fat stores respectively without movement we predicted good and excellent body condition birds wintering at a temperature of 4 9 c that become lightly or moderately oiled would have median time to starvation of 9 to 21 days due to thermoregulatory cost of oiling this time frame indicated that southward movement to escape cold temperatures may be energetically favorable however oiling may increase the cost of flight as it does in western sandpipers calidris mauri maggini et al 2017 and homing pigeons columbia livia perez et al 2017 direct studies of migrating oiled birds have not yet been conducted meaning that it is unknown if these oiled birds have the behavior flexibility to travel further south than their normal wintering range or otherwise alter their migration trajectory other authors have predicted delayed or arrested migration resulting from oiling in waterbirds due to reduced ability to accumulate or maintain sufficient fuel stores dorr et al 2020 henkel et al 2012 maggini et al 2017 we present another related mechanism for oiling induced migration alteration increased cot at cooler northern destinations may dissuade oiled bird departures from areas where they can maintain neutral or positive net energetics compared to unoiled birds our simulations predicted a spring migration delay of about one month for trace oiled birds a delay of about two months for lightly oiled birds and arrested migration below even the southernmost breeding latitudes for moderately oiled birds in addition to potential migration delays caused by difficulty refueling and thermoregulatory costs there may be less food available at stopovers due to consumption by fall migrants decomposition and spring migrants that arrived earlier brasher et al 2007 straub et al 2012 these combined factors challenging oiled birds attempting migration could delay arrival beyond our simulations predictions and or more readily cause starvation due to the breadth of reproductive strategies in birds ricklefs 1977 we focus our discussion of the effects of migration delays on reproduction on our model organism the mallard and related dabbling duck species dabbling ducks including mallards have low annual survivorship krementz et al 1989 therefore effects on a single breeding season may substantially influence an individual duck s lifetime reproductive output if ducks delay migration to minimize energetic loss from oiling they could experience decreased reproductive success mallards initiating nests later have lower clutch sizes and are less likely to renest if their nest fails arnold et al 2010 instead of delaying breeding oiled mallards may be able to breed at more southern warmer latitudes reproductive success in mallards and other ducks varies with geographic location though there are no clear cut latitudinal patterns devries et al 2008 greenwood et al 1995 in lieu of delaying migration and reproduction oiled mallards may attempt to follow the normal schedule of an unoiled mallard however the consequence of this action would be a decrease in body condition due to increased energetic costs from oiling lower body condition is linked to decreased reproductive success devries et al 2008 no matter their behavioral approach even trace oiled female mallards are likely to have their reproductive capacity negatively affected by the energetic consequences of oiling if they become oiled while migrating to the breeding grounds in spring 4 2 2 increased energetic gains an increase in energetic gains requires at least three components a behavioral capacity to increase food consumption a physical capability to digest additional food and an ability to find additional food if faced with hard to digest foods such as alfalfa or a combination of oil tainted food and cold stress mallards held in captivity and fed ad libitum can consume up to 70 more food compared to control birds to maintain body weight holmes et al 1978 miller 1975 these findings indicate that mallards can alter their behavior to increase food consumption and that they are physically capable of processing that food assuming the necessary increase in the food consumption rate is not substantially larger than the necessary increase in fdr this increase could cover the 20 3 and 53 9 increases to fdr we predicted respectively for trace and light oiling classes however the 88 6 fdr increase for moderately oiled mallards to maintain the same energetically neutral temperature as an unoiled bird may be beyond the behavioral or physical capabilities of moderately oiled birds though it may be possible for mallards to increase their food consumption in captivity in the wild spring migrating ducks may face limited food resources due to previous consumption by fall migrating birds and decomposition brasher et al 2007 straub et al 2012 overall an increase in fdr may be biologically possible for oiled mallards but finding that food in the wild may be difficult 4 3 oiling and starvation 4 3 1 self cleaning in oiled birds studies across waterbird taxa document self cleaning in oiled birds burger and tsipoura 1998 camphuysen 2011 hartung 1967 maggini et al 2017 the timeframe of self cleaning varies based on the type of oil extent of oiling and bird species in captivity lightly oiled mallards can remove fuel oil a relatively fluid and non sticky type of oil from their plumage within seven days hartung 1967 when lightly oiled with more viscous weathered crude oils anitra and mc 252 sandpipers calidris spp in captivity can remove most or all of the oil from their plumage within fourteen days burger and tsipoura 1998 maggini et al 2017 when oiled offshore by an unknown type of oil trace oiled wild lesser black backed gulls can remove all visible oil within 13 to 15 days while moderately oiled gulls can remove all visible oil within 20 to 26 days camphuysen 2011 taken together these data suggest a timeframe of one to four weeks as the amount of time aquatic birds need to eliminate visible traces of oil from their plumage at ambient temperatures of 4 9 c we predicted starvation for the light oiling poor initial body condition class combination and all moderate oiling class body condition combinations within about two weeks or less therefore both lightly oiled birds in poor body condition and moderately oiled birds in any body condition wintering in colder climates are very likely to die from starvation unless they compensate for the additional energetic costs lightly oiled birds in good and excellent initial body condition classes and trace oiled birds in the poor initial body condition class all had predicted recovery estimates in the realm of two to four weeks meaning these class combinations were potentially vulnerable to starvation before recovering times to starvation in modeled trace oiled birds at 4 9 c did not fall within the four week window at good and excellent body conditions at 4 9 c starvation was expected across poorer body conditions for light oiling and was expected at all body conditions for moderate oiling at a warmer temperature of 10 8 c the only groups we simulated that were at risk of starvation in four weeks or fewer were the moderately oiled birds in poor or good body condition more studies of self cleaning rates including various oil types e g crude diluted bitumen various oiling classes and comparisons within the same bird species are needed to better inform the length of time birds will suffer thermoregulatory consequences of external oiling depending on the timing of an oiling event a bird may become oiled while molting feathers another possible mechanism for removing oil from plumage in most bird species insulative feathers are molted once annually during the prebasic molt because both molt and migration have high energetic cost prebasic molt in migratory bird species generally occurs before or after autumn migration dawson 2015 duration of molt also tends to increase with body size across species dawson 2015 in mallards a relatively large bird species prebasic molt occurs after fall migration generally over the course of 6 to 7 weeks between november and march heitmeyer 1987 mallards also halt prebasic molt if their diet is deficient in either calories or protein richardson and kaminski 1992 given the gradual nature of prebasic molt in mallard sized birds 6 to 7 weeks compared to a relatively short self cleaning time frame of 1 to 4 weeks molt is unlikely to be an efficient alternative to active self cleaning additionally if oiling causes impaired foraging or diverts energy toward thermoregulation molt may cease entirely 4 3 2 comparison to real world oil spills our model results regarding starvation resemble the mortality patterns observed in real world oil spills though mortality through starvation predicted by our model likely overestimates the amount of time needed for some bird species to starve our finding of likely starvation across many oiling class initial body condition class combinations at 4 9 c matches the observation that oiling related avian mortality events occur more frequently at upper latitudes and during winter bourne and bibby 1975 clark 1984 starvation appears to be a leading cause of death in such spills balseiro et al 2005 starvation of birds in cold water systems is even more likely than predicted by our model due to additional factors first some birds will become heavily oiled in such a spill leading to greater energetic costs and faster starvation or death from other causes balseiro et al 2005 hartung 1967 second avian victims of oil spills at upper latitudes largely comprise diving birds such as alcids and sea ducks balseiro et al 2005 piatt et al 1990 which due to spending much of their time underwater have higher thermoregulatory costs than the modeled dabbling ducks in our study fort et al 2009 mckinney and mcwilliams 2005 therefore some species such as diving ducks are likely to suffer greater thermoregulatory consequences from oiling and starve more quickly jenssen 1994 because we incorporated temperatures approximating the gulf coast of the united states at the southernmost model latitude our model results for this latitude can be compared to the deepwater horizon dwh oil spill our model predicted that trace oiled birds could remain north of southernmost model latitude year round without encountering negative energetics a model result which corresponds with the relatively large number of surviving trace oiled birds observed after the dwh oil spill fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 however surviving lightly oiled birds were rarely observed and surviving moderately oiled birds were virtually absent within a few months after the oil well was capped fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 this difference between our model and field observations suggests one or more of the following possibilities bird species common in the northern gulf of mexico may experience more extreme heat loss than mallards when oiled oiling may change birds ability to obtain food and convert it to energy or birds may die of factors other than starvation i e from increased predation or toxicological effects of exposure warming winter and spring temperatures resulting from changing climate may seem to benefit oiled birds by reducing thermoregulatory costs north american duck species and potentially other aquatic bird species globally have shifted their wintering ranges north over the last several decades a shift correlated with increasing temperatures meehan et al 2021 and aagaard et al 2018 predicted earlier spring migration in mallard like ducks with warming temperatures however ducks and potentially other taxa may continue to experience similar wintering temperatures while still being exposed to oiling hazards and thus experience similar risks of death from oiling at shifted wintering locations a spatially explicit model of avian migration e g lonsdorf et al 2016 would be needed to better address this possibility given the potential for wintering range compression due to climate change meehan et al 2021 and for the potential of landscape scale forage depletion by waterfowl baveco et al 2011 winter body condition could decline due to limited food resources this decline would make birds more susceptible to oiling even at warmer temperatures 4 4 model assumptions and limitations our model maintains most of the assumptions of the aagaard et al 2018 model one of the most influential assumptions inherited from the base model is a constant fuel deposition rate throughout the annual cycle we applied this assumption to both migration and starvation calculations and extended it to include multiple oiling classes and initial body condition classes data on fuel deposition and foraging rates with respect to oiling are sparse and conflicting burger 1997 holmes et al 1978 maggini et al 2017 mathewson et al 2018 therefore we assumed constant fuel deposition between oiling classes for lack of consistent data to inform otherwise we address potential increases to fuel deposition rate based on oiling classes as one of our model components our model exclusively deals with one energetic consequence of oiling and one source of mortality thermoregulatory effects resulting from oiled feathers and starvation respectively in addition to affecting thermoregulation oiling can cause other energetic effects on birds ingestion can lead to increased metabolic costs holmes et al 1978 however in situ ingestion rates of oil after a spill are to the best of our knowledge unknown oiling of feathers can also increase the cost of flight this effect has only recently been studied directly in the western sandpiper a relatively small 29 g long distance migrant maggini et al 2017 and the homing pigeon a mid sized 450 g domestic model organism perez et al 2017 additional studies are needed to measure the effects of oiling on flight efficiency in other taxa including waterfowl the energetic effects of oiling on migratory flight are likely to be most consequential in long distance migrants that require large increases in fuel stores to complete migration e g shorebirds with intercontinental migrations henkel et al 2012 maggini et al 2017 in terms of mortality oiling can cause death from factors beyond starvation such factors include lipid pneumonia body system failures from toxic effects and dehydration balseiro et al 2005 cunningham et al 2017 dean and bursian 2017 king et al 2021 independent of both oiling and direct mortality from starvation mallards and potentially other bird species have lower survivorship when in lower body condition bergan and smith 1993 davis et al 2011 yetter et al 2018 therefore oiling could increase mortality risk by decreasing body condition without causing complete starvation because of the additional energetic and toxic effects of oiling future modeling efforts designed to fully capture the effects of oiling on bird populations should incorporate these effects in addition to the thermoregulatory effects demonstrated by our present model in addition to only addressing single components of oiling effects on energetics and mortality our model relies on other simplifications we only addressed degree of oiling and body condition in twelve discrete combinations in reality both elements exist on continuous scales therefore despite our introduction of variability to account for uncertainty our estimates only represent the values for a single hypothetical median individual within an oiling class initial body condition class combination we would expect greater variability within a population of birds than is represented within our model the starvation equation we chose was relatively simple it involved a single constant temperature and did not account for the slight metabolic changes associated with body mass loss over time however given the simulated nature of the temperature landscape across latitudes and time originally developed by aagaard et al 2018 and the arbitrary nature of choosing appropriate start dates and locations from which to calculate starvation we opted for a simple calculation to facilitate ease of interpretation we also treated space one dimensionally assuming a linear relationship between latitude and environmental temperature and by proxy a linear relationship between latitude and thermoregulatory cost given environmental temperature is below a bird s lct dorr et al 2020 found similar linear or nearly linear relationships between latitude and thermoregulatory cost when averaging across latitudes but microclimates across each latitude differed we did not account for this source of variation in our current modeling framework for lower critical temperature lct we did not find mallard specific values for lct increases for trace or light oiling classes and estimated these values with supplementation of data from double crested cormorants we also assumed that standard errors for lct were constant between oiling classes while our inclusion of uncertainty about estimates does help mitigate this reliance on our professional judgement more laboratory research would be needed to determine the effects of oiling on this component of thermoregulation in dabbling ducks lastly our model uses a simulated temperature gradient and it is not spatially explicit the consequence of this generality is that our model predictions do not apply directly to real world oil spill locations but the overall patterns and proportional effects mirror reality further development of the approach incorporation into more realistic models and more study on the behavior of wild oiled birds could broaden the scope of inference for this model allowing greater confidence in statements about potential changes in migration behavior in oiled birds 4 5 potential model applications despite the generalized nature of our model the starvation portion could be used to inform rough time frames for responders aiming to rehabilitate oiled birds for a spill predicted to moderately oil many birds during colder weather in an area where birds are generally in poor body condition responders are only likely to have a few days to capture oiled birds for rehabilitation if most birds are only trace or lightly oiled during warmer weather birds may be able to recover on their own or with the help of supplemental food however more research is needed on the ability of wild oiled birds to consume supplemental food before this strategy is employed in our opinion the strongest application of this model would be as a module within a spatially explicit migration model incorporating temperatures based on climate data and real world locations of oil spills with endpoints of mortality and reproductive loss such a model could assist in predicting risk to populations for ecological risk assessment and it could be used to estimate additional population scale injury in the context of natural resource damage assessments the value of models in determining injury to avian populations in the context of oil spills was well demonstrated by the dwh oil spill in 2010 the injury assessments for the dwh oil spill s impact on bird populations applied multiple models including a shoreline deposition model offshore exposure model and a live oiled bird model these models are summarized by the deepwater horizon nrda trustees 2016 several components could be used to enhance this model to allow for predictions of mortality and reproductive loss in a spatially explicit context complementing existing models that assess population scale risk and injury for birds in the wake of oil spills the models of both lonsdorf et al 2016 and dorr et al 2020 contain components that could be combined with the current model to map findings to real world locations though we currently only use three initial body condition classes additional initial body condition classes could be incorporated and birds could be allowed to transition between those classes based on net energetic balances other causes of mortality could also be incorporated to account for the general phenomenon of declining survivorship with declining body condition additional energetic effects of oiling as discussed in 4 4 could also be incorporated as could morbidity and mortality from toxicological effects to balance model simplicity with model realism sensitivity analyses applied to each of these effects and exclusion of minimally influential effects would be valuable as model complexity increases additionally this effort would likely best be initially directed at trace oiled birds given the disruptions to migration predicted by our model and their higher observed survivorship compared to more heavily oiled birds in the aftermath of dwh fallon et al 2018 henkel et al 2014 paruk et al 2019 an extended version of this model could be generalized to additional species given sufficient data on thermal conductance of a bird s feathers lct and the effects of oiling on cot this model has the potential to be especially useful for waterbird species whose annual migration path varies between years due to temperature taxa whose migration correlates strongly with annual variations in temperature suggesting a temperature modulated and energetics based migration pattern include a variety of ducks lehikoinen et al 2013 meehan et al 2021 herring gulls larus argentatus hebert 1998 and some shorebird species charadrii that winter in temperate areas austin and rehfisch 2005 this model could still be valuable for nonmigratory species or species whose migration is not primarily mediated by temperature as the fuel deposition rate and starvation components apply to any bird species to apply this model to other less studied species thermoregulatory energetics can be modeled using museum specimen measurements and known or estimated thermal properties of a species feathers reducing or eliminating the need for laboratory studies on live birds dorr et al 2020 fort et al 2009 mckinney and mcwilliams 2005 oiling can also be simulated in these models by increasing thermal conductance of oiled feathers dorr et al 2020 by extending this model to be spatially explicit population scale inclusive of other effects of oiling on reproduction and mortality and generalized to multiple species it could allow for improved estimates of mortality and reproductive loss in the wake of oil spills this extended model could serve as a powerful management tool informing sublethal oiling associated additional deaths and decreased reproductive output not easily observed once a bird leaves the site of an oil spill better estimates of these effects can allow for more accurate ecological risk assessment predictions for citing of refineries pipelines and hubs for petroleum transportation activities as well as throughout the routes taken on land and sea by oil transporting carriers when spills occur better understanding and real time predictions of effects on sublethally exposed birds could improve situational awareness and response planning by incident coordinators and allow more accurate estimates of injury for natural resource damage assessments 5 conclusions over the past century oil spills have killed millions of aquatic birds and sublethally injured many others burger 1993 haney et al 2014 munilla et al 2011 piatt et al 1990 using a mallard like dabbling duck as a model organism we used energetics modeling to explore a single oiling related pathway that can lead to death and injury thermoregulatory consequences of the oiling of a bird s feathers as one possible mechanism to offset the thermoregulatory cost of oiling our model predicted either delayed or arrested spring migration in oiled birds this potential of oiling induced migration change could reduce reproductive success by delaying arrival on the breeding grounds increasing energetic gains provided another potential avenue for recouping energy lost through the thermoregulatory cost of oiling but the potential for wild birds to employ this strategy is currently unknown the consequences of oiling increased with increasing oiling severity the costs were especially dire for moderately oiled birds which were likely to forfeit their breeding season or die though our model was general and not spatially explicit it used temperature to emphasize the importance of the timing and location of an oil spill to determine energetic impacts on birds our predictions on the starvation of light and moderate oiling classes in subzero temperatures and the survival of trace oiled birds mirror observed results of past real world oil spills balseiro et al 2005 bourne and bibby 1975 paruk et al 2019 piatt et al 1990 by applying the components of this model to a spatially explicit framework future research could predict deaths and reproductive losses associated with the energetic costs of sublethal oiling in wild populations of birds thus increasing understanding of the population level effects of oil spills on bird life credit authorship contribution statement benjamin m west conceptualization methodology software formal

24323,plant phenology models are important components in process based crop models which are used to assess the impact of climate change on food production for reliable model predictions parameters in phenology models have to be accurately known they are usually estimated by calibrating the model to observations however at regional scales in which different cultivars of a crop species may be grown not accounting for inherent differences in phenological development between cultivars in the model and the presence of model deficits lead to inaccurate parameter estimates to account for inherent differences between cultivars and to identify model deficits we used a bayesian multi level approach to calibrate a phenology model spass to observations of silage maize grown across germany between 2009 and 2017 we evaluated four multi level models of increasing complexity where we accounted for different combinations of ecological weather and year effects as well as the hierarchical classification of cultivars nested within ripening groups of the maize species we compared the calibration quality from this approach to the commonly used pooled approach in which none of these factors are considered the pooled model led to over confident process model parameter estimates and comparatively poor calibration quality the mean value of the unexplained residual error standard deviation reduced from 5 5 bbch phenological development units in the pooled model case bm 0 to 5 3 bbch when eco region and year effects bmm 1 were considered additionally accounting for weather effects bmm 2a resulted in a mean value of 5 2 bbch calibration quality especially improved when the hierarchical classification of cultivars within ripening groups of maize was incorporated including the hierarchical classification with eco region and year effects bmm 2b led to a mean residual error of 4 4 bbch while additionally considering weather effects in the full model case bmm 3 resulted in a value of 4 3 bbch our findings have implications for regional model calibration and data gathering studies since it emphasizes that ripening group and cultivar information is essential furthermore we found that if this information is not available at least weather eco region and year effects should be taken into account accounting for only the eco region and year effects led to parameter compensation of the missing weather effects our results can facilitate model improvement studies since we identified possible model limitations related to temperature effects in the reproductive post flowering phase and to soil moisture we demonstrate that bayesian multi level calibration of a phenology model facilitates the incorporation of hierarchical dependencies and the identification of model limitations our approach can be extended to full crop models at different spatial scales keywords phenology silage maize hierarchical bayes multi level model process based model data availability data and codes used for the study are available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6361647 1 introduction plant phenology plays an important role when assessing the impact of climate change and evaluating crop production menzel et al 2006 siebert and ewert 2012 zhao et al 2013 wittich and liedtke 2015 he et al 2017a wallach et al 2021 it is controlled by environmental variables and determines the timing of plant organ development and the distribution of the products of photosynthesis such as sugars to different parts of the plant thus predictions of phenological development are essential for evaluating crop growth and yield and for supporting field management decisions such as the timing of fertilizer application potgieter et al 2021 these phenology predictions are made possible by using numerical models phenology models are in turn important components of crop models which are used for simulating crop growth and development and yield besides data driven statistical models it is process based models which enable a thorough understanding of the underlying processes for evaluating potential policy interventions and adaptation to climate change lobell and asseng 2017 in these process models phenology is simulated as a parametric function of environmental variables such as temperature and photoperiod parameters of these models have to be determined accurately to ensure reliable predictions since model parameters often cannot be measured directly they need to be estimated by comparing model outputs with observed data using methods such as bayesian inference bayesian calibration provides a framework to quantify different sources of uncertainty which is essential for better predictions with the added value of being able to include prior information makowski et al 2002 to this end bayesian methods have been applied in numerous crop model calibration studies makowski et al 2006 iizumi et al 2009 sexton et al 2016 alderman and stanfill 2017 he et al 2017b gao et al 2020 during the calibration of phenology models cultivar specific parameters are usually estimated gao et al 2020 this is because phenological traits differ markedly not only between species and between ripening or maturity groups of crop species such as maize oluwaranti et al 2015 but also between cultivars within these ripening groups phenological development of a cultivar is also dependent on the environment and reflects genotype environment interactions thus methods such as selecting cultivar observations from contrasting environments for calibration he et al 2017b and using cross validation tests while evaluating environmental responses of the cultivar fukui et al 2015 are suggested for determining these cultivar specific parameters however at regional scales where many cultivars of a particular species are grown together cultivar specific parameters may not be suitable in such calibration studies region specific model parameter estimates are obtained for the crop species iizumi et al 2009 therond et al 2011 angulo et al 2013 soltani et al 2016 but differences between cultivars grown in the region are usually not taken into account the resultant estimates are a compromised solution for all the cultivars grown in different environments represented by the calibration data set furthermore models may not represent the underlying processes accurately commonly environmental interactions are incompletely or poorly understood leading to conceptual uncertainty this is reflected in multiple model formulations to represent the same process kumudini et al 2014 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 consequently models may have structural deficits but the implicit assumption in bayesian inference is that the model is without errors or that all errors are perfectly described hsueh et al 2022 during calibration the estimated parameters may compensate for model limitations wallach 2011 as a consequence even parameters which are meant to be cultivar specific have been found to vary with the environment ceglar et al 2011 thus often loosing their original physiological meaning lamsal et al 2018 ignoring inherent data structures and the presence of model deficits result in inaccurate parameter estimates when data structures such as the hierarchical classification of cultivars nested within ripening groups of a species are ignored the uncertainty in the resultant effective parameters are underestimated furthermore indiscriminate use of large amounts of data to calibrate imperfect models leads to an overconfidence in erroneous parameter estimates motavita et al 2019 which in turn has been shown to result in erroneous model predictions viswanathan et al 2022 thus it is important to account for these data structures and model deficits during parameter estimation therefore we propose a bayesian multi level calibration of a process based plant phenology model to account for inherent data structures and to identify model deficits bayesian multi level modelling bmm has been widely applied in ecological modelling clark 2003 li et al 2015 thomas et al 2017 tian et al 2020 and has more recently been applied to plant models for example patrick et al 2009 applied a hierarchical bayesian approach to estimate parameters of the farquhar photosynthesis model jarqu√≠n et al 2016 used a hierarchical bayesian formulation of a linear bilinear model to investigate genotype environment g e interactions of maize from breeding trials fer et al 2021 applied hierarchical bayes to a dynamic vegetation model in conjunction with a bayesian model emulator senf et al 2017 applied bayesian hierarchical modelling to a satellite based data driven phenology model to account for spatial and temporal variation in phenology qiu et al 2020 developed a bayesian hierarchical space time model to study the impact of climate change and extreme events on phenological development to the best of our knowledge the bmm approach has not been applied to calibrate a process based phenology model on a regional scale by applying the bmm approach we can honour the hierarchical classification of cultivars nested within ripening groups of a crop species thus species ripening group and cultivar specific parameters can be simultaneously estimated van oijen and h√∂glind 2016 we can also account for phenological development that depends on additional environmental factors which are not already captured in the model equations del giudice et al 2013 methods such as cross calibration have been used to determine crop model parameters for representative crop cultivars grown in different agro ecological sub zones xiong et al 2008 but parameter estimates from such an approach would have limited applications when the phenological development of a new cultivar belonging to a different ripening group is to be predicted parameter estimates from the bmm approach can be used for such applications the advantage of bmm lies in its borrowing strength zhang and arhonditsis 2009 where parameter estimates for data limited cultivars can benefit from data rich ones additionally the appropriate depiction of data groups results in a representative quantification of prediction uncertainty gelman 2006a we tested the proposed approach by evaluating four bmm cases of increasing complexity in which we calibrated the spass wang 1997 wang and engel 1998 2000 phenology model to observations of silage maize grown across germany from 2009 to 2017 the spass model has proven to be successful for different crop species gayler et al 2002 priesack et al 2006 biernath et al 2011 including maize and was one of the well performing models in the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip studies bassu et al 2014 durand et al 2018 kimball et al 2019 it works well for cultivar specific crop simulations however crop species simulations suffer when ripening group and cultivar information is not incorporated during calibration a problem that is not unique to the spass model furthermore a previous study viswanathan et al 2022 highlighted possible environment related deficits in the spass phenology model which needed systematic evaluation thus in the four bmm cases we accounted for different combinations of yearly variability environmental effects arising from growth in different ecological regions and weather conditions and the classification of cultivars into ripening groups with these cases we assessed the importance of including cultivar information in regional calibration studies we evaluated the bmm approach by comparing calibration results from the four cases with the commonly used pooled approach where a set of model parameters was estimated for silage maize grown across all environments we also analysed trends between environmental effect parameters and environmental variables to identify possible model deficits the findings of our study are expected to have implications for regional calibration and model improvement studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we used phenology observations of silage maize grown between 2009 and 2017 at locations across germany collected by the german national meteorological service deutsche wetterdienst dwd dwd climate data center cdc 2019 the observers reported the date of the first detected occurrence of maize phenological development stages namely 10 31 53 61 75 83 and 87 on the bbch scale biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt und chemische industrie meier 2018 in the assigned observation area corresponding cultivars and ripening groups were also reported we refer to data sets by the site and year in which silage maize was cultivated that is site year we removed site years for which sowing and harvest dates were not reported and in which the bbch data was not strictly monotonically increasing with time additionally observations that fell outside the range of sowing and harvest dates were discarded we note that not all of the seven above mentioned phenological stages were available in all site years minimum and maximum daily air temperatures were used as inputs to the spass phenology model weather data from the dwd stations were not available at all plant observation sites therefore temperature data were extracted at all sites from the era5 land re analysis gridded data set mu√±oz sabater 2019 this data set has a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and hourly temporal resolution the hourly data were aggregated to daily values we consider the re analysis data to be a better spatial representation than point measurements at the weather stations to assess model limitations related to temperature and precipitation site years were classified into ten weather classes based on average temperature and cumulative precipitation between april and june and between july and september periods during which maize usually undergoes vegetative and reproductive development respectively a k means clustering algorithm was applied to define the weather classes details in appendix a site years were also grouped into nine ecological regions based on the classification provided by the bundesamt f√ºr naturschutz 2017 for computational reasons a subset of 100 site years out of 3004 was randomly selected for calibration where it was ensured that at least one site year was selected from each of the four ripening groups nine ecological regions ten weather classes and nine years the calibration data set consisted of 66 cultivars from the four ripening groups table 1 it was also ensured that the relative proportions of site years from the different ripening groups in the full data set were maintained in the calibration subset early 34 mid early 54 mid late 11 and late 0 4 in the full data set the 100 site years used for calibration contained 604 phenology observations 2 2 phenology model air temperature site latitude sowing and harvest dates are required as inputs to the spass phenology model the model has nine parameters seven of which were estimated during calibration table 2 and the remaining two were fixed at default values the model equations and details are given in appendix b we provide a brief summary below three main phases of development are defined in the model emergence vegetative and reproductive phases emergence is dependent on the sowing depth assumed to be fixed for all the site years at 3 cm and on the temperature above a minimum value emt the development rate during the vegetative and reproductive phases is dependent on the number of physiological development days at optimum temperature pdd1 for vegetative and pdd2 for reproductive and on the temperature response function trf the trf is defined by phase specific minimum optimum and maximum cardinal temperatures tminv toptv and tmaxv respectively for vegetative and tminr toptr and tmaxr respectively for reproductive the spass phenology model as described in wang 1997 was implemented in our study with the following modifications a the photoperiod effect on the vegetative phase was not considered b no soil water limiting effect on germination was assumed and germination occurs instantaneously after sowing and c for numerical reasons the transition between emergence and vegetative phases was defined by a sigmoidal function instead of the original step function the parameters for physiological development days at optimum temperature for the vegetative pdd1 and reproductive phases pdd2 were estimated in the study additionally minimum and optimum temperature for vegetative tminv and toptv where toptv tmaxv dtoptv and reproductive tminr and toptr where toptr tmaxr dtoptr phases as well as the minimum temperature required for emergence emt were estimated however the parameters tmaxv and tmaxr were not estimated the range of average daily temperatures during the growing season at the study site years were between 6 and 31 c this is usually expected to be at or lower than the optimal temperatures for maize a warm weather plant the lack of observations in the supra optimal temperature range would make constraining tmax difficult wang et al 2015 and is expected to incur problems of equifinality to avoid these problems the values of tmaxv and tmaxr were fixed at 44 c we used bayesian inference to determine the posterior probability of the model parameters let œï d represent the given phenology observation on day d the phenology œï d t Œ∏ at day d simulated by the spass model with a parameter vector Œ∏ is dependent on air temperatures t from

one pooled and four multi level model cases as seen in fig 1 in terms of their likelihood functions in the following sections the prior distributions for all the estimated parameters are provided in table 2 2 3 1 bm 0 pooled model the pooled model is the most commonly used calibration setup for regional scale studies where a common parameter set is estimated for all cultivars grown in different

squared standard deviation respectively while the off diagonal elements are zero 2 3 2 bmm 1 fixed eco region effects and random year effects we expect that the different eco regions and years in which silage maize was grown in germany influence phenology we analysed this effect with the bmm 1 model fig 1b where we accounted for fixed effects due to the different eco regions and random effects arising from variability between the years if the different eco regions and years are represented by e e and y y respectively then 3 p œÜ Œ∏ t e e y y d d n œï d Œ∏ s p t Œ≥ e œÑ y œÉ 2 where

adequately captured in the model also differences in weather conditions could result in a perceived variability between eco regions and between years in the bmm 2a model fig 1c we additionally accounted for the effects due to the different weather classes if the different weather classes are represented by w w and parameter Œ¥ w represents the effects by weather class then 4 p œÜ Œ∏ t w w e

results we first provide results from the classification of 3004 site years into environmental classes section 3 1 we then describe the calibration quality of the spass model in the different bayesian model cases section 3 2 followed by an analysis of the posterior distributions of the spass model parameters section 3 3 the environmental effects section 3 4 and residual uncertainty section 3 5 all figures were made using the ggplot2 wickham 2016 package in r we note here again that out of the 3004 site years 100 were used for calibration 3 1 classification of site years into environmental classes all site years were classified into ten weather classes fig 2 the weather classes were based on the average temperatures and cumulative precipitation between april and june and between july and september silage maize cultivated across germany generally undergoes vegetative development from april to june and reproductive development from july to september phenological development during the vegetative and reproductive phases are dependent on temperature the relationship between temperature and phenological development is usually represented by equations in phenological models including spass however existing model equations may not accurately capture this temperature response additionally the influence of factors like precipitation that are known to influence phenology in some plant species moore and lauenroth 2017 could also have either a direct influence on maize phenology or an indirect effect by influencing temperatures within the crop canopy however these effects are not represented in the spass phenology model thus site years were classified into the weather classes to assess model limitations related to temperature and precipitation all site years were also classified into nine ecological regions fig 3 eco region 0 includes the alpine foreland and foothills characterized by flysch and molasse deposits as well as glacial moraines this eco region has experienced on average higher rainfall average cumulative precipitation of 700 mm based on site years in the full data set than the other eco regions during the maize growing season april september between 2009 and 2017 eco region 1 comprises the swabian and franconian alb and the black forest average elevation 400 m a s l it is marked by sedimentary deposits and the development of loess and loamy soils the rhine river plain is in eco region 2 eco regions 3 and 4 consist of the middle highlands average elevation of 300 400 m a s l of the thuringian forest and harz mountains the region is characterized by sedimentary deposits with some metamorphic rocks and the development of loess loam the remaining eco regions consist of the northern lowlands typified by moraine deposits eco region 7 includes the mecklenburg lake district and consists of young moraine deposits eco regions 6 and 8 largely consist of old moraine deposits eco region 8 has been on average hotter and drier average daily temperature of 15 16 c and average cumulative precipitation of 500 mm than the other eco regions during the growing season please refer to figs s2 2 1 and s2 2 2 in supplement s2 2 appendix e for details note that since the 100 site years used for calibration were randomly sampled the calibration data set contained only a few site years from ecological regions in the northeastern part of germany 3 2 calibration quality as an example we compare observed and simulated phenology for silage maize grown at a site in the state of bavaria in 2009 from the pooled model case bm 0 and the full model case bmm 3 fig 4 the blue bands show the 5 95th percentile of simulated phenology that account for uncertainty from model parameters Œ∏ s p for bm 0 in fig 4a and Œ∏ s p r c for bmm 3 in fig 4b while the red bands additionally account for environmental effects Œ¥ w Œ≥ e œÑ y in fig 4b the grey bands show the 5 95th percentile of simulated phenology that additionally account for the unresolved residual error œÉ there is a reduction in bias in bmm 3 as compared to bm 0 furthermore there is an overall reduction in unresolved residual error in bmm 3 with the model parameters and environmental effects accounting for a large share of the error variance we also note that the blue bands in fig 4a have collapsed around the mean simulated phenology the model performance represented by the mean rmse and bias for the 100 calibration site years fig 5 improved with model complexity from the pooled model to the full model bm 0 bmm 1 bmm 2a bmm 2b bmm 3 this is evident from the reduction in mean rmse and shrinkage of the mean bias towards zero in fig 6 the model performance from the five cases were analysed by ripening group and weather class across the plots the two cases bmm 2b and bmm 3 that account for the ripening group cultivar hierarchy generally exhibit a lower bias and rmse as compared to the others across the four ripening groups fig 6a the mean bias is closer to zero with increasing model complexity as seen in fig 5 a decrease in mean bias and rmse occurs on the inclusion of cultivar ripening group information through the hierarchy in bmm 2b and bmm 3 the single site year from the late ripening cultivar included in calibration also exhibits a clear improvement in rmse and bias while the inclusion of weather effects fig 6b in the model cases bmm 2a and bmm 3 result in smaller mean rmse and bias only in some weather classes the inclusion of cultivar ripening group hierarchy results in an improvement in most classes although the inclusion of eco regions and year effects bmm 1 to bmm 3 fig c 1 in the appendix c improves rmse and bias in some eco regions and years a clear trend across all the classes cannot be identified 3 3 phenology model parameters the marginal posterior distributions of the spass model parameters were analysed for the full model bmm 3 to investigate differences between cultivar ripening group and maize species parameter estimates after the environmental effects are taken into account fig 7 shows the posterior parameter distribution by species Œ∏ s p ripening groups Œ∏ s p r Œ∏ s p Œ¥ Œ∏ r and cultivars Œ∏ s p r c Œ∏ s p Œ¥ Œ∏ r Œ¥ Œ∏ r c for two parameters tminv and pdd1 parameter tminv shows low variability between cultivars of the same ripening group while pdd1 shows high variability a similar visual inspection of other parameters showed that they could be classified into the categories of low tminv tminr toptr and high pdd1 pdd2 toptv emt between cultivar variability figs d 1 and d 2 in appendix d 3 4 environmental effects the prior and posterior parameter distributions of the weather effects Œ¥ w and eco region effects Œ≥ e were analysed with respect to their corresponding classes in the four multi level model cases fig 8 negative effects indicate an overestimation while positive effects indicate underestimation of phenology by the spass model and the remaining effects that were considered in the particular bmm case this over underestimation is corrected by the corresponding environmental effect parameter to improve the model s fit to the data in that bmm case the posterior parameter distributions deviate from the prior which is normally distributed around zero and are narrower than the prior the eco region 2 fig 8a exhibits a negative effect in all model cases eco regions 0 and 1 exhibit similar effects and so do eco regions 3 and 4 in all model cases the parameter distributions of the weather effects fig 8b are only shown for bmm 2a and bmm 3 since these effects are taken into account only in these two cases weather classes 6 and 10 have similar posterior parameter distributions for weather effects these classes have different average cumulative precipitation but similar average temperatures supplement s2 3 appendix e this indicates that temperatures have a larger influence than precipitation on these weather effects to identify possible model deficits we analysed trends between the median value of the weather effects parameters and mean of the average daily temperature and cumulative precipitation of the weather classes from april to june and july to september for the cases bmm 2a and bmm 3 a high correlation coefficient is seen between the median weather effect per class and the mean of the average daily temperature from july to september fig 9 the correlation coefficient reduces from 0 87 in bmm 2a to 0 64 in the full model bmm 3 where the cultivar ripening group hierarchy is considered this is also accompanied by a widening in confidence intervals of the linear regression line the eco region effect Œ≥ e was included in all the bayesian multi level model cases fig 10 shows a comparison between the median eco regions effects for the four multi level models a negative eco region effect indicates an overestimation of phenology by the spass model and the other effects that were accounted for in the particular bmm case this overestimation was corrected by the eco region effect parameter conversely a positive eco region effect indicates an underestimation of phenology by the spass model and the other effects eco regions 6 and 8 have similar median eco region effects and so do 3 and 4 eco regions 2 6 and 8 show a negative eco region effect while 3 and 4 show a positive effect irrespective of the model case a comparison of bmm 1 fig 10a with bmm 2a fig 10b and bmm 2b fig 10c shows that the inclusion of weather effects bmm 2a results in a positive eco region effect in most regions while the inclusion of cultivar ripening group hierarchy bmm 2b results in negative eco region effects however this tendency is not seen when both weather effects and cultivar ripening group hierarchy are included in bmm 3 fig 10d 3 5 residual uncertainty the standard deviation œÉ of the likelihood function and standard deviation Œª of the year effect œÑ y represent the unresolved and resolved components of residual uncertainty respectively fig 11a shows the posterior parameter distribution of œÉ from the five bayesian models there is a reduction in unresolved residual uncertainty with increasing model complexity from bmm 0 to bmm 3 a large reduction is seen on the inclusion of ripening cultivar hierarchy in bmm 2b and bmm 3 the standard deviation of the year effect Œª fig 11b shows an increase from bmm 1 bmm 2a to bmm 2b followed by a slight decrease in bmm 3 4 discussion the bayesian multi level models were able to improve calibration by partitioning some of the residual uncertainty into those arising from the hierarchical classification of cultivars and differences in eco regions weather conditions and year of growth as seen in fig 4 the unresolved residual uncertainty in simulated phenology was smaller in the full multi level model case bmm 3 in fig 4b than in the pooled case bm 0 in fig 4a this was also shown by the reduction in the standard deviation of the likelihood function œÉ in fig 11a moreover the multi level models reduced bias and rmse fig 5 especially in the cases of bmm 2b and bmm 3 the differences between different cultivars and ripening groups were taken into account by the hierarchical structure of cultivars nested within ripening groups in bmm 2b and bmm 3 fig 6a as a result the uncertainty in simulated phenology fig 4 originating from the process model parameters did not collapse as seen in the pooled case bm 0 due to a collapse of the posterior parameter distribution not shown the over confidence in the parameters of the pooled case can lead to poor predictions motavita et al 2019 because most of the variability between site years which can be attributed to cultivar and ripening group differences are attributed to random noise œÉ the additional inclusion of the weather effects from bmm 2b to bmm 3 further improved calibration quality fig 6b the full multi level model bmm 3 allowed for a more representative estimate of spass model parameter uncertainty this was seen from the wider ranges blue bands of the resultant simulated phenology in fig 4b as compared to fig 4a based on their between cultivar variability the posterior distributions of spass model parameters were grouped into cultivar specific high variability and ripening group specific low variability parameters fig 7 the parameters that exhibited low between cultivar variability such as tminv tminr and toptr fig d 1 define the temperature response function trf in general cardinal temperatures are expected to be ripening group specific while parameters such as pdd1 and pdd2 fig d 2 should be cultivar specific because they represent traits that would be optimized in different cultivars by plant breeders parent et al 2018 zheng et al 2012 challinor et al 2016 most model parameters exhibited this expected behaviour with the exception of toptv the posterior distribution of parameter toptv which influences vegetative development may not only represent the ripening group specific optimum temperature but may have also compensated for a missing cultivar specific effect we assumed no photoperiod effect on vegetative development in the model since this effect is small for maize grown in temperate regions van bussel et al 2015 nonetheless such an effect could exist and be cultivar dependent this missing effect could have been compensated by toptv in the model the base temperature for emergence emt also exhibited some between cultivar variability this parameter could have compensated for the effects of some cultivar specific hard coded parameters in the emergence equation eq b 1 furthermore the ripening group level distributions of parameter tminv fig 7a showed that as expected early mid early ripening groups on average have a lower minimum temperature requirement for vegetative development than the mid late late ripening groups overall the match between the behaviour of calibrated parameters and theoretical expectation highlights the model s robustness if weather and eco region effects are also accounted for through the multi level modelling approach analyses of the weather effects parameters highlight model deficits related to temperature effects during reproductive development firstly the non zero values of the posterior parameter distributions indicate that weather effects are influential fig 8 also the narrow posterior distributions as compared to the prior show that the parameter values are informed by the observations furthermore there was a high correlation between median weather effects and average reproductive phase temperature by weather class fig 9 these weather effects indicate that the model overestimates phenological development at higher late summer temperatures and underestimates at lower temperatures this trend reduced with the introduction of the cultivar ripening group hierarchy certain cultivars may have been selected by the farmers based on their performance in the local environmental conditions such as temperature siebert and ewert 2012 parker et al 2017 parent et al 2018 introducing the ripening groups as a level in the hierarchy could account for the differences between the groups in reaching maturity this differentiation of ripening groups becomes evident in the reproductive phase of development during the late summer months in the absence of cultivar ripening group hierarchy in bmm 2a the weather effects captured these differences as shown in fig 9a this has implications in cases where ripening group and cultivar information are not available regional data sets such as those from the state office of agricultural statistics may not contain information about the cultivars grown but information about environmental conditions are usually more readily available in the absence of ripening group and cultivar information accounting for weather effects will still result in some degree of improvement in model calibration quality although weakened in bmm 3 the weather effect temperature trend was not completely removed fig 9b this indicates that model deficits related to temperature effects persist in the reproductive phase thus accounting for weather effects in addition to the hierarchy in bmm 3 resulted in improved site year calibration quality in many weather classes as compared to bmm 2b fig 6b the current trf in the reproductive phase may not sufficiently capture the true development behaviour different trfs for maize phenology should be evaluated using this approach with the aim of identifying a better representation of the underlying processes analyses of eco region effects parameters point to model deficits related to soil moisture since eco region effects were accounted for in all the four multi level model cases we first provide a detailed discussion of the results here the median values of the eco region effects exhibited a positive increase in many regions on the inclusion of weather effects fig 10b and a negative increase on the inclusion of cultivar ripening group hierarchy fig 10c as compared to the bmm 1 fig 10a accounting for either one of these factors weather effects or cultivar ripening group hierarchy without the other possibly resulted in the eco region effects compensating for these missing factors the neighbouring eco regions 6 and 8 northern lowlands and 2 rhine plain as well as 3 and 4 central uplands exhibited similar trends in eco region effects irrespective of the model case eco regions 6 and 8 and eco regions 3 and 4 can be further grouped thus allowing for model simplification the distinct differences between the lowlands the rhine plains negative eco region effect and the uplands positive eco region effect could be due to distinct climatological or pedological features the northern lowlands are characterized by moraines that have high groundwater levels the rhine plain also exhibits higher groundwater productivity than the central uplands bundesanstalt f√ºr geowissenschaften und rohstoffe bgr 1993 in the full model bmm 3 phenological development was overestimated in the northern lowlands and rhine plain even after the process model output was corrected for weather and year effects this overestimation was then corrected by the negative eco region effects in these regions this could indicate a possible influence of water logging which slows phenological development and is not accounted for in the spass model liu et al 2021 found that accounting for water logging stress on phenology and yield in the apsim model improved model performance for barley a similar consideration in the spass model equations may be required to account for this stress this effect could also occur because high soil water content or water logged soils might lower temperatures within the crop canopy through the cooling effect of evaporation changes in albedo at the soil surface enhanced soil heat capacity and heat transport resulting in a heat transfer away from the soil surface none of these effects are accounted for in the model an alternate formulation of the multi level model that separately accounts for factors like soil climate and topography instead of eco regions is suggested to aid further investigation by separating the effects of ecological regions from the process model parameters we were able to gain further insights into the model and identify possible model deficits as is expected the unresolved model residual error represented by the standard deviation of the likelihood function reduced with increasing model complexity a large reduction was seen due to the inclusion of the ripening group cultivar hierarchy this could have been a consequence of including a large number of parameters corresponding to 4 ripening groups and 66 cultivars in models bmm 2b and bmm 3 the other nuisance parameter the standard deviation of the random year effects increased with increasing model complexity from bmm 1 bmm 2a to bmm 2b followed by a slight reduction in bmm 3 accounting for other effects resulted in a better estimation of the random year effects that were previously attributed to the unresolved residual error while bayesian multi level modelling improved calibration we acknowledge the limitations of our approach in using limited data and excluding input uncertainty although the inclusion of only eco region weather and year effects do account for some improvement in model performance fig 5 this was not clearly evident when model performance was analysed by eco region and weather classes fig c 1 these effects may be convoluted by a possibly stronger effect of cultivar ripening group hierarchy through compensation when it is not explicitly taken into account although more observation data would help in disentangling the different effects they may not be available additionally as noted in this study using more data is also accompanied by high computation costs especially for modelling cases with higher complexity importantly the uncertainty in phenology observations and in the model inputs like temperature or reported sowing and harvest dates were not considered and could further confound results also since the observations were made for fixed bbch stages we recommend that the model and likelihood function should be reformulated to represent the uncertainty in the days rather than phenology stages for future work the resultant posterior distributions from the full model case bmm 3 facilitate phenology predictions for cultivars ripening groups and for the maize species grown in different environmental conditions in germany the phenological development of a current cultivar which has been used for calibration can be predicted in a different ecological region or weather class in this case the posterior parameter distribution of the cultivar can be used to simulate phenology using the spass model while the corresponding parameters of the ecological region and weather effects can be used to correct the model simulations for structural deficits the random year effects and unresolved residuals are added to represent the total uncertainty in predictions furthermore cultivar level parameters within a given ripening group can be used to simulate phenology for new cultivars in that group while all cultivar level parameters can be used to predict phenological development of silage maize grown in germany in future scenarios although multi level models are expected to improve prediction quality gelman 2006a this may not always occur fer et al 2021 showed that bayesian hierarchical modelling does not always lead to best predictions instead it may result in a better representation of prediction uncertainty this lack of improvement in prediction quality could be attributed to bias variance trade off in which we introduce more explanatory parameters in the multi level models at the cost of over fitting although there is always a danger of over fitting we justify the complexity of the multi level models since we employed a systematic approach to increase complexity based on system knowledge while assessing prediction quality of the models is important this is beyond the current scope of gaining a better understanding of the phenology model and identifying model deficits in its application to regional studies the bmm approach can be used as a diagnostic tool to guide model improvement efforts for example the possible influence of water logging on phenological development in maize as hypothesized from the resultant eco region effects emphasizes the need for field experiments to verify and investigate its impact liu et al 2020 these experiments can then be used to formulate and parameterize water logging stress in the process model equations liu et al 2021 wang et al 2017 showed that improved temperature response functions trfs led to reduced uncertainty in wheat yield projections further studies should focus on comparing the performance of alternate trfs during reproductive post flowering development in maize against experimental data the bmm approach can also be applied to process based crop models wherein these point based models can be spatialized pasquel et al 2022 additionally gene based models can be integrated with crop models to determine more representative genotype specific parameters wallach et al 2018 casadebaig et al 2020 oliveira et al 2021 bmm can be used to calibrate such models to data from multi location breeding trails so that genotype dependent parameters and their environmental interactions can be disentangled 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that bayesian multi level modelling bmm is a suitable approach to account for the hierarchical structure of cultivars nested within ripening groups of a crop species while simultaneously providing insights into model deficits related to environmental factors the pooled model case bm 0 led to an over confidence in the process model parameters and comparatively poor calibration quality while accounting for the eco region and year effects bmm 1 improved calibration quality the eco region effects possibly compensated for the missing weather effects estimating eco region weather and year effects bmm 2a highlighted temperature related model deficits during reproductive development it also showed that in the absence of cultivar ripening group information the weather effects were able to capture their missing effect to some extent however accounting for cultivar ripening group information bmm 2b and bmm 3 led to more representative estimates of parameter uncertainty and clearly improved calibration performance in the full model case bmm 3 with the additional inclusion of the weather effects the eco region effects did not compensate for the missing weather effects as they did in bmm 2b eco region effects could possibly be linked to water logging stress on phenology which is not represented in the process based model furthermore between cultivar variability in posterior parameter distributions matched theoretical expectations thereby emphasizing the strength of the full multi level model thus accounting for the eco regions weather and year effects and specifically the hierarchical classification of cultivars and maize ripening groups led to better calibration and representation of parameter uncertainty as compared to the commonly used pooled approach with our approach models that have been primarily used for field scale or cultivar specific studies can be extended to regional scales although we do not explicitly correct the process model equations we account for effects of model deficits related to environmental conditions this approach also highlights model deficiencies which can facilitate model improvement these findings can be used to design dedicated experiments and data gathering procedures to support the refinement of model equations bmm could also be applied to small scale studies to account for between farm and within farm variability bmm is a valuable tool in the bayesian tool box that should be implemented in crop model

based on average temperatures and cumulative precipitation between april and june and between july and september k means clustering was used to define the weather classes the k means algorithm generates clusters by minimizing within cluster variance that is based on euclidean distances hartigan and wong 1979 first the average of the mean daily temperature t s y s from april to june and from july to september were calculated for each site year sy as follows a 1 t s y s 1 n s n 1 n s t s y n where s represents the season from april to june or from july to september n s is the total number of days in that season and t s y n is the mean temperature c on a given day n at site year sy similarly cumulative precipitation p s y s was also calculated from april to june and from july to

function from the stats package in r was run to generate ten clusters to ensure stability of the resultant clusters 100 starting points were set the maximum number of iterations was set to 1000 and 10 clusters were specified to generate 10 weather classes appendix b spass model equations phenological development in the spass model occurs in three main phases emergence vegetative phase and reproductive phase the rate of phenological development during emergence or the emergence rate is a function of sowing depth sdep in cm and a minimum or base temperature emt in c requirement only above which emergence occurs for a particular day d between sowing and harvest if t d is the temperature then the emergence rate re d d 1 is given by b 1 re d max 0 0 5 t d emt 15 0 6 sdep the temperature response function trf defines the phenological development rate during the vegetative and reproductive phases as a function of temperature development occurs only between the minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperature defined by the trf with maximum development occurring at the optimum temperature topt the trf is given by b 2 f t d tmin topt tmax 2 t d tmin Œ± topt tmin Œ± t d tmin 2 Œ± topt tmin 2 Œ± if tmin t d tmax 0 otherwise where b 3 Œ± ln 2 ln tmax tmin topt tmin these cardinal temperatures are expressed in c and are development phase specific thus for the vegetative phase the development rate rv d d 1 is dependent on the phase specific trf fv and the maximum development rate 1 pdd1 for the vegetative phase at optimum temperature d 1 the trf scales between 0 and 1 and acts as a reduction factor on the maximum development rate when the temperature is not at the optimum b 4 rv d fv t d tminv toptv tmaxv pdd1 similarly for the reproductive phase if 1 pdd2 d 1 is the maximum development rate at optimum temperature and fr is the trf then the development rate rr d d 1 is given by b 5 rr d fr t d tminr toptr tmaxr pdd2 the phenological development rate r d d 1 at a

original spass model equations wang 1997 we defined a sigmoid œà d 1 in eq b 7 instead of a step function for the transition between emergence rate and vegetative development rate the internal development stage sdev d is given by b 8 sdev d d g e r m d r d 0 5 where germ is the date of germination or in this case date of sowing since germination is assumed to be instantaneous the internal

calibration performance represented by the mean rmse and bias from the 100 site years used for calibration fig c 1 was analysed by eco region and year for the five model cases bm 0 bmm 1 bmm 2a bmm 2b bmm 3 overall the ripening cultivar hierarchy in bmm 2b and bmm 3 show a clear improvement in model calibration quality the inclusion of eco region and year effects from bmm 1 onwards does not show a clear improvement trend across all classes appendix d spass model parameter distributions figs d 1 and d 2 show posterior distributions of parameters that exhibit low and high between cultivar variability respectively in general parameters that exhibit low between cultivar variability correspond to the temperature response function trf in the vegetative and reproductive phases appendix e

24323,plant phenology models are important components in process based crop models which are used to assess the impact of climate change on food production for reliable model predictions parameters in phenology models have to be accurately known they are usually estimated by calibrating the model to observations however at regional scales in which different cultivars of a crop species may be grown not accounting for inherent differences in phenological development between cultivars in the model and the presence of model deficits lead to inaccurate parameter estimates to account for inherent differences between cultivars and to identify model deficits we used a bayesian multi level approach to calibrate a phenology model spass to observations of silage maize grown across germany between 2009 and 2017 we evaluated four multi level models of increasing complexity where we accounted for different combinations of ecological weather and year effects as well as the hierarchical classification of cultivars nested within ripening groups of the maize species we compared the calibration quality from this approach to the commonly used pooled approach in which none of these factors are considered the pooled model led to over confident process model parameter estimates and comparatively poor calibration quality the mean value of the unexplained residual error standard deviation reduced from 5 5 bbch phenological development units in the pooled model case bm 0 to 5 3 bbch when eco region and year effects bmm 1 were considered additionally accounting for weather effects bmm 2a resulted in a mean value of 5 2 bbch calibration quality especially improved when the hierarchical classification of cultivars within ripening groups of maize was incorporated including the hierarchical classification with eco region and year effects bmm 2b led to a mean residual error of 4 4 bbch while additionally considering weather effects in the full model case bmm 3 resulted in a value of 4 3 bbch our findings have implications for regional model calibration and data gathering studies since it emphasizes that ripening group and cultivar information is essential furthermore we found that if this information is not available at least weather eco region and year effects should be taken into account accounting for only the eco region and year effects led to parameter compensation of the missing weather effects our results can facilitate model improvement studies since we identified possible model limitations related to temperature effects in the reproductive post flowering phase and to soil moisture we demonstrate that bayesian multi level calibration of a phenology model facilitates the incorporation of hierarchical dependencies and the identification of model limitations our approach can be extended to full crop models at different spatial scales keywords phenology silage maize hierarchical bayes multi level model process based model data availability data and codes used for the study are available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6361647 1 introduction plant phenology plays an important role when assessing the impact of climate change and evaluating crop production menzel et al 2006 siebert and ewert 2012 zhao et al 2013 wittich and liedtke 2015 he et al 2017a wallach et al 2021 it is controlled by environmental variables and determines the timing of plant organ development and the distribution of the products of photosynthesis such as sugars to different parts of the plant thus predictions of phenological development are essential for evaluating crop growth and yield and for supporting field management decisions such as the timing of fertilizer application potgieter et al 2021 these phenology predictions are made possible by using numerical models phenology models are in turn important components of crop models which are used for simulating crop growth and development and yield besides data driven statistical models it is process based models which enable a thorough understanding of the underlying processes for evaluating potential policy interventions and adaptation to climate change lobell and asseng 2017 in these process models phenology is simulated as a parametric function of environmental variables such as temperature and photoperiod parameters of these models have to be determined accurately to ensure reliable predictions since model parameters often cannot be measured directly they need to be estimated by comparing model outputs with observed data using methods such as bayesian inference bayesian calibration provides a framework to quantify different sources of uncertainty which is essential for better predictions with the added value of being able to include prior information makowski et al 2002 to this end bayesian methods have been applied in numerous crop model calibration studies makowski et al 2006 iizumi et al 2009 sexton et al 2016 alderman and stanfill 2017 he et al 2017b gao et al 2020 during the calibration of phenology models cultivar specific parameters are usually estimated gao et al 2020 this is because phenological traits differ markedly not only between species and between ripening or maturity groups of crop species such as maize oluwaranti et al 2015 but also between cultivars within these ripening groups phenological development of a cultivar is also dependent on the environment and reflects genotype environment interactions thus methods such as selecting cultivar observations from contrasting environments for calibration he et al 2017b and using cross validation tests while evaluating environmental responses of the cultivar fukui et al 2015 are suggested for determining these cultivar specific parameters however at regional scales where many cultivars of a particular species are grown together cultivar specific parameters may not be suitable in such calibration studies region specific model parameter estimates are obtained for the crop species iizumi et al 2009 therond et al 2011 angulo et al 2013 soltani et al 2016 but differences between cultivars grown in the region are usually not taken into account the resultant estimates are a compromised solution for all the cultivars grown in different environments represented by the calibration data set furthermore models may not represent the underlying processes accurately commonly environmental interactions are incompletely or poorly understood leading to conceptual uncertainty this is reflected in multiple model formulations to represent the same process kumudini et al 2014 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 consequently models may have structural deficits but the implicit assumption in bayesian inference is that the model is without errors or that all errors are perfectly described hsueh et al 2022 during calibration the estimated parameters may compensate for model limitations wallach 2011 as a consequence even parameters which are meant to be cultivar specific have been found to vary with the environment ceglar et al 2011 thus often loosing their original physiological meaning lamsal et al 2018 ignoring inherent data structures and the presence of model deficits result in inaccurate parameter estimates when data structures such as the hierarchical classification of cultivars nested within ripening groups of a species are ignored the uncertainty in the resultant effective parameters are underestimated furthermore indiscriminate use of large amounts of data to calibrate imperfect models leads to an overconfidence in erroneous parameter estimates motavita et al 2019 which in turn has been shown to result in erroneous model predictions viswanathan et al 2022 thus it is important to account for these data structures and model deficits during parameter estimation therefore we propose a bayesian multi level calibration of a process based plant phenology model to account for inherent data structures and to identify model deficits bayesian multi level modelling bmm has been widely applied in ecological modelling clark 2003 li et al 2015 thomas et al 2017 tian et al 2020 and has more recently been applied to plant models for example patrick et al 2009 applied a hierarchical bayesian approach to estimate parameters of the farquhar photosynthesis model jarqu√≠n et al 2016 used a hierarchical bayesian formulation of a linear bilinear model to investigate genotype environment g e interactions of maize from breeding trials fer et al 2021 applied hierarchical bayes to a dynamic vegetation model in conjunction with a bayesian model emulator senf et al 2017 applied bayesian hierarchical modelling to a satellite based data driven phenology model to account for spatial and temporal variation in phenology qiu et al 2020 developed a bayesian hierarchical space time model to study the impact of climate change and extreme events on phenological development to the best of our knowledge the bmm approach has not been applied to calibrate a process based phenology model on a regional scale by applying the bmm approach we can honour the hierarchical classification of cultivars nested within ripening groups of a crop species thus species ripening group and cultivar specific parameters can be simultaneously estimated van oijen and h√∂glind 2016 we can also account for phenological development that depends on additional environmental factors which are not already captured in the model equations del giudice et al 2013 methods such as cross calibration have been used to determine crop model parameters for representative crop cultivars grown in different agro ecological sub zones xiong et al 2008 but parameter estimates from such an approach would have limited applications when the phenological development of a new cultivar belonging to a different ripening group is to be predicted parameter estimates from the bmm approach can be used for such applications the advantage of bmm lies in its borrowing strength zhang and arhonditsis 2009 where parameter estimates for data limited cultivars can benefit from data rich ones additionally the appropriate depiction of data groups results in a representative quantification of prediction uncertainty gelman 2006a we tested the proposed approach by evaluating four bmm cases of increasing complexity in which we calibrated the spass wang 1997 wang and engel 1998 2000 phenology model to observations of silage maize grown across germany from 2009 to 2017 the spass model has proven to be successful for different crop species gayler et al 2002 priesack et al 2006 biernath et al 2011 including maize and was one of the well performing models in the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip studies bassu et al 2014 durand et al 2018 kimball et al 2019 it works well for cultivar specific crop simulations however crop species simulations suffer when ripening group and cultivar information is not incorporated during calibration a problem that is not unique to the spass model furthermore a previous study viswanathan et al 2022 highlighted possible environment related deficits in the spass phenology model which needed systematic evaluation thus in the four bmm cases we accounted for different combinations of yearly variability environmental effects arising from growth in different ecological regions and weather conditions and the classification of cultivars into ripening groups with these cases we assessed the importance of including cultivar information in regional calibration studies we evaluated the bmm approach by comparing calibration results from the four cases with the commonly used pooled approach where a set of model parameters was estimated for silage maize grown across all environments we also analysed trends between environmental effect parameters and environmental variables to identify possible model deficits the findings of our study are expected to have implications for regional calibration and model improvement studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we used phenology observations of silage maize grown between 2009 and 2017 at locations across germany collected by the german national meteorological service deutsche wetterdienst dwd dwd climate data center cdc 2019 the observers reported the date of the first detected occurrence of maize phenological development stages namely 10 31 53 61 75 83 and 87 on the bbch scale biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt und chemische industrie meier 2018 in the assigned observation area corresponding cultivars and ripening groups were also reported we refer to data sets by the site and year in which silage maize was cultivated that is site year we removed site years for which sowing and harvest dates were not reported and in which the bbch data was not strictly monotonically increasing with time additionally observations that fell outside the range of sowing and harvest dates were discarded we note that not all of the seven above mentioned phenological stages were available in all site years minimum and maximum daily air temperatures were used as inputs to the spass phenology model weather data from the dwd stations were not available at all plant observation sites therefore temperature data were extracted at all sites from the era5 land re analysis gridded data set mu√±oz sabater 2019 this data set has a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and hourly temporal resolution the hourly data were aggregated to daily values we consider the re analysis data to be a better spatial representation than point measurements at the weather stations to assess model limitations related to temperature and precipitation site years were classified into ten weather classes based on average temperature and cumulative precipitation between april and june and between july and september periods during which maize usually undergoes vegetative and reproductive development respectively a k means clustering algorithm was applied to define the weather classes details in appendix a site years were also grouped into nine ecological regions based on the classification provided by the bundesamt f√ºr naturschutz 2017 for computational reasons a subset of 100 site years out of 3004 was randomly selected for calibration where it was ensured that at least one site year was selected from each of the four ripening groups nine ecological regions ten weather classes and nine years the calibration data set consisted of 66 cultivars from the four ripening groups table 1 it was also ensured that the relative proportions of site years from the different ripening groups in the full data set were maintained in the calibration subset early 34 mid early 54 mid late 11 and late 0 4 in the full data set the 100 site years used for calibration contained 604 phenology observations 2 2 phenology model air temperature site latitude sowing and harvest dates are required as inputs to the spass phenology model the model has nine parameters seven of which were estimated during calibration table 2 and the remaining two were fixed at default values the model equations and details are given in appendix b we provide a brief summary below three main phases of development are defined in the model emergence vegetative and reproductive phases emergence is dependent on the sowing depth assumed to be fixed for all the site years at 3 cm and on the temperature above a minimum value emt the development rate during the vegetative and reproductive phases is dependent on the number of physiological development days at optimum temperature pdd1 for vegetative and pdd2 for reproductive and on the temperature response function trf the trf is defined by phase specific minimum optimum and maximum cardinal temperatures tminv toptv and tmaxv respectively for vegetative and tminr toptr and tmaxr respectively for reproductive the spass phenology model as described in wang 1997 was implemented in our study with the following modifications a the photoperiod effect on the vegetative phase was not considered b no soil water limiting effect on germination was assumed and germination occurs instantaneously after sowing and c for numerical reasons the transition between emergence and vegetative phases was defined by a sigmoidal function instead of the original step function the parameters for physiological development days at optimum temperature for the vegetative pdd1 and reproductive phases pdd2 were estimated in the study additionally minimum and optimum temperature for vegetative tminv and toptv where toptv tmaxv dtoptv and reproductive tminr and toptr where toptr tmaxr dtoptr phases as well as the minimum temperature required for emergence emt were estimated however the parameters tmaxv and tmaxr were not estimated the range of average daily temperatures during the growing season at the study site years were between 6 and 31 c this is usually expected to be at or lower than the optimal temperatures for maize a warm weather plant the lack of observations in the supra optimal temperature range would make constraining tmax difficult wang et al 2015 and is expected to incur problems of equifinality to avoid these problems the values of tmaxv and tmaxr were fixed at 44 c we used bayesian inference to determine the posterior probability of the model parameters let œï d represent the given phenology observation on day d the phenology œï d t Œ∏ at day d simulated by the spass model with a parameter vector Œ∏ is dependent on air temperatures t from

one pooled and four multi level model cases as seen in fig 1 in terms of their likelihood functions in the following sections the prior distributions for all the estimated parameters are provided in table 2 2 3 1 bm 0 pooled model the pooled model is the most commonly used calibration setup for regional scale studies where a common parameter set is estimated for all cultivars grown in different

which silage maize was grown in germany influence phenology we analysed this effect with the bmm 1 model fig 1b where we accounted for fixed effects due to the different eco regions and random effects

adequately captured in the model also differences in weather conditions could result in a perceived variability between eco regions and between years in the bmm 2a model fig 1c we additionally accounted for the effects due to the different weather classes if the different weather classes are represented by w w and parameter Œ¥ w represents the effects by weather class then 4 p œÜ Œ∏ t w w e

sampling of the posterior parameter distributions was performed using the gibbs algorithm from the jags software plummer 2003 implementation in r2jags su and yajima 2020 and jagsui kellner 2021 packages in r r core team 2021 for the model cases bm 0 bmm 1 bmm 2a and bmm 2b 500 runs were used for adaptation three chains were run and 5000 iterations were run per chain until the gelman rubin

results we first provide results from the classification of 3004 site years into environmental classes section 3 1 we then describe the calibration quality of the spass model in the different bayesian model cases section 3 2 followed by an analysis of the posterior distributions of the spass model parameters section 3 3 the environmental effects section 3 4 and residual uncertainty section 3 5 all figures were made using the ggplot2 wickham 2016 package in r we note here again that out of the 3004 site years 100 were used for calibration 3 1 classification of site years into environmental classes all site years were classified into ten weather classes fig 2 the weather classes were based on the average temperatures and cumulative precipitation between april and june and between july and september silage maize cultivated across germany generally undergoes vegetative development from april to june and reproductive development from july to september phenological development during the vegetative and reproductive phases are dependent on temperature the relationship between temperature and phenological development is usually represented by equations in phenological models including spass however existing model equations may not accurately capture this temperature response additionally the influence of factors like precipitation that are known to influence phenology in some plant species moore and lauenroth 2017 could also have either a direct influence on maize phenology or an indirect effect by influencing temperatures within the crop canopy however these effects are not represented in the spass phenology model thus site years were classified into the weather classes to assess model limitations related to temperature and precipitation all site years were also classified into nine ecological regions fig 3 eco region 0 includes the alpine foreland and foothills characterized by flysch and molasse deposits as well as glacial moraines this eco region has experienced on average higher rainfall average cumulative precipitation of 700 mm based on site years in the full data set than the other eco regions during the maize growing season april september between 2009 and 2017 eco region 1 comprises the swabian and franconian alb and the black forest average elevation 400 m a s l it is marked by sedimentary deposits and the development of loess and loamy soils the rhine river plain is in eco region 2 eco regions 3 and 4 consist of the middle highlands average elevation of 300 400 m a s l of the thuringian forest and harz mountains the region is characterized by sedimentary deposits with some metamorphic rocks and the development of loess loam the remaining eco regions consist of the northern lowlands typified by moraine deposits eco region 7 includes the mecklenburg lake district and consists of young moraine deposits eco regions 6 and 8 largely consist of old moraine deposits eco region 8 has been on average hotter and drier average daily temperature of 15 16 c and average cumulative precipitation of 500 mm than the other eco regions during the growing season please refer to figs s2 2 1 and s2 2 2 in supplement s2 2 appendix e for details note that since the 100 site years used for calibration were randomly sampled the calibration data set contained only a few site years from ecological regions in the northeastern part of germany 3 2 calibration quality as an example we compare observed and simulated phenology for silage maize grown at a site in the state of bavaria in 2009 from the pooled model case bm 0 and the full model case bmm 3 fig 4 the blue bands show the 5 95th percentile of simulated phenology that account for uncertainty from model parameters Œ∏ s p for bm 0 in fig 4a and Œ∏ s p r c for bmm 3 in fig 4b while the red bands additionally account for environmental effects Œ¥ w Œ≥ e œÑ y in fig 4b the grey bands show the 5 95th percentile of simulated phenology that additionally account for the unresolved residual error œÉ there is a reduction in bias in bmm 3 as compared to bm 0 furthermore there is an overall reduction in unresolved residual error in bmm 3 with the model parameters and environmental effects accounting for a large share of the error variance we also note that the blue bands in fig 4a have collapsed around the mean simulated phenology the model performance represented by the mean rmse and bias for the 100 calibration site years fig 5 improved with model complexity from the pooled model to the full model bm 0 bmm 1 bmm 2a bmm 2b bmm 3 this is evident from the reduction in mean rmse and shrinkage of the mean bias towards zero in fig 6 the model performance from the five cases were analysed by ripening group and weather class across the plots the two cases bmm 2b and bmm 3 that account for the ripening group cultivar hierarchy generally exhibit a lower bias and rmse as compared to the others across the four ripening groups fig 6a the mean bias is closer to zero with increasing model complexity as seen in fig 5 a decrease in mean bias and rmse occurs on the inclusion of cultivar ripening group information through the hierarchy in bmm 2b and bmm 3 the single site year from the late ripening cultivar included in calibration also exhibits a clear improvement in rmse and bias while the inclusion of weather effects fig 6b in the model cases bmm 2a and bmm 3 result in smaller mean rmse and bias only in some weather classes the inclusion of cultivar ripening group hierarchy results in an improvement in most classes although the inclusion of eco regions and year effects bmm 1 to bmm 3 fig c 1 in the appendix c improves rmse and bias in some eco regions and years a clear trend across all the classes cannot be identified 3 3 phenology model parameters the marginal posterior distributions of the spass model parameters were analysed for the full model bmm 3 to investigate differences between cultivar ripening group and maize species parameter estimates after the environmental effects are taken into account fig 7 shows the posterior parameter distribution by species Œ∏ s p ripening groups Œ∏ s p r Œ∏ s p Œ¥ Œ∏ r and cultivars Œ∏ s p r c Œ∏ s p Œ¥ Œ∏ r Œ¥ Œ∏ r c for two parameters tminv and pdd1 parameter tminv shows low variability between cultivars of the same ripening group while pdd1 shows high variability a similar visual inspection of other parameters showed that they could be classified into the categories of low tminv tminr toptr and high pdd1 pdd2 toptv emt between cultivar variability figs d 1 and d 2 in appendix d 3 4 environmental effects the prior and posterior parameter distributions of the weather effects Œ¥ w and eco region effects Œ≥ e were analysed with respect to their corresponding classes in the four multi level model cases fig 8 negative effects indicate an overestimation while positive effects indicate underestimation of phenology by the spass model and the remaining effects that were considered in the particular bmm case this over underestimation is corrected by the corresponding environmental effect parameter to improve the model s fit to the data in that bmm case the posterior parameter distributions deviate from the prior which is normally distributed around zero and are narrower than the prior the eco region 2 fig 8a exhibits a negative effect in all model cases eco regions 0 and 1 exhibit similar effects and so do eco regions 3 and 4 in all model cases the parameter distributions of the weather effects fig 8b are only shown for bmm 2a and bmm 3 since these effects are taken into account only in these two cases weather classes 6 and 10 have similar posterior parameter distributions for weather effects these classes have different average cumulative precipitation but similar average temperatures supplement s2 3 appendix e this indicates that temperatures have a larger influence than precipitation on these weather effects to identify possible model deficits we analysed trends between the median value of the weather effects parameters and mean of the average daily temperature and cumulative precipitation of the weather classes from april to june and july to september for the cases bmm 2a and bmm 3 a high correlation coefficient is seen between the median weather effect per class and the mean of the average daily temperature from july to september fig 9 the correlation coefficient reduces from 0 87 in bmm 2a to 0 64 in the full model bmm 3 where the cultivar ripening group hierarchy is considered this is also accompanied by a widening in confidence intervals of the linear regression line the eco region effect Œ≥ e was included in all the bayesian multi level model cases fig 10 shows a comparison between the median eco regions effects for the four multi level models a negative eco region effect indicates an overestimation of phenology by the spass model and the other effects that were accounted for in the particular bmm case this overestimation was corrected by the eco region effect parameter conversely a positive eco region effect indicates an underestimation of phenology by the spass model and the other effects eco regions 6 and 8 have similar median eco region effects and so do 3 and 4 eco regions 2 6 and 8 show a negative eco region effect while 3 and 4 show a positive effect irrespective of the model case a comparison of bmm 1 fig 10a with bmm 2a fig 10b and bmm 2b fig 10c shows that the inclusion of weather effects bmm 2a results in a positive eco region effect in most regions while the inclusion of cultivar ripening group hierarchy bmm 2b results in negative eco region effects however this tendency is not seen when both weather effects and cultivar ripening group hierarchy are included in bmm 3 fig 10d 3 5 residual uncertainty the standard deviation œÉ of the likelihood function and standard deviation Œª of the year effect œÑ y represent the unresolved and resolved components of residual uncertainty respectively fig 11a shows the posterior parameter distribution of œÉ from the five bayesian models there is a reduction in unresolved residual uncertainty with increasing model complexity from bmm 0 to bmm 3 a large reduction is seen on the inclusion of ripening cultivar hierarchy in bmm 2b and bmm 3 the standard deviation of the year effect Œª fig 11b shows an increase from bmm 1 bmm 2a to bmm 2b followed by a slight decrease in bmm 3 4 discussion the bayesian multi level models were able to improve calibration by partitioning some of the residual uncertainty into those arising from the hierarchical classification of cultivars and differences in eco regions weather conditions and year of growth as seen in fig 4 the unresolved residual uncertainty in simulated phenology was smaller in the full multi level model case bmm 3 in fig 4b than in the pooled case bm 0 in fig 4a this was also shown by the reduction in the standard deviation of the likelihood function œÉ in fig 11a moreover the multi level models reduced bias and rmse fig 5 especially in the cases of bmm 2b and bmm 3 the differences between different cultivars and ripening groups were taken into account by the hierarchical structure of cultivars nested within ripening groups in bmm 2b and bmm 3 fig 6a as a result the uncertainty in simulated phenology fig 4 originating from the process model parameters did not collapse as seen in the pooled case bm 0 due to a collapse of the posterior parameter distribution not shown the over confidence in the parameters of the pooled case can lead to poor predictions motavita et al 2019 because most of the variability between site years which can be attributed to cultivar and ripening group differences are attributed to random noise œÉ the additional inclusion of the weather effects from bmm 2b to bmm 3 further improved calibration quality fig 6b the full multi level model bmm 3 allowed for a more representative estimate of spass model parameter uncertainty this was seen from the wider ranges blue bands of the resultant simulated phenology in fig 4b as compared to fig 4a based on their between cultivar variability the posterior distributions of spass model parameters were grouped into cultivar specific high variability and ripening group specific low variability parameters fig 7 the parameters that exhibited low between cultivar variability such as tminv tminr and toptr fig d 1 define the temperature response function trf in general cardinal temperatures are expected to be ripening group specific while parameters such as pdd1 and pdd2 fig d 2 should be cultivar specific because they represent traits that would be optimized in different cultivars by plant breeders parent et al 2018 zheng et al 2012 challinor et al 2016 most model parameters exhibited this expected behaviour with the exception of toptv the posterior distribution of parameter toptv which influences vegetative development may not only represent the ripening group specific optimum temperature but may have also compensated for a missing cultivar specific effect we assumed no photoperiod effect on vegetative development in the model since this effect is small for maize grown in temperate regions van bussel et al 2015 nonetheless such an effect could exist and be cultivar dependent this missing effect could have been compensated by toptv in the model the base temperature for emergence emt also exhibited some between cultivar variability this parameter could have compensated for the effects of some cultivar specific hard coded parameters in the emergence equation eq b 1 furthermore the ripening group level distributions of parameter tminv fig 7a showed that as expected early mid early ripening groups on average have a lower minimum temperature requirement for vegetative development than the mid late late ripening groups overall the match between the behaviour of calibrated parameters and theoretical expectation highlights the model s robustness if weather and eco region effects are also accounted for through the multi level modelling approach analyses of the weather effects parameters highlight model deficits related to temperature effects during reproductive development firstly the non zero values of the posterior parameter distributions indicate that weather effects are influential fig 8 also the narrow posterior distributions as compared to the prior show that the parameter values are informed by the observations furthermore there was a high correlation between median weather effects and average reproductive phase temperature by weather class fig 9 these weather effects indicate that the model overestimates phenological development at higher late summer temperatures and underestimates at lower temperatures this trend reduced with the introduction of the cultivar ripening group hierarchy certain cultivars may have been selected by the farmers based on their performance in the local environmental conditions such as temperature siebert and ewert 2012 parker et al 2017 parent et al 2018 introducing the ripening groups as a level in the hierarchy could account for the differences between the groups in reaching maturity this differentiation of ripening groups becomes evident in the reproductive phase of development during the late summer months in the absence of cultivar ripening group hierarchy in bmm 2a the weather effects captured these differences as shown in fig 9a this has implications in cases where ripening group and cultivar information are not available regional data sets such as those from the state office of agricultural statistics may not contain information about the cultivars grown but information about environmental conditions are usually more readily available in the absence of ripening group and cultivar information accounting for weather effects will still result in some degree of improvement in model calibration quality although weakened in bmm 3 the weather effect temperature trend was not completely removed fig 9b this indicates that model deficits related to temperature effects persist in the reproductive phase thus accounting for weather effects in addition to the hierarchy in bmm 3 resulted in improved site year calibration quality in many weather classes as compared to bmm 2b fig 6b the current trf in the reproductive phase may not sufficiently capture the true development behaviour different trfs for maize phenology should be evaluated using this approach with the aim of identifying a better representation of the underlying processes analyses of eco region effects parameters point to model deficits related to soil moisture since eco region effects were accounted for in all the four multi level model cases we first provide a detailed discussion of the results here the median values of the eco region effects exhibited a positive increase in many regions on the inclusion of weather effects fig 10b and a negative increase on the inclusion of cultivar ripening group hierarchy fig 10c as compared to the bmm 1 fig 10a accounting for either one of these factors weather effects or cultivar ripening group hierarchy without the other possibly resulted in the eco region effects compensating for these missing factors the neighbouring eco regions 6 and 8 northern lowlands and 2 rhine plain as well as 3 and 4 central uplands exhibited similar trends in eco region effects irrespective of the model case eco regions 6 and 8 and eco regions 3 and 4 can be further grouped thus allowing for model simplification the distinct differences between the lowlands the rhine plains negative eco region effect and the uplands positive eco region effect could be due to distinct climatological or pedological features the northern lowlands are characterized by moraines that have high groundwater levels the rhine plain also exhibits higher groundwater productivity than the central uplands bundesanstalt f√ºr geowissenschaften und rohstoffe bgr 1993 in the full model bmm 3 phenological development was overestimated in the northern lowlands and rhine plain even after the process model output was corrected for weather and year effects this overestimation was then corrected by the negative eco region effects in these regions this could indicate a possible influence of water logging which slows phenological development and is not accounted for in the spass model liu et al 2021 found that accounting for water logging stress on phenology and yield in the apsim model improved model performance for barley a similar consideration in the spass model equations may be required to account for this stress this effect could also occur because high soil water content or water logged soils might lower temperatures within the crop canopy through the cooling effect of evaporation changes in albedo at the soil surface enhanced soil heat capacity and heat transport resulting in a heat transfer away from the soil surface none of these effects are accounted for in the model an alternate formulation of the multi level model that separately accounts for factors like soil climate and topography instead of eco regions is suggested to aid further investigation by separating the effects of ecological regions from the process model parameters we were able to gain further insights into the model and identify possible model deficits as is expected the unresolved model residual error represented by the standard deviation of the likelihood function reduced with increasing model complexity a large reduction was seen due to the inclusion of the ripening group cultivar hierarchy this could have been a consequence of including a large number of parameters corresponding to 4 ripening groups and 66 cultivars in models bmm 2b and bmm 3 the other nuisance parameter the standard deviation of the random year effects increased with increasing model complexity from bmm 1 bmm 2a to bmm 2b followed by a slight reduction in bmm 3 accounting for other effects resulted in a better estimation of the random year effects that were previously attributed to the unresolved residual error while bayesian multi level modelling improved calibration we acknowledge the limitations of our approach in using limited data and excluding input uncertainty although the inclusion of only eco region weather and year effects do account for some improvement in model performance fig 5 this was not clearly evident when model performance was analysed by eco region and weather classes fig c 1 these effects may be convoluted by a possibly stronger effect of cultivar ripening group hierarchy through compensation when it is not explicitly taken into account although more observation data would help in disentangling the different effects they may not be available additionally as noted in this study using more data is also accompanied by high computation costs especially for modelling cases with higher complexity importantly the uncertainty in phenology observations and in the model inputs like temperature or reported sowing and harvest dates were not considered and could further confound results also since the observations were made for fixed bbch stages we recommend that the model and likelihood function should be reformulated to represent the uncertainty in the days rather than phenology stages for future work the resultant posterior distributions from the full model case bmm 3 facilitate phenology predictions for cultivars ripening groups and for the maize species grown in different environmental conditions in germany the phenological development of a current cultivar which has been used for calibration can be predicted in a different ecological region or weather class in this case the posterior parameter distribution of the cultivar can be used to simulate phenology using the spass model while the corresponding parameters of the ecological region and weather effects can be used to correct the model simulations for structural deficits the random year effects and unresolved residuals are added to represent the total uncertainty in predictions furthermore cultivar level parameters within a given ripening group can be used to simulate phenology for new cultivars in that group while all cultivar level parameters can be used to predict phenological development of silage maize grown in germany in future scenarios although multi level models are expected to improve prediction quality gelman 2006a this may not always occur fer et al 2021 showed that bayesian hierarchical modelling does not always lead to best predictions instead it may result in a better representation of prediction uncertainty this lack of improvement in prediction quality could be attributed to bias variance trade off in which we introduce more explanatory parameters in the multi level models at the cost of over fitting although there is always a danger of over fitting we justify the complexity of the multi level models since we employed a systematic approach to increase complexity based on system knowledge while assessing prediction quality of the models is important this is beyond the current scope of gaining a better understanding of the phenology model and identifying model deficits in its application to regional studies the bmm approach can be used as a diagnostic tool to guide model improvement efforts for example the possible influence of water logging on phenological development in maize as hypothesized from the resultant eco region effects emphasizes the need for field experiments to verify and investigate its impact liu et al 2020 these experiments can then be used to formulate and parameterize water logging stress in the process model equations liu et al 2021 wang et al 2017 showed that improved temperature response functions trfs led to reduced uncertainty in wheat yield projections further studies should focus on comparing the performance of alternate trfs during reproductive post flowering development in maize against experimental data the bmm approach can also be applied to process based crop models wherein these point based models can be spatialized pasquel et al 2022 additionally gene based models can be integrated with crop models to determine more representative genotype specific parameters wallach et al 2018 casadebaig et al 2020 oliveira et al 2021 bmm can be used to calibrate such models to data from multi location breeding trails so that genotype dependent parameters and their environmental interactions can be disentangled 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that bayesian multi level modelling bmm is a suitable approach to account for the hierarchical structure of cultivars nested within ripening groups of a crop species while simultaneously providing insights into model deficits related to environmental factors the pooled model case bm 0 led to an over confidence in the process model parameters and comparatively poor calibration quality while accounting for the eco region and year effects bmm 1 improved calibration quality the eco region effects possibly compensated for the missing weather effects estimating eco region weather and year effects bmm 2a highlighted temperature related model deficits during reproductive development it also showed that in the absence of cultivar ripening group information the weather effects were able to capture their missing effect to some extent however accounting for cultivar ripening group information bmm 2b and bmm 3 led to more representative estimates of parameter uncertainty and clearly improved calibration performance in the full model case bmm 3 with the additional inclusion of the weather effects the eco region effects did not compensate for the missing weather effects as they did in bmm 2b eco region effects could possibly be linked to water logging stress on phenology which is not represented in the process based model furthermore between cultivar variability in posterior parameter distributions matched theoretical expectations thereby emphasizing the strength of the full multi level model thus accounting for the eco regions weather and year effects and specifically the hierarchical classification of cultivars and maize ripening groups led to better calibration and representation of parameter uncertainty as compared to the commonly used pooled approach with our approach models that have been primarily used for field scale or cultivar specific studies can be extended to regional scales although we do not explicitly correct the process model equations we account for effects of model deficits related to environmental conditions this approach also highlights model deficiencies which can facilitate model improvement these findings can be used to design dedicated experiments and data gathering procedures to support the refinement of model equations bmm could also be applied to small scale studies to account for between farm and within farm variability bmm is a valuable tool in the bayesian tool box that should be implemented in crop model

reviewers for their comments and feedback that helped to improve the manuscript appendix a weather class clustering the 3004 site years available for the study were classified into ten weather classes based on average temperatures and cumulative precipitation between april and june and between july and september k means clustering was used to define the weather classes the k means algorithm generates clusters by minimizing within cluster variance that is based on euclidean distances hartigan and wong 1979 first the average of the mean daily temperature t s y s from april to june and from july to september were calculated for each site year sy as follows a 1 t s y s 1 n s n 1 n s t s y n where s represents the season from april to june or from july to september n s is the total number of days in that season and t s y n is the mean temperature c on a given day n at site year sy similarly cumulative precipitation p s y s was also calculated from april to june and from july to september as follows a 2 p s y s n 1 n s p s y n where p s y n is the precipitation mm on a given day n at site year sy the values for each of the four factors t s y a p r j u n t s y j u l s e p p s

normalized value and k m i n min k 1 k 2 k s y and k m a x max k 1 k 2 k s y are the minimum and maximum values of the particular factor across all the site years s y 3004 respectively the kmeans function from the stats package in r was run to generate ten clusters to ensure stability of the resultant clusters 100 starting points were set the maximum number of iterations was set to 1000 and 10 clusters were specified to generate 10 weather classes appendix b spass model equations phenological development in the spass model occurs in three main phases emergence vegetative phase and reproductive phase the rate of phenological development during emergence or the emergence rate is a function of sowing depth sdep in cm and a minimum or base temperature emt in c requirement only above which emergence occurs for a particular day d between sowing and harvest if t d is the temperature then the emergence rate re d d 1 is given by b 1 re d max 0 0 5 t d emt 15 0 6 sdep the

development rate rv d d 1 is dependent on the phase specific trf fv and the maximum development rate 1 pdd1 for the vegetative phase at optimum temperature d 1 the trf scales between 0 and 1 and acts as a reduction factor on the maximum development rate when the temperature is not at the optimum b 4 rv d fv t d tminv toptv tmaxv pdd1 similarly for the reproductive phase if 1 pdd2 d 1 is the

24324,efficient farm management is one of the most important issues in achieving sustainable performance ecological footprint ef measurement and emergy analysis ea are appropriate tools to achieve the principles of sustainability in different ecosystems this study aimed to compare the indicators and determine the ecological sustainability of two cropping systems of irrigated wheat and grain maize using ecological footprint evaluation and emergy analysis in the catchment area of dez in iran in the crop year 2019 2020 for this purpose a total of 400 questionnaires from wheat and maize farmers were collected based on a simple random sampling method the results of evaluating the ecological footprint method of wheat and maize cultivation in the study area at the level of one hectare were 3 50 and 4 66 global hectares respectively also the results of total emergy inputs for the ecological system of wheat and maize production were 1 60e 16 and 2 55e 16 sej ha 1 per year respectively this study showed that the two methods ef and ea are complementary the evaluation results of both sustainability indices were very close to each other so both cultivation systems were environmentally unsustainable we also found that the ecosystem of the irrigated wheat production system is more desirable than the ecosystem of the maize production system in terms of yield renewability and environmental sustainability since both cropping systems are strongly affected by the purchased inputs more than 95 as a result they create a high environmental pressure which shows the apprehensive condition of the current agricultural production systems in iran this study is the first study from iran that uses these two tools simultaneously to determine the sustainability assessment of two strategic products of the region graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cereals emergy indicators environmental impact assessment global hectare sustainable agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid economic and demographic growth is closely linked to the over exploitation of natural resources zhai et al 2017 the over exploitation of natural resources and agricultural activities has resulted in the increasing degradation extent of the environment pata 2021 population growth increases the demand for food production energy consumption and economic development sarkodie et al 2019 agriculture is a key economic sector in developing countries development human well being and economic prosperity of society are highly dependent on the development of supply chains in the agricultural industry currently development has accelerated the demand for food and fuel and raised concerns about competition between land resources the need for freshwater energy and the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 the share of agriculture in greenhouse gas emissions is 14 amiri et al 2020 irrigated agriculture is a vital component of total agriculture and the largest exploiter of global freshwater with about 85 consumption of the resources silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 in iran wheat and maize are the main products improper use of inputs like chemical fertilizers pesticides fossil fuels machinery etc causes irreversible environmental damage poor management lack of supervision and improper use of pesticides and fertilizers are the main challenges in the study area pilevar et al 2020 in addition agricultural research that aims to enhance crop yield in various systems overlooks the imposed costs on the environment this has led to unfavorable environmental consequences for agricultural ecosystems altieri 2018 located in the warm and dry climatic region iran copes with several environmental problems including the water crisis and uncontrolled water consumption and agricultural inputs on the other hand farmers unlimited access to the dez river has led to the overconsumption of water resources to reduce these adverse environmental effects the idea of sustainable agriculture and the transformation of agriculture from high input to low input consumption and the use of methods to increase the sustainability of agricultural systems for the planet is very important sarkar et al 2020 an agricultural system is sustainable when it is technically feasible economically justifiable politically appropriate administratively viable socially acceptable and environmentally friendly ebrahimian et al 2017 over the past two decades several methods have been proposed to assess the environment among which the ecological footprint ress wackernagel 1999 has been widely used because of its ease of understanding the footprint index determines the amount of pressure on nature caused by man or other man made systems agostinho and pereira 2013 ecological footprint has been suggested as a powerful communication tool due to its ability to inform people about the environmental effects of overproduction and consumption ecological footprint estimates the amount of productive land needed to compensate for the environmental impacts of a particular activity by calculating resource consumption and carbon dioxide production fang et al 2014 inputs especially chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in agricultural systems create large traces of carbon production according to studies each hectare of land can absorb 1 8 tons of carbon the carbon uptake criterion is used as a basis for assessing the ecological footprint therefore to evaluate the ecological footprint in terms of carbon the energy index was used and to determine the energy index there are special equivalent factors that use the amount of energy from the impact of each of the factors affecting the environment is estimated in terms of the global average per hectare gha 1 1 global hectares naderi mahdei et al 2015 the key concept in calculating the ecological footprint is to use the same unit for the calculations which simplifies the comparison and analysis compare to environmental impact assessment methods in which the assessment criteria are completely qualitative the ecological footprint has an advantageous quantitative basis for decision making this ability has led to the introduction of the ecological footprint method as an indicator for measuring the sustainability of communities galli et al 2013 index david scienceman 1983 is another effective tool at the agroecosystem level that assumes systems as a network of energy flows which by evaluating all the inputs and energies purchased it determines the sustainability of a cultivation system in terms of energy consumption emergy analysis is a valuable indicator that has become a mature tool for ecological economic assessment and can be a more comprehensive alternative to many existing methods for environmentally friendly decisions emergy on the other hand is a type of energy that is used directly or indirectly to produce a product or service emergy analysis is an agroecosystem analysis method that evaluates all inputs including free and non renewable inputs purchased energy and services and aims to examine the sustainability of an agroecosystem in terms of energy consumption emergy is sometimes referred to as energy memory hercher pasteur et al 2020 over the past three decades emergy has proven to be an effective and powerful tool that can be used to support the flow of natural ecosystem resources and the macroeconomic system as well as to measure overall performance and sustainability the emergy approach s main advantage is that it can comprehensively evaluate the system s stability by converting all currents and natural and economic resources into solar energy units zhang et al 2012 evaluation of the sustainability of production is a quantitative approach that determines the changes in the systems among the various techniques for calculating production sustainability emergy analysis is considered a suitable method amiri et al 2019 using these two methods various research projects have been conducted concerning the energy of inputs and evaluation of the sustainability of agricultural products and systems naderi mahdei and colleagues 2015 used ecological footprint analysis in a study to compare the environmental sustainability assessment of conventional systems with conservation tillage systems the results showed that both cropping systems were unstable however it was proved that conservation systems are more environmentally friendly and more sustainable in a study kissinger and gottlieb 2012 widely acknowledged the role of ecological footprint analysis as an indicator of sustainability they analyzed three approaches to footprint arguing that integrating all approaches could create a better and more comprehensive indicator of sustainability that would be able to support sustainable resource management ghaley and porter 2013 used emergy analysis to compare the evaluation of the stability of the combined food and energy system with the conventional wheat production system to produce food forage and energy without chemicals fertilizers herbicides and fungicides the results showed that the cfe system requires significantly fewer resources and tends to produce more sustainably houshyar et al 2018 used emergy evaluation to study the environmental effects of wheat and maize cultivation systems in a study the results showed that the environmental loading ratio of maize was much higher than wheat cultivation therefore compared to wheat production they recommended that maize production should be continued with much more care especially in terms of utilization of nitrogen and water consumption considering that the purpose of catchment management is planning and activities to achieve an ecologically and economically sound catchment this study aimed at evaluating the sustainability of irrigated wheat and maize in the dez catchment area as one of the main hubs for the production of strategic crops in khuzestan province iran the results of comparing these indicators lead to planning and management decisions that can be used to minimize the environmental damage caused by agricultural activities 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is part of the dez catchment in khuzestan province iran which is between 48 9 to 48 56 east longitude and 32 39 to 31 35 north latitude the area of the basin in this area is 5085 26 square kilometers the dez river basin as a third grade basin is a subset of the greater karun basin that is subdivided into a larger subset of the persian and oman gulf arid and semi arid climates constitute the largest area of the study area the average annual rainfall is 350 mm the quality of lands in the region is optimal in terms of agriculture most of the soil in the region is clay also the average slope in the study area is 4 6 which indicates that the lands of the study area are flat the main agricultural products of the region include barley rapeseed alfalfa citrus sugarcane rice and vegetables with a predominance of wheat and maize this region is very important in terms of agricultural use and is one of the most important centers of agricultural production in khuzestan and iran fig 1 shows the location of the study area in khuzestan province and iran 2 2 statistical population the statistical population is all farmers exploiting the dez irrigation catchment in the northern parts of khuzestan province using the common or traditional cultivation system in terms of rotation of grain maize and irrigated wheat cochran s formula was used to determine the sample size the sample size was based on cochran s formula with an error level of 0 05 due to the uncertainty of the statistical population 384 people answered the questionnaires and were included in the statistical analysis finally based on a simple random sampling method interviews with 400 selected farmers in the study area were conducted by a questionnaire the validity of which was confirmed by a panel of experts cronbach s alpha method was also used to determine the reliability of the questionnaire the alpha number was estimated to be 0 84 which indicates that the reliability level of the questionnaire is good and acceptable 2 3 data sources it should be noted that data related to in farm production processes such as crop practice and irrigation etc for both crops in the region were collected by a questionnaire at the level of top farmers data on erosion soil organic matter and agricultural data of the region were kindly provided by the agricultural jihad organization of khuzestan province also information on renewable environmental inputs including sunlight rain and wind was kindly provided by the general meteorological department of khuzestan province the method of the present study has a practical approach because it is in line with achieving sustainable agricultural development this research was carried out in the cropping year of 2019 2020 in a part of the dez catchment in this study to determine sustainability indicators based on reputable international institutions and environmental indicators of iran an ecological footprint index and emergy analysis of agricultural products were selected in fact by measuring and analyzing these two methods it is possible to determine the level of sustainability of cultivation systems or crops also to prepare the map of the area under cultivation of the irrigated wheat crop satellite images related to 13 04 2021 and the area under cultivation of grain maize the images related to 17 09 2020 landsat 8 satellite oli operational land imager sensor were used the reason for selecting these images at the mentioned times was the availability of appropriate images considering the growth period and identifiability of the products therefore according to fig 2 taken from satellite images the total area under irrigated wheat cultivation was 103 371 12 hectares and grain maize was 127 785 38 hectares in the study area 2 4 method of ecological footprint to determine the environmental sustainability of agriculture we used the modified ecological footprint method presented by kissinger and gottlieb 2012 and guzman et al 2013 in this study the following eqs 1 3 were used to compare the sustainability of two crops of irrigated wheat and maize 1 e f t i 1 n e f i e i t c o 2 e i f i e q f 1000 3 t p c e c o c k eft ecological footprint index in terms

the system and drawing an emergy diagram fig 3 then the emergy table was created to calculate the emergy of reservoir and system flows then all these values including units of mass energy money etc are multiplied by their respective conversion rates and all are converted to emergy units amiri et al 2020 emergy unit the sej and the unit of transfer of the energy conversion factor sej ha 1 j is the solar joule per joule kohkan et al 2018 then the sustainability of the systems was evaluated using the value of emergy indicators to calculate emergy indices all inputs were divided into four groups renewable environmental inputs r renewable purchased inputs fr non renewable environmental inputs n and non renewable purchased inputs fn in this study the yield of wheat maize and straw was considered as the system output this classification differs with different ecosystems fallahinejad et al 2021 independent samples t test was performed between the two crops to determine whether there are differences in the evaluation of ecological footprint and emergy analysis the details of calculations related to the evaluation of inputs are provided in the appendix in general to compare the sustainability of the two crops three steps were taken based on an integrated quantitative and qualitative modeling approach see fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 ecological footprint evaluation 3 1 1 cultivation of irrigated wheat based on the use of inputs in the study area our findings showed the ecological footprint method of irrigated wheat cultivation of 3 50 global hectares see eq 4 4 e f i 1 12 e f i 46535 87 m j 1000 0 85 20 0 314 1000000 1 8 t o n 3 50 g h a 3 1 2 cultivation of grain maize the ecological footprint for grain maize cultivation was 4 66 global hectares see eq 5 5 e f i 1 12 e f i 61899 72 m j 1000 0 85 20 0 314 1000000 1 8 t o n 4 66 g h a 3 1 3 comparison of ecological footprints of wheat and maize based on the values obtained from eqs 4 and 5 and table 1 the results of ecological footprint evaluation for wheat and maize showed that both cropping systems in the region are in an unsustainable state in terms of the environment mean comparison results of the evaluation of ecological footprint between two crops showed that there is no significant difference between ecological footprint in wheat and maize table 2 in this study maize was more unsustainable in terms of high consumption of inputs and environmental effects the land required to compensate for the environmental effects of these two crops is not enough since these systems produce 1 7 tons and 2 86 tons of excess carbon to produce wheat and maize respectively these amounts are more than the ecological capacity of one hectare to absorb environmental pollution for both wheat and maize crops nitrate fertilizer with 40 85 and 49 36 diesel fuel with 18 57 and 17 60 and water consumption with 14 57 and 16 31 respectively had the greatest impact on environmental instability in the study area the decreased ecological potential of agricultural lands and increased environmental pollution due to high consumption of inputs especially chemical fertilizers diesel fuel and subsequent increase in soil salinity and acidity have caused the ecological footprint of agriculture to increase alarmingly in the study area fig 5 shows a comparison chart of the energy percentage of inputs in irrigated wheat and maize in this study the high ecological footprint of traditional agriculture was consistent with previous studies naderi mahdei et al 2015 kissinger and gottlieb 2012 bevec et al 2011 also the important role of nitrate fertilizer and fossil fuels in increasing environmental hazards and ecological unsustainability was consistent with fallahpour et al 2012 it should be noted that no study was found to contradict the findings of this part of the study 3 2 emergy analysis table 3 shows the analysis of data related to inputs and outputs and emergy evaluation for each product in the study area the results of total emergy inputs for the ecological system of wheat and maize production were 1 60e 16 and 2 55e 16 sej ha 1 per year respectively according to the questionnaire since the straw produce of grain maize has no economic value it was not included in the emergy analysis 3 2 1 comparison of emergy analysis between wheat and maize the results showed that the ecosystems for the production of both crops are in an environmentally unsustainable condition there was no significant difference p 0 05 between emergy inputs in wheat and maize cultivation table 4 however wheat cultivation was more sustainable compared to grain maize due to less input consumption and less pressure on the environment the highest emergy consumption for both wheat and maize crops was related to nitrate fertilizer with 60 79 and 61 14 followed by phosphate fertilizer with 22 75 and 26 51 respectively fig 6 diagrams a comparison of the emergy inputs between irrigated wheat and maize cultivation in terms of sej ha 1 in the study area in the study of amiri and colleagues 2019 the emergy analysis of rapeseed cultivation in lorestan province iran revealed that the highest emergy consumption was related to nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers with 3 09e 10 and 2 82e 10 sej ha 1 respectively in the study of houshyar et al 2018 in jahrom city fars province iran the highest emergy consumption was obtained for nitrogen fertilizer and groundwater with 9 56e 15 and 1 77e 16 for wheat and 2 16e 16 and 1 50e 16 sej ha 1 for maize respectively in the ghaley and porter study 2013 in denmark total emergy of 1 33e 16 sej ha 1 was obtained on wheat cultivation and the highest emergy consumption was related to nitrogen fertilizer with 57 8 in contradiction with the findings of this study wang et al 2014 report on grain fields showed that corn cultivation was more sustainable than wheat due to the small scale of the fields and the higher consumption of inputs 3 2 2 the flow of emergy inputs in production systems table 5 shows the flow of important resources and inputs for wheat and maize cropping systems along with the amount equations and characteristics of emergy indicators for evaluating these cultivation ecosystems 3 2 2 1 renewable environmental inputs r the share of renewable environmental inputs from the total emergy input in the two ecosystems of the wheat and maize systems was low 1 29 and 0 9 respectively which indicates a low dependence on renewable environmental resources wheat production in the region also showed more dependence on renewable environmental resources in a similar study by houshyar and colleagues 2018 this value was 0 87 and 0 17 for wheat and maize ecosystems respectively 3 2 2 2 non renewable environmental inputs n in this study soil erosion was considered a non renewable environmental source the share of soil erosion from the total emergy input in both ecosystems in the study area was 3 53e 13 sej ha 1 the relatively high rate of soil erosion indicates the fragile nature of agricultural lands in the region in a similar study the share of soil erosion for maize in the us state of kansas was reported to be 2 16e 14 sej ha 1 martin et al 2006 in another study the value for wheat production was 5 55e 13 sej ha 1 ghaley and porter 2013 3 2 2 3 renewable and non renewable purchased inputs fr fn non renewable inputs from total purchased resources had the largest share in both cropping systems the share of renewable emergy resources in wheat and maize production systems was 3 32 and 3 09 and for non renewable was 95 17 and 95 88 respectively the emergy inputs purchased for the two products studied were almost identical among all the inputs purchased chemical fertilizers nitrate and phosphate and fossil fuels had the largest share which emphasizes the strong influence of purchased inputs on these ecosystems therefore minimizing the consumption of these inputs by managing the purchased inputs and their efficient use in the production process is essential in a similar study the emergy of purchased inputs in wheat cultivation was 1 29e 16 sej ha 1 and the highest emergy was related to nitrogen fertilizer with 57 8 ghaley and porter 2013 in another study in both wheat and maize cultivation the share of purchased resources was about 97 of all the inputs purchased the highest share of emergy was related to nitrogen fertilizer with 83 89 and 86 48 in wheat and maize production systems respectively houshyar et al 2018 fig 7 shows the emergy flow category in wheat and maize production systems 3 2 3 comparison of emergy indicators for the selected products the most important indicators that were used in agro ecosystems to compare the two cropping systems of wheat and maize in this study include the following 3 2 3 1 emergy yield ratio eyr the emergy yield ratio is calculated by dividing the total emergy output by the emergy of the purchased market inputs this index was 2 03 and 1 01 for the wheat and maize ecosystems respectively indicating that these two cropping systems have a low dependence on free environmental inputs the irrigated wheat production system had a higher eyr value due to less consumption of purchased inputs which shows that this system is more efficient in emergy consumption a higher value of this index is more desirable 3 2 3 2 emergy investment ratio eir this index measures the ratio of total purchased emergy inputs to total free inputs the eir values for wheat and maize production systems were calculated to be 65 30 and 94 82 respectively these values show the greater dependence of the maize production system on the purchased inputs and the greater utilization of the wheat production system from free environmental resources questionnaire information indicated unreasonable use of some inputs purchased by farmers including chemical fertilizers and diesel fuel which increased this index in the ecosystem of maize so the economic efficiency of the ecosystem of irrigated wheat was higher than the ecosystem of maize in the study area 3 2 3 3 emergy self sufficiency ratio esr this ratio is obtained by dividing the total emergy of the environmental inputs by the emergy efficiency of the products this index refers to the degree to which the agricultural system relies on its internal resources and the higher its value the more desirable it is esr values for wheat and maize production systems in the study area were calculated to be 0 007 and 0 010 respectively 3 2 3 4 environmental sustainability index esi this index is obtained by dividing the emergy yield ratio by the environmental load ratio the esi values for wheat and maize production systems were 0 026 and 0 009 respectively the values of both systems are close to each other and very low so both cropping systems do not have the desired level of sustainability and put a lot of environmental pressure the higher value of this index in the ecosystem of wheat production compared to the ecosystem of maize indicates more economic sustainability of wheat cultivation in the study area 3 2 3 5 renewable emergy ratio r the renewable emergy ratio is calculated by dividing the renewable emergy inputs by the total emergy input this index shows the share of renewable resources in total production resources and its high means that the system is more dependent on renewable resources and as a result its higher sustainability in this study emergy renewability index for wheat and maize production systems were 4 61 and 3 99 respectively indicating that the sustainability of the wheat ecosystem in the long run is higher than the maize ecosystem 3 2 3 6 environmental loading ratio elr this index is the ratio obtained from the sum of total emergy consumption of purchased inputs and non renewable environmental resources to free renewable environmental resources this index was 76 65 and 109 51 for wheat and maize production systems respectively high values of the elr index in this study indicate very high environmental pressure and stress by market purchased and non renewable environmental inputs of the two cropping systems that cause a lot of pressure on the environment therefore the lower amount of this index in the wheat ecosystem indicates less pressure and less environmental load on this ecosystem 3 2 3 7 modified environmental load ratio index elr this index is calculated from the ratio of non renewable emergy sources to renewable ones the elr index or modified version of the environmental load ratio was proposed by ortega et al in 2002 asgharipour et al 2019 elr like the environmental load index refers to the environmental pressure created by an agricultural system and consequently higher elr values just like elr indicate higher environmental pressures and stresses this index for irrigated wheat and maize production systems was 20 69 and 24 04 respectively table 6 shows the comparison of emergy indices for different cultivation systems with previous studies 4 conclusions crops such as wheat and maize are increasingly grown in dez catchment lands these two crops are still important in government programs and farmers cultivation patterns therefore due to human centered droughts lack of water strategy in the country water bankruptcy in the country inefficient and unbalanced agriculture and finally improper consumption of input it is essential to achieve a correct understanding of sustained production in this region on the other hand iran has high water stress as the agriculture sector uses 90 of the country s renewable water therefore all these factors are a serious threat to agriculture and food security since environmental sustainability assessment is one of the most important tools in the sustainable development planning process it is inevitable to pay attention to it in policy making and planning in recent years two scientific tools ecological footprint ef and emergy analysis ea have been widely used around the world to measure human impact on nature and determine the sustainability of systems this is the first study from iran in the field of sustainable agriculture that has simultaneously used both tools to evaluate the sustainability of two strategic products the present study attempted to compare the indicators and determine the ecological sustainability of the two irrigated systems of wheat and maize to introduce a more sustainable and environmentally friendly crop in the dez catchment this study showed that one evident imperfection of the ecological footprint method is that some natural inputs such as surface soil erosion cannot be calculated but in emergy analysis these resources are calculated and in fact separate renewable and non renewable resources in this way improving the methodology of the ecological footprint considering the strong points of the emergy methodology could be a good alternative therefore the possibility of obtaining one better index of sustainability through the junction of ecological footprint with emergy index thus this study showed that the two methods ecological footprint and emergy analysis are complementary and each considers a specific aspect of a system but emergy analysis due to its multiple indicators and attention to environmental inputs deals with more and more fundamental details about sustainability the evaluation results of both sustainability indicators were very close to each other so the total consumption inputs for both products chemical fertilizers especially nitrate and phosphate and then diesel have the most impact on environmental unsustainability in the study area the findings of this study illustrated the sensitivity of the over consumption of inputs in the regional economy and environmental performance since the farming systems in our study area rely more on purchased inputs they create higher environmental pressure also the very low value of esi environmental sustainability index for both systems indicated that both cropping systems have an unfavorable level of sustainability the higher value of this index in the ecosystem of wheat production compared to the maize system indicates the greater sustainability of the wheat cultivation economy in the study area therefore the need for more non renewable inputs in the production process of these two crops itself reduces the sustainability of the system and causes energy imbalance this indicates the worrying situation of the current agricultural production systems in iran relying more on the optimal use of renewable energy sources is a key point in the sustainability of production systems therefore due to the high dependence of production systems on non renewable inputs in this study to optimize the consumption of these inputs and increase environmental and economic sustainability we suggest advising farmers on the proper use of fertilizers and chemical pesticides implementing policies aimed at promoting the use of renewable energy creating job opportunities among farmers modernizing worn out agricultural machinery electric watering pumps by government financial support promoting the use of green fuel to replace fossil fuels for transportation purposes and as a final result the ecosystem of the irrigated wheat production is more desirable than grain maize in terms of yield renewability and environmental sustainability therefore the production of both crops especially maize must be managed with the highest accuracy and in respect of environmental aspects and impacts in the region since there are few scientific studies in iran on the sustainable management of agricultural farms it is worthwhile to continue further research in this field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we thank anonymous

24324,efficient farm management is one of the most important issues in achieving sustainable performance ecological footprint ef measurement and emergy analysis ea are appropriate tools to achieve the principles of sustainability in different ecosystems this study aimed to compare the indicators and determine the ecological sustainability of two cropping systems of irrigated wheat and grain maize using ecological footprint evaluation and emergy analysis in the catchment area of dez in iran in the crop year 2019 2020 for this purpose a total of 400 questionnaires from wheat and maize farmers were collected based on a simple random sampling method the results of evaluating the ecological footprint method of wheat and maize cultivation in the study area at the level of one hectare were 3 50 and 4 66 global hectares respectively also the results of total emergy inputs for the ecological system of wheat and maize production were 1 60e 16 and 2 55e 16 sej ha 1 per year respectively this study showed that the two methods ef and ea are complementary the evaluation results of both sustainability indices were very close to each other so both cultivation systems were environmentally unsustainable we also found that the ecosystem of the irrigated wheat production system is more desirable than the ecosystem of the maize production system in terms of yield renewability and environmental sustainability since both cropping systems are strongly affected by the purchased inputs more than 95 as a result they create a high environmental pressure which shows the apprehensive condition of the current agricultural production systems in iran this study is the first study from iran that uses these two tools simultaneously to determine the sustainability assessment of two strategic products of the region graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cereals emergy indicators environmental impact assessment global hectare sustainable agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid economic and demographic growth is closely linked to the over exploitation of natural resources zhai et al 2017 the over exploitation of natural resources and agricultural activities has resulted in the increasing degradation extent of the environment pata 2021 population growth increases the demand for food production energy consumption and economic development sarkodie et al 2019 agriculture is a key economic sector in developing countries development human well being and economic prosperity of society are highly dependent on the development of supply chains in the agricultural industry currently development has accelerated the demand for food and fuel and raised concerns about competition between land resources the need for freshwater energy and the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 the share of agriculture in greenhouse gas emissions is 14 amiri et al 2020 irrigated agriculture is a vital component of total agriculture and the largest exploiter of global freshwater with about 85 consumption of the resources silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 in iran wheat and maize are the main products improper use of inputs like chemical fertilizers pesticides fossil fuels machinery etc causes irreversible environmental damage poor management lack of supervision and improper use of pesticides and fertilizers are the main challenges in the study area pilevar et al 2020 in addition agricultural research that aims to enhance crop yield in various systems overlooks the imposed costs on the environment this has led to unfavorable environmental consequences for agricultural ecosystems altieri 2018 located in the warm and dry climatic region iran copes with several environmental problems including the water crisis and uncontrolled water consumption and agricultural inputs on the other hand farmers unlimited access to the dez river has led to the overconsumption of water resources to reduce these adverse environmental effects the idea of sustainable agriculture and the transformation of agriculture from high input to low input consumption and the use of methods to increase the sustainability of agricultural systems for the planet is very important sarkar et al 2020 an agricultural system is sustainable when it is technically feasible economically justifiable politically appropriate administratively viable socially acceptable and environmentally friendly ebrahimian et al 2017 over the past two decades several methods have been proposed to assess the environment among which the ecological footprint ress wackernagel 1999 has been widely used because of its ease of understanding the footprint index determines the amount of pressure on nature caused by man or other man made systems agostinho and pereira 2013 ecological footprint has been suggested as a powerful communication tool due to its ability to inform people about the environmental effects of overproduction and consumption ecological footprint estimates the amount of productive land needed to compensate for the environmental impacts of a particular activity by calculating resource consumption and carbon dioxide production fang et al 2014 inputs especially chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in agricultural systems create large traces of carbon production according to studies each hectare of land can absorb 1 8 tons of carbon the carbon uptake criterion is used as a basis for assessing the ecological footprint therefore to evaluate the ecological footprint in terms of carbon the energy index was used and to determine the energy index there are special equivalent factors that use the amount of energy from the impact of each of the factors affecting the environment is estimated in terms of the global average per hectare gha 1 1 global hectares naderi mahdei et al 2015 the key concept in calculating the ecological footprint is to use the same unit for the calculations which simplifies the comparison and analysis compare to environmental impact assessment methods in which the assessment criteria are completely qualitative the ecological footprint has an advantageous quantitative basis for decision making this ability has led to the introduction of the ecological footprint method as an indicator for measuring the sustainability of communities galli et al 2013 index david scienceman 1983 is another effective tool at the agroecosystem level that assumes systems as a network of energy flows which by evaluating all the inputs and energies purchased it determines the sustainability of a cultivation system in terms of energy consumption emergy analysis is a valuable indicator that has become a mature tool for ecological economic assessment and can be a more comprehensive alternative to many existing methods for environmentally friendly decisions emergy on the other hand is a type of energy that is used directly or indirectly to produce a product or service emergy analysis is an agroecosystem analysis method that evaluates all inputs including free and non renewable inputs purchased energy and services and aims to examine the sustainability of an agroecosystem in terms of energy consumption emergy is sometimes referred to as energy memory hercher pasteur et al 2020 over the past three decades emergy has proven to be an effective and powerful tool that can be used to support the flow of natural ecosystem resources and the macroeconomic system as well as to measure overall performance and sustainability the emergy approach s main advantage is that it can comprehensively evaluate the system s stability by converting all currents and natural and economic resources into solar energy units zhang et al 2012 evaluation of the sustainability of production is a quantitative approach that determines the changes in the systems among the various techniques for calculating production sustainability emergy analysis is considered a suitable method amiri et al 2019 using these two methods various research projects have been conducted concerning the energy of inputs and evaluation of the sustainability of agricultural products and systems naderi mahdei and colleagues 2015 used ecological footprint analysis in a study to compare the environmental sustainability assessment of conventional systems with conservation tillage systems the results showed that both cropping systems were unstable however it was proved that conservation systems are more environmentally friendly and more sustainable in a study kissinger and gottlieb 2012 widely acknowledged the role of ecological footprint analysis as an indicator of sustainability they analyzed three approaches to footprint arguing that integrating all approaches could create a better and more comprehensive indicator of sustainability that would be able to support sustainable resource management ghaley and porter 2013 used emergy analysis to compare the evaluation of the stability of the combined food and energy system with the conventional wheat production system to produce food forage and energy without chemicals fertilizers herbicides and fungicides the results showed that the cfe system requires significantly fewer resources and tends to produce more sustainably houshyar et al 2018 used emergy evaluation to study the environmental effects of wheat and maize cultivation systems in a study the results showed that the environmental loading ratio of maize was much higher than wheat cultivation therefore compared to wheat production they recommended that maize production should be continued with much more care especially in terms of utilization of nitrogen and water consumption considering that the purpose of catchment management is planning and activities to achieve an ecologically and economically sound catchment this study aimed at evaluating the sustainability of irrigated wheat and maize in the dez catchment area as one of the main hubs for the production of strategic crops in khuzestan province iran the results of comparing these indicators lead to planning and management decisions that can be used to minimize the environmental damage caused by agricultural activities 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is part of the dez catchment in khuzestan province iran which is between 48 9 to 48 56 east longitude and 32 39 to 31 35 north latitude the area of the basin in this area is 5085 26 square kilometers the dez river basin as a third grade basin is a subset of the greater karun basin that is subdivided into a larger subset of the persian and oman gulf arid and semi arid climates constitute the largest area of the study area the average annual rainfall is 350 mm the quality of lands in the region is optimal in terms of agriculture most of the soil in the region is clay also the average slope in the study area is 4 6 which indicates that the lands of the study area are flat the main agricultural products of the region include barley rapeseed alfalfa citrus sugarcane rice and vegetables with a predominance of wheat and maize this region is very important in terms of agricultural use and is one of the most important centers of agricultural production in khuzestan and iran fig 1 shows the location of the study area in khuzestan province and iran 2 2 statistical population the statistical population is all farmers exploiting the dez irrigation catchment in the northern parts of khuzestan province using the common or traditional cultivation system in terms of rotation of grain maize and irrigated wheat cochran s formula was used to determine the sample size the sample size was based on cochran s formula with an error level of 0 05 due to the uncertainty of the statistical population 384 people answered the questionnaires and were included in the statistical analysis finally based on a simple random sampling method interviews with 400 selected farmers in the study area were conducted by a questionnaire the validity of which was confirmed by a panel of experts cronbach s alpha method was also used to determine the reliability of the questionnaire the alpha number was estimated to be 0 84 which indicates that the reliability level of the questionnaire is good and acceptable 2 3 data sources it should be noted that data related to in farm production processes such as crop practice and irrigation etc for both crops in the region were collected by a questionnaire at the level of top farmers data on erosion soil organic matter and agricultural data of the region were kindly provided by the agricultural jihad organization of khuzestan province also information on renewable environmental inputs including sunlight rain and wind was kindly provided by the general meteorological department of khuzestan province the method of the present study has a practical approach because it is in line with achieving sustainable agricultural development this research was carried out in the cropping year of 2019 2020 in a part of the dez catchment in this study to determine sustainability indicators based on reputable international institutions and environmental indicators of iran an ecological footprint index and emergy analysis of agricultural products were selected in fact by measuring and analyzing these two methods it is possible to determine the level of sustainability of cultivation systems or crops also to prepare the map of the area under cultivation of the irrigated wheat crop satellite images related to 13 04 2021 and the area under cultivation of grain maize the images related to 17 09 2020 landsat 8 satellite oli operational land imager sensor were used the reason for selecting these images at the mentioned times was the availability of appropriate images considering the growth period and identifiability of the products therefore according to fig 2 taken from satellite images the total area under irrigated wheat cultivation was 103 371 12 hectares and grain maize was 127 785 38 hectares in the study area 2 4 method of ecological footprint to determine the environmental sustainability of agriculture we used the modified ecological footprint method presented by kissinger and gottlieb 2012 and guzman et al 2013 in this study the following eqs 1 3 were used to compare the sustainability of two crops of irrigated wheat and maize 1 e f t i 1 n e f i e i t c o 2 e i f i e q f 1000 3 t p c e c o c k eft ecological footprint index in terms

the system and drawing an emergy diagram fig 3 then the emergy table was created to calculate the emergy of reservoir and system flows then all these values including units of mass energy money etc are multiplied by their respective conversion rates and all are converted to emergy units amiri et al 2020 emergy unit the sej and the unit of transfer of the energy conversion factor sej ha 1 j is the solar joule per joule kohkan et al 2018 then the sustainability of the systems was evaluated using the value of emergy indicators to calculate emergy indices all inputs were divided into four groups renewable environmental inputs r renewable purchased inputs fr non renewable environmental inputs n and non renewable purchased inputs fn in this study the yield of wheat maize and straw was considered as the system output this classification differs with different ecosystems fallahinejad et al 2021 independent samples t test was performed between the two crops to determine whether there are differences in the evaluation of ecological footprint and emergy analysis the details of calculations related to the evaluation of inputs are provided in the appendix in general to compare the sustainability of the two crops three steps were taken based on an integrated quantitative and qualitative modeling approach see fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 ecological footprint evaluation 3 1 1 cultivation of irrigated wheat based on the use of inputs in the study area our findings showed the ecological footprint method of irrigated wheat cultivation of 3 50 global hectares see eq 4 4 e f

i 1 12 e f i 61899 72 m j 1000 0 85 20 0 314 1000000 1 8 t o n 4 66 g h a 3 1 3 comparison of ecological footprints of wheat and maize based on the values obtained from eqs 4 and 5 and table 1 the results of ecological footprint evaluation for wheat and maize showed that both cropping systems in the region are in an unsustainable state in terms of the environment mean comparison results of the evaluation of ecological footprint between two crops showed that there is no significant difference between ecological footprint in wheat and maize table 2 in this study maize was more unsustainable in terms of high consumption of inputs and environmental effects the land required to compensate for the environmental effects of these two crops is not enough since these systems produce 1 7 tons and 2 86 tons of excess carbon to produce wheat and maize respectively these amounts are more than the ecological capacity of one hectare to absorb environmental pollution for both wheat and maize crops nitrate fertilizer with 40 85 and 49 36 diesel fuel with 18 57 and 17 60 and water consumption with 14 57 and 16 31 respectively had the greatest impact on environmental instability in the study area the decreased ecological potential of agricultural lands and increased environmental pollution due to high consumption of inputs especially chemical fertilizers diesel fuel and subsequent increase in soil salinity and acidity have caused the ecological footprint of agriculture to increase alarmingly in the study area fig 5 shows a comparison chart of the energy percentage of inputs in irrigated wheat and maize in this study the high ecological footprint of traditional agriculture was consistent with previous studies naderi mahdei et al 2015 kissinger and gottlieb 2012 bevec et al 2011 also the important role of nitrate fertilizer and fossil fuels in increasing environmental hazards and ecological unsustainability was consistent with fallahpour et al 2012 it should be noted that no study was found to contradict the findings of this part of the study 3 2 emergy analysis table 3 shows the analysis of data related to inputs and outputs and emergy evaluation for each product in the study area the results of total emergy inputs for the ecological system of wheat and maize production were 1 60e 16 and 2 55e 16 sej ha 1 per year respectively according to the questionnaire since the straw produce of grain maize has no economic value it was not included in the emergy analysis 3 2 1 comparison of emergy analysis between wheat and maize the results showed that the ecosystems for the production of both crops are in an environmentally unsustainable condition there was no significant difference p 0 05 between emergy inputs in wheat and maize cultivation table 4 however wheat cultivation was more sustainable compared to grain maize due to less input consumption and less pressure on the environment the highest emergy consumption for both wheat and maize crops was related to nitrate fertilizer with 60 79 and 61 14 followed by phosphate fertilizer with 22 75 and 26 51 respectively fig 6 diagrams a comparison of the emergy inputs between irrigated wheat and maize cultivation in terms of sej ha 1 in the study area in the study of amiri and colleagues 2019 the emergy analysis of rapeseed cultivation in lorestan province iran revealed that the highest emergy consumption was related to nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers with 3 09e 10 and 2 82e 10 sej ha 1 respectively in the study of houshyar et al 2018 in jahrom city fars province iran the highest emergy consumption was obtained for nitrogen fertilizer and groundwater with 9 56e 15 and 1 77e 16 for wheat and 2 16e 16 and 1 50e 16 sej ha 1 for maize respectively in the ghaley and porter study 2013 in denmark total emergy of 1 33e 16 sej ha 1 was obtained on wheat cultivation and the highest emergy consumption was related to nitrogen fertilizer with 57 8 in contradiction with the findings of this study wang et al 2014 report on grain fields showed that corn cultivation was more sustainable than wheat due to the small scale of the fields and the higher consumption of inputs 3 2 2 the flow of emergy inputs in production systems table 5 shows the flow of important resources and inputs for wheat and maize cropping systems along with the amount equations and characteristics of emergy indicators for evaluating these cultivation ecosystems 3 2 2 1 renewable environmental inputs r the share of renewable environmental inputs from the total emergy input in the two ecosystems of the wheat and maize systems was low 1 29 and 0 9 respectively which indicates a low dependence on renewable environmental resources wheat production in the region also showed more dependence on renewable environmental resources in a similar study by houshyar and colleagues 2018 this value was 0 87 and 0 17 for wheat and maize ecosystems respectively 3 2 2 2 non renewable environmental inputs n in this study soil erosion was considered a non renewable environmental source the share of soil erosion from the total emergy input in both ecosystems in the study area was 3 53e 13 sej ha 1 the relatively high rate of soil erosion indicates the fragile nature of agricultural lands in the region in a similar study the share of soil erosion for maize in the us state of kansas was reported to be 2 16e 14 sej ha 1 martin et al 2006 in another study the value for wheat production was 5 55e 13 sej ha 1 ghaley and porter 2013 3 2 2 3 renewable and non renewable purchased inputs fr fn non renewable inputs from total purchased resources had the largest share in both cropping systems the share of renewable emergy resources in wheat and maize production systems was 3 32 and 3 09 and for non renewable was 95 17 and 95 88 respectively the emergy inputs purchased for the two products studied were almost identical among all the inputs purchased chemical fertilizers nitrate and phosphate and fossil fuels had the largest share which emphasizes the strong influence of purchased inputs on these ecosystems therefore minimizing the consumption of these inputs by managing the purchased inputs and their efficient use in the production process is essential in a similar study the emergy of purchased inputs in wheat cultivation was 1 29e 16 sej ha 1 and the highest emergy was related to nitrogen fertilizer with 57 8 ghaley and porter 2013 in another study in both wheat and maize cultivation the share of purchased resources was about 97 of all the inputs purchased the highest share of emergy was related to nitrogen fertilizer with 83 89 and 86 48 in wheat and maize production systems respectively houshyar et al 2018 fig 7 shows the emergy flow category in wheat and maize production systems 3 2 3 comparison of emergy indicators for the selected products the most important indicators that were used in agro ecosystems to compare the two cropping systems of wheat and maize in this study include the following 3 2 3 1 emergy yield ratio eyr the emergy yield ratio is calculated by dividing the total emergy output by the emergy of the purchased market inputs this index was 2 03 and 1 01 for the wheat and maize ecosystems respectively indicating that these two cropping systems have a low dependence on free environmental inputs the irrigated wheat production system had a higher eyr value due to less consumption of purchased inputs which shows that this system is more efficient in emergy consumption a higher value of this index is more desirable 3 2 3 2 emergy investment ratio eir this index measures the ratio of total purchased emergy inputs to total free inputs the eir values for wheat and maize production systems were calculated to be 65 30 and 94 82 respectively these values show the greater dependence of the maize production system on the purchased inputs and the greater utilization of the wheat production system from free environmental resources questionnaire information indicated unreasonable use of some inputs purchased by farmers including chemical fertilizers and diesel fuel which increased this index in the ecosystem of maize so the economic efficiency of the ecosystem of irrigated wheat was higher than the ecosystem of maize in the study area 3 2 3 3 emergy self sufficiency ratio esr this ratio is obtained by dividing the total emergy of the environmental inputs by the emergy efficiency of the products this index refers to the degree to which the agricultural system relies on its internal resources and the higher its value the more desirable it is esr values for wheat and maize production systems in the study area were calculated to be 0 007 and 0 010 respectively 3 2 3 4 environmental sustainability index esi this index is obtained by dividing the emergy yield ratio by the environmental load ratio the esi values for wheat and maize production systems were 0 026 and 0 009 respectively the values of both systems are close to each other and very low so both cropping systems do not have the desired level of sustainability and put a lot of environmental pressure the higher value of this index in the ecosystem of wheat production compared to the ecosystem of maize indicates more economic sustainability of wheat cultivation in the study area 3 2 3 5 renewable emergy ratio r the renewable emergy ratio is calculated by dividing the renewable emergy inputs by the total emergy input this index shows the share of renewable resources in total production resources and its high means that the system is more dependent on renewable resources and as a result its higher sustainability in this study emergy renewability index for wheat and maize production systems were 4 61 and 3 99 respectively indicating that the sustainability of the wheat ecosystem in the long run is higher than the maize ecosystem 3 2 3 6 environmental loading ratio elr this index is the ratio obtained from the sum of total emergy consumption of purchased inputs and non renewable environmental resources to free renewable environmental resources this index was 76 65 and 109 51 for wheat and maize production systems respectively high values of the elr index in this study indicate very high environmental pressure and stress by market purchased and non renewable environmental inputs of the two cropping systems that cause a lot of pressure on the environment therefore the lower amount of this index in the wheat ecosystem indicates less pressure and less environmental load on this ecosystem 3 2 3 7 modified environmental load ratio index elr this index is calculated from the ratio of non renewable emergy sources to renewable ones the elr index or modified version of the environmental load ratio was proposed by ortega et al in 2002 asgharipour et al 2019 elr like the environmental load index refers to the environmental pressure created by an agricultural system and consequently higher elr values just like elr indicate higher environmental pressures and stresses this index for irrigated wheat and maize production systems was 20 69 and 24 04 respectively table 6 shows the comparison of emergy indices for different cultivation systems with previous studies 4 conclusions crops such as wheat and maize are increasingly grown in dez catchment lands these two crops are still important in government programs and farmers cultivation patterns therefore due to human centered droughts lack of water strategy in the country water bankruptcy in the country inefficient and unbalanced agriculture and finally improper consumption of input it is essential to achieve a correct understanding of sustained production in this region on the other hand iran has high water stress as the agriculture sector uses 90 of the country s renewable water therefore all these factors are a serious threat to agriculture and food security since environmental sustainability assessment is one of the most important tools in the sustainable development planning process it is inevitable to pay attention to it in policy making and planning in recent years two scientific tools ecological footprint ef and emergy analysis ea have been widely used around the world to measure human impact on nature and determine the sustainability of systems this is the first study from iran in the field of sustainable agriculture that has simultaneously used both tools to evaluate the sustainability of two strategic products the present study attempted to compare the indicators and determine the ecological sustainability of the two irrigated systems of wheat and maize to introduce a more sustainable and environmentally friendly crop in the dez catchment this study showed that one evident imperfection of the ecological footprint method is that some natural inputs such as surface soil erosion cannot be calculated but in emergy analysis these resources are calculated and in fact separate renewable and non renewable resources in this way improving the methodology of the ecological footprint considering the strong points of the emergy methodology could be a good alternative therefore the possibility of obtaining one better index of sustainability through the junction of ecological footprint with emergy index thus this study showed that the two methods ecological footprint and emergy analysis are complementary and each considers a specific aspect of a system but emergy analysis due to its multiple indicators and attention to environmental inputs deals with more and more fundamental details about sustainability the evaluation results of both sustainability indicators were very close to each other so the total consumption inputs for both products chemical fertilizers especially nitrate and phosphate and then diesel have the most impact on environmental unsustainability in the study area the findings of this study illustrated the sensitivity of the over consumption of inputs in the regional economy and environmental performance since the farming systems in our study area rely more on purchased inputs they create higher environmental pressure also the very low value of esi environmental sustainability index for both systems indicated that both cropping systems have an unfavorable level of sustainability the higher value of this index in the ecosystem of wheat production compared to the maize system indicates the greater sustainability of the wheat cultivation economy in the study area therefore the need for more non renewable inputs in the production process of these two crops itself reduces the sustainability of the system and causes energy imbalance this indicates the worrying situation of the current agricultural production systems in iran relying more on the optimal use of renewable energy sources is a key point in the sustainability of production systems therefore due to the high dependence of production systems on non renewable inputs in this study to optimize the consumption of these inputs and increase environmental and economic sustainability we suggest advising farmers on the proper use of fertilizers and chemical pesticides implementing policies aimed at promoting the use of renewable energy creating job opportunities among farmers modernizing worn out agricultural machinery electric watering pumps by government financial support promoting the use of green fuel to replace fossil fuels for transportation purposes and as a final result the ecosystem of the irrigated wheat production is more desirable than grain maize in terms of yield renewability and environmental sustainability therefore the production of both crops especially maize must be managed with the highest accuracy and in respect of environmental aspects and impacts in the region since there are few scientific studies in iran on the sustainable management of agricultural farms it is worthwhile to continue further research in this field declaration of competing interest the
