8795,in this paper we have used complex electrical conductivity σ ω as a new key factor for monitoring the efficiency of coagulation flocculation processes this process was applied of textile wastewater treatment by controlling the flocculants dosages through σ ω measurements therefore σ ω is the best parameter that allows investigating and predicting the interactions at the molecular level between the fine colloidal particles in the wastewater and cationic polymer used for coagulation flocculation the variations of complex conductivity were modeled by the summation of cole cole relaxation process and diffusion process and the analysis of extracted parameters from the model allowed us to predict the dosage of the cationic polymer to achieve the flocculation process the results showed that 10 mg l as the optimal concentration to achieve the best flocculation process keywords wastewater cationic polymer complex conductivity flocculation 1 introduction the use of water in different industrial sectors produces considerable amounts of wastewater 1 2 these wastewaters consist of a mixture of many different chemicals that can be summarily classified into readily biodegradable components difficultly biodegradable and non biodegradable however in recent decades the important production of industrial waste begins to present a real problem for the environment 3 therefore their treatments before rejecting them in the natural environment are considered a very important step to protect our environments mechanical and physical processes such as coarse screening grit removal and activated sludge biological treatments removes a large portion of the material contained in the water however after these operations the water always contains a considerable amount of substances composed of suspended matter colloids and very fine particles difficult to decant the turbidity and color of water are due to the very small particles called colloidal particles 4 these particles which can remain suspended in water for long periods can even pass through a very fine filter moreover because of their high stability they do not aggregate 5 the coagulation and flocculation process was proposed as ways to eliminate these particles this physicochemical procedure is most commonly used to remove colloidal particles in water this procedure makes it possible to destabilize the particles in suspension in order to facilitate their agglomeration generally the coagulation flocculation process is divided into four stages that are classified by the main mechanism responsible for aggregate formation these four steps are 6 7 1 charge shielding 2 charge neutralization 3 formation of electrostatic patches and 4 formation of inter particle bridges thus the fundamental mechanisms of the coagulation flocculation process have been the subject of several studies in recent years and most aspects of this process are now well illustrated 4 5 8 9 however despite this improvement in the understanding of these mechanisms it is still difficult to predict the necessary doses of coagulants and flocculants from the physico chemical properties to obtain flocs in order to complete this process as the surface charges and induced interactions of charged particles in wastewater give the specific electrical properties this last must be analyzed in order to control and optimize the coagulation flocculation process 10 thus through the literature it is found that impedance spectroscopy is a tool essentially used in order to characterize of charged materials 11 13 in the current paper we have decided to use real wastewater coming from the textile industry considering this wastewater as the greater challenge to reduce the conductivity the high conductivity values of wastewater are due to the charges of the free particles to agglomerate these fine particles we have adopted the coagulation flocculation processes for solid liquid separations several authors showed the traditional coagulation flocculation was followed with zeta potential turbidity dbo5 and dco to demonstrate that solid liquid separation 14 16 in our results we have adopted the complex conductivity as a new technique to predict the optimal dosage and opening a potential way for coagulation flocculation design ensuring the low environmental impact of flocculants overdose 2 material and methods the experimental measurement was made by using polymer polyacrylamide as a flocculants during wastewater treatment of the textile industry collected from a heterogeneous common effluent treatment plant located in berrechid morocco different concentrations were prepared from the raw wastewater such as 0 2 5 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l to destabilize the colloid particles we have made the agitation for a short period 3 min but at a rapid stirring speed allowing ensuring a very good diffusion of the polymer with fine particles of wastewater this agitation was followed by slow agitation for 20 min in order to favor the contacting of the contiguous particles and avoid breaking the flocs formed finally these flakes are left to settle for a rest period of 30 min after the rest time 30 min the electrical conductivity measurements of all concentrations were obtained using impedance meter voltalab 10 which gives the possibility to obtain the conductivity spectra in the range of the frequency 100 mh to 100 khz with ac potential amplitude of 10 mv a three electrode was employed to perform these measurements and we have used the z view 2 2 software for analyzing these data and to extract different electrical parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of complex conductivity the notation used in this paper defines the complex conductivity as σ ω σ ω iσ ω was used by several authors 17 18 fig 1 represent the cole cole plots nyquist plots in which the imaginary part σ of the conductivity is plotted as a function of the real part σ all concentrations shown similar behavior each concentration is characterized by the apparition of the clear relaxation process fig 1 was split into graphs one contains the concentration range 0 10 mg l and other contains the concentration range 10 25 mg l a clear distinction among different concentrations is shown in both ranges of concentrations in the first range of concentrations below 10 mg l the diameter of the semi circle decrease with the concentration increase this behavior show in decreases of free charge in the medium 6 17 contrariwise in the second range above 10 mg l the diameter of the semi circle increase with the concentration increase this behavior shows in increases of free charge in the medium fig 2 shows the frequency dependence of the imaginary part σ of the complex conductivity measured at different concentrations of cationic polymer from 0 to 25 mg l also this figure was split into two graphs to show the two regions in the conductivity evolution fig 2 clearly shows a relaxation peak for each concentration this figure makes it possible to estimate the relaxation frequency fr deduced from the evolution of σ we can notice that the relaxation frequencies move towards the low frequencies in the first region above this concentration the relaxation frequencies move towards the high frequencies in the second region one in the first stage suspended particles were destabilized by changing of the flocculants concentration these changes in both figures could be due to the electrostatic interaction with the surfaces of wastewater particles and the polymer chain 18 20 fig 3 shows the variation σ vs frequency for raw wastewater this variation has three distinct domains at a low frequency a dispersion follows a power law in an average frequency interval the conductivity increases from a characteristic frequency ωc which corresponds to the transition from a hopping conductivity to a diffusive dynamic conductivity in the frequency range where the real part of the conductivity σ presents a plateau it is possible to estimate the value of the high frequency conductivity noted σ hf 21 22 the high frequency conductivity has been attributed to the conductivity within the aggregates or clusters while at low frequency the power law has been attributed to the hopping conduction between the aggregates 23 the flocculation mechanism promotes the aggregation of wastewater particles since the cationic polymer plays a bridging role between these particles indeed the aggregates resulting from the flocculation process can be considered as flocs of different sizes thus the addition of cationic polymer has the effect of increasing the ionic strength due to the condensation of the fine particles 3 2 modeling experimental data to extract the electrical parameters from this technique which is related to the process of flocculation of wastewater it must be modeled by using the empirical model or using the electric equivalent circuit in this work we have modeled our results by an electric equivalent circuit to fit the experimental results a model useful for describing the complex conductivity relaxation process σ ω was used by andrey tarasov and konstantin titov 2013 23 in our case as seen in the above figure fig 3 the shift observed at low frequencies with the experimental data dot symbols and cole cole relaxation red line imposes on us to add constant phases element cpe in parallel with cole cole circuit as observed in fig 4 the complex conductivity of the branch a shown in fig 4 is 1 y 1 ω 1 z 1 ω 1 r 2 2 y 1 ω 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 1 j ω τ p 1 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 1 k 1 j ω τ p 1 or τ r 1 t 1 p 1 and k r 2 r 1 r 2 the complex conductivity of the branch b shown in fig 4 is the admittance function of constant phase element is given by the following equation 3 y c p e t j ω p where t is a frequency independent parameter and the exponent p is between 0 and 1 the relationship between complex admittance and complex conductivity is writing as follow 4 y ω s d σ ω whit s d is constant cell therefore the expression of the complex conductivity σ can be written as follow 5 σ ω σ 1 k 1 j ω τ p 1 with k r 2 r 1 r 2 σ σ 0 σ k is substituted in the previous equation and can be written as follow 6 σ ω σ σ 0 σ 1 j ω τ p 1 whit σ d s 1 r 1 1 r 2 we also get r 2 r 1 obtained σ ω d s 1 r 1 therefore the total expression of the complex conductivity σ can be written as follow 7 σ ω σ σ 0 σ 1 j ω τ p 1 σ h o j ω p 2 with σ h o t 2 s d where ω is the angular frequency τ is the relaxation time σ is the very high frequency conductivity and σ0 is the low frequency conductivity δσ σ0 σ is the ionic strength of the relaxation σho is the hopping conductivity thus the first term of the above expression is analog to the cole cole relaxation whereas the second term is analog to the power law and attributed to diffusion process to validate this circuit we have selected raw sample because all concentration show the similar behavior this model gives a satisfactory description of the experimentally measured values as it is shown in fig 5 with the squared correlation coefficients of r2 0 99 fig 6 shows the evolution of extracted parameters from the equivalent circuit such as the relaxation time τ and the ionic strength δσ these parameters were illustrated as a function of the concentration of cationic polymer the variation of ionic strength shows the existence of two regions in which show a decrease in the first region followed by an increase in the second region on the other hand the relaxation time increases in the first region and a decrease in the second region the above evolution of both parameters relaxation time τ and the ionic strength δσ showed a net transition at 10 mg l first of all the addition of different concentrations of polyacrylamide at raw wastewater provokes particles charged in the concentration range below 10 mg l the attractive interaction was increased between particles charged and polyacrylamide chain this interaction could decrease the ionic strength δσ due to the neutralization as shown in fig 6 above the 10 mg l the excess of polyacrylamide concentrations increase again the number of ions and consequently the conductivity increase and posed a real problem in the environment concerning the contribution of the relaxation times used to optimize the flocculation process the neutralization of media formed the dipole moments most of the dipole moments increase as in the case of 10 mg l the dipole moments take a lot of time to follow the electrical field and consequently at 10 mg l the relaxation time is higher 24 to summarize eduardo alberto lópez maldonado et all 25 was obtained 15 mg l of flocculant in their study on wastewater treatment of the semiconductor industry through zeta potential measurements this concentration as very close to the concentration obtained in our measurement using electrical conductivity we conclude the analysis of the complex conductivity can be used to optimize the flocculation process and to ensure good flocculants 4 conclusion in this study the analysis of electrical properties showed its importance in monitoring the aggregation processes that occur during the flocculation process the conductivity analysis allowed us to extract the relaxation time and ionic strength all these parameters showed a clear transition to the 10 mg l concentration thus indicating the existence of the two regions in the first region their evolution suggests an increase in floc size and the formation of a more compact and stable aggregate in the second region a decrease in relaxation time was observed indicating the deflocculation of the aggregates conductivity modeling allowed us to estimate the optimal concentration to achieve a flocculation process indeed the amount of cationic polymer required to obtain the charge neutralization of the wastewater particles is the main criterion of the flocculation process therefore any excess of this quantity would be free and could generate a negative impact leading to an increase in conductivity and leading to secondary pollution author contribution all

8796,matching regional water supply and demand can be improved by allocating local renewable water resources through decentralized water supply networks wsns the feasibility of decentralized wsns depends on the costs for the required pipeline infrastructure the lowest costs for pipeline infrastructure depend on the local landscape characteristics we present a model that designs decentralized wsns to supply water with regional supply sources the objective of the model is to include the effects of landscape characteristics on infrastructure costs and to minimize overall wsn costs we tested the model on a case study in the fresh water scarce region of zeeuws vlaanderen in the southwestern part of the netherlands with known hydro geological geographical and climate data the model was tested to supply a large industrial water user with groundwater resources operated within sustainable yields the generated wsns cover a demand between 0 5 and 5 5 million m3 year 1 between 1 and 12 supply locations are needed to cover the demand the pipeline infrastructure needed ranges from 25 1 to 114 5 km the model determines the optimal pipeline route the amount of water flowing over each pipeline segment and reveals if a small increase in demand causes a relatively large increase in costs the results can be used to determine if water transport is preferred over other water supply options such as wastewater re use or desalination of saline water resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords industrial water use water supply network network optimization geo information systems gis mixed integer quadratic programming 1 introduction many industrial processes are dependent on the availability of water in some cases for the product itself but often mainly for the production process industries largely rely on centralized water supply systems due to the general policy in the twentieth century to create large scale infrastructure projects 1 relying on large scale centralized systems introduces uncertainty in water supply due to the rising costs and changing availability of water resources 2 4 projections show that rainfall patterns will change around the globe 5 6 that the quality of water may severely diminish due to salt water intrusion in coastal areas 7 and that human alterations to watersheds affect the quantity and or quality of the available water resources 8 groundwater resources are often used in an unsustainable way depleting water supplies and possibly leading to land subsidence and or enhancing salt water intrusion 9 new approaches are needed to use the available water resources in a sustainable way 10 12 many efforts within industry a sector accounting for 19 of global water withdrawals 13 focus on reducing the water demand by increasing the process efficiency and by reusing or recycling water 14 while these efforts are certainly needed the remaining demand still needs to be supplied by extracting water from natural systems alternative local sources of water such as wastewater harvested rainwater surface water and groundwater can be used to reduce dependency on remote centralized sources the use of decentralized water supply systems is an option to alleviate future water scarcity and to deal with increasing infrastructure costs 15 the use of decentralized networks provides flexibility to adjust water quality to the needs of the user 15 and has the potential to increase resilience when supply is diversified 16 a comprehensive overview of water supply network design and optimization methods was created by mala jetmarova 17 irrespective of the form of distribution central or decentral local extractions need to adhere to the sustainable yield of the water resource avoid subsidence due to groundwater extraction and prevent enhancement of salt water intrusion the use of methods to assess all these aspects for the overall sustainability of industrial water use is currently still limited but is needed to ensure water use remains within the limits of local water systems 18 the appropriate design and evaluation of a water supply network wsn based on many small scale water resources requires a model based approach several models exist that can be used to evaluate the regional supply and demand of conventional and alternative water resources such as a the water evaluation and planning system weap which can be used to evaluate water management scenarios based on a water balance accounting principle 19 b the watercress model which simulates the quantities and qualities of water flowing through a catchment area at equal continuous time steps 20 c the ribasim model which links hydrological conditions with the specific water users in the basin 21 d or the model developed by nobel and allen which matches and optimizes the water reuse possibilities between industries based on their location 10 these models are useful to evaluate and optimize the water supply and demand system when the water transport infrastructure is already present and the water resources to be used are defined a modelling approach which can select the optimal configuration of supply locations based on a wsn for which the transport infrastructure does not yet exist was still lacking such a model can assist in a transition towards regional water self sufficiency based on local renewable water sources a transition towards the use of local water resources requires an evaluation of the optimal network for water transport transporting large quantities of water usually occurs through pipelines pipeline construction costs depend on the local conditions and landscape features such as land use slope required excavation depth and subsurface soil type 12 22 the objective of the model we present is to generate the lowest cost wsn based on the local landscape characteristics and the available renewable water resources we combined geographic information system gis methods graph theory 23 and mixed integer quadratic programming the gis methods were used to include the influence of landscape characteristics on pipeline construction costs graph theory was used to model the relationships between objects 23 24 the supply and demand locations in our model represent the objects and are referred to as nodes the pipeline connections are the relationships between nodes and are referred to as edges mixed integer quadratic programming was then used to find the configuration of nodes and edges that leads to the lowest cost wsn in this paper we present a modelling approach which generates the lowest cost wsn for a specific demand based on known supply locations in a region we tested the approach on a case study in zeeuws vlaanderen in the southwestern part of the netherlands 2 case study description the model was tested by generating a wsn for an industrial site in zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands the current fresh water supply for the site is dependent on transport of water from outside this coastal fresh water scarce region most of the surface area of the region 733 km2 is used for agriculture local fresh groundwater sources are hosted within a lithologically heterogeneous aquifer and positioned on top of deeper more saline groundwater in this case study we consider a maximum chloride concentration of 1500 mg cl l as a limit for use in industry based on an accepted classification of a fresh saline interface 25 the fresh saline groundwater distribution in the area was mapped in 2015 26 calculated groundwater extractions should not cause the so called upconing of the fresh saline groundwater 1500 mg cl l interface in the deeper subsoil to avoid possible negative consequences for other water users e g famers in the area we tested the model to generate a wsn with the available fresh groundwater resources in the region operated at sustainable yields the current water supply of the industrial site is covered by importing 3 million m3 year 1 from outside the region we investigated the possibility to supply between 0 5 and 5 5 million m3 year 1 of water with groundwater resources in the region 3 methodology transport networks including wsns and their optimization have been thoroughly studied within the operations research field 17 a water transport network can be represented as nodes and edges 27 28 the nodes represent the water demand or supply locations and the edges represent the pipeline connections with associated costs between nodes graph theory optimization procedures can then be used to optimize the network 29 the presented model converts regional spatial data into a node and edge network generates the lowest cost wsn based on the water demand of the user and visualizes the result the model has four main steps fig 1 1 input data generation 2 cost of passage surface creation 3 least cost path determination 4 water supply network selection 3 1 input data the first step of the model compiles and generates the data required for step 2 4 in this section the components to generate the input data are described the supply and demand sites with respect to water quantities and qualities the landscape types and associated weights to determine the route of the pipeline infrastructure supply sites to generate a decentralized wsn possible sources of water need to be identified the supply site input data are the locations coordinates and the amount of water which the wells can supply sustainably m3 year 1 criteria such as the natural recharge of an aquifer 30 the environmental flow requirements of an area 31 or the overall sustainable water footprint of a river basin 32 can be used to determine the sustainable yield for water extractions for this case study fresh groundwater sources in the zeeuws vlaanderen region were modelled a maximum drawdown of 50 mm 33 of the phreatic groundwater level the change in water level at the extraction wells relative to the initial situation was set as the boundary condition for the allowed extraction rate in zeeuws vlaanderen brackish and saline groundwater is present below fresh groundwater therefore saline groundwater upconing can occur as a result of lowering the piezometric heads due to extraction and saline groundwater flowing to the extraction well extractions are dimensioned in such a way that the position of the 1500 mg cl l interface between the fresh groundwater above and the brackish groundwater below should not move into the groundwater extraction well 26 34 an available 3d variable density groundwater flow model coupled with a salt transport model 34 was used to provide the necessary data on hydraulic conductivities 35 and the groundwater salinity distribution expressed as mg cl up to a depth of 140 m below mean sea level msl 26 34 the 100 100 m resolution model uses the modflow 36 based computer code mocdens3d 65 66 and consists of 40 model layers to reproduce the movement of groundwater salinity in the vertical direction stresses in the model on the groundwater system includes six different surface water types sea and estuarine waters lakes canals small rivers water courses up to ditches seasonal natural groundwater recharge from the national hydrological instrument 37 a shallow drainage system and existing groundwater extraction wells the surface water and drainage systems seasonal water level and with a certain resistance to the groundwater system are inserted into the model using an accurate digital elevation model actueel hoogtebestand nederland ahn 38 resolution 5 5 m boundary conditions in the sea and at the hinterland complete the model 34 to obtain an estimate of fresh groundwater availability the depth of the fresh saline groundwater 1500 mg cl l interface was determined for the study area the resulting interface served as an initial estimate of the potential availability of fresh groundwater locations as the movement of groundwater is a dynamic process sustainability constraints need to be placed on extraction rates determining the extraction locations and associated rates was done in two steps 1 obtaining an initial selection of extraction coordinates based on the hydraulic properties of the subsoil 35 in combination with an analytical formula which estimates the maximum extraction without upconing of the fresh saline groundwater 1500 mg cl l interface into the extraction well 39 and 2 calculating the phreatic groundwater level drawdown for given extraction rates based on the super positional effect of the extraction well clusters the drawdown is based on hydrogeological parameters of a semi confined groundwater system and the extraction rates calculated with the so called formula of de glee of the wells 40 upconing of saline groundwater can be approximated using analytical methods such as discussed in refs 39 41 42 where a critical rise of the interface can be calculated the maximum sustainable extraction rate for the case study is set to the rate before saline groundwater will experience an abrupt rise towards the well screen this rise is given by the model of bear and dagan 41 and was calculated using fresh saline groundwater interface depths resulting in maximum extraction rates qmax in m3 day 1 per grid cell see annex 1 cells with extractions that are too small qmax 500 m3 day 1 were removed the remaining locations were extracted as points and finally grouped into clusters with extraction wells 100 m apart this step serves as an initial selection but does not yet consider the summed superposed effect of clustered extraction wells on the overall drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level saline groundwater upconing is related to drawdown therefore the latter was also quantified using an analytical method pumping rates were optimized for minimal summed drawdown and maximum extraction rates considering interference the summed effect of neighboring extraction wells the outcome allows the user to quantify the fresh groundwater extractable in m3 year 1 for a given maximum drawdown the relationship between the maximum accepted drawdown and the maximum extraction rate is linear reducing the maximum accepted drawdown by half yields half the extraction rate see annex 1 through this property the effect of altering the accepted drawdown as a possible sustainability criteria on the optimal wsn can be explored this analytical approach provides a first estimate of the sustainable yield at a specified groundwater drawdown the presented approach can be expanded with additional criteria to ensure overall sustainability of the groundwater system 43 45 demand sites the spatial location coordinates of the demand site s and their demand m3 year 1 for a specified quality of water for the case study in zeeland a single industrial user is used as the demand location the demand quality is set to a maximum of 1500 mg cl l the model was built to accept multiple demand sites landscape types the type of landscape and land use influence the costs of placing pipeline infrastructure 46 47 we use a landscape type map of the study area to find the pipeline routes with the lowest costs fig 2 the landscape types used in this work correspond to publicly available data for the netherlands 48 landscape weights to determine the pipeline routes with the lowest costs the different landscape types were weighted to reflect the costs of placing pipeline infrastructure within them the weights assigned to the landscape types reflect the relative differences in costs between the landscape types for example the costs associated with placing pipeline infrastructure in a built up area are high relative to an agricultural area the list of included landscape types can be expanded based on data availability and importance of specific landscape types in a region e g industrial areas or groundwater extraction areas 3 2 cost of passage surface the lowest costs for a pipeline between two locations do not necessarily correspond to a straight line 46 feldman et al 46 showed that the use of spatial data in the form of a cost of passage surface based on land use can reduce pipeline construction costs by 14 even when the total length of pipeline increases by 21 as a consequence a cost of passage surface is a raster in which each cell value represents the costs of traversing that cell and can be based on any type of costs for the case study the costs refer to the placement of pipeline infrastructure in this paper the weights assigned to each of the landscape types fig 2 were combined and overlaid using gis software to create the general cost of passage surface for pipeline infrastructure in the area the cost of passage surface is the input data to determine the least cost path the route with the lowest total costs to connect two locations in this case with pipeline infrastructure 49 51 3 3 least cost paths based on the general cost of passage surface the lowest costs route for a pipeline between two locations was calculated fig 3 the least cost path between two locations is the shortest route between two locations according to the metric used in the cost of passage surface 52 least cost path methods have been widely used for infrastructure routing 49 50 53 to create the least cost paths the cost of passage surface was converted into an accumulated cost surface for each location the accumulated cost surfaces were then used to trace the lowest cost route between the departure and destination locations 51 the weighting procedure section 3 1 allows users to consider criteria with different metrics e g construction costs slope distance to protected areas and to have all criteria be reflected in the final least cost path 54 the steps shown in fig 3 describe the procedure to determine the least cost path between a set of two locations to generate the wsn with the lowest costs all the possible connections between all the demand and supply locations are needed for each demand or supply location the least cost paths to all other locations were calculated the resulting least cost paths for all possible combinations of locations were overlaid and combined into a single least cost network when creating the network a node was added at each location where pipelines intersect the added nodes serve as transport hubs where flows can merge but do not affect the overall water balance in the network the model considers the merging of flows by calculating the required pipeline capacity and associated costs before and after the transport hubs hubs are represented by their location coordinates but have a demand and supply of zero the above procedure results in a v x v where v is the set of all locations or nodes adjacency matrix as shown in step 3 of fig 1 the values in the matrix represent the length kilometers of the lowest cost pipeline route between each starting location i and destination location j the diagonal zeros represent the fact that the distance from each location to itself is zero 3 4 water supply network selection the mathematical representation of the optimization problem in this work is a variation of the fixed charge network flow problem which is used to model many practical problems in the areas of transportation and distribution 55 the problem is characterized by the set up costs a fixed charge that is incurred when an activity is performed 56 57 for pipeline construction the fixed charges are the costs that need to be made irrespective of the size of the pipe being placed we used a mixed integer quadratic programming miqp method to solve the optimization problem and to generate the optimal wsn 56 the system is represented by a graph g v e with nodes v and edges e the supply and demand locations are the nodes and the possible transport pipelines the edges the set of edges e is the result of section 3 3 each edge i j in e where i is the source and j is the destination is described according to the following parameters flow x i j the amount of water being transported over the edge maximum capacity u i j the maximum amount of water which can be transported over an edge since the wsn is not yet built the maximum capacity is not yet defined this parameter makes it possible to generate wsns incorporating parts of existing pipeline infrastructure fixed costs f i j the fixed costs which will be incurred to place the pipeline irrespective of the amount of water transported costs per unit flow c i j the costs to increase the capacity of a pipeline according to the amount of water which needs to be transported on off y i j binary variable with value 1 if the pipeline connection is used or 0 the pipeline connection is not used water demand supply s i the water demand negative value or supplied positive value to the network at each node transport hubs have a demand supply of zero each node has an associated water supply or water demand s i in the network for locations that supply water s i 0 for transport hubs that do not provide or consume water s i 0 and for water users that extract water from the network s i 0 the costs per unit flow c i j are based on the length of the pipeline section i j the result of the least cost path analysis and the pipeline diameter required to achieve a suitable flow speed the suitable range for flow speed while considering a 1 5 factor for peak demands was set between 0 5 m s 1 and 1 5 m s 1 the fixed costs f i j are also based on the length of the associated pipeline section but are not dependent on the water flow the capacity dependent pipeline placement costs used in the model were 0 5 euro mm 1 diameter m 1 the relation between accepted flow velocity and available pipeline diameters generally available in increments of 100 mm yield a stepwise behavior in terms of costs against flow annex 2 we approximate the stepwise behavior with a quadratic function from which the constants serve to establish the objective function for the network selection procedure according to 1 minimize t p p c i j e c α i j x i j 2 i j e c β i j x i j i j e f i j y i j 2 where c α i j α l i j 3 where c β i j β l i j 4 where f i j ε l i j where t p p c is the total pipeline placement costs for the wsn based on the adequate diameter to accommodate the required flow over each edge and l is the length of the pipeline km between nodes i j generated through the least cost path analysis the coefficients α β and ε are the constants derived from the quadratic relationship between flow and pipeline placement costs annex 2 the optimization problem can be characterized as a mixed integer quadratic program due to the quadratic term in the objective function the left and middle terms represent the sum of the costs per unit flow over each edge the right term is the sum of the fixed costs for all the edges used if an edge is not used there are no costs fixed or per unit flow associated with that edge the constraints of the optimization model are given by equations 5 7 the first constraint ensures that the sum of the flows out of any node left term is smaller or equal to the sum of the flows entering the node middle term and the supply right term at the node equation 2 applies to every node i in the set of nodes v 5 subject to i j e x i j j i e x j i s i i v the second constraint ensures that if an edge is used the flow should be larger or equal to zero while at the same time it should be smaller or equal to the maximum capacity of the edge equation 6 existing pipeline infrastructure has a maximum capacity which can be incorporated in the model through parameter u i j the model returns the flow over each pipeline and therefore the capacity which needs to be installed this constraint only applies to edges in use but is evaluated for every edge i j in the set of edges e 6 0 x i j u i j y i j i j e the variable y i j denotes whether an edge is used or not and can take the value 0 not in use or 1 in use equation 7 if the edge is used the fixed costs to place the pipeline are incurred this variable is also evaluated for every edge i j in the set of edges e 7 y i j 0 1 i j e the output of the optimization yields the edgelist of the lowest cost wsn the amount of water to be transported over each edge and the capacity at which the supply locations should be operated the miqp was implemented in python and solved with the gurobi optimization solver 4 results zeeuws vlaanderen case 4 1 regional water supply fresh groundwater sources the extraction location selection procedure yielded about 2000 extraction well locations from which fresh groundwater could be extracted the possible extraction wells were grouped into 25 clusters in which individual extraction wells are at least 100 m apart clusters close to the coastlines are dune type geological formations capturing and storing fresh rainwater the optimized clusters including the individual extraction wells are shown in fig 4 the total amount of water which can be extracted from the 25 clusters when limiting head drawdown to 50 mm is 7 6 million m3 year 1 the spatial center of each cluster is used to generate the wsn 4 2 least cost pipeline network the construction of pipeline infrastructure is preferred in areas where the construction costs are the lowest table 1 shows the weighted costs for pipeline infrastructure construction used in this work the weights assigned to the different categories were determined in consultation with water supply experts a distinction was made between crossing a road or waterway as opposed to building parallel to these landscape types the zones parallel to transport infrastructure are relatively suitable to place pipeline infrastructure because other uses for these areas are limited crossing transport infrastructure should be avoided to reduce costs in this work we reduced the costs of pipeline infrastructure parallel to transport infrastructure by 70 compared to the original landscape type traversed fig 5 a shows the combined cost of passage surface based on the landscape cost weights to place pipeline infrastructure the areas with the lowest costs are agricultural areas along existing transport infrastructure the original weighted cost for agricultural areas was 50 table 1 which is reduced by 70 in the zones parallel to existing infrastructure to yield the lowest final weighted cost of 15 generation of the least cost paths for all possible connections between the water supply and demand locations yielded a preliminary network with 408 edges fig 5b the preliminary number of edges did not yet account for the possibility to transport water in both directions to include the possibility to transport water in both directions the original edges were copied and the start and end points were inverted the result is an adjacency matrix not shown with 816 2 408 values the total number of nodes in the network is 269 of which 25 are the supply locations fig 5b 1 is the demand location and 243 are transport hubs the complete network has a total length of 1796 km 21 passes agricultural area 1 built up and 1 forest and open natural area the remainder 76 falls within the parallel zone alongside existing transport infrastructure or waterways the length of pipeline traversing each landscape type is a reflection of the weights assigned to each type table 1 assigning equal weights to each landscape type would result in unrealistic straight lines between nodes 4 3 lowest cost water supply network the model creates the lowest cost wsn specific to the demand of the user and the available water supply fig 6 pipeline diameter and flow velocity are shown in annex 3 and annex 4 we discuss the wsns i vii of fig 6 in order of increasing demand below i the optimal wsn to supply the starting demand of 0 5 million m3 year 1 uses three supply locations and is 25 1 km long ii the wsn configuration changes considerably because the supply locations of i while being closer cannot cover the demand of 0 6 million m3 year 1 the optimal wsn uses the most southern supply location as the single supply source iii demand reaches 2 1 million m3 year 1 exceeding the 2 08 million m3 year 1 available at the most southern location a small supply location close to the existing route is added to the wsn to cover the demand the inclusion of the small supply location reduces the capacity at which the southern supply locations is operated and reduces the diameter of the pipeline up to the point where the pipelines merge iv the optimal wsn shifts to the east to include a supply location with more water to cover the demand the inclusion of this new location reduces the capacity at which the southern well is operated from 2 05 in iii to 1 8 million m3 year 1 v the optimal wsn still includes the most southern supply location but now also includes the second largest supply location in the area with a supply of 0 92 million m3 year 1 the second largest supply location is operated at 98 capacity 0 90 million m3 year 1 because demand is still below the maximum water availability vi the optimal wsn is rearranged to include the southern supply source with 0 14 million m3 year 1 the capacity at which the most eastern supply location is operated is lowered to 93 0 86 million m3 year 1 vii the optimal wsn has a different configuration compared to vi to supply the maximum investigated demand of 5 5 million m3 year 1 the most eastern supply site with a supply 0 92 million m3 year 1 is approached with a new branch of the network directly going east instead of expanding the branch from the south east as in v and vi in general the optimal wsn configuration results from operating the supply location furthest from the demand location at the lowest possible capacity this can reduce the amount of water supplied by a specific well when demand increases and new supply locations are added to the wsn an example of this occurs in the transition from iii to iv by reducing the operating capacity of the furthermost supply location the pipeline diameter which needs to be installed over the complete network is minimized leading to reduced costs as the demand increases the costs of the optimal wsn increase with steps to reflect the shifts in wsn configuration fig 7 in fig 7 the costs of the wsns i vii of fig 6 are annotated and the optimal wsn costs for a drawdown of 75 mm are shown for comparison the steps in costs arise from the need to add new supply locations to the wsn each time demand exceeds the maximum capacity of a set of supply locations at each step increasing the diameter capacity of pipelines is no longer sufficient to cover the demand and additional pipelines to new supply locations are needed the addition of a new pipeline connection incurs the fixed costs which causes the steps in costs in the lower demand range up to vi the steps in costs for adding supply locations are more pronounced at higher demand ranges the cost steps become less pronounced because the total number of supply locations required to cover the demand is larger when many supply location are needed subtle changes in the network are possible to minimize costs making the steps less pronounced a linear increase in costs as occurs between a demand of 0 7 ii and 2 0 million m3 year 1 at 50 mm drawdown indicates that the only added costs occur from adding additional capacity increasing pipeline diameter to the network 5 discussion 5 1 modelling approach over the last decades water resources management has increasingly relied on computer models 58 the model in this study adds to the existing modelling toolbox by offering the possibility to generate and evaluate decentralized water supply networks these networks are based on local fresh and in the future saline water resources as a base for enhancing regional water self sufficiency the model accepts any supply location if the spatial location and the available amount of water are provided this allows the evaluation of water supply networks in which surface water rainwater wastewater brackish or saline water are used as decentralized supply sources the complexity of the optimization problem in terms of the number of network configurations which can cover the demand increases exponentially as the number of supply locations increases the presented model is therefore particularly suited to assist in the design process for decentralized water supply networks with many smaller supply locations adhering to maximum sustainable yields reducing the overall water demand of a user is directly related to a reduction in the amount of water which needs to be transported the stepwise behavior of the wsn costs reveals tipping points where reductions in demand can significantly influence the wsn configuration and costs the model can be used to compare the costs of transport with the costs for demand reduction through the implementation of water saving technologies or through an increase of water re use depending on the local landscape and water supply sources either option may be favorable for example the costs for desalination have been decreasing over the years 59 which can make water supply networks based on small scale local brackish sources preferable over long distance transport of high quality water the costs of pipeline infrastructure depend on many factors 60 and can vary with a factor of 25 based on the methods and materials used 61 as long as the same cost function for placing pipeline infrastructure is applicable to the complete case study area the model will generate the lowest cost wsn the wsn can also be optimized based on other criteria than monetary costs a cost function in terms of carbon dioxide emissions or energy use will yield the optimal wsn in terms of the respective cost function metric 5 2 sustainable water use self sufficiency and sustainability can be enhanced by harvesting alternative local renewable resources 62 63 the model we present generates the optimal network to connect supply and demand within the boundaries of sustainably available water resources on any scale considering sustainable water availability over all relevant scales is needed to ensure overall long term sustainability 64 65 long term sustainability of the decentralized wsn requires adherence to the catchment s water budget 66 and ensuring that the cumulative effect of local extractions do not negatively alter the entire drainage basin 8 in the case study the maximum phreatic water level drawdown was set to a single value for all well clusters determining and applying specific drawdown values for each location based on criteria applicable to the local context is suggested for future research prevention of land subsidence as a consequence of draining peatlands 67 is such an additional criteria for specific low lying areas in the netherlands in other areas the maximum phreatic water level drawdown should be sensible with the presence of water intensive crop areas drawdown values and subsequent extraction rates can be matched with these local conditions at a very high spatial resolution for this study it was decided that the analytical methods to determine water extraction rates are sufficient to identify possible supply locations and to show the functionality of the modelling approach validating the extraction rates through a 3d numerical groundwater flow model 34 68 69 with an adequate resolution is suggested as a future step 5 3 context specific application the case study presents a single set of weights for the landscape types in the region based on contact with water transport infrastructure experts involving local stakeholders to determine the weights makes the model results more context specific methodologies such as multi criteria evaluations can be applied to spatial data to determine which areas are more or less suited for a certain purpose 70 each set of favored criteria will yield a specific cost of passage surface which will in turn yield a specific wsn configuration by defining and assigning the cost weights for each landscape type in consultation with local stakeholders the model generates water supply networks tailored to the local context publicly available spatial data on landscape types limited to the netherlands was used to demonstrate the workings of the model spatial data from other countries belgium for this case study can be incorporated to assist with the transboundary nature of integrated water resources management 71 consultation with local stakeholders can increase the number of landscape types included in the model because the categories of the national dataset are limited the manual addition of no go areas such as natura 2000 areas 72 or local heritage sites makes results more site specific and complements the generic spatial data relevant for pipeline construction costs 6 conclusion this study presents a modelling approach to generate decentralized water supply networks based on the local landscape characteristics and water availability of a region we add a novel approach to the modelling toolbox for regional water planners by incorporating spatial data and the effect of landscape types on the costs to place pipeline infrastructure in combination with an optimization procedure based on a water balance between supply and demand water supply networks optimized to the local context can be generated by incorporating these spatial aspects representing the water network as nodes and edges makes it possible solve the complex optimization problem with mixed integer quadratic programming the model was used for a case study in zeeuws vlaanderen in the south of the netherlands to supply an industrial zone with regional fresh groundwater as an alternative to importing fresh water from outside the region the model generates 1 the pipeline configuration for the lowest cost water supply network 2 the amount of water flowing over each pipeline in the network 3 the capacity at which the supply locations should be operated the model can be extended with other conventional and alternative water sources such as brackish water resources and wastewater treatment plant effluents in that case treatment costs to achieve adequate quality and related costs need to be included decision makers can use the model to evaluate scenarios with varying supply and demand settings and to identify the points at which sudden increases in transport network costs occur credit authorship contribution statement joeri willet project administration conceptualization methodology data curation visualization writing

8796,matching regional water supply and demand can be improved by allocating local renewable water resources through decentralized water supply networks wsns the feasibility of decentralized wsns depends on the costs for the required pipeline infrastructure the lowest costs for pipeline infrastructure depend on the local landscape characteristics we present a model that designs decentralized wsns to supply water with regional supply sources the objective of the model is to include the effects of landscape characteristics on infrastructure costs and to minimize overall wsn costs we tested the model on a case study in the fresh water scarce region of zeeuws vlaanderen in the southwestern part of the netherlands with known hydro geological geographical and climate data the model was tested to supply a large industrial water user with groundwater resources operated within sustainable yields the generated wsns cover a demand between 0 5 and 5 5 million m3 year 1 between 1 and 12 supply locations are needed to cover the demand the pipeline infrastructure needed ranges from 25 1 to 114 5 km the model determines the optimal pipeline route the amount of water flowing over each pipeline segment and reveals if a small increase in demand causes a relatively large increase in costs the results can be used to determine if water transport is preferred over other water supply options such as wastewater re use or desalination of saline water resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords industrial water use water supply network network optimization geo information systems gis mixed integer quadratic programming 1 introduction many industrial processes are dependent on the availability of water in some cases for the product itself but often mainly for the production process industries largely rely on centralized water supply systems due to the general policy in the twentieth century to create large scale infrastructure projects 1 relying on large scale centralized systems introduces uncertainty in water supply due to the rising costs and changing availability of water resources 2 4 projections show that rainfall patterns will change around the globe 5 6 that the quality of water may severely diminish due to salt water intrusion in coastal areas 7 and that human alterations to watersheds affect the quantity and or quality of the available water resources 8 groundwater resources are often used in an unsustainable way depleting water supplies and possibly leading to land subsidence and or enhancing salt water intrusion 9 new approaches are needed to use the available water resources in a sustainable way 10 12 many efforts within industry a sector accounting for 19 of global water withdrawals 13 focus on reducing the water demand by increasing the process efficiency and by reusing or recycling water 14 while these efforts are certainly needed the remaining demand still needs to be supplied by extracting water from natural systems alternative local sources of water such as wastewater harvested rainwater surface water and groundwater can be used to reduce dependency on remote centralized sources the use of decentralized water supply systems is an option to alleviate future water scarcity and to deal with increasing infrastructure costs 15 the use of decentralized networks provides flexibility to adjust water quality to the needs of the user 15 and has the potential to increase resilience when supply is diversified 16 a comprehensive overview of water supply network design and optimization methods was created by mala jetmarova 17 irrespective of the form of distribution central or decentral local extractions need to adhere to the sustainable yield of the water resource avoid subsidence due to groundwater extraction and prevent enhancement of salt water intrusion the use of methods to assess all these aspects for the overall sustainability of industrial water use is currently still limited but is needed to ensure water use remains within the limits of local water systems 18 the appropriate design and evaluation of a water supply network wsn based on many small scale water resources requires a model based approach several models exist that can be used to evaluate the regional supply and demand of conventional and alternative water resources such as a the water evaluation and planning system weap which can be used to evaluate water management scenarios based on a water balance accounting principle 19 b the watercress model which simulates the quantities and qualities of water flowing through a catchment area at equal continuous time steps 20 c the ribasim model which links hydrological conditions with the specific water users in the basin 21 d or the model developed by nobel and allen which matches and optimizes the water reuse possibilities between industries based on their location 10 these models are useful to evaluate and optimize the water supply and demand system when the water transport infrastructure is already present and the water resources to be used are defined a modelling approach which can select the optimal configuration of supply locations based on a wsn for which the transport infrastructure does not yet exist was still lacking such a model can assist in a transition towards regional water self sufficiency based on local renewable water sources a transition towards the use of local water resources requires an evaluation of the optimal network for water transport transporting large quantities of water usually occurs through pipelines pipeline construction costs depend on the local conditions and landscape features such as land use slope required excavation depth and subsurface soil type 12 22 the objective of the model we present is to generate the lowest cost wsn based on the local landscape characteristics and the available renewable water resources we combined geographic information system gis methods graph theory 23 and mixed integer quadratic programming the gis methods were used to include the influence of landscape characteristics on pipeline construction costs graph theory was used to model the relationships between objects 23 24 the supply and demand locations in our model represent the objects and are referred to as nodes the pipeline connections are the relationships between nodes and are referred to as edges mixed integer quadratic programming was then used to find the configuration of nodes and edges that leads to the lowest cost wsn in this paper we present a modelling approach which generates the lowest cost wsn for a specific demand based on known supply locations in a region we tested the approach on a case study in zeeuws vlaanderen in the southwestern part of the netherlands 2 case study description the model was tested by generating a wsn for an industrial site in zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands the current fresh water supply for the site is dependent on transport of water from outside this coastal fresh water scarce region most of the surface area of the region 733 km2 is used for agriculture local fresh groundwater sources are hosted within a lithologically heterogeneous aquifer and positioned on top of deeper more saline groundwater in this case study we consider a maximum chloride concentration of 1500 mg cl l as a limit for use in industry based on an accepted classification of a fresh saline interface 25 the fresh saline groundwater distribution in the area was mapped in 2015 26 calculated groundwater extractions should not cause the so called upconing of the fresh saline groundwater 1500 mg cl l interface in the deeper subsoil to avoid possible negative consequences for other water users e g famers in the area we tested the model to generate a wsn with the available fresh groundwater resources in the region operated at sustainable yields the current water supply of the industrial site is covered by importing 3 million m3 year 1 from outside the region we investigated the possibility to supply between 0 5 and 5 5 million m3 year 1 of water with groundwater resources in the region 3 methodology transport networks including wsns and their optimization have been thoroughly studied within the operations research field 17 a water transport network can be represented as nodes and edges 27 28 the nodes represent the water demand or supply locations and the edges represent the pipeline connections with associated costs between nodes graph theory optimization procedures can then be used to optimize the network 29 the presented model converts regional spatial data into a node and edge network generates the lowest cost wsn based on the water demand of the user and visualizes the result the model has four main steps fig 1 1 input data generation 2 cost of passage surface creation 3 least cost path determination 4 water supply network selection 3 1 input data the first step of the model compiles and generates the data required for step 2 4 in this section the components to generate the input data are described the supply and demand sites with respect to water quantities and qualities the landscape types and associated weights to determine the route of the pipeline infrastructure supply sites to generate a decentralized wsn possible sources of water need to be identified the supply site input data are the locations coordinates and the amount of water which the wells can supply sustainably m3 year 1 criteria such as the natural recharge of an aquifer 30 the environmental flow requirements of an area 31 or the overall sustainable water footprint of a river basin 32 can be used to determine the sustainable yield for water extractions for this case study fresh groundwater sources in the zeeuws vlaanderen region were modelled a maximum drawdown of 50 mm 33 of the phreatic groundwater level the change in water level at the extraction wells relative to the initial situation was set as the boundary condition for the allowed extraction rate in zeeuws vlaanderen brackish and saline groundwater is present below fresh groundwater therefore saline groundwater upconing can occur as a result of lowering the piezometric heads due to extraction and saline groundwater flowing to the extraction well extractions are dimensioned in such a way that the position of the 1500 mg cl l interface between the fresh groundwater above and the brackish groundwater below should not move into the groundwater extraction well 26 34 an available 3d variable density groundwater flow model coupled with a salt transport model 34 was used to provide the necessary data on hydraulic conductivities 35 and the groundwater salinity distribution expressed as mg cl up to a depth of 140 m below mean sea level msl 26 34 the 100 100 m resolution model uses the modflow 36 based computer code mocdens3d 65 66 and consists of 40 model layers to reproduce the movement of groundwater salinity in the vertical direction stresses in the model on the groundwater system includes six different surface water types sea and estuarine waters lakes canals small rivers water courses up to ditches seasonal natural groundwater recharge from the national hydrological instrument 37 a shallow drainage system and existing groundwater extraction wells the surface water and drainage systems seasonal water level and with a certain resistance to the groundwater system are inserted into the model using an accurate digital elevation model actueel hoogtebestand nederland ahn 38 resolution 5 5 m boundary conditions in the sea and at the hinterland complete the model 34 to obtain an estimate of fresh groundwater availability the depth of the fresh saline groundwater 1500 mg cl l interface was determined for the study area the resulting interface served as an initial estimate of the potential availability of fresh groundwater locations as the movement of groundwater is a dynamic process sustainability constraints need to be placed on extraction rates determining the extraction locations and associated rates was done in two steps 1 obtaining an initial selection of extraction coordinates based on the hydraulic properties of the subsoil 35 in combination with an analytical formula which estimates the maximum extraction without upconing of the fresh saline groundwater 1500 mg cl l interface into the extraction well 39 and 2 calculating the phreatic groundwater level drawdown for given extraction rates based on the super positional effect of the extraction well clusters the drawdown is based on hydrogeological parameters of a semi confined groundwater system and the extraction rates calculated with the so called formula of de glee of the wells 40 upconing of saline groundwater can be approximated using analytical methods such as discussed in refs 39 41 42 where a critical rise of the interface can be calculated the maximum sustainable extraction rate for the case study is set to the rate before saline groundwater will experience an abrupt rise towards the well screen this rise is given by the model of bear and dagan 41 and was calculated using fresh saline groundwater interface depths resulting in maximum extraction rates qmax in m3 day 1 per grid cell see annex 1 cells with extractions that are too small qmax 500 m3 day 1 were removed the remaining locations were extracted as points and finally grouped into clusters with extraction wells 100 m apart this step serves as an initial selection but does not yet consider the summed superposed effect of clustered extraction wells on the overall drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level saline groundwater upconing is related to drawdown therefore the latter was also quantified using an analytical method pumping rates were optimized for minimal summed drawdown and maximum extraction rates considering interference the summed effect of neighboring extraction wells the outcome allows the user to quantify the fresh groundwater extractable in m3 year 1 for a given maximum drawdown the relationship between the maximum accepted drawdown and the maximum extraction rate is linear reducing the maximum accepted drawdown by half yields half the extraction rate see annex 1 through this property the effect of altering the accepted drawdown as a possible sustainability criteria on the optimal wsn can be explored this analytical approach provides a first estimate of the sustainable yield at a specified groundwater drawdown the presented approach can be expanded with additional criteria to ensure overall sustainability of the groundwater system 43 45 demand sites the spatial location coordinates of the demand site s and their demand m3 year 1 for a specified quality of water for the case study in zeeland a single industrial user is used as the demand location the demand quality is set to a maximum of 1500 mg cl l the model was built to accept multiple demand sites landscape types the type of landscape and land use influence the costs of placing pipeline infrastructure 46 47 we use a landscape type map of the study area to find the pipeline routes with the lowest costs fig 2 the landscape types used in this work correspond to publicly available data for the netherlands 48 landscape weights to determine the pipeline routes with the lowest costs the different landscape types were weighted to reflect the costs of placing pipeline infrastructure within them the weights assigned to the landscape types reflect the relative differences in costs between the landscape types for example the costs associated with placing pipeline infrastructure in a built up area are high relative to an agricultural area the list of included landscape types can be expanded based on data availability and importance of specific landscape types in a region e g industrial areas or groundwater extraction areas 3 2 cost of passage surface the lowest costs for a pipeline between two locations do not necessarily correspond to a straight line 46 feldman et al 46 showed that the use of spatial data in the form of a cost of passage surface based on land use can reduce pipeline construction costs by 14 even when the total length of pipeline increases by 21 as a consequence a cost of passage surface is a raster in which each cell value represents the costs of traversing that cell and can be based on any type of costs for the case study the costs refer to the placement of pipeline infrastructure in this paper the weights assigned to each of the landscape types fig 2 were combined and overlaid using gis software to create the general cost of passage surface for pipeline infrastructure in the area the cost of passage surface is the input data to determine the least cost path the route with the lowest total costs to connect two locations in this case with pipeline infrastructure 49 51 3 3 least cost paths based on the general cost of passage surface the lowest costs route for a pipeline between two locations was calculated fig 3 the least cost path between two locations is the shortest route between two locations according to the metric used in the cost of passage surface 52 least cost path methods have been widely used for infrastructure routing 49 50 53 to create the least cost paths the cost of passage surface was converted into an accumulated cost surface for each location the accumulated cost surfaces were then used to trace the lowest cost route between the departure and destination locations 51 the weighting procedure section 3 1 allows users to consider criteria with different metrics e g construction costs slope distance to protected areas and to have all criteria be reflected in the final least cost path 54 the steps shown in fig 3 describe the procedure to determine the least cost path between a set of two locations to generate the wsn with the lowest costs all the possible connections between all the demand and supply locations are needed for each demand or supply location the least cost paths to all other locations were calculated the resulting least cost paths for all possible combinations of locations were overlaid and combined into a single least cost network when creating the network a node was added at each location where pipelines intersect the added nodes serve as transport hubs where flows can merge but do not affect the overall water balance in the network the model considers the merging of flows by calculating the required pipeline capacity and associated costs before and after the transport hubs hubs are represented by their location coordinates but have a demand and supply of zero the above procedure results in a v x v where v is the set of all locations or nodes adjacency matrix as shown in step 3 of fig 1 the values in the matrix represent the length kilometers of the lowest cost pipeline route between each starting location i and destination location j the diagonal zeros represent the fact that the distance from each location to itself is zero 3 4 water supply network selection the mathematical representation of the optimization problem in this work is a variation of the fixed charge network flow problem which is used to model many practical problems in the areas of transportation and distribution 55 the problem is characterized by the set up costs a fixed charge that is incurred when an activity is performed 56 57 for pipeline construction the fixed charges are the costs that need to be made irrespective of the size of the pipe being placed we used a mixed integer quadratic programming miqp method to solve the optimization problem and to generate the optimal wsn 56 the system is represented by a graph g v e with nodes v and edges e the supply and demand locations are the nodes and the possible transport pipelines the edges the set of edges e is the result of section 3 3 each edge i j in e where i is the source and j is the destination is described according to the following parameters flow x i j the amount of water being transported over the edge maximum capacity u i j the maximum amount of water which can be transported over an edge since the wsn is not yet built the maximum capacity is not yet defined this parameter makes it possible to generate wsns incorporating parts of existing pipeline infrastructure fixed costs f i j the fixed costs which will be incurred to place the pipeline irrespective of the amount of water transported costs per unit flow c i j the costs to increase the capacity of a pipeline according to the amount of water which needs to be transported on off y i j binary variable with value 1 if the pipeline connection is used or 0 the pipeline connection is not used water demand supply s i the water demand negative value or supplied positive value to the network at each node transport hubs have a demand supply of zero each node has an associated water supply or water demand s i in the network for locations that supply water s i 0 for transport hubs that do not provide or consume water s i 0 and for water users that extract water from the network s i 0 the costs per unit flow c i j are based on the length of the pipeline section i j the result of the least cost path analysis and the pipeline diameter required to achieve a suitable flow speed the suitable range for flow speed while considering a 1 5 factor for peak demands was set between 0 5 m s 1 and 1 5 m s 1 the fixed costs f i j are also based on the length of the associated pipeline section but are not dependent on the water flow the capacity dependent pipeline placement costs used in the model were 0 5 euro mm 1 diameter m 1 the relation between accepted flow velocity and available pipeline diameters generally available in increments of 100 mm yield a stepwise behavior in terms of costs against flow annex 2 we approximate the stepwise behavior with a quadratic function from which the constants serve to establish the objective function for the network selection procedure according to 1 minimize t p p c i j e c α i j x i j 2 i j e c β i j x i j i j e f i j y i j 2 where c α i j α l i j 3 where c β i j β l i j 4 where f i j ε l i j where t p p c is the total pipeline placement costs for the wsn based on the adequate diameter to accommodate the required flow over each edge and l is the length of the pipeline km between nodes i j generated through the least cost path analysis the coefficients α β and ε are the constants derived from the quadratic relationship between flow and pipeline placement costs annex 2 the optimization problem can be characterized as a mixed integer quadratic program due to the quadratic term in the objective function the left and middle terms represent the sum of the costs per unit flow over each edge the right term is the sum of the fixed costs for all the edges used if an edge is not used there are no costs fixed or per unit flow associated with that edge the constraints of the optimization model are given by equations 5 7 the first constraint ensures that the sum of the flows out of any node left term is smaller or equal to the sum of the flows entering the node middle term and the supply right term at the node equation 2 applies to every node i in the set of nodes v 5 subject to i j e x i j j i e x j i s i i v the second constraint ensures that if an edge is used the flow should be larger or equal to zero while at the same time it should be smaller or equal to the maximum capacity of the edge equation 6 existing pipeline infrastructure has a maximum capacity which can be incorporated in the model through parameter u i j the model returns the flow over each pipeline and therefore the capacity which needs to be installed this constraint only applies to edges in use but is evaluated for every edge i j in the set of edges e 6 0 x i j u i j y i j i j e the variable y i j denotes whether an edge is used or not and can take the value 0 not in use or 1 in use equation 7 if the edge is used the fixed costs to place the pipeline are incurred this variable is also evaluated for every edge i j in the set of edges e 7 y i j 0 1 i j e the output of the optimization yields the edgelist of the lowest cost wsn the amount of water to be transported over each edge and the capacity at which the supply locations should be operated the miqp was implemented in python and solved with the gurobi optimization solver 4 results zeeuws vlaanderen case 4 1 regional water supply fresh groundwater sources the extraction location selection procedure yielded about 2000 extraction well locations from which fresh groundwater could be extracted the possible extraction wells were grouped into 25 clusters in which individual extraction wells are at least 100 m apart clusters close to the coastlines are dune type geological formations capturing and storing fresh rainwater the optimized clusters including the individual extraction wells are shown in fig 4 the total amount of water which can be extracted from the 25 clusters when limiting head drawdown to 50 mm is 7 6 million m3 year 1 the spatial center of each cluster is used to generate the wsn 4 2 least cost pipeline network the construction of pipeline infrastructure is preferred in areas where the construction costs are the lowest table 1 shows the weighted costs for pipeline infrastructure construction used in this work the weights assigned to the different categories were determined in consultation with water supply experts a distinction was made between crossing a road or waterway as opposed to building parallel to these landscape types the zones parallel to transport infrastructure are relatively suitable to place pipeline infrastructure because other uses for these areas are limited crossing transport infrastructure should be avoided to reduce costs in this work we reduced the costs of pipeline infrastructure parallel to transport infrastructure by 70 compared to the original landscape type traversed fig 5 a shows the combined cost of passage surface based on the landscape cost weights to place pipeline infrastructure the areas with the lowest costs are agricultural areas along existing transport infrastructure the original weighted cost for agricultural areas was 50 table 1 which is reduced by 70 in the zones parallel to existing infrastructure to yield the lowest final weighted cost of 15 generation of the least cost paths for all possible connections between the water supply and demand locations yielded a preliminary network with 408 edges fig 5b the preliminary number of edges did not yet account for the possibility to transport water in both directions to include the possibility to transport water in both directions the original edges were copied and the start and end points were inverted the result is an adjacency matrix not shown with 816 2 408 values the total number of nodes in the network is 269 of which 25 are the supply locations fig 5b 1 is the demand location and 243 are transport hubs the complete network has a total length of 1796 km 21 passes agricultural area 1 built up and 1 forest and open natural area the remainder 76 falls within the parallel zone alongside existing transport infrastructure or waterways the length of pipeline traversing each landscape type is a reflection of the weights assigned to each type table 1 assigning equal weights to each landscape type would result in unrealistic straight lines between nodes 4 3 lowest cost water supply network the model creates the lowest cost wsn specific to the demand of the user and the available water supply fig 6 pipeline diameter and flow velocity are shown in annex 3 and annex 4 we discuss the wsns i vii of fig 6 in order of increasing demand below i the optimal wsn to supply the starting demand of 0 5 million m3 year 1 uses three supply locations and is 25 1 km long ii the wsn configuration changes considerably because the supply locations of i while being closer cannot cover the demand of 0 6 million m3 year 1 the optimal wsn uses the most southern supply location as the single supply source iii demand reaches 2 1 million m3 year 1 exceeding the 2 08 million m3 year 1 available at the most southern location a small supply location close to the existing route is added to the wsn to cover the demand the inclusion of the small supply location reduces the capacity at which the southern supply locations is operated and reduces the diameter of the pipeline up to the point where the pipelines merge iv the optimal wsn shifts to the east to include a supply location with more water to cover the demand the inclusion of this new location reduces the capacity at which the southern well is operated from 2 05 in iii to 1 8 million m3 year 1 v the optimal wsn still includes the most southern supply location but now also includes the second largest supply location in the area with a supply of 0 92 million m3 year 1 the second largest supply location is operated at 98 capacity 0 90 million m3 year 1 because demand is still below the maximum water availability vi the optimal wsn is rearranged to include the southern supply source with 0 14 million m3 year 1 the capacity at which the most eastern supply location is operated is lowered to 93 0 86 million m3 year 1 vii the optimal wsn has a different configuration compared to vi to supply the maximum investigated demand of 5 5 million m3 year 1 the most eastern supply site with a supply 0 92 million m3 year 1 is approached with a new branch of the network directly going east instead of expanding the branch from the south east as in v and vi in general the optimal wsn configuration results from operating the supply location furthest from the demand location at the lowest possible capacity this can reduce the amount of water supplied by a specific well when demand increases and new supply locations are added to the wsn an example of this occurs in the transition from iii to iv by reducing the operating capacity of the furthermost supply location the pipeline diameter which needs to be installed over the complete network is minimized leading to reduced costs as the demand increases the costs of the optimal wsn increase with steps to reflect the shifts in wsn configuration fig 7 in fig 7 the costs of the wsns i vii of fig 6 are annotated and the optimal wsn costs for a drawdown of 75 mm are shown for comparison the steps in costs arise from the need to add new supply locations to the wsn each time demand exceeds the maximum capacity of a set of supply locations at each step increasing the diameter capacity of pipelines is no longer sufficient to cover the demand and additional pipelines to new supply locations are needed the addition of a new pipeline connection incurs the fixed costs which causes the steps in costs in the lower demand range up to vi the steps in costs for adding supply locations are more pronounced at higher demand ranges the cost steps become less pronounced because the total number of supply locations required to cover the demand is larger when many supply location are needed subtle changes in the network are possible to minimize costs making the steps less pronounced a linear increase in costs as occurs between a demand of 0 7 ii and 2 0 million m3 year 1 at 50 mm drawdown indicates that the only added costs occur from adding additional capacity increasing pipeline diameter to the network 5 discussion 5 1 modelling approach over the last decades water resources management has increasingly relied on computer models 58 the model in this study adds to the existing modelling toolbox by offering the possibility to generate and evaluate decentralized water supply networks these networks are based on local fresh and in the future saline water resources as a base for enhancing regional water self sufficiency the model accepts any supply location if the spatial location and the available amount of water are provided this allows the evaluation of water supply networks in which surface water rainwater wastewater brackish or saline water are used as decentralized supply sources the complexity of the optimization problem in terms of the number of network configurations which can cover the demand increases exponentially as the number of supply locations increases the presented model is therefore particularly suited to assist in the design process for decentralized water supply networks with many smaller supply locations adhering to maximum sustainable yields reducing the overall water demand of a user is directly related to a reduction in the amount of water which needs to be transported the stepwise behavior of the wsn costs reveals tipping points where reductions in demand can significantly influence the wsn configuration and costs the model can be used to compare the costs of transport with the costs for demand reduction through the implementation of water saving technologies or through an increase of water re use depending on the local landscape and water supply sources either option may be favorable for example the costs for desalination have been decreasing over the years 59 which can make water supply networks based on small scale local brackish sources preferable over long distance transport of high quality water the costs of pipeline infrastructure depend on many factors 60 and can vary with a factor of 25 based on the methods and materials used 61 as long as the same cost function for placing pipeline infrastructure is applicable to the complete case study area the model will generate the lowest cost wsn the wsn can also be optimized based on other criteria than monetary costs a cost function in terms of carbon dioxide emissions or energy use will yield the optimal wsn in terms of the respective cost function metric 5 2 sustainable water use self sufficiency and sustainability can be enhanced by harvesting alternative local renewable resources 62 63 the model we present generates the optimal network to connect supply and demand within the boundaries of sustainably available water resources on any scale considering sustainable water availability over all relevant scales is needed to ensure overall long term sustainability 64 65 long term sustainability of the decentralized wsn requires adherence to the catchment s water budget 66 and ensuring that the cumulative effect of local extractions do not negatively alter the entire drainage basin 8 in the case study the maximum phreatic water level drawdown was set to a single value for all well clusters determining and applying specific drawdown values for each location based on criteria applicable to the local context is suggested for future research prevention of land subsidence as a consequence of draining peatlands 67 is such an additional criteria for specific low lying areas in the netherlands in other areas the maximum phreatic water level drawdown should be sensible with the presence of water intensive crop areas drawdown values and subsequent extraction rates can be matched with these local conditions at a very high spatial resolution for this study it was decided that the analytical methods to determine water extraction rates are sufficient to identify possible supply locations and to show the functionality of the modelling approach validating the extraction rates through a 3d numerical groundwater flow model 34 68 69 with an adequate resolution is suggested as a future step 5 3 context specific application the case study presents a single set of weights for the landscape types in the region based on contact with water transport infrastructure experts involving local stakeholders to determine the weights makes the model results more context specific methodologies such as multi criteria evaluations can be applied to spatial data to determine which areas are more or less suited for a certain purpose 70 each set of favored criteria will yield a specific cost of passage surface which will in turn yield a specific wsn configuration by defining and assigning the cost weights for each landscape type in consultation with local stakeholders the model generates water supply networks tailored to the local context publicly available spatial data on landscape types limited to the netherlands was used to demonstrate the workings of the model spatial data from other countries belgium for this case study can be incorporated to assist with the transboundary nature of integrated water resources management 71 consultation with local stakeholders can increase the number of landscape types included in the model because the categories of the national dataset are limited the manual addition of no go areas such as natura 2000 areas 72 or local heritage sites makes results more site specific and complements the generic spatial data relevant for pipeline construction costs 6 conclusion this study presents a modelling approach to generate decentralized water supply networks based on the local landscape characteristics and water availability of a region we add a novel approach to the modelling toolbox for regional water planners by incorporating spatial data and the effect of landscape types on the costs to place pipeline infrastructure in combination with an optimization procedure based on a water balance between supply and demand water supply networks optimized to the local context can be generated by incorporating these spatial aspects representing the water network as nodes and edges makes it possible solve the complex optimization problem with mixed integer quadratic programming the model was used for a case study in zeeuws vlaanderen in the south of the netherlands to supply an industrial zone with regional fresh groundwater as an alternative to importing fresh water from outside the region the model generates 1 the pipeline configuration for the lowest cost water supply network 2 the amount of water flowing over each pipeline in the network 3 the capacity at which the supply locations should be operated the model can be extended with other conventional and alternative water sources such as brackish water resources and wastewater treatment plant effluents in that case treatment costs to achieve adequate quality and related costs need to be included decision makers can use the model to evaluate scenarios with varying supply and demand settings and to identify the points at which sudden increases in transport network costs occur credit authorship contribution statement joeri willet project administration conceptualization methodology data curation visualization writing

to 2050 predicts that the global water demand for manufacturing will increase by 400 between 2000 and 2050 2 to ensure the sustainability of water resources the industry should improve water efficiency in a value chain as well as maximise the opportunities for safe re use of different grades of water moreover water related industries need to focus not only on climate change and water

both reducing and oxidizing radicals for water treatment 12 14 innovative advanced treatment technologies are currently being developed for highly polluted water the reviews of biological chemical advanced chemical technologies or advanced oxidation processes and hybrid technologies for the treatment of industrial wastewaters were presented 15 20 although many new technologies have been proposed the main concept is to use hybrid approaches that combine various treatment mechanisms to remove the full spectrum of chemicals present in pharmaceutical wastewaters the rapid development of the pharmaceutical industry presents conflicting challenges to water resources management the discharge of inadequately treated wastewaters results in the release of pharmaceutical substances into the environment resulting in risks to water quality and a possible adverse impact on aquatic ecosystems and public health 21 in recent years there has been an increasing focus on water use in those several highly water dependent industries besides the production of pharmaceuticals the chemical industry 22 23 motor vehicle production 24 paper production 25 26 the steel industry 27 28 the textile industry 29 30 as well as the food and beverage industry 31 33 the pharmaceutical industry has a special place in this list of highly water dependent industries many pharmaceutical processes require very pure water that meets strict quality standards simultaneously they can generate heavily polluted and toxic wastewaters that require complex and costly multi step treatment to meet the regulatory requirements 21 pharmaceutical plants typically use a broad range of chemicals and technological processes presenting major challenges for waste cleanup technologies and procedures mineralization represents the most effective treatment which is the ultimate goal in many areas of pollutant control and destruction high purity water is an indispensable resource for the production of medicines for human and veterinary use but at the same time the pharmaceutical industry is one of the main polluters of local water resources 21 another source of high risk regarding pharmaceuticals is very polluted waste water at hospitals and homes for the elderly this waste water contains pharmaceuticals together with greatly variable and hazardous microbiological pollutants where the concentration of pharmaceutical residues could be several times higher than in municipal wastewater 34 37 futhermore without any treatment veterinary pharmaceutical residues from aquaculture and livestock farms can enter into the water as an active parent product or biologically active metabolites 38 the current trends of sustainable development goals sdg include efforts of water re use which is recognized as a key option to reduce water consumption at the manufacturing facility level 39 however the re use of water in pharmaceutical production is met with caution from the regulatory agencies concerned with the quality and safety of pharmaceuticals prompting new strategies that may reconcile the conflicting goals of wastewater re use and ensuring that contaminants cannot enter pharmaceutical production via reused water innovative zld technologies make it possible to almost completely eliminate wastewater discharges maximizing water re use in the industry 40 43 despite the high potential for water saving the application of zld on an industrial scale is currently very limited due to the high costs energy consumption 40 and the generation of solid hazardous waste 40 41 although the data from certain industries point to opportunities for decreasing water consumption by up to 50 44 implementation of circular water management in the pharmaceutical industry is quite limited due to very strict legislative regulations and safety considerations the main barriers for water re use in the pharmaceutical industry are the unique requirements of water quality and the risks associated with product contamination and human health 15 with the rapid development of a circular economic strategy within the eu member states in recent years many incentives have been implemented providing support for research and innovation through different grant programmes while promoting new legal and economic regulations therefore pharmaceutical manufacturers are currently interested in practical options for closing the water loop in those technological processes where water does not come into direct contact with pharmaceutical products moreover manufacturers are seeking to minimise the use of water energy and hazardous materials to eliminate waste during the product life cycle and to use treated wastewater for other purposes in several countries switzerland the usa singapore australia where wastewater after treatment is reused for agricultural irrigation or discharged into aquifers that also serve as sources of drinking water certain pharmaceuticals are included in the water monitoring programs 45 while these biologically active substances are not systematically regulated at a global level despite evidence of the presence of pharmaceutical residues in various aquatic environments of latvia 46 the state has not yet implemented a long term strategy to reduce the risk caused by this pollution the purpose of this article is to point out water related challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry the overall water flow at the pharmaceutical plant of jsc grindeks is shown the most water intensive technological processes are identified and reusable water streams are specified the second objective is to show and assess the environmental benefit of the best practically implemented pharmaceutical wastewater re use examples on the basis of the experience gained at jsc grindeks a medium sized multiproduct pharmaceutical company 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant description the pharmaceutical company jsc grindeks located in riga latvia was selected for a case study in our article the multi product manufacturing facility of jsc grindeks produces both active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and final dosage forms fdfs belonging to the cardiovascular central nervous system gastroenterological and anti cancer therapeutic groups the wastewaters originating from the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities of jsc grindeks are polluted with a wide range of difficult to degrade and toxic organic compounds including phenols while also containing high concentrations of organic nitrogen compounds and inorganic salts in combination with the near absence of phosphorus compounds the wastewaters are treated in a system of compact moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs the technological process and main operational parameters of the wwtp are detailed in a previous study by strade et al 47 according to the data from year 2019 the average wastewater flow is 200 m3 d while the incoming cod load fluctuates from 0 4 to 2 2 t per day and the total nitrogen load varies from 0 012 to 0 075 t per day after pre treatment the wastewaters are discharged into the municipal sewer system for final treatment 2 2 data acquisition a comprehensive analysis of the incoming and outgoing water flows within the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities of jsc grindeks was carried out including pharmaceutical grade water cooling water water for the steam generation and wastewater the analysis included plant specific data about i water supply sources ii quality requirements of water used for industrial purposes iii water preparation pre treatment processes used at the manufacturing facilities iv water consumption v wastewater production generation composition flows and treatments vi water and wastewater reuse practices the numerical values of water consumption and wastewater reuse were analysed using the monitoring data from year 2019 the relevant data were obtained from internal technical documentation and standard operating procedures from the information provided to local regulatory agencies as well as through interviews with employees the chemical and microbiological purity standards of the pharmaceutical grade water and the defined uses during the various manufacturing stages of the apis and fdfs were summarized and analysed according to good manufacturing practice gmp guidelines pharmacopoeia monographs and the guidelines from european medicines agency ema and the world health organisation who 2 3 data evaluation on the basis of the complete water flow analysis the overall water flow chart for the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities of jsc grindeks was summarized and analysed for the first time the information obtained was used to identify the bottlenecks in the current water management system and to point out the opportunities to improve water usage efficiency to implement reuse solutions and to close the water loop restrictions and limitations related to direct water reuse in the pharmaceutical production were emphasized based on the sector specific regulatory requirements and product quality and safety risks the percentage of water savings from water efficiency improvements and reuse actions was estimated using scientific and technical literature sources in order to demonstrate the dependence of pharmaceutical industry on water resources the first part of the article provides an overview of the diverse applications of water in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes the sector specific water quality requirements are analysed in this part to underline the difference of pharmaceutical industry from other process industries considering that the pharmaceutical sector also is one of the major polluters of water resources the following section of this article points out the shortcomings of the current legislation regarding the control of environmental emissions from the pharmaceutical industry various possibilities for applying the principles of circular economy through the recovery of resources and the reuse of wastewater streams are discussed at the end of this article the application of the principles of circular economy in the management of chemically polluted wastewater was analysed from three aspects i the reuse of untreated wastewater streams as secondary resources in the biological wastewater treatment processes ii the recovery of materials from concentrated wastewater streams ii the possibilities and limitations of wastewater reuse after the application of different treatment strategies 3 results and discussion 3 1 different grades of water in the pharmaceutical industry according to the world health organisation the most widely used raw material in pharmaceutical manufacturing is water 48 consistent and high quality water supply is required for the production of pharmaceutical products rinsing and cleaning of equipment as well as for technical purposes like steam generation and cooling 15 the various types of water use in pharmaceutical manufacturing requires efficient management of both incoming and outgoing water flows the water flows at jsc grindeks are depicted in fig 1 this scheme characterises the water sources and the applied water pre treatment methods in various technological processes and also outlines the wastewater management practices at the company a reference to this flow chart is given in the following sections of this article to describe the specific stages of water management at jsc grindeks 3 1 1 pharmaceutical grade water in pharmaceutical manufacturing different grades of water are used as raw material ingredient and solvent in the production processing and formulation of active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and final dosage forms fdfs for human or veterinary use fig 2 the grades of water used highly depend on the formulation and the route of administration of the pharmaceutical product and as well as on the stage in the manufacturing process at which water is used 49 fig 2 summarises the minimum acceptable grade of water used during the manufacture of apis and fdfs potable water may be used in chemical synthesis of all intermediates of api prior to the final isolation and purification steps potable water is also used for the initial rinse of the manufacturing equipment containers and closures in the manufacturing of apis and non sterile fdfs unless there are specific technical or quality requirements for higher grades of water 49 potable water is not covered by a pharmacopoeia monograph but should at a minimum meet the world health organisation who guidelines for drinking water quality 50 potable water is used as feed water for the production of pharmaceutical grade waters purified water and water for injections purified water pw pw is used as an excipient for the final isolation and purification of apis and for the preparation of nonsterile fdfs additionally pw is used in the granulation and tablet coating processes preparation of ointments creams and gels as well as for the formulation of syrups the water content in each fdf is specified in the registration dossier pw is the accepted grade of water for the final rinse of equipment containers and closures in the manufacture of non parenteral fdfs pw is typically prepared by ion exchange ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis ro or distillation jsc grindeks uses a six step purification system for obtaining pw for pharmaceutical production fig 1 the purification system provides mechanical filtration iron removal softening filtration through activated carbon a two stage ro process and degassing the pw storage and distribution system consists of a water storage tank a circulation pump a uv irradiation cell and a pw circulation loop pipeline with water outlet valves at the production sites the average annual pw consumption of jsc grindeks is about 6500 7000 m3 water for injections wfi wfi is the highest quality water used by the pharmaceutical industry wfi is used in the manufacturing of sterile pharmaceutical products for parenteral administration and other pharmaceutical products where endotoxin content must be controlled wfi is also used for the final rinsing of primary packaging materials wfi must be sterile and non pyrogenic in order to avoid the introduction of contamination and to prevent the growth of microorganisms in pharmaceutical products until 2017 the european union good manufacturing practice gmp regulations disallowed the production of wfi by non distillation methods because of concerns about biofilm formation and endotoxin contamination after recent changes in the european pharmacopoeia it is now also allowed to produce wfi by reverse osmosis coupled to other suitable techniques such as electro deionisation ultrafiltration or nano filtration jsc grindeks uses very small quantities of wfi 1 m3 year which are purchased from external suppliers this type of water is used in the final production stage for the oxytocin api due to the tight specification for microbiological purity and the absence of endotoxins water for the preparation of extracts water for the preparation of herbal drug extracts must comply with the requirements for pw or water intended for human consumption of a quality equivalent to that defined in directive 98 83 ec 49 the chemical and microbiological purity requirements for pharmaceutical grade water are defined in the relevant pharmacopoeias table 1 represents the current quality specifications for pw and wfi defined by the european pharmacopoeia ph eur and the united states pharmacopoeia usp unlike usp ph eur specifies a limit for heavy metals in pw and a limit for nitrate concentration in pw and wfi both pharmacopoeias also have different requirements for the electrical conductivity of pharmaceutical grade water the control of bacterial endotoxins lipopolysaccharide cell wall components of gram negative bacteria in water used in the manufacture of fdfs intended for parenteral administration is critical as reaction to endotoxins can lead to potentially lethal anaphylactic shock in patients 51 a less commonly discussed aspect is the continued quality assurance of the various water grades pharmaceutical water production storage and distribution systems should be designed installed commissioned qualified and maintained to ensure reliable production of water at the specified quality 48 failure to meet water quality requirements poses an unacceptable risk to public health therefore continuous quality control of water used in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products is of vital importance the frequency of quality control and the water sampling points are usually specified by the water monitoring programs failures in the purification process pose critical levels of risk and the lack of proper quality water can result in manufacturing downtime or product recall despite the use of validated purification systems and stringent operational controls microbial contamination is the most challenging issue in the purification process of pharmaceutical grade water recent recall surveys from the usa have found that the presence of water borne bacteria burkholderia cepacia represent the vast majority of microbiological contamination cases that have triggered food and drug administration fda recalls of non sterile drug products 52 various design features like continual circulation at a flowrate of 1 3 m s heating options and the inclusion of high intensity ultraviolet uv light lamps may be incorporated to prevent the growth of biofilms and to control microbial contamination in pharmaceutical grade water systems 51 the experience at jsc grindeks shows that proper sanitation and regular maintenance procedures are essential to preventing microbial proliferation and recontamination of the water for example a validated sanitization procedure of the pw distribution and storage system in the api manufacturing facility is performed with 3 or 10 hydrogen peroxide solution 1 at least once a year 2 if the pw system has been shut down for more than 14 days 3 in cases in which the parameters of microbiological contamination do not meet the requirements of the relevant pharmacopoeia thermal sanitization 85 c 30 min of the pw system in the fdf manufacturing facility is used for routine operations twice per year and if the toc or total number of aerobic bacteria of the pw circulating in the loop exceed the maximum level or if the loop has been emptied if reconstruction work in the loop has been performed or the system has been exposed to air special attention is paid to the plastic tubing at pw outlet points to avoid the introduction of microbiological contamination into the pw circulation loop they are disconnected rinsed with 70 ethanol and dried after each use as well as replaced at least every 6 months from a water efficiency standpoint the preparation of pharmaceutical grade water is associated with relatively high losses of water the experience of jsc grindeks confirms that due to the very high purity requirements of pw up to 50 of the feed water is discharged as waste from the ro modules fig 1 however this water is still of sufficiently high quality for re use as an alternative onsite water source in units that do not come into a direct contact with pharmaceutical products for example in cooling systems this inefficiency has been identified as one of the bottlenecks in the water management system of jsc grindeks where the circular economy approach could be applied to partially close the water loop and to reduce the water consumption by about 7000 m3 annually equal to 12 of the total amount of potable water used in production processes at jsc grindeks 3 1 2 process water in addition to direct use in pharmaceutical production where water comes into contact with pharmaceutical substances it is also used as a key resource for technical purposes for example cooling and steam generation 3 1 2 1 cooling water to provide reliable pharmaceutical manufacturing process conditions the correct process temperature must be guaranteed at all times which may require a cooling capacity the main pharmaceutical manufacturing processes that require an effective cooling system are batch processing in multipurpose reactors for example temperature sensitive chemical reactions crystallization of final products cooling of creams and ointments before pouring and packaging wet granulation processes for tablet production moulding of gelatine capsules sterilisation of liquid fdfs due to its high heat capacity and low cost water is the most common coolant cooling water should be pre treated to ensure efficient heat transfer reduce total energy consumption and avoid equipment failure pre treatment depends on feed water quality and usually includes iron removal softening the addition of corrosion and scale inhibitors and treatment with biocides to prevent biological fouling in the heat exchange systems 53 it is also important to control the ph value of cooling water as acidic environment promotes corrosion while alkaline ph increases scale formation 54 the traditionally used cooling towers or once through single pass cooling systems often represent the largest percentage of water consumption in pharmaceutical manufacturing 55 and jsc grindeks is not an exception the once through cooling system used at jsc grindeks consumes up to 250 000 m3 of water annually which exceeds the total amount of potable water used for pharmaceutical manufacturing processes by a factor of about 4 2 after a single pass through heat exchangers and or condensers the heated water is discharged into the storm water drainage system the reduction of high water consumption by once through cooling systems requires a change towards closed loop recirculating cooling systems that consume an order of magnitude lower volume of cooling water compared to once through systems 53 it has been noted by other authors that the installation of adiabatic cooling systems allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce water consumption by up to 98 compared to the traditionally used open loop cooling systems 53 56 besides reusing the same clean water into closed circuit also eliminates the costs associated with the treatment and disposal of water and also eliminates the concerns associated with legionnaires disease 56 jsc grindeks obtains its cooling water from 2 artesian boreholes located on the territory of the plant the natural and regulatory limits to water extraction from an artesian aquifer prevent further expansion of production unless more water efficient cooling technologies are introduced otherwise the available groundwater resources may be insufficient for the required cooling capacity and extensive use of this resource will incur regulatory and taxation costs 3 1 2 2 water for steam generation steam used in pharmaceutical facilities can be separated into three categories plant steam chemical free steam and pure steam table 2 depending on the intended use of the steam there are different requirements of feed water quality and steam generation methods feed water of the plant steam boiler must be derived from water that is of drinking quality it is treated to remove the bulk of dissolved solids hardness and silica which could cause scaling and corrosion of the steam generator and pipelines the manufacturing facilities of jsc grindeks consume about 17 18 000 m3 of potable water per year for plant steam production boiler feed water is purified by passing through mechanical filters cation exchange softening resins and an ro system that greatly reduces the content of scale forming salts improves boiler efficiency and steam purity chemical free steam is typically a separate type of steam generated without chemical boiler additives 57 it is used for humidity control of processes and critical cleanrooms where pharmaceutical products are directly exposed to the room atmosphere jsc grindeks also uses humidification to eliminate the build up of static electricity in manufacturing environments where flammable gases or substances are being used several local steam boilers are installed in the manufacturing facilities for such purposes pure steam is the highest quality of steam used in pharmaceutical manufacturing it is used for the sterilisation of pharmaceutical products equipment or piping this type of steam is critical to biopharmaceutical production and for the production of injectable solutions unlike plant steam no chemical additives are permitted in the treatment of water used in pure steam generators as pure steam comes into direct contact with pharmaceutical products or product contact surfaces additional treatment of feed water should be performed to ensure that the condensate of pure steam meets wfi requirements for conductivity toc microbial content and endotoxins 58 as jsc grindeks does not produce sterile pharmaceutical products pure steam is not used in the manufacturing processes the recovery and on site re use of steam condensate is one of the key actions that can improve the water efficiency at manufacturing facilities the re use of high purity condensate also reduces chemical use feed water treatment costs and saves energy since after returning to the boiler the hot condensate requires much less energy to reheat for repeated steam production despite the potential water savings steam condensate is not recovered and reused as boiler feed water at jsc grindeks the major obstacle here is that the boiler house is located about 500 m from the manufacturing facilities the relatively long distance and the initial investment that would be necessary to build a condensate return line have prevented the re use of plant steam condensate from a water efficiency point of view in instances in which the installation costs of condensate recovery equipment are too high to be justified factories should evaluate alternative options for re use of condensate due to its inherent heat content condensate can be reused in various heating systems or as a source of clean hot water for washing purposes there are not only financial and technical but also product quality and safety issues that need to be considered when analysing condensate re use options in a pharmaceutical plant as pure steam comes into contact with pharmaceutical products the condensate must not be directly returned to a pure steam generator because of contamination risk 58 potential microbiological contamination of condensate from hvac systems also is one of the risk factors that could limit condensate re use scientific publications report that hvac condensate can be contaminated with legionella and other airborne bacteria therefore the harvested condensate water must be properly disinfected before re use as an alternative water resource 59 our case study confirms the conclusions of the united nations 60 that the industry often prioritizes production capacity over water efficiency and conservation a common reason for this is that investments in efficient cooling processes or water reuse systems may have longer return on investment than short term improvements in production capacity moreover low water prices in the regions with good freshwater availability also do not encourage investment in water efficiency at the plant level and the potential benefits of water efficiency improvements in industry are often underestimated in order to properly evaluate and provide justifications for modifications to equipment or operating practices the new and true value of water should be assessed accounting not only for the water supply costs but also for the related treatment pumping storage purification and disposal costs 6 3 1 3 water recovered from drug manufacturing processes pharmaceutical products are typically produced in multi stage batch processes that create highly complex waste streams with variable chemical composition toxicity and volume 15 such variation in the quality and quantity of wastewater may cause shock and overload to the treatment systems which leads to malfunctioning or even failure of treatment processes particularly biological treatment 61 in order to ensure effective treatment of pharmaceutical effluents manufacturing plants must separately manage different types of wastewater distinguish highly toxic and concentrated streams and providing pre treatment if necessary wastewater biodegradability and toxicity as well as the concentration of specific pollutants in the individual batch streams must be taken into account for selecting the most appropriate treatment methods the evaluation and separation of pharmaceutical batch streams according to the nature of the contamination is a key activity not only for finding the most appropriate treatment solution but also for assessing the recovery or re use potential of materials in the effluents a cost effective and simple method for toxicity screening of pharmaceutical wastewater has been implemented in laboratory practice at the wwtp of jsc grindeks which is based on bod measurements over a wide range of initial concentrations 47 by using a simple bod cod relationship for different batch loads it is possible to identify the most toxic flows and to determine safe rates of discharge into biological wastewater treatment systems the extensive initial concentration range used in the experiments which corresponds to the real amount of wastewater generated per day while also accounting for the dilution in equalization tank allows determination of the toxic threshold concentration of the sample these data are used as a basis for assessing the risks and predicting the process performance in the case of production increases or changes in the presence of specific pollutants in wastewater primary attention should be paid to the most toxic compounds that enter the wastewater as synthesis by products or unreacted raw materials if the screening indicates that wastewaters are toxic to activated sludge already at low concentration levels separate collection at the source and further research should be performed pre treatment options are then evaluated or waste disposal by specialised service providers may be required 3 2 the role of legislation in controlling the emissions of apis from manufacturing plants a very important issue at a global level is the role of the pharmaceutical industry in reducing the discharge of pharmaceutical substances into the aquatic environment despite the recent concerns regarding the risks to human health and ecosystems posed by pharmaceuticals current eu legislation does not regulate the emissions of apis at the manufacturing stage the industrial emissions directive 2010 75 eu which also applies to pharmaceutical manufacturing sites does not include apis on the list of polluting substances and there are no threshold values established for pharmaceutical discharge apis that are already registered with the european medicines agency ema as ingredients of medicinal products for human and veterinary use are also exempt from the reach regulations gmp guidelines essentially focus on pharmaceutical product quality and safety parameters and do not include any requirements for environmental protection there are a number of shortcomings in the existing ema guidance for environmental risk assessment first there are insufficient or no environmental risk assessment era data available for numerous widely consumed pharmaceutical products that entered the market before the respective guidelines came into force in the eu era is a mandatory requirement for all new marketing authorization applications for medicinal products intended for human and veterinary use only since 2006 and 2001 respectively 62 second the risks associated with api discharges from manufacturing sites are not included in the eras 63 in contrast to veterinary products the results of era for human medicinal products should not constitute a criterion for the refusal of marketing authorization 62 63 a recent communication of the european commission that refers to the european union strategic approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment emphasizes that the pharmaceutical industry needs to reduce its environmental impact from the product lifecycle perspective with the greatest focus on the research and development as well as the manufacturing stages 64 the development of pharmaceutical products that degrade more readily to harmless substances in wwtp and the environment and are produced by greener manufacturing methods are identified as the future priorities of the pharmaceutical industry 64 3 3 opportunities and limitations of treated pharmaceutical wastewater re use in drug manufacturing processes from the sustainability point of view water re use in manufacturing is essential because it could drastically reduce freshwater requirements and enable the expansion of production capacity without exceeding water discharge limits 15 the opportunities for reusing treated pharmaceutical wastewaters as a secondary resource in pharmaceutical manufacturing are quite limited due to the high risk of product contamination which may have serious impact on patient health and is contrary to the gmp requirements 50 to avoid cross contamination between products re use of treated wastewater for industrial purposes might be acceptable only after complete removal of api residues during the wastewater treatment process if the quality of reclaimed water is not inferior to drinking water it should be stressed that all changes in pharmaceutical manufacturing such as alternative sources of starting materials including water reuse should be validated and accepted by the relevant regulatory authorities as well as approved by industrial customers this is a time consuming and expensive process that can seriously impact the economic viability of any changes furthermore investments in wastewater treatment for re use should be weighed against the cost and local availability of freshwater resources among the eu member states latvia ranks 4th in the availability of freshwater resources with the average of about 18 000 m³ per inhabitant per year 65 in contrast to latvia the available water resources in poland the czech republic cyprus and malta are below 1700 m3 per inhabitant per year indicating that those countries may experience shortages of water for industrial uses since chemically and energetically intensive wastewater treatment processes are needed to improve the wastewater quality according to the specifications for re use in some cases water re use may cause higher environmental impact than the water use itself 66 the effluent from the biological wwtp of jsc grindeks is not suitable for internal re use purposes the applied mbbr system ensures pre treatment in accordance to the local regulations in terms of cod as well as n and p removal however this level of treatment is still insufficient for subsequent re use of the treated wastewater for example in cooling systems fig 3 summarises the main problematic issues that can arise from the re use of biologically treated pharmaceutical wastewaters in cooling systems first the use of biologically treated pharmaceutical wastewater streams increases the risk of scaling and corrosion due to the high levels of dissolved salts second the re use of effluents from biological wwtp promotes higher microbiological activity and biofouling due to the remaining dissolved nutrients additional fouling problems may be associated with residual suspended solids activated sludge biofilm growth and deposits on heat transfer surfaces tend to cause loss of heat transfer efficiency any of these problems or a combination of them can result in costly unscheduled downtime reduced process capacity and reliability besides that the chemical compatibility of effluent water with materials used in the cooling systems should be assessed direct contact of products with wastewater is not allowed in any situation therefore the pipelines should be permanently monitored and maintained to prevent any leakage into the reaction vessels and the associated product contamination risks fluctuations of effluent water quality and quantity cause additional challenges and should be taken into consideration furthermore pharmaceutical wastewater after biological treatment is often too warm for cooling purposes for example the temperature of effluent water from the biological wwtp of jsc grindeks varies between 28 and 42 c making it unsuitable for cooling purposes elevated temperature is one of the stress factors to nitrifying bacteria that may disrupt the nitrification process therefore a heat exchanger for wastewater cooling is installed at the wwtp of jsc grindeks 3 4 processing of pharmaceutical waste streams for resource recovery and re use for a typical batch chemical process in the pharmaceutical industry solvents can constitute up to 80 90 of the non aqueous mass 67 due to their high proportion in process mixtures spent solvents also represent a major part of the waste generated by the pharmaceutical industry the minimisation of solvent use substitution of hazardous solvents as well as solvent recovery and re use are becoming key priorities for the purposes of greener manufacturing 68 70 in practice about 50 of waste solvents are recovered and reused in the batch chemical processes at jsc grindeks while the remaining part is either disposed through incineration or biologically degraded as dilute aqueous solutions during wastewater treatment in the post denitrification process see more details in section 3 5 4 the main barriers to solvent recovery especially in the manufacturing of low volume apis include the technical difficulty and cost of recovery purity requirements equal to those for fresh solvents and the time consuming analytical and administrative procedures necessary to verify the quality and to approve solvent re use in the manufacturing although many pharmaceutical manufacturers have centralised solvent recovery facilities the distillation equipment at jsc grindeks is integrated at separate production sites such an approach allows better optimisation of the solvent recovery processes and eliminates the risks of cross contamination between pharmaceutical products by using shared equipment for solvent recovery transition metal catalysts play an important role in the pharmaceutical industry and are extensively used for the development of new drug candidates and large scale synthesis of apis 71 wastewater containing transition metals may not be discharged into biological wwtp as these metals tend to accumulate in the sludge causing toxic effects on microorganisms and having an effect on further processing of sludge 72 73 in accordance with latvian legislation elevated content of heavy metals in the sludge is a basic criterion for their classification as hazardous waste 74 due to the efforts to prevent heavy metal emissions in the pharmaceutical wastewater stream the sludge generated at the wwtp of jsc grindeks typically corresponds to class 1 or 2 class 5 is considered to be hazardous waste which allows use of the sludge for soil fertilisation and re cultivation of degraded areas spent catalysts and or contaminated wastewater streams from metal catalysed chemical synthesis steps could be utilised as a resource for the recovery of toxic heavy metals 75 due to the relatively small volumes of heavy metal containing wastewater and the need for specific processing jsc grindeks does not carry out on site recovery of heavy metals from wastewater streams spent pd and ni catalysts along with concentrated metal containing wastewaters from chemical synthesis are collected separately and sent to specialised organisations for processing while copper ions are precipitated and removed from the wastewater in the form of insoluble hydroxide prior to the discharge into the biological wwtp there are several other wastewater streams arising from pharmaceutical manufacturing processes that can be directly reused as resources and secondary raw materials such as alkaline streams effluents containing nutrients such as phosphates and metals practical examples focusing on the re use of these flows are detailed in section 3 5 the successful use of such wastes as valuable materials serves as an example of the circular economy approach providing a motivation for improved waste stream management at the chemical plant level and or enhanced cooperation both with other companies i e to develop industrial symbiosis and with universities 3 5 implementing circular economy elements into pharmaceutical wastewater treatment procedures the practical experience at the wwtp of jsc grindeks shows that there are several possible ways for reusing contaminated wastewater streams from batch chemical synthesis operations as raw materials in the biological wwtp to identify and manage the possible ways of wastewater re use each batch process should be analysed separately and effective communication between production sites and wastewater treatment plant should be facilitated to share information that is relevant for the wwtp obviously such commitment also requires technical possibilities for collecting the individual wastewater streams in separate containers for temporary storage which might be a limiting factor in some cases the examples of reusing untreated pharmaceutical wastewater batch streams as raw materials in the biological wwtp of jsc grindeks are given in fig 4 practical implementation is demonstrated for metal containing wastewater streams alkaline solutions and nutrient containing effluents the given examples indicate that certain pharmaceutical wastewater batch streams should be considered not as a waste but rather as a valuable resource to be handled according to the principles of circular economy the implementation of circular economy elements through pharmaceutical wastewater re use allows reduction of the chemical consumption and operational costs of wwtp 3 5 1 the use of al3 containing wastewater as coagulant in sludge removal processes aluminium chloride is used as a lewis acid in the synthesis of milnacipran hydrochloride api 76 an acidic aqueous al3 solution is generated as a synthesis by product aluminium acts as a toxic agent to aquatic organisms including fish invertebrates and plants 77 to avoid the disruption of the activated sludge process it is crucial to assess the toxicity risks of such waste streams to biological water treatment plants before large scale production and the biocenosis from the particular wwtp must be employed in the toxicity tests 78 in the performed toxicity tests al3 containing wastewater showed highly toxic effects on the activated sludge microorganisms at the wwtp of jsc grindeks 47 in a separate pilot study it was found that this type of wastewater is suitable for re use as a coagulant in the sludge removal process and excess phosphorus precipitation at full scale wwtp for the best process performance the optimum ph range and dosage should be adjusted depending on case specific effluent characteristics in many situations the ph drop upon the addition of aluminium salts needs to be counteracted by the addition of an alkaline solution ph control is important also to maintain minimum levels of dissolved residual aluminium in treated wastewater 79 at the current production capacity about 15 m3 of al3 containing wastewater is generated each year and 100 of this wastewater is reused in the sludge removal process at the on site wwtp of jsc grindeks the implementation of such circular economy elements as the introduction of al3 containing wastewater to the sludge removal process allows for replacement of the traditionally used commercial aqueous 40 fecl3 solution 3 5 2 the use of inorganic acids or bases for ph control in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs the ph values of pharmaceutical wastewater from different batch processes can vary greatly ranging from highly acidic to alkaline if high amounts of acids or bases are discharged into wastewaters considerable amounts of chemicals are required to return the ph value to a neutral level that is optimal for activated sludge microorganisms especially if the buffer capacity of wastewater is low the ph of the wastewater received at the wwtp of jsc grindeks is adjusted by adding 50 h2so4 or 30 naoh solutions according to necessity in general the wastewaters of jsc grindeks are highly alkaline ph 10 in the equalizing tank due to biodegradation processes the ph value in the first mbbrs drops down to a neutral level therefore the addition of h2so4 is usually not necessary higher volumes of naoh solution are consumed for ph control at the nitrification stage to avoid extreme ph fluctuations a large volume equalizing tank is required alternatively concentrated water solutions of inorganic acids or bases if available as by products from the manufacturing processes can be collected in separate containers and subsequently reused for ph control in the biological treatment reactors if alkaline aqueous solutions from manufacturing are intended for ph control during the nitrification process they must not contain biodegradable organic compounds that would directly promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria the oxygen affinity and growth rate of nitrifying bacteria is low in comparison to heterotrophic bacteria therefore an increase in heterotrophic bacteria may adversely affect the nitrifying bacteria by competing for space oxygen and other nutrients resulting in the inhibition of nitrification 80 a strongly alkaline naoh solution fig 4 can also be used as a precipitant to remove copper from wastewaters generated during other batch processes 3 5 3 the use of phosphorus containing wastewater as a nutrient source for activated sludge microorganisms a characteristic feature for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants is the situation that influent wastewater can be deficient in some nutrients and rich in others in general the industrial wastewaters of jsc grindeks are rich in carbon and nitrogen while deficient in phosphorus the median cod and nitrogen concentration of the influent water are 5500 mg l and 160 mg l respectively yet the median phosphorus concentration in the inlet water is only 3 mg l to ensure optimal phosphorus levels at the biological treatment stages at the wwtp of jsc grindeks h3po4 is added as a phosphorus source in the first mbbr and the level of inorganic phosphates is monitored in the first and last mbbrs because low phosphorus availability strongly affects the biodegradation efficiency and favours the growth of filamentous bacteria 81 the only production process giving high amounts of phosphates c 10 g l po4 p in the wastewaters of jsc grindeks is the batch synthesis of ipidacrine api which performed in campaigns lasting only several weeks every year in order to avoid extreme peak loadings and overdose of phosphorus at these times about 10 m3 of wastewater from this batch process is collected separately and reused as a phosphorus source during the periods when its concentration is low in the influent wastewater the substitution of h3po4 with phosphorus rich wastewater allows reduction of the consumption of phosphorus as a critical nutrient and lowers the operational costs of wwtp leading to improved plant efficiency 3 5 4 the use of recovered solvents as easily degradable carbon source for the denitrification processes spent solvents that after several recovery cycles are no longer suitable for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products represent a large proportion of the liquid waste generated by the pharmaceutical industry see more details in section 3 4 in most cases elevated water content is the reason why spent solvents are no longer suitable for re use in chemical synthesis solvents in general are toxic and inhibit the enzymatic activity of activated sludge microorganisms 82 however controlled addition of some solvents to wastewater streams may be beneficial for the activated sludge microorganisms at the biological wwtp of jsc grindeks about 9 5 tons of water miscible spent solvents per year are utilised as external carbon sources in the post denitrification process due to its relatively low toxicity highly biodegradable nature and chemical compatibility with the dosing line materials ethanol has been selected as the most suitable spent solvent for this purpose the addition of a carbon source is based on an experimentally determined optimal c n ratio of 4 1 where c is cod and n refers to both no3 n and no2 n the spent ethanol is diluted with water to a concentration of about 50 in order to reduce its flammability and to mitigate explosion risks at the wwtp although the current re use rate of spent solvents in the denitrification process represents only about 3 5 of the total amount of spent solvents generated at jsc grindeks there are opportunities to also utilise these solvents at municipal wwtps as the denitrification efficiency at municipal wwtps is often limited by insufficient carbon content in the untreated wastewater 83 spent solvents can be potentially introduced as external carbon sources at municipal wwtps considering that spent solvents are recovered separately from each batch process at jsc grindeks it is possible to accurately determine the presence of pharmaceutical residues in such solvents additionally it allows to choose solvents from the production of those apis that show comparatively better biodegradability at wwtps and does not represent therapeutic classes that have significant adverse effects on the ecosystem 84 the implementation of such practices allows reduction of operating costs of the wwtps an increase in nitrogen removal efficiency and general improvement of pharmaceutical waste management 4 conclusions comprehensive analysis of various water flows and their quality requirements allows identification of opportunities and limitations for water reuse at the manufacturing plant level concerns about product contamination the strict chemical and microbiological purity requirements and current gmp regulations restrict the use of reclaimed water in direct contact with pharmaceutical products water steam condensate and reject water re use from ro systems and a transition to water efficient closed loop cooling systems were recognized as necessary actions to reduce water consumption in a particular pharmaceutical factory due to extreme variability of pharmaceutical wastewater in a multiproduct factory treatability studies and toxicity screening should be conducted for individual batch streams to distinguish highly toxic and concentrated streams and provide pre treatment if necessary our case study highlights a synergy between manufacturing facilities and on site wwtp that provides a logical path for implementing the elements of circular economy in the pharmaceutical factory as a result specific wastewater streams from pharmaceutical batch processes can be reused as sources of nutrients coagulants or a ph control agent in a biological wwtp providing both environmental and economic benefits funding this work was funded by the polish national agency for academic exchange as the part of the project international

production provide the greatest gross value sectors of the eu economy but exhibit the highest dependency on a stable supply of water in sufficient quantity and quality 1 the oecd environmental outlook to 2050 predicts that the global water demand for manufacturing will increase by 400 between 2000 and 2050 2 to ensure the sustainability of water resources the industry should improve water efficiency in a value chain as well as maximise the opportunities for safe re use of different grades of water moreover water related industries need to focus not only on climate change and water

re use in landscape irrigation while avoiding the hazards of introducing pharmaceutical residues into the environment 9 achieved the removal of organic halogens from process wastewaters 8 performed catalytic oxidation processes for detoxification and improving the biodegradability of pharmaceutical wastewater streams 10 developed nanofiltration 11 and used ionising radiation as the source of both reducing and oxidizing radicals for water treatment 12 14 innovative advanced treatment technologies are currently being developed for highly polluted water the reviews of biological chemical advanced chemical technologies or advanced oxidation processes and hybrid technologies for the treatment of industrial wastewaters were presented 15 20 although many new technologies have been proposed the main concept is to use hybrid approaches that combine various treatment mechanisms to remove the full spectrum of chemicals present in pharmaceutical wastewaters the rapid development of the pharmaceutical industry presents conflicting challenges to water resources management the discharge of inadequately treated wastewaters results in the release of pharmaceutical substances into the environment resulting in risks to water quality and a possible adverse impact on aquatic ecosystems and public health 21 in recent years there has been an increasing focus on water use in those several highly water dependent industries besides the production of pharmaceuticals the chemical industry 22 23 motor vehicle production 24 paper production 25 26 the steel industry 27 28 the textile industry 29 30 as well as the food and beverage industry 31 33 the pharmaceutical industry has a special place in this list of highly water dependent industries many pharmaceutical processes require very pure water that meets strict quality standards simultaneously they can generate heavily polluted and toxic wastewaters that require complex and costly multi step treatment to meet the regulatory requirements 21 pharmaceutical plants typically use a broad range of chemicals and technological processes presenting major challenges for waste cleanup technologies and procedures mineralization represents the most effective treatment which is the ultimate goal in many areas of pollutant control and destruction high purity water is an indispensable resource for the production of medicines for human and veterinary use but at the same time the pharmaceutical industry is one of the main polluters of local water resources 21 another source of high risk regarding pharmaceuticals is very polluted waste water at hospitals and homes for the elderly this waste water contains pharmaceuticals together with greatly variable and hazardous microbiological pollutants where the concentration of pharmaceutical residues could be several times higher than in municipal wastewater 34 37 futhermore without any treatment veterinary pharmaceutical residues from aquaculture and livestock farms can enter into the water as an active parent product or biologically active metabolites 38 the current trends of sustainable development goals sdg include efforts of water re use which is recognized as a key option to reduce water consumption at the manufacturing facility level 39 however the re use of water in pharmaceutical production is met with caution from the regulatory agencies concerned with the quality and safety of pharmaceuticals prompting new strategies that may reconcile the conflicting goals of wastewater re use and ensuring that contaminants cannot enter pharmaceutical production via reused water innovative zld technologies make it possible to almost completely eliminate wastewater discharges maximizing water re use in the industry 40 43 despite the high potential for water saving the application of zld on an industrial scale is currently very limited due to the high costs energy consumption 40 and the generation of solid hazardous waste 40 41 although the data from certain industries point to opportunities for decreasing water consumption by up to 50 44 implementation of circular water management in the pharmaceutical industry is quite limited due to very strict legislative regulations and safety considerations the main barriers for water re use in the pharmaceutical industry are the unique requirements of water quality and the risks associated with product contamination and human health 15 with the rapid development of a circular economic strategy within the eu member states in recent years many incentives have been implemented providing support for research and innovation through different grant programmes while promoting new legal and economic regulations therefore pharmaceutical manufacturers are currently interested in practical options for closing the water loop in those technological processes where water does not come into direct contact with pharmaceutical products moreover manufacturers are seeking to minimise the use of water energy and hazardous materials to eliminate waste during the product life cycle and to use treated wastewater for other purposes in several countries switzerland the usa singapore australia where wastewater after treatment is reused for agricultural irrigation or discharged into aquifers that also serve as sources of drinking water certain pharmaceuticals are included in the water monitoring programs 45 while these biologically active substances are not systematically regulated at a global level despite evidence of the presence of pharmaceutical residues in various aquatic environments of latvia 46 the state has not yet implemented a long term strategy to reduce the risk caused by this pollution the purpose of this article is to point out water related challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry the overall water flow at the pharmaceutical plant of jsc grindeks is shown the most water intensive technological processes are identified and reusable water streams are specified the second objective is to show and assess the environmental benefit of the best practically implemented pharmaceutical wastewater re use examples on the basis of the experience gained at jsc grindeks a medium sized multiproduct pharmaceutical company 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant description the pharmaceutical company jsc grindeks located in riga latvia was selected for a case study in our article the multi product manufacturing facility of jsc grindeks produces both active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and final dosage forms fdfs belonging to the cardiovascular central nervous system gastroenterological and anti cancer therapeutic groups the wastewaters originating from the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities of jsc grindeks are polluted with a wide range of difficult to degrade and toxic organic compounds including phenols while also containing high concentrations of organic nitrogen compounds and inorganic salts in combination with the near absence of phosphorus compounds the wastewaters are treated in a system of compact moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs the technological process and main operational parameters of the wwtp are detailed in a previous study by strade et al 47 according to the data from year 2019 the average wastewater flow is 200 m3 d while the incoming cod load fluctuates from 0 4 to 2 2 t per day and the total nitrogen load varies from 0 012 to 0 075 t per day after pre treatment the wastewaters are discharged into the municipal sewer system for final treatment 2 2 data acquisition a comprehensive analysis of the incoming and outgoing water flows within the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities of jsc grindeks was carried out including pharmaceutical grade water cooling water water for the steam generation and wastewater the analysis included plant specific data about i water supply sources ii quality requirements of water used for industrial purposes iii water preparation pre treatment processes used at the manufacturing facilities iv water consumption v wastewater production generation composition flows and treatments vi water and wastewater reuse practices the numerical values of water consumption and wastewater reuse were analysed using the monitoring data from year 2019 the relevant data were obtained from internal technical documentation and standard operating procedures from the information provided to local regulatory agencies as well as through interviews with employees the chemical and microbiological purity standards of the pharmaceutical grade water and the defined uses during the various manufacturing stages of the apis and fdfs were summarized and analysed according to good manufacturing practice gmp guidelines pharmacopoeia monographs and the guidelines from european medicines agency ema and the world health organisation who 2 3 data evaluation on the basis of the complete water flow analysis the overall water flow chart for the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities of jsc grindeks was summarized and analysed for the first time the information obtained was used to identify the bottlenecks in the current water management system and to point out the opportunities to improve water usage efficiency to implement reuse solutions and to close the water loop restrictions and limitations related to direct water reuse in the pharmaceutical production were emphasized based on the sector specific regulatory requirements and product quality and safety risks the percentage of water savings from water efficiency improvements and reuse actions was estimated using scientific and technical literature sources in order to demonstrate the dependence of pharmaceutical industry on water resources the first part of the article provides an overview of the diverse applications of water in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes the sector specific water quality requirements are analysed in this part to underline the difference of pharmaceutical industry from other process industries considering that the pharmaceutical sector also is one of the major polluters of water resources the following section of this article points out the shortcomings of the current legislation regarding the control of environmental emissions from the pharmaceutical industry various possibilities for applying the principles of circular economy through the recovery of resources and the reuse of wastewater streams are discussed at the end of this article the application of the principles of circular economy in the management of chemically polluted wastewater was analysed from three aspects i the reuse of untreated wastewater streams as secondary resources in the biological wastewater treatment processes ii the recovery of materials from concentrated wastewater streams ii the possibilities and limitations of wastewater reuse after the application of different treatment strategies 3 results and discussion 3 1 different grades of water in the pharmaceutical industry according to the world health organisation the most widely used raw material in pharmaceutical manufacturing is water 48 consistent and high quality water supply is required for the production of pharmaceutical products rinsing and cleaning of equipment as well as for technical purposes like steam generation and cooling 15 the various types of water use in pharmaceutical manufacturing requires efficient management of both incoming and outgoing water flows the water flows at jsc grindeks are depicted in fig 1 this scheme characterises the water sources and the applied water pre treatment methods in various technological processes and also outlines the wastewater management practices at the company a reference to this flow chart is given in the following sections of this article to describe the specific stages of water management at jsc grindeks 3 1 1 pharmaceutical grade water in pharmaceutical manufacturing different grades of water are used as raw material ingredient and solvent in the production processing and formulation of active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and final dosage forms fdfs for human or veterinary use fig 2 the grades of water used highly depend on the formulation and the route of administration of the pharmaceutical product and as well as on the stage in the manufacturing process at which water is used 49 fig 2 summarises the minimum acceptable grade of water used during the manufacture of apis and fdfs potable water may be used in chemical synthesis of all intermediates of api prior to the final isolation and purification steps potable water is also used for the initial rinse of the manufacturing equipment containers and closures in the manufacturing of apis and non sterile fdfs unless there are specific technical or quality requirements for higher grades of water 49 potable water is not covered by a pharmacopoeia monograph but should at a minimum meet the world health organisation who guidelines for drinking water quality 50 potable water is used as feed water for the production of pharmaceutical grade waters purified water and water for injections purified water pw pw is used as an excipient for the final isolation and purification of apis and for the preparation of nonsterile fdfs additionally pw is used in the granulation and tablet coating processes preparation of ointments creams and gels as well as for the formulation of syrups the water content in each fdf is specified in the registration dossier pw is the accepted grade of water for the final rinse of equipment containers and closures in the manufacture of non parenteral fdfs pw is typically prepared by ion exchange ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis ro or distillation jsc grindeks uses a six step purification system for obtaining pw for pharmaceutical production fig 1 the purification system provides mechanical filtration iron removal softening filtration through activated carbon a two stage ro process and degassing the pw storage and distribution system consists of a water storage tank a circulation pump a uv irradiation cell and a pw circulation loop pipeline with water outlet valves at the production sites the average annual pw consumption of jsc grindeks is about 6500 7000 m3 water for injections wfi wfi is the highest quality water used by the pharmaceutical industry wfi is used in the manufacturing of sterile pharmaceutical products for parenteral administration and other pharmaceutical products where endotoxin content must be controlled wfi is also used for the final rinsing of primary packaging materials wfi must be sterile and non pyrogenic in order to avoid the introduction of contamination and to prevent the growth of microorganisms in pharmaceutical products until 2017 the european union good manufacturing practice gmp regulations disallowed the production of wfi by non distillation methods because of concerns about biofilm formation and endotoxin contamination after recent changes in the european pharmacopoeia it is now also allowed to produce wfi by reverse osmosis coupled to other suitable techniques such as electro deionisation ultrafiltration or nano filtration jsc grindeks uses very small quantities of wfi 1 m3 year which are purchased from external suppliers this type of water is used in the final production stage for the oxytocin api due to the tight specification for microbiological purity and the absence of endotoxins water for the preparation of extracts water for the preparation of herbal drug extracts must comply with the requirements for pw or water intended for human consumption of a quality equivalent to that defined in directive 98 83 ec 49 the chemical and microbiological purity requirements for pharmaceutical grade water are defined in the relevant pharmacopoeias table 1 represents the current quality specifications for pw and wfi defined by the european pharmacopoeia ph eur and the united states pharmacopoeia usp unlike usp ph eur specifies a limit for heavy metals in pw and a limit for nitrate concentration in pw and wfi both pharmacopoeias also have different requirements for the electrical conductivity of pharmaceutical grade water the control of bacterial endotoxins lipopolysaccharide cell wall components of gram negative bacteria in water used in the manufacture of fdfs intended for parenteral administration is critical as reaction to endotoxins can lead to potentially lethal anaphylactic shock in patients 51 a less commonly discussed aspect is the continued quality assurance of the various water grades pharmaceutical water production storage and distribution systems should be designed installed commissioned qualified and maintained to ensure reliable production of water at the specified quality 48 failure to meet water quality requirements poses an unacceptable risk to public health therefore continuous quality control of water used in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products is of vital importance the frequency of quality control and the water sampling points are usually specified by the water monitoring programs failures in the purification process pose critical levels of risk and the lack of proper quality water can result in manufacturing downtime or product recall despite the use of validated purification systems and stringent operational controls microbial contamination is the most challenging issue in the purification process of pharmaceutical grade water recent recall surveys from the usa have found that the presence of water borne bacteria burkholderia cepacia represent the vast majority of microbiological contamination cases that have triggered food and drug administration fda recalls of non sterile drug products 52 various design features like continual circulation at a flowrate of 1 3 m s heating options and the inclusion of high intensity ultraviolet uv light lamps may be incorporated to prevent the growth of biofilms and to control microbial contamination in pharmaceutical grade water systems 51 the experience at jsc grindeks shows that proper sanitation and regular maintenance procedures are essential to preventing microbial proliferation and recontamination of the water for example a validated sanitization procedure of the pw distribution and storage system in the api manufacturing facility is performed with 3 or 10 hydrogen peroxide solution 1 at least once a year 2 if the pw system has been shut down for more than 14 days 3 in cases in which the parameters of microbiological contamination do not meet the requirements of the relevant pharmacopoeia thermal sanitization 85 c 30 min of the pw system in the fdf manufacturing facility is used for routine operations twice per year and if the toc or total number of aerobic bacteria of the pw circulating in the loop exceed the maximum level or if the loop has been emptied if reconstruction work in the loop has been performed or the system has been exposed to air special attention is paid to the plastic tubing at pw outlet points to avoid the introduction of microbiological contamination into the pw circulation loop they are disconnected rinsed with 70 ethanol and dried after each use as well as replaced at least every 6 months from a water efficiency standpoint the preparation of pharmaceutical grade water is associated with relatively high losses of water the experience of jsc grindeks confirms that due to the very high purity requirements of pw up to 50 of the feed water is discharged as waste from the ro modules fig 1 however this water is still of sufficiently high quality for re use as an alternative onsite water source in units that do not come into a direct contact with pharmaceutical products for example in cooling systems this inefficiency has been identified as one of the bottlenecks in the water management system of jsc grindeks where the circular economy approach could be applied to partially close the water loop and to reduce the water consumption by about 7000 m3 annually equal to 12 of the total amount of potable water used in production processes at jsc grindeks 3 1 2 process water in addition to direct use in pharmaceutical production where water comes into contact with pharmaceutical substances it is also used as a key resource for technical purposes for example cooling and steam generation 3 1 2 1 cooling water to provide reliable pharmaceutical manufacturing process conditions the correct process temperature must be guaranteed at all times which may require a cooling capacity the main pharmaceutical manufacturing processes that require an effective cooling system are batch processing in multipurpose reactors for example temperature sensitive chemical reactions crystallization of final products cooling of creams and ointments before pouring and packaging wet granulation processes for tablet production moulding of gelatine capsules sterilisation of liquid fdfs due to its high heat capacity and low cost water is the most common coolant cooling water should be pre treated to ensure efficient heat transfer reduce total energy consumption and avoid equipment failure pre treatment depends on feed water quality and usually includes iron removal softening the addition of corrosion and scale inhibitors and treatment with biocides to prevent biological fouling in the heat exchange systems 53 it is also important to control the ph value of cooling water as acidic environment promotes corrosion while alkaline ph increases scale formation 54 the traditionally used cooling towers or once through single pass cooling systems often represent the largest percentage of water consumption in pharmaceutical manufacturing 55 and jsc grindeks is not an exception the once through cooling system used at jsc grindeks consumes up to 250 000 m3 of water annually which exceeds the total amount of potable water used for pharmaceutical manufacturing processes by a factor of about 4 2 after a single pass through heat exchangers and or condensers the heated water is discharged into the storm water drainage system the reduction of high water consumption by once through cooling systems requires a change towards closed loop recirculating cooling systems that consume an order of magnitude lower volume of cooling water compared to once through systems 53 it has been noted by other authors that the installation of adiabatic cooling systems allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce water consumption by up to 98 compared to the traditionally used open loop cooling systems 53 56 besides reusing the same clean water into closed circuit also eliminates the costs associated with the treatment and disposal of water and also eliminates the concerns associated with legionnaires disease 56 jsc grindeks obtains its cooling water from 2 artesian boreholes located on the territory of the plant the natural and regulatory limits to water extraction from an artesian aquifer prevent further expansion of production unless more water efficient cooling technologies are introduced otherwise the available groundwater resources may be insufficient for the required cooling capacity and extensive use of this resource will incur regulatory and taxation costs 3 1 2 2 water for steam generation steam used in pharmaceutical facilities can be separated into three categories plant steam chemical free steam and pure steam table 2 depending on the intended use of the steam there are different requirements of feed water quality and steam generation methods feed water of the plant steam boiler must be derived from water that is of drinking quality it is treated to remove the bulk of dissolved solids hardness and silica which could cause scaling and corrosion of the steam generator and pipelines the manufacturing facilities of jsc grindeks consume about 17 18 000 m3 of potable water per year for plant steam production boiler feed water is purified by passing through mechanical filters cation exchange softening resins and an ro system that greatly reduces the content of scale forming salts improves boiler efficiency and steam purity chemical free steam is typically a separate type of steam generated without chemical boiler additives 57 it is used for humidity control of processes and critical cleanrooms where pharmaceutical products are directly exposed to the room atmosphere jsc grindeks also uses humidification to eliminate the build up of static electricity in manufacturing environments where flammable gases or substances are being used several local steam boilers are installed in the manufacturing facilities for such purposes pure steam is the highest quality of steam used in pharmaceutical manufacturing it is used for the sterilisation of pharmaceutical products equipment or piping this type of steam is critical to biopharmaceutical production and for the production of injectable solutions unlike plant steam no chemical additives are permitted in the treatment of water used in pure steam generators as pure steam comes into direct contact with pharmaceutical products or product contact surfaces additional treatment of feed water should be performed to ensure that the condensate of pure steam meets wfi requirements for conductivity toc microbial content and endotoxins 58 as jsc grindeks does not produce sterile pharmaceutical products pure steam is not used in the manufacturing processes the recovery and on site re use of steam condensate is one of the key actions that can improve the water efficiency at manufacturing facilities the re use of high purity condensate also reduces chemical use feed water treatment costs and saves energy since after returning to the boiler the hot condensate requires much less energy to reheat for repeated steam production despite the potential water savings steam condensate is not recovered and reused as boiler feed water at jsc grindeks the major obstacle here is that the boiler house is located about 500 m from the manufacturing facilities the relatively long distance and the initial investment that would be necessary to build a condensate return line have prevented the re use of plant steam condensate from a water efficiency point of view in instances in which the installation costs of condensate recovery equipment are too high to be justified factories should evaluate alternative options for re use of condensate due to its inherent heat content condensate can be reused in various heating systems or as a source of clean hot water for washing purposes there are not only financial and technical but also product quality and safety issues that need to be considered when analysing condensate re use options in a pharmaceutical plant as pure steam comes into contact with pharmaceutical products the condensate must not be directly returned to a pure steam generator because of contamination risk 58 potential microbiological contamination of condensate from hvac systems also is one of the risk factors that could limit condensate re use scientific publications report that hvac condensate can be contaminated with legionella and other airborne bacteria therefore the harvested condensate water must be properly disinfected before re use as an alternative water resource 59 our case study confirms the conclusions of the united nations 60 that the industry often prioritizes production capacity over water efficiency and conservation a common reason for this is that investments in efficient cooling processes or water reuse systems may have longer return on investment than short term improvements in production capacity moreover low water prices in the regions with good freshwater availability also do not encourage investment in water efficiency at the plant level and the potential benefits of water efficiency improvements in industry are often underestimated in order to properly evaluate and provide justifications for modifications to equipment or operating practices the new and true value of water should be assessed accounting not only for the water supply costs but also for the related treatment pumping storage purification and disposal costs 6 3 1 3 water recovered from drug manufacturing processes pharmaceutical products are typically produced in multi stage batch processes that create highly complex waste streams with variable chemical composition toxicity and volume 15 such variation in the quality and quantity of wastewater may cause shock and overload to the treatment systems which leads to malfunctioning or even failure of treatment processes particularly biological treatment 61 in order to ensure effective treatment of pharmaceutical effluents manufacturing plants must separately manage different types of wastewater distinguish highly toxic and concentrated streams and providing pre treatment if necessary wastewater biodegradability and toxicity as well as the concentration of specific pollutants in the individual batch streams must be taken into account for selecting the most appropriate treatment methods the evaluation and separation of pharmaceutical batch streams according to the nature of the contamination is a key activity not only for finding the most appropriate treatment solution but also for assessing the recovery or re use potential of materials in the effluents a cost effective and simple method for toxicity screening of pharmaceutical wastewater has been implemented in laboratory practice at the wwtp of jsc grindeks which is based on bod measurements over a wide range of initial concentrations 47 by using a simple bod cod relationship for different batch loads it is possible to identify the most toxic flows and to determine safe rates of discharge into biological wastewater treatment systems the extensive initial concentration range used in the experiments which corresponds to the real amount of wastewater generated per day while also accounting for the dilution in equalization tank allows determination of the toxic threshold concentration of the sample these data are used as a basis for assessing the risks and predicting the process performance in the case of production increases or changes in the presence of specific pollutants in wastewater primary attention should be paid to the most toxic compounds that enter the wastewater as synthesis by products or unreacted raw materials if the screening indicates that wastewaters are toxic to activated sludge already at low concentration levels separate collection at the source and further research should be performed pre treatment options are then evaluated or waste disposal by specialised service providers may be required 3 2 the role of legislation in controlling the emissions of apis from manufacturing plants a very important issue at a global level is the role of the pharmaceutical industry in reducing the discharge of pharmaceutical substances into the aquatic environment despite the recent concerns regarding the risks to human health and ecosystems posed by pharmaceuticals current eu legislation does not regulate the emissions of apis at the manufacturing stage the industrial emissions directive 2010 75 eu which also applies to pharmaceutical manufacturing sites does not include apis on the list of polluting substances and there are no threshold values established for pharmaceutical discharge apis that are already registered with the european medicines agency ema as ingredients of medicinal products for human and veterinary use are also exempt from the reach regulations gmp guidelines essentially focus on pharmaceutical product quality and safety parameters and do not include any requirements for environmental protection there are a number of shortcomings in the existing ema guidance for environmental risk assessment first there are insufficient or no environmental risk assessment era data available for numerous widely consumed pharmaceutical products that entered the market before the respective guidelines came into force in the eu era is a mandatory requirement for all new marketing authorization applications for medicinal products intended for human and veterinary use only since 2006 and 2001 respectively 62 second the risks associated with api discharges from manufacturing sites are not included in the eras 63 in contrast to veterinary products the results of era for human medicinal products should not constitute a criterion for the refusal of marketing authorization 62 63 a recent communication of the european commission that refers to the european union strategic approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment emphasizes that the pharmaceutical industry needs to reduce its environmental impact from the product lifecycle perspective with the greatest focus on the research and development as well as the manufacturing stages 64 the development of pharmaceutical products that degrade more readily to harmless substances in wwtp and the environment and are produced by greener manufacturing methods are identified as the future priorities of the pharmaceutical industry 64 3 3 opportunities and limitations of treated pharmaceutical wastewater re use in drug manufacturing processes from the sustainability point of view water re use in manufacturing is essential because it could drastically reduce freshwater requirements and enable the expansion of production capacity without exceeding water discharge limits 15 the opportunities for reusing treated pharmaceutical wastewaters as a secondary resource in pharmaceutical manufacturing are quite limited due to the high risk of product contamination which may have serious impact on patient health and is contrary to the gmp requirements 50 to avoid cross contamination between products re use of treated wastewater for industrial purposes might be acceptable only after complete removal of api residues during the wastewater treatment process if the quality of reclaimed water is not inferior to drinking water it should be stressed that all changes in pharmaceutical manufacturing such as alternative sources of starting materials including water reuse should be validated and accepted by the relevant regulatory authorities as well as approved by industrial customers this is a time consuming and expensive process that can seriously impact the economic viability of any changes furthermore investments in wastewater treatment for re use should be weighed against the cost and local availability of freshwater resources among the eu member states latvia ranks 4th in the availability of freshwater resources with the average of about 18 000 m³ per inhabitant per year 65 in contrast to latvia the available water resources in poland the czech republic cyprus and malta are below 1700 m3 per inhabitant per year indicating that those countries may experience shortages of water for industrial uses since chemically and energetically intensive wastewater treatment processes are needed to improve the wastewater quality according to the specifications for re use in some cases water re use may cause higher environmental impact than the water use itself 66 the effluent from the biological wwtp of jsc grindeks is not suitable for internal re use purposes the applied mbbr system ensures pre treatment in accordance to the local regulations in terms of cod as well as n and p removal however this level of treatment is still insufficient for subsequent re use of the treated wastewater for example in cooling systems fig 3 summarises the main problematic issues that can arise from the re use of biologically treated pharmaceutical wastewaters in cooling systems first the use of biologically treated pharmaceutical wastewater streams increases the risk of scaling and corrosion due to the high levels of dissolved salts second the re use of effluents from biological wwtp promotes higher microbiological activity and biofouling due to the remaining dissolved nutrients additional fouling problems may be associated with residual suspended solids activated sludge biofilm growth and deposits on heat transfer surfaces tend to cause loss of heat transfer efficiency any of these problems or a combination of them can result in costly unscheduled downtime reduced process capacity and reliability besides that the chemical compatibility of effluent water with materials used in the cooling systems should be assessed direct contact of products with wastewater is not allowed in any situation therefore the pipelines should be permanently monitored and maintained to prevent any leakage into the reaction vessels and the associated product contamination risks fluctuations of effluent water quality and quantity cause additional challenges and should be taken into consideration furthermore pharmaceutical wastewater after biological treatment is often too warm for cooling purposes for example the temperature of effluent water from the biological wwtp of jsc grindeks varies between 28 and 42 c making it unsuitable for cooling purposes elevated temperature is one of the stress factors to nitrifying bacteria that may disrupt the nitrification process therefore a heat exchanger for wastewater cooling is installed at the wwtp of jsc grindeks 3 4 processing of pharmaceutical waste streams for resource recovery and re use for a typical batch chemical process in the pharmaceutical industry solvents can constitute up to 80 90 of the non aqueous mass 67 due to their high proportion in process mixtures spent solvents also represent a major part of the waste generated by the pharmaceutical industry the minimisation of solvent use substitution of hazardous solvents as well as solvent recovery and re use are becoming key priorities for the purposes of greener manufacturing 68 70 in practice about 50 of waste solvents are recovered and reused in the batch chemical processes at jsc grindeks while the remaining part is either disposed through incineration or biologically degraded as dilute aqueous solutions during wastewater treatment in the post denitrification process see more details in section 3 5 4 the main barriers to solvent recovery especially in the manufacturing of low volume apis include the technical difficulty and cost of recovery purity requirements equal to those for fresh solvents and the time consuming analytical and administrative procedures necessary to verify the quality and to approve solvent re use in the manufacturing although many pharmaceutical manufacturers have centralised solvent recovery facilities the distillation equipment at jsc grindeks is integrated at separate production sites such an approach allows better optimisation of the solvent recovery processes and eliminates the risks of cross contamination between pharmaceutical products by using shared equipment for solvent recovery transition metal catalysts play an important role in the pharmaceutical industry and are extensively used for the development of new drug candidates and large scale synthesis of apis 71 wastewater containing transition metals may not be discharged into biological wwtp as these metals tend to accumulate in the sludge causing toxic effects on microorganisms and having an effect on further processing of sludge 72 73 in accordance with latvian legislation elevated content of heavy metals in the sludge is a basic criterion for their classification as hazardous waste 74 due to the efforts to prevent heavy metal emissions in the pharmaceutical wastewater stream the sludge generated at the wwtp of jsc grindeks typically corresponds to class 1 or 2 class 5 is considered to be hazardous waste which allows use of the sludge for soil fertilisation and re cultivation of degraded areas spent catalysts and or contaminated wastewater streams from metal catalysed chemical synthesis steps could be utilised as a resource for the recovery of toxic heavy metals 75 due to the relatively small volumes of heavy metal containing wastewater and the need for specific processing jsc grindeks does not carry out on site recovery of heavy metals from wastewater streams spent pd and ni catalysts along with concentrated metal containing wastewaters from chemical synthesis are collected separately and sent to specialised organisations for processing while copper ions are precipitated and removed from the wastewater in the form of insoluble hydroxide prior to the discharge into the biological wwtp there are several other wastewater streams arising from pharmaceutical manufacturing processes that can be directly reused as resources and secondary raw materials such as alkaline streams effluents containing nutrients such as phosphates and metals practical examples focusing on the re use of these flows are detailed in section 3 5 the successful use of such wastes as valuable materials serves as an example of the circular economy approach providing a motivation for improved waste stream management at the chemical plant level and or enhanced cooperation both with other companies i e to develop industrial symbiosis and with universities 3 5 implementing circular economy elements into pharmaceutical wastewater treatment procedures the practical experience at the wwtp of jsc grindeks shows that there are several possible ways for reusing contaminated wastewater streams from batch chemical synthesis operations as raw materials in the biological wwtp to identify and manage the possible ways of wastewater re use each batch process should be analysed separately and effective communication between production sites and wastewater treatment plant should be facilitated to share information that is relevant for the wwtp obviously such commitment also requires technical possibilities for collecting the individual wastewater streams in separate containers for temporary storage which might be a limiting factor in some cases the examples of reusing untreated pharmaceutical wastewater batch streams as raw materials in the biological wwtp of jsc grindeks are given in fig 4 practical implementation is demonstrated for metal containing wastewater streams alkaline solutions and nutrient containing effluents the given examples indicate that certain pharmaceutical wastewater batch streams should be considered not as a waste but rather as a valuable resource to be handled according to the principles of circular economy the implementation of circular economy elements through pharmaceutical wastewater re use allows reduction of the chemical consumption and operational costs of wwtp 3 5 1 the use of al3 containing wastewater as coagulant in sludge removal processes aluminium chloride is used as a lewis acid in the synthesis of milnacipran hydrochloride api 76 an acidic aqueous al3 solution is generated as a synthesis by product aluminium acts as a toxic agent to aquatic organisms including fish invertebrates and plants 77 to avoid the disruption of the activated sludge process it is crucial to assess the toxicity risks of such waste streams to biological water treatment plants before large scale production and the biocenosis from the particular wwtp must be employed in the toxicity tests 78 in the performed toxicity tests al3 containing wastewater showed highly toxic effects on the activated sludge microorganisms at the wwtp of jsc grindeks 47 in a separate pilot study it was found that this type of wastewater is suitable for re use as a coagulant in the sludge removal process and excess phosphorus precipitation at full scale wwtp for the best process performance the optimum ph range and dosage should be adjusted depending on case specific effluent characteristics in many situations the ph drop upon the addition of aluminium salts needs to be counteracted by the addition of an alkaline solution ph control is important also to maintain minimum levels of dissolved residual aluminium in treated wastewater 79 at the current production capacity about 15 m3 of al3 containing wastewater is generated each year and 100 of this wastewater is reused in the sludge removal process at the on site wwtp of jsc grindeks the implementation of such circular economy elements as the introduction of al3 containing wastewater to the sludge removal process allows for replacement of the traditionally used commercial aqueous 40 fecl3 solution 3 5 2 the use of inorganic acids or bases for ph control in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs the ph values of pharmaceutical wastewater from different batch processes can vary greatly ranging from highly acidic to alkaline if high amounts of acids or bases are discharged into wastewaters considerable amounts of chemicals are required to return the ph value to a neutral level that is optimal for activated sludge microorganisms especially if the buffer capacity of wastewater is low the ph of the wastewater received at the wwtp of jsc grindeks is adjusted by adding 50 h2so4 or 30 naoh solutions according to necessity in general the wastewaters of jsc grindeks are highly alkaline ph 10 in the equalizing tank due to biodegradation processes the ph value in the first mbbrs drops down to a neutral level therefore the addition of h2so4 is usually not necessary higher volumes of naoh solution are consumed for ph control at the nitrification stage to avoid extreme ph fluctuations a large volume equalizing tank is required alternatively concentrated water solutions of inorganic acids or bases if available as by products from the manufacturing processes can be collected in separate containers and subsequently reused for ph control in the biological treatment reactors if alkaline aqueous solutions from manufacturing are intended for ph control during the nitrification process they must not contain biodegradable organic compounds that would directly promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria the oxygen affinity and growth rate of nitrifying bacteria is low in comparison to heterotrophic bacteria therefore an increase in heterotrophic bacteria may adversely affect the nitrifying bacteria by competing for space oxygen and other nutrients resulting in the inhibition of nitrification 80 a strongly alkaline naoh solution fig 4 can also be used as a precipitant to remove copper from wastewaters generated during other batch processes 3 5 3 the use of phosphorus containing wastewater as a nutrient source for activated sludge microorganisms a characteristic feature for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants is the situation that influent wastewater can be deficient in some nutrients and rich in others in general the industrial wastewaters of jsc grindeks are rich in carbon and nitrogen while deficient in phosphorus the median cod and nitrogen concentration of the influent water are 5500 mg l and 160 mg l respectively yet the median phosphorus concentration in the inlet water is only 3 mg l to ensure optimal phosphorus levels at the biological treatment stages at the wwtp of jsc grindeks h3po4 is added as a phosphorus source in the first mbbr and the level of inorganic phosphates is monitored in the first and last mbbrs because low phosphorus availability strongly affects the biodegradation efficiency and favours the growth of filamentous bacteria 81 the only production process giving high amounts of phosphates c 10 g l po4 p in the wastewaters of jsc grindeks is the batch synthesis of ipidacrine api which performed in campaigns lasting only several weeks every year in order to avoid extreme peak loadings and overdose of phosphorus at these times about 10 m3 of wastewater from this batch process is collected separately and reused as a phosphorus source during the periods when its concentration is low in the influent wastewater the substitution of h3po4 with phosphorus rich wastewater allows reduction of the consumption of phosphorus as a critical nutrient and lowers the operational costs of wwtp leading to improved plant efficiency 3 5 4 the use of recovered solvents as easily degradable carbon source for the denitrification processes spent solvents that after several recovery cycles are no longer suitable for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products represent a large proportion of the liquid waste generated by the pharmaceutical industry see more details in section 3 4 in most cases elevated water content is the reason why spent solvents are no longer suitable for re use in chemical synthesis solvents in general are toxic and inhibit the enzymatic activity of activated sludge microorganisms 82 however controlled addition of some solvents to wastewater streams may be beneficial for the activated sludge microorganisms at the biological wwtp of jsc grindeks about 9 5 tons of water miscible spent solvents per year are utilised as external carbon sources in the post denitrification process due to its relatively low toxicity highly biodegradable nature and chemical compatibility with the dosing line materials ethanol has been selected as the most suitable spent solvent for this purpose the addition of a carbon source is based on an experimentally determined optimal c n ratio of 4 1 where c is cod and n refers to both no3 n and no2 n the spent ethanol is diluted with water to a concentration of about 50 in order to reduce its flammability and to mitigate explosion risks at the wwtp although the current re use rate of spent solvents in the denitrification process represents only about 3 5 of the total amount of spent solvents generated at jsc grindeks there are opportunities to also utilise these solvents at municipal wwtps as the denitrification efficiency at municipal wwtps is often limited by insufficient carbon content in the untreated wastewater 83 spent solvents can be potentially introduced as external carbon sources at municipal wwtps considering that spent solvents are recovered separately from each batch process at jsc grindeks it is possible to accurately determine the presence of pharmaceutical residues in such solvents additionally it allows to choose solvents from the production of those apis that show comparatively better biodegradability at wwtps and does not represent therapeutic classes that have significant adverse effects on the ecosystem 84 the implementation of such practices allows reduction of operating costs of the wwtps an increase in nitrogen removal efficiency and general improvement of pharmaceutical waste management 4 conclusions comprehensive analysis of various water flows and their quality requirements allows identification of opportunities and limitations for water reuse at the manufacturing plant level concerns about product contamination the strict chemical and microbiological purity requirements and current gmp regulations restrict the use of reclaimed water in direct contact with pharmaceutical products water steam condensate and reject water re use from ro systems and a transition to water efficient closed loop cooling systems were recognized as necessary actions to reduce water consumption in a particular pharmaceutical factory due to extreme variability of pharmaceutical wastewater in a multiproduct factory treatability studies and toxicity screening should be conducted for individual batch streams to distinguish highly toxic and concentrated streams and provide pre treatment if necessary our case study highlights a synergy between manufacturing facilities and on site wwtp that provides a logical path for implementing the elements of circular economy in the pharmaceutical factory as a result specific wastewater streams from pharmaceutical batch processes can be reused as sources of nutrients coagulants or a ph control agent in a biological wwtp providing both environmental and economic benefits funding this work was funded by the polish national agency for academic exchange as the part of the project international

8798,in the last few years in poland consumption of natural bottled mineral and spring waters is growing waters are taken from surface springs or shallow wells on the other hand highly mineralized waters used in medical treatment are extracted from deep bored wells due to the origin of the water it may contain naturally occurring radioactive isotopes the most important radionuclides are 226ra 228ra 210pb and 210po as they could contribute to the effective dose in the greatest degree due to consumption by people in the frame of the work radium isotopes were determined in bottled waters which are easily accessible throughout poland as well in medicinal water directly sampled from health resorts concentration of radium isotopes was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry after chemical separation the highest dose calculated for a member of public was 0 0291 msv year which accounts for about 20 of the parametric value for drinking water 1 introduction water is the most common substance in nature 1 the main resources of water are seas and oceans covering over 70 of the earth s surface as well as rivers and lakes sufficient water resources are an essential condition for the economic development and technical progress of the modern world for the whole of humanity water is a special value in everyday life due to its multiple uses the most important of these is to use it as drinking water to support and satisfy life functions 1 pursuant to the directive of the european commission for drinking water 98 83 ec water intended for human consumption means all water in its original state or after treatment intended for drinking cooking preparing food or other household purposes regardless of its origin and whether it is supplied from a distribution network cisterns or in bottles or containers 2 water circulating in nature is not chemically pure water it contains small amounts of dissolved gases soluble mineral salts which results in the presence of cations such as k na mg2 ca2 and anions of the type hco3 cl no3 in water in addition water may contain radioactive nuclides of natural or anthropogenic origin everyone is exposed to ionizing radiation this exposure is associated with natural or artificial radioactivity in the environment see fig 1 exposure to anthropogenic radioactive substances is associated with the use of artificial radionuclides and radiation sources in medicine x ray diagnostics radiotherapy nuclear medicine and in various industries nuclear technologies nuclear power plants 3 low concentration of artificial radionuclides in the environment is still measured as a result of nuclear weapon tests conducted in the 1950s and 1960s and after nuclear accidents windscale chernobyl 4 and the most recent one in fukushima natural sources of ionizing radiation are nuclides built into the rocks forming the earth s crust during its formation and released into the environment as a result of geological processes weathering exhalation passage to groundwater in most cases the dose of radiation derived from radionuclides introduced into the body together with drinking water represents a small part of the total radiation dose to which an average person on the globe is exposed see fig 1 due to the fact that water is necessary for life and it cannot be replaced control and ensuring its quality also due to the content of radioactive substances is extremely important 5 as stated in national primary drinking water regulations issued by us epa there is a need to measure combined concentration of 226ra and 228ra and maximum contaminats level should not exceed 185 mbq l 6 in amended australian drinking water guidelines total estimated dose excluding 40k should not be higher than 1 msv year the guideline gives procedure on how drinking water shall be analysed in terms of radioactivity 7 in hungary 8 and turkey 9 screening method is used measurement of gross alpha and beta set limits are following 0 1 bq l for gross alpha 1 bq l for gross beta if these values are exceeded specific nuclides must be determined radioactivity is a phenomenon associated with the spontaneous decay of nuclei of various elements which is accompanied by the emission of alpha beta or quanta of gamma radiation very often radioactive isotopes are interrelated in such a way that as a result of the decay of one nucleus other radionuclides are formed creating radioactive decay chains there are three natural radioactive decay chains and the schemes of changes taking place in the individual ones are presented in fig 2 10 radioactive nuclides may occur in surface and groundwater the presence of artificial nuclides in water may be related to the routine operations of nuclear power plants spent fuel processing or failures of nuclear installations therefore artificial radionuclides may be present primarily in surface waters usually they are not found in drinking water taken in underground aquifers on the other hand the concentration of natural radionuclides in surface waters is typically very low and their contribution to consumer doses is minimal however the problem of the occurrence of natural radionuclides in drinking water from underground aquifers cannot be ignored 11 sometimes these concentrations are so high that they can make a significant contribution to the dose for consumers this applies especially to the isotopes of radium 226ra and 228ra incidentally isotopes of uranium 234u and 238u or lead 210pb and polonium 210po 12 naturally occurring dissolved radium in groundwater is known as a human carcinogen once ingested may be deposited in the whole human body and poses a risk to health by dna damage and increase of risk cancer 6 content of radium isotopes in drinking waters have been measured in different parts of the world including poland according to kozłowska 13 and walencik 14 concentration of radium isotopes in bottled mineral waters or underground ones from the outer carpathians ranges from 10 up to 490 mbq l for 226ra and from 29 to 396 mbq l for 228ra the mean radium concentration could be two orders of magnitude higher than for uranium also chau 15 16 and mielnikow 17 in another papers widely discussed level of radium isotopes in mineral or spring waters authors stated that 226ra and 228ra concentrations vary from a few to more than 500 mbq l also they found no correlation or poor correlation between mineralization and radium concentration 2 materials and methods the article presents the results of measurements of radium 226ra and 228ra isotopes in bottled mineral and spring waters generally available throughout poland and natural medicinal therapeutic waters taken directly from water intakes in spa resorts the most measurements were carried out at the silesian centre of environmental radioactivity of the central mining institute gig katowice however analyses of a few samples were performed in parallel in the institute of inorganic chemistry of the university of vienna iac and in central mining institute a research methodology in gig includes co precipitation of radium and barium in the form of sulfates followed by separation from interfering 210pb by using ammonia solution of edta as a complexing agent finally the radioactive source was prepared on the basis of the insta gel gelling liquid scintillation cocktail after reaching radioactive equilibrium about 30 days after preparation samples were measured by means of a quantulus ultra low background liquid scintillation counter 18 initial volume of each sample was 2 l and measurement time 1 h this method enabled to determine simultaneously both isotopes with lower limit of detection 2 mbq l for 226ra and 30 mbq l for 228ra usually samples are prepared in batches in order to calibrate the instrument in each batch apart from unknown samples blank and standards with well known activity separately for 226ra and 228ra are done 19 the method used at the central mining institute has been accredited by the polish centre for accreditation since 1993 in turn vienna laboratory iac used emporetm radium rad disks and liquid scintillation spectrometry to determine radium isotopes from water samples 20 21 3 results and discussion in the study 65 water samples were tested 35 were groundwater with a high total content of dissolved mineral substances or a high concentration of specific components characteristic for waters used in a spa treatment samples were taken directly from springs located in the particular spas the rest 30 were selected bottled mineral and spring waters available in supermarkets in poland water samples which were analysed in both laboratories are marked out in bold in the below tables table 1 and table 2 and results listed there are the average from two sets of measurements the test results for medicinal waters are provided in table 1 it was found that the lowest concentration of 226ra in medicinal waters is the detection limit for the employed measurement method 3mbq l while the highest measured concentration is 989 mbq l 228ra isotope in the studied medicinal waters was present in slightly lower concentrations the lowest value is no more than 20 mbq l which is the limit of detection while the highest measured concentration is 470 mbq l fig 3 the 226ra and 228ra originate from different decay chains where parent radionuclides 232th and 238u have various chemical properties and mobility in aqueous media 22 as the next stage of our study radium concentration for 30 bottled mineral waters available in poland was determined outcomes are shown in table 2 the concentration of 226ra isotope in bottled mineral and spring waters ranges from 3 mbq l which is the limit of detection up to 641 mbq l whereas the content of radium 228ra oscillates between 20 mbq land 250 mbq l usually radium isotopes concentration in bottled mineral waters is by far lower than in therapeutic waters ionizing radiation can penetrate the human body in two ways the first of these is inhalation radioactive substances can be introduced with inhaled air the second way of internal exposure is ingestion through the digestive tract with a meal or water consumption 23 since consumption of bottled mineral and spring water in poland is growing rapidly every year so without any doubts there is a need to monitor the quality of these waters in terms of the content of radioactive elements the current regulation of the ministry of health in poland of 31 march 2011 on natural mineral waters spring waters and table waters does not regulate the problem of radioactivity in these waters 24 on the other hand it should be emphasized that issues regarding the content of radioactive substances in waters intended for consumption are regulated by the regulation of the ministry of health of 11 december 2017 25 according to this ordinance the concentration of radium 226ra and 228ra in drinking water shall be determined this regulation also gives parametric values for individual isotopes table 3 as formulated in the regulation and in the council directive 2013 51 euratom the parametric value is the content of radioactive substances in water above which it should be assessed whether the presence of radioactive substances in water poses a threat to human health requiring action and if necessary take corrective actions to improve water quality to a level consistent with health protection requirements people against radiation 26 if the requirements of the regulation on the quality water intended for human consumption were used for the analysed mineral spring and medicinal waters the radium isotope concentrations in the several tested water samples would significantly exceed the parametric values as shown in fig 4 in about 8 of tested waters concentration of 226ra is higher than the parametric values for this radioisotope it could imply that 5 out of 65 analysed water do not meet the requirements of the regulation with respect to 226ra isotope in the case of 228ra isotope approximately 14 of the tested samples exceed parametric value 200 mbq l fig 5 in order to assess the exposure to ionizing radiation from nuclides introduced into the body the effective dose that the average water consumer may receive should be estimated in accordance with the regulation of the minister of health of 2017 this dose should not exceed 0 1 msv year when calculating the dose the concentration of a given radioactive isotope the dose coefficients for certain nuclide taken from council directive 96 29 euratom 27 and the annual consumption 730 l of water by an adult are used ed σ dci ci v where ed effective dose msv year dci dose coefficient for given nuclide msv bq ci given radionuclide concentration bq l v annual water consumption 730 l year if such calculation procedure were done for medicinal waters it would show that the obtained effective dose could be several times higher than 0 1 msv nevertheless the daily volume of medicinal water consumed by patients is about 1 l divided into portions throughout the day usually as prescribed by doctors on average patients stay in the spa for 3 weeks so they can consume about 21 l of water considering the highest measured radium isotope concentrations therapeutic water from the jan kazimierz intake in duszniki zdrój of 989 mbq l for 226ra and 240 mbq l for 228ra respectively the estimated effective dose is 0 0092 msv year which is far below 0 1 msv year available data shows that the annual consumption of bottled mineral or spring waters in poland in 2017 was about 101 l per person 28 similarly to drinking water the effective dose can be estimated outcomes for those calculations are shown in table 4 for water with the highest concentration of 226ra staropolanka 2000 the effective annual dose would be 0 0215 msv which is about 20 of the indicative dose 0 1 msv mentioned in the regulation of the ministry of health the results obtained above indicate that consumption of mineral or spring water containing elevated concentrations of natural radioactive isotopes does not pose a threat to human health the expected doses from consumption of natural mineral or spring waters are almost negligible while comparing to other natural radiation sources indoor radon 40k on the other hand the research undoubtedly draws attention to the possibility of increased natural radioactivity in mineral and medicinal waters especially taken from underground aquifers this problem should not be ignored and waters regularly tested for radioactive content 29 32 the quality of different types of mineral water was analysed in more details regarding the concentration of minerals listed in table 5 and radium isotopes to investigate the relationship between the studied parameters characterizing the mineral water samples tested the principal component analysis pca was applied 33 35 the pca is the method commonly used in exploring multidimensional data sets it allows reducing the data dimensionality its visualization and interpretation of the observed phenomenon in the pca a data set is organized into matrix x m x n where rows represent the studied samples objects and the columns represent the studied parameters the pca decomposes the studied data matrix x into two matrices score matrix s m x fn and loading matrix d fn x n where m and n describe the number of objects in our case mineral water samples and the number of parameters respectively and fn denotes the number of significant factors the columns of matrix s and the rows of matrix d are called principal components pcs and they are constructed to maximize the data variation description the pcs are orthogonal effective data compression enables the visualization and interpretation of the similarities dissimilarities between the studied objects in the parameters space 36 37 in our study the data set was organized in matrix x 30 10 where rows represent the studied mineral water samples listed in table 5 and columns represent 10 studied parameters i e concentrations of the total mineral content 1 ca2 2 mg2 3 na 4 k 5 hco3 6 cl 7 so4 2 8 226ra 9 and 228ra 10 respectively since the studied data set contained measurements performed within different magnitude ranges the pca model was constructed for the centred and standardized data based on the percentage of the modelled variance the optimal number of significant pcs was determined in our study the pca model with five pcs described 91 08 of the data variance the score plots and loading plots constructed for the studied data set are presented in fig 6 the pc1 described 51 40 of the data variance and revealed the difference between the mineral water samples nos 10 14 16 18 23 and 28 and all the remaining mineral water samples resulting from relatively higher total minerals content in a sample parameter no 1 as well as higher concentration of hco3 parameter no 6 and low concentration of cl so4 2 parameters nos 7 and 8 moreover two groups of mineral water samples and one non grouped sample can be distinguished along pc1 the first group collected mineral water sample nos 1 9 11 13 17 19 27 and 29 whereas the second group was composed of mineral water samples nos 10 14 16 18 and 28 the mineral water sample no 23 was not grouped in any of the two distinguished clusters based on the loading plot it was possible to conclude that the uniqueness of sample no 23 resulted mainly from the highest concentration of na k and 226ra parameters nos 4 5 and 9 the samples collected in the first cluster were characterized by low values of all studied parameters several differences in concentrations of studied components were observed in the second cluster namely the samples nos10 and 14 were unique because of the high concentration of ca2 parameter no 2 and lower concentrations of cl and so4 2 parameters nos 7 and 8 the remaining samples collected in the second cluster differed from the samples 10 and 14 due to the relatively low concentration of ca2 parameter no 2 and high concentration of mg2 parameter no 3 moreover the uniqueness of the sample no 18 was observed resulting from the highest concentration of 228ra parameter no 10 and the lowest concentration of na parameter no 4 among all the studied samples the pc2 describing 17 03 of the total data variance was constructed due to the highest differences between samples nos 5 20 and 24 and the sample no 14 based on the loading plot it could be observed that the samples nos 5 20 and 24 were characterized by higher concentrations of cl and so4 2 parameters nos 7 and 8 while the sample no 14was unique because of the relatively high concentration of hco3 parameter no 6 and low concentrations of cl and so4 2 parameters nos 7 and 8 respectively the pc3 representing 14 18 of the total data variance reflected the highest difference between the samples nos 23 and 18 whereas the pc4 describing 8 20 of data variance revealed the difference of the sample no 18 and all remaining samples respectively the uniqueness of the sample nos 23 was confirmed by the highest concentrations of na k and 226ra parameters nos 4 5 and 9 the uniqueness of the sample no 18 was also observed resulting from the highest concentration of 228ra parameter no 10 4 conclusions the most popular mineral or spring bottled waters and curative ones widely used in poland were examined in terms of radium isotopes content the chosen analytical method enables to obtain precise results with low detection limits the pca allows to divided studied water samples into two main clusters moreover the uniqueness of one type of mineral water was observed due to the highest concentration of na k and 226ra despite the fact that nowadays radium isotopes content and resulting effective doses are low additionally there are no clear guidelines for radioactivity levels in mineral or spring bottled waters it is necessary to perform regular monitoring of these waters for therapeutic waters concentration ranges between 3 and 989 mbq l for 226ra and 20 470 mbq l for 228ra respectively in case of mineral or spring waters concentrations of both radium isotopes are by far lower and oscillates between 3 and 641 mbq l for 226ra and 20 250 mbq l for 228ra calculated effective dose for a member of the public consuming bottled waters varies from 0 0015 up 0 0291 msv year these values are significantly below 0 1 msv year the reference value which is mentioned in the regulation of ministry of health in poland it means that the consumption of mineral or spring water usually does not a present potential hazard for public health acknowledgments this work was supported by the ministry of science and higher education poland 11155029 authors

228ra respectively the estimated effective dose is 0 0092 msv year which is far below 0 1 msv year available data shows that the annual consumption of bottled mineral or spring waters in poland in 2017 was about 101 l per person 28 similarly to drinking water the effective dose can be estimated outcomes for those calculations are shown in table 4 for water with the highest concentration of 226ra staropolanka 2000 the effective annual dose would be 0 0215 msv which is about 20 of the indicative dose 0 1 msv mentioned in the regulation of the ministry of health the results obtained above indicate that consumption of mineral or spring water containing elevated concentrations of natural radioactive isotopes does not pose a threat to human health the expected doses from consumption of natural mineral or spring waters are almost negligible while comparing to other natural radiation sources indoor radon 40k on the other hand the research undoubtedly draws attention to the possibility of increased natural radioactivity in mineral and medicinal waters especially taken from underground aquifers this problem should not be ignored and waters regularly tested for radioactive content 29 32 the quality of different types of mineral water was analysed in more details regarding the concentration of minerals listed in table 5 and radium isotopes to investigate the relationship between the studied parameters characterizing the mineral water samples tested the principal component analysis pca was applied 33 35 the pca is the method commonly used in exploring multidimensional data sets it allows reducing the data dimensionality its visualization and interpretation of the observed phenomenon in the pca a data set is organized into matrix x m x n where rows represent the studied samples objects and the columns represent the studied parameters the pca decomposes the studied data matrix x into two matrices score matrix s m x fn and loading matrix d fn x n where m and n describe the number of objects in our case mineral water samples and the number of parameters respectively and fn denotes the number of significant factors the columns of matrix s and the rows of matrix d are called principal components pcs and they are constructed to maximize the data variation description the pcs are orthogonal effective data compression enables the visualization and interpretation of the similarities dissimilarities between the studied objects in the parameters space 36 37 in our study the data set was organized in matrix x 30 10 where rows represent the studied mineral water samples listed in table 5 and columns represent 10 studied parameters i e concentrations of the total mineral content 1 ca2 2 mg2 3 na 4 k 5 hco3 6 cl 7 so4 2 8 226ra 9 and 228ra 10 respectively since the studied data set contained measurements performed within different magnitude ranges the pca model was constructed for the centred and standardized data based on the percentage of the modelled variance the optimal number of significant pcs was determined in our study the pca model with five pcs described 91 08 of the data variance the score plots and loading plots constructed for the studied data set are presented in fig 6 the pc1 described 51 40 of the data variance and revealed the difference between the mineral water samples nos 10 14 16 18 23 and 28 and all the remaining mineral water samples resulting from relatively higher total minerals content in a sample parameter no 1 as well as higher concentration of hco3 parameter no 6 and low concentration of cl so4 2 parameters nos 7 and 8 moreover two groups of mineral water samples and one non grouped sample can be distinguished along pc1 the first group collected mineral water sample nos 1 9 11 13 17 19 27 and 29 whereas the second group was composed of mineral water samples nos 10 14 16 18 and 28 the mineral water sample no 23 was not grouped in any of the two distinguished clusters based on the loading plot it was possible to conclude that the uniqueness of sample no 23 resulted mainly from the highest concentration of na k and 226ra parameters nos 4 5 and 9 the samples collected in the first cluster were characterized by low values of all studied parameters several differences in concentrations of studied components were observed in the second cluster namely the samples nos10 and 14 were unique because of the high concentration of ca2 parameter no 2 and lower concentrations of cl and so4 2 parameters nos 7 and 8 the remaining samples collected in the second cluster differed from the samples 10 and 14 due to the relatively low concentration of ca2 parameter no 2 and high concentration of mg2 parameter no 3 moreover the uniqueness of the sample no 18 was observed resulting from the highest concentration of 228ra parameter no 10 and the lowest concentration of na parameter no 4 among all the studied samples the pc2 describing 17 03 of the total data variance was constructed due to the highest differences between samples nos 5 20 and 24 and the sample no 14 based on the loading plot it could be observed that the samples nos 5 20 and 24 were characterized by higher concentrations of cl and so4 2 parameters nos 7 and 8 while the sample no 14was unique because of the relatively high concentration of hco3 parameter no 6 and low concentrations of cl and so4 2 parameters nos 7 and 8 respectively the pc3 representing 14 18 of the total data variance reflected the highest difference between the samples nos 23 and 18 whereas the pc4 describing 8 20 of data variance revealed the difference of the sample no 18 and all remaining samples respectively the uniqueness of the sample nos 23 was confirmed by the highest concentrations of na k and 226ra parameters nos 4 5 and 9 the uniqueness of the sample no 18 was also observed resulting from the highest concentration of 228ra parameter no 10 4 conclusions the most popular mineral or spring bottled waters and curative ones widely used in poland were examined in terms of radium isotopes content the chosen analytical method enables to obtain precise results with low detection limits the pca allows to divided studied water samples into two main clusters moreover the uniqueness of one type of mineral water was observed due to the highest concentration of na k and 226ra despite the fact that nowadays radium isotopes content and resulting effective doses are low additionally there are no clear guidelines for radioactivity levels in mineral or spring bottled waters it is necessary to perform regular monitoring of these waters for therapeutic waters concentration ranges between 3 and 989 mbq l for 226ra and 20 470 mbq l for 228ra respectively in case of mineral or spring waters concentrations of both radium isotopes are by far lower and oscillates between 3 and 641 mbq l for 226ra and 20 250 mbq l for 228ra calculated effective dose for a member of the public consuming bottled waters varies from 0 0015 up 0 0291 msv year these values are significantly below 0 1 msv year the reference value which is mentioned in the regulation of ministry of health in poland it means that the consumption of mineral or spring water usually does not a present potential hazard for public health acknowledgments this work was supported by the ministry of science and higher education poland 11155029 authors

8799,the study highlights effectiveness of hydrodynamic cavitation hc in the degradation of effluents polluted by brilliant cresyl blue bcb dye optimal process parameters were cavitation number 0 27 inlet pressure 1 70 bar temperature 20 c and ph 7 the efficiency of hc was investigated in combination with other advanced oxidation processes including the addition of external oxidants hydrogen peroxide ozone and sodium persulfate and photooxidation a detailed investigation of reactive radical species present in the system is also presented hybrid processes based on hc revealed the highest synergism finally ultrafast degradation of target oxazine dye decolorization efficiency of 100 within the short treatment time of 1 min was developed the most effective process was a combination of hydrodynamic cavitation and ozonation with a synergistic coefficient of 1 84 and electrical energy per order eeo of 0 03 kwh m 3 order 1 the presented solution is ready to be implemented as technology for industrial practice graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrodynamic cavitation advanced oxidation processes aops hydroxyl radicals persulfate photooxidation 1 introduction the discharge of wastewaters containing organic dyes into aquatic environments causes serious health and environmental issues 1 3 brilliant cresyl blue bcb is an oxazine dye and it is widely used in the textile printing industries as well as a tracer within the red blood cells to determine the rna stain 4 studies have shown that bcb is classified considered as a carcinogenic toxic and mutagenic compound even a low concentration of this dye has adverse effects on the environment 5 for commercial purposes more than 10 thousand varieties of synthetic dyes are produced and available on the market worldwide moreover the usage of synthetic dyes exceeds 70 thousand tonnes per year and approximately 20 of the dyes are released into the wastewater after the dyeing process 6 7 these wastewaters contain high amounts of suspended particles and intense colour with high ph and are varied in the residual chemical oxygen demand cod the high value of total organic carbon toc and often are discharged directly into the environment 8 9 hence it is essential to treat such effluents and prevent their discharge into freshwater sources considering the damage to the aquatic environment caused by the wastewater discharged by textile dyeing industries it is necessary to develop an environmentally friendly and energy efficient technique to treat the textile effluent before being discharged into the aquatic environment 10 11 over the past few years several conventional techniques consisting of different combinations of physical chemical and biological oxidation processes have been developed for the treatment of textile effluent these treatment processes however produce large amounts of secondary pollutants which are even more carcinogenic than the parent compound recently many researchers have used hydrodynamic cavitation hc one of the advanced oxidation processes aops to treat wastewater as a versatile hybrid aops 12 15 during the hc a substantial pressure change occurs when an aqueous solution passes through cavitating devices such as orifice or venturi due to the alteration in the fluid flow path 16 17 cavitation phenomenon involves nucleation growth and subsequent collapse of as generated microbubbles or cavities that occur at short time intervals at multiple reactor locations and thus release large amounts of energy a sudden collapse of the cavities creates a hot spot high localized temperatures 5000 10 000 k and pressures 500 atm resulting in the formation of ho h ho2 and h2o2 18 as generated radicals non selective reactive species are capable of oxidizing organic substances within the cavitating devices and help to mineralize the target compounds 19 21 however it has been reported in many studies that hc alone can not provide the necessary removal of organic pollutants present in the treated aqueous phase as a hybrid aop which results in significantly higher degradation in a shorter time of treatment it is therefore often combined with other processes such as the addition of a photocatalyst fenton reagent h2o2 ozone etc many literature studies have been reported for the treatment of dyes applying individually operated aops such as photocatalysis and fenton reaction as well as combined treatment schemes such as sonoelectrochemical oxidation sonophotocatalytic degradation hydrodynamic acoustic cavitation hac and combined hydrodynamic cavitation hydrogen peroxide hc h2o2 approach the removal efficiency of acid red 88 was investigated using different approaches based on hydrodynamic cavitation 22 using hc and combined approach of hc h2o2 it was reported that the removal extent of acid red 88 stands at 92 and 99 within 120 min under the optimized parameters of 4000 μm addition of 30 h2o2 the combined operation of hc h2o2 100 μm with fe tio2 1 8 g l resulted in the complete decolorization of the effluent removal efficiency of 100 the aforementioned study reported that the degradation rate was enhanced by 45 60 for the combination of hc h2o2 with the addition of an appropriate catalyst a novel approach to utilizing hydrogel adsorbent and hc was investigated for the degradation of crystal violet dye as a result of which 73 toc removal was obtained within 90 min under optimized operational conditions the observed synergistic index was 1 53 as compared to the addition of individual treatment processes 23 the removal of rhodamine b dye in the presence of hc assisted hydrogel nanocomposite adsorption was also studied according to the results the decolorization efficiency of 65 was obtained under optimized operating conditions such as ph 7 62 0 5 g clay loaded nanocomposite hydrogel and 25 g hydrogel loading in the adsorption column the greater extent of the degradation was observed with the addition of h2o2 to the hybrid system which increased the degradation of rh b dye to 72 85 with toc removal of 45 24 in another study researchers focused their attention on the oxidation of reactive red 4 using an improved hybrid process with a combination of hc h2o2 and ozone it was reported that almost 99 of the degradation was achieved within 5 min in comparison with the other processes 25 among the application of ho h ho2 as oxidizing species to remove organic pollutants recently sulfate radical so 4 sulfate radical so 4 is considered as an alternative to ho radical due to their high oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 ev which is capable of destroying various persistent pollutants such as organic dyes since sulfate radical so 4 has a longer lifetime 3 4 10 5 s than ho radical 2 10 8 s their usefulness is already proved in the literature 26 two oxidants such as persulfate s 2 o 8 2 and peroxymonosulfate hso 5 are the sources of so 4 which can be activated using various activators including catalysts uv base and heat sulfate radicals attack hydro peroxide o o bond by homolytic or heterolytic cleavage and they can transform from to hydroxyl radicals ho 27 therefore the role of so 4 radicals in the degradation of bcb was investigated thermal activation 20 c 50 c and the effect of concentration 0 1 m 0 5 m 1 0 m of ps in model solution was studied the literature analysis revealed that there are many studies reported using aops for degrading different types of dyes but no studies are reported based on a combination of hc with other aops such as h2o2 ozone and uv treatment for the oxidation of bcb the present work is aimed at defining possible enhancement in the oxidation of bcb by using hc in the presence of various oxidants such as h2o2 ozone and persulfate the synergistic effect of various parameters on the oxidation of dye by different combined processes such as hc h2o2 hc ozone hc ps hc h2o2 ozone hc uv and hc uv h2o2 was assessed 2 experimental

milliq water purification system millipore corporation usa sodium hydroxide merck and sulphuric acid merck 95 97 was used for adjusting the solution ph 2 10 a tytan 32 ozone generator erem was applied for the generation of ozone gas at a rate of 0 459 g h all the chemicals used were of analytical grade 2 2 experimental procedure all the studies were conducted using a 6 dm3 volume of the dye solution the solution temperature inside the reactor was maintained at 20 2 c by circulating cooling water through the cooling coil mounted inside of the mixing chamber the total reaction time for all the experiments was 180 min and the aliquots were taken for the analysis at regular time intervals the effect of the cavitation number on decolorization and cod removal was initially investigated by varying the pressure in the range of 3 10 bar to study the effectiveness of the hybrid processes based on hc oxidative reagents such as ozone hydrogen peroxide and sodium peroxydisulfate were added to the reactor hc in combination with hydrogen peroxide and ps experiments was conducted at a different feed rate for hydrogen peroxide and ps to find the influence of the oxidants the oxidants ozone hydrogen peroxide and ps were directly injected through the nozzle into the throat of the venturi slit thus directly exposing to the cavitational effect different types of scavengers were used to examine the combined effect of the oxidants and cavitation on decolorization and cod removal 2 3 hydrodynamic cavitation set up the schematic representation of the hc system is illustrated in fig 1 the experimental setup is comprised of an 11 l stainless steel tank ss316 with a closed loop circuit of the temperature control system stirrer an electric heater a vane pump ms 801 4 1360 min 1 techtop motor shanghai china and a venturi slit as a cavitating device there were two discharge lines from the pump with a maximum flow rate of 1000 l h i e the primary process line and the bypass

mm with a throat diameter of 2 mm and the connecting elements were made of stainless steel ss316 while the inlet and outlet tubing were made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe geometric details the dimensions of venturi and other operational parameters of the cavitating device and its arrangements have already been reported by our research group 12 the volume of the dye solution treated in the system was 6 l for the studies involving hc o3 h2o2 and combinations of them in experiments with uv light irradiation an additional 3 l chamber equipped with a uv lamp uvhq 250z hg lamp uv technik germany was attached to the primary process line the power of the lamp is 250 w with a specific lamp power of 56 w cm the uv emission spectrum of the hg lamp is provided on fig s1 supporting information file the oxidants hydrogen peroxide and ps solutions were injected continuously into the system using a high pressure pump s 7110 isocratic pump merck hitachi japan with a flow rate of 0 22 ml min in comparison ozone was injected directly from the ozone generator at a flow rate of 0 5 l min which corresponds to 0 459 g h of ozone production the concentration of ozone in inlet gas stream to the reactor was 1 53 10 2 g ozone l of air 2 4 analytical procedure a uv spectrophotometer dr2010 hach usa was used to determine the dye degradation in the aqueous media the absorbance measured for the wavelength of 625 nm corresponded to the maximum absorption wavelength of bcb dye the degradation efficiency decolorization efficiency was calculated through the following eq 1 1 degradation ci cf ci 100 where ci and cf were concentrations calculated based on absorbance values for the dye solutions before and after the treatment processes respectively the cod of the solution was measured with a standard cuvette test method using a hach cod reactor and a hach dr 2010 spectrophotometer 28 29 the effect of scavengers at a set time interval was determined with the rp hplc equipped with a c18 column of dimensions 4 6 150 mm obtained from agilent technologies usa and a uv detector to detect the presence of intermediate by products generated during the degradation of bcb the process samples were analysed with the hplc uv dad technique the mobile phase applied in rp hplc determination consists of acetonitrile water mixture 20 80 v v with flow rate maintained at 1 ml min all the experiments were repeated twice and the average values of two runs with an experimental error of 3 were reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishing optimal parameters for hc processes 3 1 1 effect of the cavitation number on dye degradation the cavitation number describes the intensity of cavitation in hydraulic devices it is given as a ratio of the difference between the recovered downstream pressure of the throat and the vapor pressure of the liquid over the linear velocity of the fluid at the throat 30 it is expressed as follows eq 2 2 c v p 2 p v 1 2 ρ ν 0 2 where p2 downstream pressure pa pv water vapor pressure at 20 c pa ρ density of the pumped medium at 20 c kg m ν linear velocity at the throat of venturi tube m s the optimal values depending on the system are in the range of 0 1 the cavitation number is a crucial parameter that directly influences the efficacy of the hc in dye degradation the interdependence between cavitation number and degradation rate was investigated experiments were conducted for different cavitation number values cv 0 14 0 27 0 5 0 9 1 2 it was observed that the highest degradation efficiency was obtained for cv 0 27 with the inlet pressure of 1 70 bar and the outlet pressure of 1 20 bar as the inlet pressure rises the cavitation number declines thus resulting in a greater amount of reactive hydroxyl radicals ho that react with the dye molecules at the same time the flow rate of the solution will be higher and consequently followed by an increased number of venturi passes 31 as a result a strong interaction between free reactive radicals ho and dye molecules occurs 32 hence increased degradation efficiency was observed for cv 0 27 10 fig 2 a for lower values of cv 0 14 degradation efficiency was 5 and for higher values of cv 1 2 degradation efficiency was 2 this leads to a conclusion that at a lower cv 0 14 a cloudy cavity is formed and the interacting surface between the dye molecules and ho is too small to decompose dye molecules while at higher cv values 1 2 number of ho formed is not sufficient to attack and decompose the target molecules therefore all the experiments were performed at an optimum cavitation number of 0 27 inlet pressure 1 70 bar and outlet pressure 1 20 bar flow rate 338 l h the velocity at the throat of venturi 31 m s and temperature maintained at 20 c information about the relationship between the parameters and cavitation number can be found in table 1 the number of passes is expressed as follows eq 3 33 3 number of passes flow rate l min v l t min this parameter will be used in further discussion to understand the effectiveness of cavitation based processes fully low cavitation numbers i e the high linear velocity of the liquid results in a maximized number of passes of the treated media via the cavitation zone 3 1 2 effect of ph on the degradation of bcb the ph value plays a significant role in the degradation of the dye solution hereby during the optimization of process parameters studies of ph effect on bcb degradation were considered indispensable since this factor influences the physicochemical properties of the dye molecules in the solution experiments were conducted in the ph range of 2 10 the results obtained indicate that the highest degradation efficiency was obtained for solutions of ph 3 0 and ph 10 0 fig 2b approximately 99 5 of bcb was degraded at a solution ph of 10 0 and 99 8 at a solution ph of 3 0 within the treatment time of 180 min using sole hc cv 0 27 meanwhile if we compare degradation efficiency in 1 min of treatment time 87 89 degradation corresponds to solution ph of 10 0 and 49 35 degradation corresponds to solution ph of 3 0 i e basic circumstances were favorable for the degradation of bcb the lowest degradation efficiency of 12 58 was obtained in the ph range 6 7 details of bcb degradation at different ph values and rate constants are provided in table 2 a rise in the reaction rate constant from 1 10 2 min 1 to 2 3 10 2 min 1 was obtained when the solution ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 respectively the extent of degradation may occur because of the generation of ho increases with an increase in ph media and this accompanied by higher oxidation potential of ho 2 8v which leads to a higher degradation of bcb meanwhile the studies also revealed an increase in the degradation of bcb for ph 3 compared to a neutral ph this fact can be explained by a low ability of hydroxyl radicals ho to be recombined in acidic ph therefore more ho are disposable in solution and can directly react with pollutant molecules thus resulting in degradation efficiency of 98 81 in 180 min a similar effect has been observed by gore et al 25 the results obtained indicate that both acidic and alkaline media enhance the degradation of bcb concerning a neutral ph however basic ph is favored since the degradation takes place in only 1 min treatment for hc as a sole treatment process phenoxazine groups of dye such as bcb and nile blue are stable at different ph media 4 therefore degradation of bcb is attributed to the combined effect of acid basic ph and cavitation conditions related to generation of radical species blank experiments of ph effect on bcb without treatment were conducted to check if ph conditions affect the decolorization of bcb after 180 min incubation of samples at ph 3 ph 7 and ph 10 no change was observed in model samples of bcb blank experiments were conducted also to evaluate the role of temperature on bcb degradation two different temperatures were selected 20 c and 50 c and after 180 min incubation no decolorization was observed selection of the ph for real wastewater treatment scenario will depend on the type of effluents and their native ph as well as the possibility of their mixing with other effluents having strongly acidic or basic ph this way the utilization of external chemicals for ph correction can be minimized thereby lowering the costs of the treatment process 3 2 effectiveness of ozone as a sole process and in combination with hc for bcb degradation ozone is a powerful oxidant having a high oxidation potential 2 08 ev it was used to enhance the degradation of pollutant molecules in the aqueous medium ozone can degrade a variety of organic contaminants whose molecules contain unsaturated bonds such as cc nn and cn 14 cavitation devices ceaselessly generate free reactive radicals which intensively interact with pollutant molecules contributing thus in higher degradation rates of contaminants present in wastewater 34 in order to intensify the degradation of bcb dye a combination of hc and ozone was studied in the present work an enhanced mass transfer of ozone molecules from the gas phase to model solution occurs during the combination of hc with ozone gas where an immediate degradation of dye molecules takes place within the treatment time of 1 min under hc conditions ozone molecules are readily transformed into atomic and molecular oxygen o2 which undergoes in reaction with water molecules to produce superoxide o 2 and ho radicals 35 the reactions that take place are presented in the following eqs 4 11 25 35 38 4 h 2 o hc ho h e e o 2 8 v 5 o 3 h c 2 h 2 e o 2 h 2 o e o 2 08 v 6 o 3 h c o 2 o p 3 7 h 2 o hc ho h 8 o p 3 h 2 o 2 h o 9 h o o 2 o h o 2 1 10 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 11 o 2 b c b deg r a d a t i o n b y p r o d u c t s c o 2 h 2 o in case of ozone based processes it is important to evaluate what is the effectiveness of ozone uptake from the injected gas by the processed liquid a preliminary studies revealed that 15 min are needed to saturate the processed liquid with ozone and that ozone is absorbed quantitatively in the aqueous phase during first 15 min of the barbotage after this time period ozone starts to be detect at the reactor s gas outlet since 100 degradation for hc o3 and sole ozone was achieved respectively in 1 min and 5 min treatment time it is considered that total amount of ozone introduced in the inlet gas was available for treatment process it can be inferred that the degradation of bcb was 10 using hc as a sole process in 180 min and 100 degradation was attained in 5 min with the sole use of ozonation rox 1 03 it was also possible to achieve 100 degradation in only 1 min by combining hc with ozone rox 0 27 fig 3 a a synergistic effect was obtained for the combined process with a respective synergistic coefficient of 1 84 the removal efficiency was also confirmed by the cod analysis results which showed degradation efficiency of 94 by the sole ozonation process and degradation efficiency of 97 for the combined process of hc o3 table 3 exp 13 14 15 the synergetic coefficient that examines the efficiency of the combined method is expressed in the following equation eq 12 12 s k h c o 3 k h c k o 3 k h c o 3 is the rate constant of the combined process of hc and ozone k h c is the rate constant of sole hc process and k o 3 is the rate constant of the sole ozonation process the degradation of reactive orange 4 ro4 by the hc based hybrid treatment techniques have also been studied by other researchers 25 they reported that the combination of hc with ozone at an optimum feed rate of 3 g h resulted in the toc removal efficiency of 76 25 during the treatment time of 60 min studies of rhodamine 6g degradation with the hybrid process of hc ozone were conducted by rajoriya et al 35 they similarly reported the decolorization efficiency of 100 in 5 10 min toc removal of 84 using hc ozone process 3 g h in 120 min conclusively the results of the present study showed a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the treatment process at a much shorter required treatment time in comparison with the already reported data regarding the combined process of hc o 3 3 3 effect of hc coupled with h2o2 on dye degradation the effect of h2o2 with a particular dosage in combination with hc was investigated h2o2 as an oxidant with the oxidation potential of 1 78 ev under optimum cavitation conditions can be dissociated giving rise of a number of ho radicals 39 the sufficient amount of energy needed for the dissociation of h2o2 will be produced from the cavitation phenomena because during cavitation a sufficient amount of energy is created to dissociate the o o bond 213 kj mol in h2o2 and o h bond 418 kj mol of h2o therefore a rise in the amount of ho generated from h2o2 in combination with hc will lead to the degradation of dye molecules as well as other organic pollutants 13 25 39 40 the reactions taking place are described below eqs 13 20 39 41 13 h 2 o 2 hc 2 ho 14 h 2 o hc h ho 15 ho ho hc h 2 o 2 16 ho h 2 o 2 hc oh 2 h 2 o 17 ho oh 2 hc h 2 o o 2 18 o h 2 h 2 o 2 ho h 2 o o 2 19 bcb oh 2 co 2 h 2 o other intermediates 20 bcb h 2 o 2 co 2 h 2 o other intermediates we observed that most of the mineralization using the hybrid process of hc h2o2 occurs in the first 60 min for the sole h2o2 process the degradation efficiency of only 35 74 was obtained for the treatment of 5 mg l dye while the degradation efficiency of 74 15 was achieved for the combined process of hc h2o2 fig 3b thus a significant speed up of the degradation was observed in the first 60 min the synergistic coefficient of 1 07 obtained in a combination of hc and h2o2 proved the effectiveness of hc in making h2o2 more suitable for the degradation of organic pollutants this is due to the high number of ho generated by the dissociation of h2o2 in the presence of hc leading to higher degradation efficiency of bcb compared to that obtained for the sole h2o2 process overall the degradation effectiveness in both processes sole h2o2 rox 8 31 and hc h2o2 rox 8 31 was high and reached 90 49 and 96 49 after 180 min respectively table 3 16 17 the effectiveness of the combined method of hc h2o2 was also reported by other researchers in the degradation of different dyes such as methylene blue methyl orange and rhodamine b 42 43 3 4 effect of the combination of hc with uv irradiation on bcb degradation the combination of hc with uv light irradiation was also investigated in this study a slight increase in the degradation rate of bcb was observed when the combined process of hc uv 34 was used instead of the photolysis alone 22 both experiments were performed for 180 min at 20 c with a rate constant of 1 4 10 3 min 1 for the sole uv process and 1 9 10 3 min 1 for hc aided with uv as generated ho in the combined process of hc uv eventually sped up the degradation rate of the target pollutants compared to individual approaches cavitation phenomena and photolysis of water molecules enhanced the generation rate of oxidizing species consequently giving rise to the degradation of contaminant molecules 44 the results of cod analysis exhibited the degradation efficiency of 19 for the sole uv and 26 for the combined process of hc uv the synergistic coefficient was 0 9 and this shows that there is no additional efficacy for the combination of both methods table 3 exp 18 19 3 5 dye degradation kinetics during the degradation studies under the cavitation effect the concentration of ho radicals was found to be continuous extremely reactive and non selective so its concentration impact can be neglected the kinetic analysis reveals that the degradation of bcb dye with hc fits into the pseudo first order kinetic model it was observed that the pseudo first order rate constant increases from 1 3 10 2 to 9 3 10 2 min 1 when aops are combined with hc under cavitation conditions the degradation occurs due to pyrolytic decomposition of the dye molecules inside the bubble as a result contaminant molecules are converted to low toxic substances and even non toxic compounds 31 the reaction rate constant determination is expressed in the following eqs 21 and 22 45 21 c c 0 e k t 22 k ln c c 0 t 3 6 effectiveness of hc based aops aops assisted hc process hc based aops provide efficient degradation of wastewater pollutants thus synergistic coefficient values are higher for hc based aops compared to sole aops processes 25 in this study aops such as the ozonation process uv oxidation and h2o2 oxidation were combined with hc for better degradation efficiency of bcb additionally contributing to the reduction of treatment costs reactions that take place are exhibited in the following equations eqs 23 25 34 23 o 3 u v o 3 h ν h 2 o 2 h o o 2 24 uv h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 h ν 2 ho 25 o 3 uv h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 o 3 h 2 o h ν 4 ho o 2 several experiments were performed to study the effect of the combination of hc with aops as hybrid treatment methods the best processes appeared to be the combined treatment process of hc uv o3 which resulted in the degradation efficiency of 100 in 5 min and a synergistic coefficient of 3 42 rox 1 34 and followed then by the combined process of hc uv o3 h2o2 with degradation efficiency of 100 in 5 min and a corresponding synergistic coefficient of 1 85 rox 2 26 the degradation efficiency of the hybrid process of h2o2 uv was increased from 93 98 for the sole process rox 8 31 to 100 for the combined process of hc h2o2 uv rox 5 54 in 180 min treatment time with a synergistic coefficient of 5 91 fig 4 a b c the cod removal for processes of hc uv o3 hc uv o3 h2o2 and hc h2o2 uv resulted in being 98 99 and 97 respectively the synergistic coefficients of 3 42 1 85 and 5 91 for the processes as mentioned earlier confirmed the effectiveness of hc assisted aops for the decolorization and mineralization of bcb contained liquid phase table 3 exp 27 25 21 3 7 effect of concentration and temperature of persulfate in the degradation of bcb dye in the present study two pairs of experiments were conducted where the effects of ps concentration and temperature of the ps assisted treatment process in the degradation of bcb were studied for this purpose three concentrations of ps 0 1 m 0 5 m 1 0 m together with two different temperatures 20 c and 50 c were selected in the first set of experiments the temperature was kept constant at 20 c and the effect of hc combined with ps for the three concentrations 0 1 m 0 5 m 1 0 m on dye degradation was investigated table 3 exp 28 33 we found that as the concentration increases degradation efficiency increases too the highest of the achieved degradation corresponds to hc ps 1 0 m rox 3 36 with 98 47 within the treatment of 180 min fig 5 for the second pair of experiments the concentration of 1 0 m ps was selected as a fixed parameter since the highest degradation was obtained for ps 1 0 m and the effect of the temperature was investigated in the degradation of bcb for the hc ps process at 20 c hc contributes to the degradation of bcb increasing from 51 36 sole ps rox 3 36 to 98 47 hc ps rox 3 36 on the other hand when ps 1 0 m is activated by heat at the temperature of 50 c hc gives attribute in treatment time which is reduced from 180 sole ps rox 1 12 to 60 min hc ps rox 1 12 degradation values varied from 84 36 to 98 61 respectively fig 6 the amount of cod removed confirmed the extent of dye mineralization table 3 exp 32 35 it is clear that in this case the application of ps as an oxidant is not justified since less expensive oxidants h 2 o 2 as well as o 3 provide much higher effectiveness 3 8 effect of the initial concentration of bcb on its degradation efficiency the initial concentration of dye has a significant impact on the degradation rate this study revealed a remarkable decrement in degradation rate as the initial concentration of dye increases wang et al 43 studied the degradation of rhodamine b by swirling jet elicited cavitation and they stated that with the increase of concentration from 10 mg l to 50 mg l degradation was decreased from 98 9 to 63 4 in 180 min thakare et al 46 claimed that as the concentration of brilliant green increased from 10 to 30 mg l its degradation efficiency decreased from 27 92 to 17 34 the presented results go along closely with results already stated in other researches of dye removal such as reactive red x 3d 47 and acid orange 7 ao7 48 in the present study it was observed that with an increase in bcb concentration from 5 to 20 and 50 mg l a substantial decrease in degradation was obtained comparing the same time of treatment the influence of concentration on the degradation rate of bcb is compiled in table 4 during bcb treatment by the sole hc process degradation decreased from 10 0 to 4 14 when the initial concentration of bcb increased from 5 to 50 mg l respectively table 4 exp 13 42 the most effective process for degradation of 5 mg l dye was considered hc combined with ozone rox 0 27 where degradation efficiency of 100 was achieved in short reaction time of 1 min table 4 exp 15 meanwhile complete degradation of 20 mg l was achieved in 15 min rox 1 01 and 99 8 degradation of 50 mg l bcb was achieved in treatment time of 60 min rox 1 21 table 4 exp 38 44 the most effective process for the highest degradation of bcb 20 and 50 mg l was the hybrid process of hc uv o3 h2o2 where the degradation efficiency of 100 was achieved in only 5 min rox 0 57 whereas 99 73 degradation for 50 mg l bcb was achieved within 30 min of treatment rox 1 36 table 4 exp 41 47 fig 7 a b in the case of hc processes assisted with the addition of external oxidants the less effective process was considered hc h2o2 where degradation efficiency of 96 5 was obtained at initial bcb concentration of 5 mg l rox 8 31 to 14 5 rox 8 34 and 3 06 rox 3 33 for 20 and 50 mg l in treatment time of 180 min respectively table 4 exp 16 39 45 fig 7c it is clear that h2o2 reacting directly or converted mainly to ho is not effective for bcb degradation a comparison of results between o3 and o3 h2o2 peroxone process revealed an interesting difference between these processes generally peroxone is a more effective aop comparing to ozonation due to the enhanced formation of reactive radicals ho thus conversion of o3 by reaction with h2o2 hc h2o2 o3 rox 3 07 to produce an increased amount of free reactive radicals was not favored making ozonation combined with hc hc o3 rox 0 27 the most effective process of this studies table 4 exp 15 23 the same trend was also observed for the higher concentration of dye such as 20 and 50 ppm table 4 exp 37 40 44 46 3 9 role of scavengers in the degradation of bcb since the dye degradation under the effect of ozone occurs in the time interval of 1 5 min ozone was considered as the most effective oxidant used for the degradation of bcb molecules to study whether the degradation of bcb takes place due to ho radicals or superoxide radicals o 2 several scavengers were used the scavengers selected for this purpose were methanol n propanol n butanol t butyl alcohol tba and p benzoquinone p bq the alcohols were used as scavengers to investigate the formation and role of ho in the dye degradation whereas p bq was used as a o 2 scavenger their role has also been investigated by other researches 49 50 since the degradation of bcb by the combined process of hc o3 occur in only 1 min therefore we compared the degradation efficiency of bcb for the first minute of each experimental run with the addition of scavengers a significant decline in the degradation efficiency occurred in the presence of p bq where the degradation efficiency decreased from 100 for hc o3 to only 11 24 for the combined process of hc o3 p bq the presence of p bq extends the treatment time to 45 min this can be explained by the presence of superoxide radicals o 2 into the model solution formed from the ozone molecule they are continuously generated thus immediate degradation of bcb in the presence of p bq was prevented by the fast reaction of superoxide radical o 2 with this scavenger table 5 exp 53 in the case of alcoholic compounds a significant decrease in the degradation of bcb takes place in the first minute of reaction in the presence of tba but within 3 min the dye faces complete degradation of 100 ozone directly reacts with tba with a relatively high reaction rate constant 104 105 s 1 51 thus the inhibition of bcb degradation is directly related to a competitive reaction of ozone with tba and lasts until most of the tba is oxidized hc o3 tba table 5 exp 48 comparing from rox values for all processes the lowest rox 0 27 1 table 3 exp 15 corresponds to the hc o3 process in which 100 degradation was achieved in 1 min this means that the excess of o3 can be converted to other radicals such as o 2 ho oh 2 which contribute to high degradation in short treatment time the reaction rate was slower with addition of p bq such that only 44 23 degradation occurred in 6 min this compound was used as a commonly known scavenger of superoxide radicals significant influence on process effectiveness suggests important role of superoxide radicals in the degradation mechanism superoxide radical promotes oxidation reaction by the nucleophile addition of o 2 into the dye molecule this nucleophile favours a cleavage of benzene ring and subsequent complete mineralization of the compound 52 combining all obtained data we propose that the radical species mainly responsible for the degradation of bcb dye are superoxide radicals o 2 but it is worth noting that ho may also be involved in the degradation of bcb dye molecules 3 10 possible degradation mechanism of bcb it is well known that the identification of by products formed during aop based treatment is a one of the important aspects in case of the development of new processes 53 thus we analysed possible pathways of degradation of target pollutant to assess the risk of formation of harmful by products the first possible degradation pathway is based on the direct attack of the ozone gas to the azo double bond of the bcb 54 resulting in nn cleavage superoxide radicals o 2 mainly attack azo bonds and this is typically reported in the degradation of azo dyes where the main reactive species responsible for dye degradation was found to be o 2 50 nevertheless presence of ho initiate n c bond cleavage 55 the cleavage of nn and c n produced the nitrosobenzene naphthalene ring with the substituent and 2 amino 4 6 dichlorotriarine 47 superoxide radical o 2 initiates cycloaddition reactions with unsaturated bonds in addition to electrophilic assault and leads to the creation of a carbonyl group co or nitroso group no compounds 56 cationic dye molecules interact with o2 ho2 or ho species to generate unstable intermediates to detect the presence of intermediate by products the process samples were analysed by hplc uv dad technique gradient elution program was used in these studies to detect any additional peaks appearing during the hc assisted degradation of bcb the analytical method used in this studies is very sensitive with detection limits for compounds having aromatic rings in their structure below 0 1 ppm thus any intermediate by products possible to be formed would be detected the studies revealed that bcb is completely degraded and there was no intermediate present in the samples the complete disappearance of peaks on the hplc chromatogram indicates the absence of any organic moiety analysis of final samples revealed that no additional compounds or by products are present in the treated medium these results confirmed the high removal efficiency of cod almost 100 the dye is a heteropolyaromatic compound having nitrogen n oxygen o zinc zn and chlorine cl atoms attached to the central aromatic ring initially ozone selectively attacks activated aromatic rings or double bonds which are both present in bcb dye owing to the elevated electronic densities on these aromatic carbons replaced with electron donor groups they are particularly reactive with ozone and the reaction will take place mainly concerning the carbon atoms situated in the ortho and para positions the electron withdrawing groups cooh no2 replaced aromatics are weakly reactive to ozone the molecular structure of bcb dye contains both electron donating groups oh nhr and electron withdrawing groups zncl2 hence ozone reactions should occur initially in certain preferential sites sites with high electronic density have been recognized and the evaluation has shown that ozone attacks are likely to occur in the azo group 57 58 the degradation pathway similarly includes the following reactions i hydroxylation reaction where deformation of c h bonds intended to the formation of small carbon chain compounds ii direct oxidation cleavage of benzene ring in bcb molecules iii cleavage of co in the hetero ring of bcb molecule 59 iv splitting of the chromophoric azo c nc bond via the direct oxidation 60 the proposed degradation pathway of bcb is illustrated in fig 8 3 11 influence of water matrix on the degradation rate of bcb dye the presence of inorganic anions affects the decolorization of dye polluted wastewater due to their specific properties nacl imposes the fiber staining by the ability to enhance the dye diffusion being therefore easily absorbed in fiber meanwhile carbonate and bicarbonate ions increase the ph media which helps in dye fiber binding assisted through the formation of covalent bonds 61 sodium sulfate helps in dye fixation in fabric because it reduces negative charges in fiber 62 inorganic anions scavenge ho and inhibit dye degradation thus these inorganic ions were studied as potential inhibitors of degradation that can be present in real wastewaters since hc o3 process was considered as the most effective process to be degradation efficiency of 100 in 1 min therefore it was seen reasonable to study the effect of the presence of co existing compounds on its effectiveness in the degradation of bcb for this purpose two different concentrations 5 and 10 mm of salts nacl na2so4 na2co3 ca no3 2 under two different ph values 7 0 and 10 0 were taken into consideration these studies revealed fig 9 that the presence of the salts as mentioned above initiates a slight decrease in the degradation of bcb dye comparison of bcb degradation results within the same group of anions concentration 10 mm under two different ph 7 0 and 10 0 revealed that the lowest degradation was obtained in the presence of sulfate and carbonate anions with 91 and 92 degradation in the first minute of treatment meanwhile complete degradation was achieved within 5 min of treatment time 100 of degradation was achieved in 5 min of treatment time carbonate anion reacts with hydroxyl radical resulting in the formation of carbonate radical it is a very selective and strong one electron oxidant competing therefore with hydroxyl radicals and scavenging them 61 in a higher concentration of carbonates present in aqueous media the scavenging effect is more visible 61 the same effect was also observed for a lower concentration of anions 5 mm where the lowest degradation of bcb still was obtained in the presence of sulfate and carbonate anions with degradation efficiency of 92 6 and 94 respectively the maximum degradation of 100 was achieved in 5 and 4 min of treatment in the presence of sulfate and carbonate anions respectively as it corresponds to the effect of other anions their inhibition effect was small and comparable in between them and degradation values varied from 95 to 99 8 for nitrate 10 mm nitrate at initial ph of 10 0 in the first minute of treatment time but it is worth mentioning that removal efficiency of 100 was obtained in only 5 min treatment time the fastest time to achieve 100 in the presence of anions was 2 and 3 min in case of chloride ph 7 0 10 mm and 5 mm and nitrate 5 mm ph 10 0 and ph 7 0 anions respectively further experimental results of the effect of anions on the degradation of bcb dye are compiled in table 6 results were compared with the experimental value found in table 3 exp15 for hc o3 in which the degradation efficiency of 100 was achieved within the short treatment time of 1 min it can be seen that sulfates and carbonates exhibited the most suppressive effect among the studied anions from experimental observations we found out that as the concentration of anion increases degradation of dye slightly decreased this effect is even more enforced in basic ph conditions herewith the treatment process of hc o3 can be considered as a promising process for the degradation of organic pollutants such as organic dyes in real industrial wastewaters containing several co existing inorganic compounds moreover it can be implemented in future studies for treating saline wastewaters containing a high value of tds 4 economic assessment treatment costs of the model solution containing bcb dye treated by the hc process combined with aops were estimated the analysis was performed using the same methodology as in the previous study of our research team 63 the compilation is provided in table 7 they were calculated considering such factors as treatment time cost of oxidants and cost of electric energy the hc system uses the power of 1100 w and the ozone generator uses the power of 380 w the cost of electricity in 2019 for industrial customers in poland is 0 164 us dollars usd per 1 kwh 3600 kj the cost of treatment was first estimated for each 6 l batch volume of experiments and then it was recalculated to 1 m3 model solution treatment two alternative options for the treatment process were analysed higher degradation of the bcb dye takes 0 5 m place at basic ph conditions for the sole use of the hc process with degradation efficiency of 99 5 in treatment time of 180 min table 2 exp 12 in this case the cost of treatment of one cubic meter of effluents containing 5 mg l of bcb dye was estimated at 15 03 usd in the case of real effluents having a primary basic ph the hc should be a process of the first choice the second option relates to the treatment of effluents containing bcb dye at neutral ph conditions correction of ph to basic conditions to perform the treatment and further back correction to neutral ph for effluent discharge could be not reasonable from the practical point of view from the aspect of cost estimation both experiments share the same cost of treatment of 15 03 usd table 7 exp 13 12 the most economical approach for the degradation of bcb dye by the hc based aops turned out to be the combined process of hc o3 with the total treatment cost of 0 15 usd m3 followed by sole o3 0 73 usd m3 and hc uv o3 h2o2 0 99 usd m3 table 7 exp 15 14 25 it was observed that the lowest treatment costs belong to the processes with a short treatment time up to 1 min for hc o3 and uv o3 hc uv o3 h2o2 up to 5 min in case of cost evaluation for the highest concentration of bcb dye 20 and 50 ppm the lowest treatment costs belong to the combined process of hc uv o3 h2o2 0 99 and 5 95 usd m3 table 7 exp 25 47 the efficiency of combined processes of hydrodynamic cavitation and aops also was expressed in terms of electrical energy per order eeo it was calculated for the most effective processes to give an insight into the significance of usage of hydrodynamic cavitation electrical energy per order eeo is a parameter that describes the amount of electrical energy needed to decline the concentration of pollutants by one order of magnitude 90 reduction in a unit of volume water 64 65 the equation used to determine electrical energy per order eeo is the same equation reported by asaithambi et al 66 where he determined the removal of the organic pollutant from industrial wastewater using the uv fe2 h2o2 process and he determined the electrical energy per order for processes applied in wastewater treatment the evaluation of eeo was limited to processes that attained 100 degradation of bcb this analysis revealed that the lowest electrical energy per order eeo was obtained for the combined process of hc o3 with a value of 0 03 kwh m 3 order 1 meanwhile eeo for the process of sole ozonation was 0 74 kwh m 3 order 1 these results are followed then by the combined process of hc uv o3 h2o2 0 75 kwh m 3 order 1 and sole process of uv o3 h2o2 3 01 kwh m 3 order 1 higher eeo values were obtained with an increase in the concentration of bcb from 5 mg l hc o3 0 03 kwh m 3 order 1 to 20 mg l hc o3 6 70 kwh m 3 order 1 this can be explained by the fact that with an increase in the concentration of dye more time is needed to completely degrade the bcb as a result more energy is required in the system effectiveness of hydrodynamic cavitation is once more reinforced by comparing eeo for the processes as mentioned above and it can be understood that by using hc eeo was strongly declined comparing sole processes to hydrodynamic cavitation based combined processes evaluated results of electrical energy per order are presented in the table 7 exp 14 15 22 23 24 25 38 40 41 therefore it can be concluded that amount of energy needed for wastewater treatment by hydrodynamic cavitation aided aops is less than sole hybrid aop processes contributing thus to the cost effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes 5 conclusions these studies revealed that the combined process of hydrodynamic cavitation and ozone hc o3 may be considered as a very effective method in the degradation of bcb dye containing effluents broadly explained our findings indicate that under optimal parameters such as cv 0 27 inlet pressure 1 70 bar the sole process of hydrodynamic cavitation provided only 10 bcb degradation in 180 min treatment time meanwhile the addition of ozone increased degradation of dye to 100 in only 1 min of treatment time the synergistic coefficient of 1 84 for the combined process of hc o3 indicated the high effectiveness of both methods as a successful attempt which led to total dye degradation additionally the rate of bcb degradation for the combined process of hc o3 is almost twice the added values of independent processes despite the highest degradation achieved the time of treatment is also the shortest compared to other processes finally this rapid process revealed to be the cheapest one with a treatment cost of 0 15 usd m3 calculated for degradation efficiency of 100 in treatment time of 1 min these results appear to be consistent with comparison performed for studied processes in terms of electrical energy per order eeo where once more it was proved the effectiveness of combined processes of hc and other external oxidants a significant difference between eeo for sole ozone 0 74 kwh m 3 order 1 and combined process of hc o3 0 03 kwh m 3 order 1 reinforce the finding that the use of hydrodynamic cavitation and ozone lower the treatment time and consequently the cost of treatment rapid degradation of the target pollutant in the present study allows performing the treatment on line without the need for high volume tanks due to short retention time needed finally low costs of treatment make the developed method ideal for implementation in real industrial practice credit authorship contribution statement elvana cako

for industrial practice graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrodynamic cavitation advanced oxidation processes aops hydroxyl radicals persulfate photooxidation 1 introduction the discharge of wastewaters containing organic dyes into aquatic environments causes serious health and environmental issues 1 3 brilliant cresyl blue bcb is an oxazine dye and it is widely used in the textile printing industries as well as a tracer within the red blood cells to determine the rna stain 4 studies have shown that bcb is classified considered as a carcinogenic toxic and mutagenic compound even a low concentration of this dye has adverse effects on the environment 5 for commercial purposes more than 10 thousand varieties of synthetic dyes are produced and available on the market worldwide moreover the usage of synthetic dyes exceeds 70 thousand tonnes per year and approximately 20 of the dyes are released into the wastewater after the dyeing process 6 7 these wastewaters contain high amounts of suspended particles and intense colour with high ph and are varied in the residual chemical oxygen demand cod the high value of total organic carbon toc and often are discharged directly into the environment 8 9 hence it is essential to treat such effluents and prevent their discharge into freshwater sources considering the damage to the aquatic environment caused by the wastewater discharged by textile dyeing industries it is necessary to develop an environmentally friendly and energy efficient technique to treat the textile effluent before being discharged into the aquatic environment 10 11 over the past few years several conventional techniques consisting of different combinations of physical chemical and biological oxidation processes have been developed for the treatment of textile effluent these treatment processes however produce large amounts of secondary pollutants which are even more carcinogenic than the parent compound recently many researchers have used hydrodynamic cavitation hc one of the advanced oxidation processes aops to treat wastewater as a versatile hybrid aops 12 15 during the hc a substantial pressure change occurs when an aqueous solution passes through cavitating devices such as orifice or venturi due to the alteration in the fluid flow path 16 17 cavitation phenomenon involves nucleation growth and subsequent collapse of as generated microbubbles or cavities that occur at short time intervals at multiple reactor locations and thus release large amounts of energy a sudden collapse of the cavities creates a hot spot high localized temperatures 5000 10 000 k and pressures 500 atm resulting in the formation of ho h ho2 and h2o2 18 as generated radicals non selective reactive species are capable of oxidizing organic substances within the cavitating devices and help to mineralize the target compounds 19 21 however it has been reported in many studies that hc alone can not provide the necessary removal of organic pollutants present in the treated aqueous phase as a hybrid aop which results in significantly higher degradation in a shorter time of treatment it is therefore often combined with other processes such as the addition of a photocatalyst fenton reagent h2o2 ozone etc many literature studies have been reported for the treatment of dyes applying individually operated aops such as photocatalysis and fenton reaction as well as combined treatment schemes such as sonoelectrochemical oxidation sonophotocatalytic degradation hydrodynamic acoustic cavitation hac and combined hydrodynamic cavitation hydrogen peroxide hc h2o2 approach the removal efficiency of acid red 88 was investigated using different approaches based on hydrodynamic cavitation 22 using hc and combined approach of hc h2o2 it was reported that the removal extent of acid red 88 stands at 92 and 99 within 120 min under the optimized parameters of 4000 μm addition of 30 h2o2 the combined operation of hc h2o2 100 μm with fe tio2 1 8 g l resulted in the complete decolorization of the effluent removal efficiency of 100 the aforementioned study reported that the degradation rate was enhanced by 45 60 for the combination of hc h2o2 with the addition of an appropriate catalyst a novel approach to utilizing hydrogel adsorbent and hc was investigated for the degradation of crystal violet dye as a result of which 73 toc removal was obtained within 90 min under optimized operational conditions the observed synergistic index was 1 53 as compared to the addition of individual treatment processes 23 the removal of rhodamine b dye in the presence of hc assisted hydrogel nanocomposite adsorption was also studied according to the results the decolorization efficiency of 65 was obtained under optimized operating conditions such as ph 7 62 0 5 g clay loaded nanocomposite hydrogel and 25 g hydrogel loading in the adsorption column the greater extent of the degradation was observed with the addition of h2o2 to the hybrid system which increased the degradation of rh b dye to 72 85 with toc removal of 45 24 in another study researchers focused their attention on the oxidation of reactive red 4 using an improved hybrid process with a combination of hc h2o2 and ozone it was reported that almost 99 of the degradation was achieved within 5 min in comparison with the other processes 25 among the application of ho h ho2 as oxidizing species to remove organic pollutants recently sulfate radical so 4 sulfate radical so 4 is considered as an alternative to ho radical due to their high oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 ev which is capable of destroying various persistent pollutants such as organic dyes since sulfate radical so 4 has a longer lifetime 3 4 10 5 s than ho radical 2 10 8 s their usefulness is already proved in the literature 26 two oxidants such as persulfate s 2 o 8 2 and peroxymonosulfate hso 5 are the sources of so 4 which can be activated using various activators including catalysts uv base and heat sulfate radicals attack hydro peroxide o o bond by homolytic or heterolytic cleavage and they can transform from to hydroxyl radicals ho 27 therefore the role of so 4 radicals in the degradation of bcb was investigated thermal activation 20 c 50 c and the effect of concentration 0 1 m 0 5 m 1 0 m of ps in model solution was studied the literature analysis revealed that there are many studies reported using aops for degrading different types of dyes but no studies are reported based on a combination of hc with other aops such as h2o2 ozone and uv treatment for the oxidation of bcb the present work is aimed at defining possible enhancement in the oxidation of bcb by using hc in the presence of various oxidants such as h2o2 ozone and persulfate the synergistic effect of various parameters on the oxidation of dye by different combined processes such as hc h2o2 hc ozone hc ps hc h2o2 ozone hc uv and hc uv h2o2 was assessed 2 experimental

the experiments was 180 min and the aliquots were taken for the analysis at regular time intervals the effect of the cavitation number on decolorization and cod removal was initially investigated by varying the pressure in the range of 3 10 bar to study the effectiveness of the hybrid processes based on hc oxidative reagents such as ozone hydrogen peroxide and sodium peroxydisulfate were added to the reactor hc in combination with hydrogen peroxide and ps experiments was conducted at a different feed rate for hydrogen peroxide and ps to find the influence of the oxidants the oxidants ozone hydrogen peroxide and ps were directly injected through the nozzle into the throat of the venturi slit thus directly exposing to the cavitational effect different types of scavengers were used to examine the combined effect of the oxidants and cavitation on decolorization and cod removal 2 3 hydrodynamic cavitation set up the schematic representation of the hc system is illustrated in fig 1

measured for the wavelength of 625 nm corresponded to the maximum absorption wavelength of bcb dye the degradation efficiency decolorization efficiency was calculated through the following eq 1 1 degradation ci cf ci 100 where ci and cf were concentrations calculated based on absorbance values for the dye solutions before and after the treatment processes respectively the cod of the solution was measured with a standard cuvette test method using a hach cod reactor and a hach dr 2010 spectrophotometer 28 29 the effect of scavengers at a set time interval was determined with the rp hplc equipped with a c18 column of dimensions 4 6 150 mm obtained from agilent technologies usa and a uv detector to detect the presence of intermediate by products generated during the degradation of bcb the process samples were analysed with the hplc uv dad technique the mobile phase applied in rp hplc determination consists of acetonitrile water mixture 20 80 v v with flow rate maintained at 1 ml min all the experiments were repeated twice and the average values of two runs with an experimental error of 3 were reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishing optimal parameters for hc processes 3 1 1 effect of the cavitation number on dye degradation the cavitation number describes the intensity of cavitation in hydraulic devices it is given as a ratio of the difference between the recovered downstream pressure of the throat and the vapor pressure of the liquid over the linear velocity of the fluid at the throat 30 it is expressed as follows eq 2 2 c v p 2 p v 1 2 ρ ν 0 2 where p2 downstream pressure pa pv water vapor pressure at 20 c pa ρ density of the pumped medium at 20 c kg m ν linear velocity at the throat of venturi tube m s the optimal values depending on the system are in the range of 0 1 the cavitation number is a crucial parameter that directly influences the efficacy of the hc in dye degradation the interdependence between cavitation number and degradation rate was investigated experiments were conducted for different cavitation number values cv 0 14 0 27 0 5 0 9 1 2 it was observed that the highest degradation efficiency was obtained for cv 0 27 with the inlet pressure of 1 70 bar and the outlet pressure of 1 20 bar as the inlet pressure rises the cavitation number declines thus resulting in a greater amount of reactive hydroxyl radicals ho that react with the dye molecules at the same time the flow rate of the solution will be higher and consequently followed by an increased number of venturi passes 31 as a result a strong interaction between free reactive radicals ho and dye molecules occurs 32 hence increased degradation efficiency was observed for cv 0 27 10 fig 2 a for lower values of cv 0 14 degradation efficiency was 5 and for higher values of cv 1 2 degradation efficiency was 2 this leads to a conclusion that at a lower cv 0 14 a cloudy cavity is formed and the interacting surface between the dye molecules and ho is too small to decompose dye molecules while at higher cv values 1 2 number of ho formed is not sufficient to attack and decompose the target molecules therefore all the experiments were performed at an optimum cavitation number of 0 27 inlet pressure 1 70 bar and outlet pressure 1 20 bar flow rate 338 l h the velocity at the throat of venturi 31 m s and temperature maintained at 20 c information about the relationship between the parameters and cavitation number can be found in table 1 the number of passes is expressed as follows eq 3 33 3 number of passes flow rate l min v l t min this parameter will be used in further discussion to understand the effectiveness of cavitation based processes fully low cavitation numbers i e the high linear velocity of the liquid results in a maximized number of passes of the treated media via the cavitation zone 3 1 2 effect of ph on the degradation of bcb the ph value plays a significant role in the degradation of the dye solution hereby during the optimization of process parameters studies of ph effect on bcb degradation were considered indispensable since this factor influences the physicochemical properties of the dye molecules in the solution experiments were conducted in the ph range of 2 10 the results obtained indicate that the highest degradation efficiency was obtained for solutions of ph 3 0 and ph 10 0 fig 2b approximately 99 5 of bcb was degraded at a solution ph of 10 0 and 99 8 at a solution ph of 3 0 within the treatment time of 180 min using sole hc cv 0 27 meanwhile if we compare degradation efficiency in 1 min of treatment time 87 89 degradation corresponds to solution ph of 10 0 and 49 35 degradation corresponds to solution ph of 3 0 i e basic circumstances were favorable for the degradation of bcb the lowest degradation efficiency of 12 58 was obtained in the ph range 6 7 details of bcb degradation at different ph values and rate constants are provided in table 2 a rise in the reaction rate constant from 1 10 2 min 1 to 2 3 10 2 min 1 was obtained when the solution ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 respectively the extent of degradation may occur because of the generation of ho increases with an increase in ph media and this accompanied by higher oxidation potential of ho 2 8v which leads to a higher degradation of bcb meanwhile the studies also revealed an increase in the degradation of bcb for ph 3 compared to a neutral ph this fact can be explained by a low ability of hydroxyl radicals ho to be recombined in acidic ph therefore more ho are disposable in solution and can directly react with pollutant molecules thus resulting in degradation efficiency of 98 81 in 180 min a similar effect has been observed by gore et al 25 the results obtained indicate that both acidic and alkaline media enhance the degradation of bcb concerning a neutral ph however basic ph is favored since the degradation takes place in only 1 min treatment for hc as a sole treatment process phenoxazine groups of dye such as bcb and nile blue are stable at different ph media 4 therefore degradation of bcb is attributed to the combined effect of acid basic ph and cavitation conditions related to generation of radical species blank experiments of ph effect on bcb without treatment were conducted to check if ph conditions affect the decolorization of bcb after 180 min incubation of samples at ph 3 ph 7 and ph 10 no change was observed in model samples of bcb blank experiments were conducted also to evaluate the role of temperature on bcb degradation two different temperatures were selected 20 c and 50 c and after 180 min incubation no decolorization was observed selection of the ph for real wastewater treatment scenario will depend on the type of effluents and their native ph as well as the possibility of their mixing with other effluents having strongly acidic or basic ph this way the utilization of external chemicals for ph correction can be minimized thereby lowering the costs of the treatment process 3 2 effectiveness of ozone as a sole process and in combination with hc for bcb degradation ozone is a powerful oxidant having a high oxidation potential 2 08 ev it was used to enhance the degradation of pollutant molecules in the aqueous medium ozone can degrade a variety of organic contaminants whose molecules contain unsaturated bonds such as cc nn and cn 14 cavitation devices ceaselessly generate free reactive radicals which intensively interact with pollutant molecules contributing thus in higher degradation rates of contaminants present in wastewater 34 in order to intensify the degradation of bcb dye a combination of hc and ozone was studied in the present work an enhanced mass transfer of ozone molecules from the gas phase to model solution occurs during the combination of hc with ozone gas where an immediate degradation of dye molecules takes place within the treatment time of 1 min under hc conditions ozone molecules are readily transformed into atomic and molecular oxygen o2 which undergoes in reaction with water molecules to produce superoxide o 2 and ho radicals 35 the reactions that take place are presented in the following eqs 4 11 25 35 38 4 h 2 o hc ho h e e o 2 8 v 5 o 3 h c 2 h 2 e o 2 h 2 o e o 2 08 v 6 o 3 h c o 2 o p 3 7 h 2 o hc ho h 8 o p 3 h 2 o 2 h o 9 h o o 2 o h o 2 1 10 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 11 o 2 b c b deg r a d a t i o n b y p r o d u c t s c o 2 h 2 o in case of ozone based processes it is important to evaluate what is the effectiveness of ozone uptake from the injected gas by the processed liquid a preliminary studies revealed that 15 min are needed to saturate the processed liquid with ozone and that ozone is absorbed quantitatively in the aqueous phase during first 15 min of the barbotage after this time period ozone starts to be detect at the reactor s gas outlet since 100 degradation for hc o3 and sole ozone was achieved respectively in 1 min and 5 min treatment time it is considered that total amount of ozone introduced in the inlet gas was available for treatment process it can be inferred that the degradation of bcb was 10 using hc as a sole process in 180 min and 100 degradation was attained in 5 min with the sole use of ozonation rox 1 03 it was also possible to achieve 100 degradation in only 1 min by combining hc with ozone rox 0 27 fig 3 a a synergistic effect was obtained for the combined process with a respective synergistic coefficient of 1 84 the removal efficiency was also confirmed by the cod analysis results which showed degradation efficiency of 94 by the sole ozonation process and degradation efficiency of 97 for the combined process of hc o3 table 3 exp 13 14 15 the synergetic coefficient that examines the efficiency of the combined method is expressed in the following equation eq 12 12 s k h c o 3 k h c k o 3 k h c o 3 is the rate constant of the combined process of hc and ozone k h c is the rate constant of sole hc process and k o 3 is the rate constant of the sole ozonation process the degradation of reactive orange 4 ro4 by the hc based hybrid treatment techniques have also been studied by other researchers 25 they reported that the combination of hc with ozone at an optimum feed rate of 3 g h resulted in the toc removal efficiency of 76 25 during the treatment time of 60 min studies of rhodamine 6g degradation with the hybrid process of hc ozone were conducted by rajoriya et al 35 they similarly reported the decolorization efficiency of 100 in 5 10 min toc removal of 84 using hc ozone process 3 g h in 120 min conclusively the results of the present study showed a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the treatment process at a much shorter required treatment time in comparison with the already reported data regarding the combined process of hc o 3 3 3 effect of hc coupled with h2o2 on dye degradation the effect of h2o2 with a particular dosage in combination with hc was investigated h2o2 as an oxidant with the oxidation potential of 1 78 ev under optimum cavitation conditions can be dissociated giving rise of a number of ho radicals 39 the sufficient amount of energy needed for the dissociation of h2o2 will be produced from the cavitation phenomena because during cavitation a sufficient amount of energy is created to dissociate the o o bond 213 kj mol in h2o2 and o h bond 418 kj mol of h2o therefore a rise in the amount of ho generated from h2o2 in combination with hc will lead to the degradation of dye molecules as well as other organic pollutants 13 25 39 40 the reactions taking place are described below eqs 13 20 39 41 13 h 2 o 2 hc 2 ho 14 h 2 o hc h ho 15 ho ho hc h 2 o 2 16 ho h 2 o 2 hc oh 2 h 2 o 17 ho oh 2 hc h 2 o o 2 18 o h 2 h 2 o 2 ho h 2 o o 2 19 bcb oh 2 co 2 h 2 o other intermediates 20 bcb h 2 o 2 co 2 h 2 o other intermediates we observed that most of the mineralization using the hybrid process of hc h2o2 occurs in the first 60 min for the sole h2o2 process the degradation efficiency of only 35 74 was obtained for the treatment of 5 mg l dye while the degradation efficiency of 74 15 was achieved for the combined process of hc h2o2 fig 3b thus a significant speed up of the degradation was observed in the first 60 min the synergistic coefficient of 1 07 obtained in a combination of hc and h2o2 proved the effectiveness of hc in making h2o2 more suitable for the degradation of organic pollutants this is due to the high number of ho generated by the dissociation of h2o2 in the presence of hc leading to higher degradation efficiency of bcb compared to that obtained for the sole h2o2 process overall the degradation effectiveness in both processes sole h2o2 rox 8 31 and hc h2o2 rox 8 31 was high and reached 90 49 and 96 49 after 180 min respectively table 3 16 17 the effectiveness of the combined method of hc h2o2 was also reported by other researchers in the degradation of different dyes such as methylene blue methyl orange and rhodamine b 42 43 3 4 effect of the combination of hc with uv irradiation on bcb degradation the combination of hc with uv light irradiation was also investigated in this study a slight increase in the degradation rate of bcb was observed when the combined process of hc uv 34 was used instead of the photolysis alone 22 both experiments were performed for 180 min at 20 c with a rate constant of 1 4 10 3 min 1 for the sole uv process and 1 9 10 3 min 1 for hc aided with uv as generated ho in the combined process of hc uv eventually sped up the degradation rate of the target pollutants compared to individual approaches cavitation phenomena and photolysis of water molecules enhanced the generation rate of oxidizing species consequently giving rise to the degradation of contaminant molecules 44 the results of cod analysis exhibited the degradation efficiency of 19 for the sole uv and 26 for the combined process of hc uv the synergistic coefficient was 0 9 and this shows that there is no additional efficacy for the combination of both methods table 3 exp 18 19 3 5 dye degradation kinetics during the degradation studies under the cavitation effect the concentration of ho radicals was found to be continuous extremely reactive and non selective so its concentration impact can be neglected the kinetic analysis reveals that the degradation of bcb dye with hc fits into the pseudo first order kinetic model it was observed that the pseudo first order rate constant increases from 1 3 10 2 to 9 3 10 2 min 1 when aops are combined with hc under cavitation conditions the degradation occurs due to pyrolytic decomposition of the dye molecules inside the bubble as a result contaminant molecules are converted to low toxic substances and even non toxic compounds 31 the reaction rate constant determination is expressed in the following eqs 21 and 22 45 21 c c 0 e k t 22 k ln c c 0 t 3 6 effectiveness of hc based aops aops assisted hc process hc based aops provide efficient degradation of wastewater pollutants thus synergistic coefficient values are higher for hc based aops compared to sole aops processes 25 in this study aops such as the ozonation process uv oxidation and h2o2 oxidation were combined with hc for better degradation efficiency of bcb additionally contributing to the reduction of treatment costs reactions that take place are exhibited in the following equations eqs 23 25 34 23 o 3 u v o 3 h ν h 2 o 2 h o o 2 24 uv h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 h ν 2 ho 25 o 3 uv h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 o 3 h 2 o h ν 4 ho o 2 several experiments were performed to study the effect of the combination of hc with aops as hybrid treatment methods the best processes appeared to be the combined treatment process of hc uv o3 which resulted in the degradation efficiency of 100 in 5 min and a synergistic coefficient of 3 42 rox 1 34 and followed then by the combined process of hc uv o3 h2o2 with degradation efficiency of 100 in 5 min and a corresponding synergistic coefficient of 1 85 rox 2 26 the degradation efficiency of the hybrid process of h2o2 uv was increased from 93 98 for the sole process rox 8 31 to 100 for the combined process of hc h2o2 uv rox 5 54 in 180 min treatment time with a synergistic coefficient of 5 91 fig 4 a b c the cod removal for processes of hc uv o3 hc uv o3 h2o2 and hc h2o2 uv resulted in being 98 99 and 97 respectively the synergistic coefficients of 3 42 1 85 and 5 91 for the processes as mentioned earlier confirmed the effectiveness of hc assisted aops for the decolorization and mineralization of bcb contained liquid phase table 3 exp 27 25 21 3 7 effect of concentration and temperature of persulfate in the degradation of bcb dye in the present study two pairs of experiments were conducted where the effects of ps concentration and temperature of the ps assisted treatment process in the degradation of bcb were studied for this purpose three concentrations of ps 0 1 m 0 5 m 1 0 m together with two different temperatures 20 c and 50 c were selected in the first set of experiments the temperature was kept constant at 20 c and the effect of hc combined with ps for the three concentrations 0 1 m 0 5 m 1 0 m on dye degradation was investigated table 3 exp 28 33 we found that as the concentration increases degradation efficiency increases too the highest of the achieved degradation corresponds to hc ps 1 0 m rox 3 36 with 98 47 within the treatment of 180 min fig 5 for the second pair of experiments the concentration of 1 0 m ps was selected as a fixed parameter since the highest degradation was obtained for ps 1 0 m and the effect of the temperature was investigated in the degradation of bcb for the hc ps process at 20 c hc contributes to the degradation of bcb increasing from 51 36 sole ps rox 3 36 to 98 47 hc ps rox 3 36 on the other hand when ps 1 0 m is activated by heat at the temperature of 50 c hc gives attribute in treatment time which is reduced from 180 sole ps rox 1 12 to 60 min hc ps rox 1 12 degradation values varied from 84 36 to 98 61 respectively fig 6 the amount of cod removed confirmed the extent of dye mineralization table 3 exp 32 35 it is clear that in this case the application of ps as an oxidant is not justified since less expensive oxidants h 2 o 2 as well as o 3 provide much higher effectiveness 3 8 effect of the initial concentration of bcb on its degradation efficiency the initial concentration of dye has a significant impact on the degradation rate this study revealed a remarkable decrement in degradation rate as the initial concentration of dye increases wang et al 43 studied the degradation of rhodamine b by swirling jet elicited cavitation and they stated that with the increase of concentration from 10 mg l to 50 mg l degradation was decreased from 98 9 to 63 4 in 180 min thakare et al 46 claimed that as the concentration of brilliant green increased from 10 to 30 mg l its degradation efficiency decreased from 27 92 to 17 34 the presented results go along closely with results already stated in other researches of dye removal such as reactive red x 3d 47 and acid orange 7 ao7 48 in the present study it was observed that with an increase in bcb concentration from 5 to 20 and 50 mg l a substantial decrease in degradation was obtained comparing the same time of treatment the influence of concentration on the degradation rate of bcb is compiled in table 4 during bcb treatment by the sole hc process degradation decreased from 10 0 to 4 14 when the initial concentration of bcb increased from 5 to 50 mg l respectively table 4 exp 13 42 the most effective process for degradation of 5 mg l dye was considered hc combined with ozone rox 0 27 where degradation efficiency of 100 was achieved in short reaction time of 1 min table 4 exp 15 meanwhile complete degradation of 20 mg l was achieved in 15 min rox 1 01 and 99 8 degradation of 50 mg l bcb was achieved in treatment time of 60 min rox 1 21 table 4 exp 38 44 the most effective process for the highest degradation of bcb 20 and 50 mg l was the hybrid process of hc uv o3 h2o2 where the degradation efficiency of 100 was achieved in only 5 min rox 0 57 whereas 99 73 degradation for 50 mg l bcb was achieved within 30 min of treatment rox 1 36 table 4 exp 41 47 fig 7 a b in the case of hc processes assisted with the addition of external oxidants the less effective process was considered hc h2o2 where degradation efficiency of 96 5 was obtained at initial bcb concentration of 5 mg l rox 8 31 to 14 5 rox 8 34 and 3 06 rox 3 33 for 20 and 50 mg l in treatment time of 180 min respectively table 4 exp 16 39 45 fig 7c it is clear that h2o2 reacting directly or converted mainly to ho is not effective for bcb degradation a comparison of results between o3 and o3 h2o2 peroxone process revealed an interesting difference between these processes generally peroxone is a more effective aop comparing to ozonation due to the enhanced formation of reactive radicals ho thus conversion of o3 by reaction with h2o2 hc h2o2 o3 rox 3 07 to produce an increased amount of free reactive radicals was not favored making ozonation combined with hc hc o3 rox 0 27 the most effective process of this studies table 4 exp 15 23 the same trend was also observed for the higher concentration of dye such as 20 and 50 ppm table 4 exp 37 40 44 46 3 9 role of scavengers in the degradation of bcb since the dye degradation under the effect of ozone occurs in the time interval of 1 5 min ozone was considered as the most effective oxidant used for the degradation of bcb molecules to study whether the degradation of bcb takes place due to ho radicals or superoxide radicals o 2 several scavengers were used the scavengers selected for this purpose were methanol n propanol n butanol t butyl alcohol tba and p benzoquinone p bq the alcohols were used as scavengers to investigate the formation and role of ho in the dye degradation whereas p bq was used as a o 2 scavenger their role has also been investigated by other researches 49 50 since the degradation of bcb by the combined process of hc o3 occur in only 1 min therefore we compared the degradation efficiency of bcb for the first minute of each experimental run with the addition of scavengers a significant decline in the degradation efficiency occurred in the presence of p bq where the degradation efficiency decreased from 100 for hc o3 to only 11 24 for the combined process of hc o3 p bq the presence of p bq extends the treatment time to 45 min this can be explained by the presence of superoxide radicals o 2 into the model solution formed from the ozone molecule they are continuously generated thus immediate degradation of bcb in the presence of p bq was prevented by the fast reaction of superoxide radical o 2 with this scavenger table 5 exp 53 in the case of alcoholic compounds a significant decrease in the degradation of bcb takes place in the first minute of reaction in the presence of tba but within 3 min the dye faces complete degradation of 100 ozone directly reacts with tba with a relatively high reaction rate constant 104 105 s 1 51 thus the inhibition of bcb degradation is directly related to a competitive reaction of ozone with tba and lasts until most of the tba is oxidized hc o3 tba table 5 exp 48 comparing from rox values for all processes the lowest rox 0 27 1 table 3 exp 15 corresponds to the hc o3 process in which 100 degradation was achieved in 1 min this means that the excess of o3 can be converted to other radicals such as o 2 ho oh 2 which contribute to high degradation in short treatment time the reaction rate was slower with addition of p bq such that only 44 23 degradation occurred in 6 min this compound was used as a commonly known scavenger of superoxide radicals significant influence on process effectiveness suggests important role of superoxide radicals in the degradation mechanism superoxide radical promotes oxidation reaction by the nucleophile addition of o 2 into the dye molecule this nucleophile favours a cleavage of benzene ring and subsequent complete mineralization of the compound 52 combining all obtained data we propose that the radical species mainly responsible for the degradation of bcb dye are superoxide radicals o 2 but it is worth noting that ho may also be involved in the degradation of bcb dye molecules 3 10 possible degradation mechanism of bcb it is well known that the identification of by products formed during aop based treatment is a one of the important aspects in case of the development of new processes 53 thus we analysed possible pathways of degradation of target pollutant to assess the risk of formation of harmful by products the first possible degradation pathway is based on the direct attack of the ozone gas to the azo double bond of the bcb 54 resulting in nn cleavage superoxide radicals o 2 mainly attack azo bonds and this is typically reported in the degradation of azo dyes where the main reactive species responsible for dye degradation was found to be o 2 50 nevertheless presence of ho initiate n c bond cleavage 55 the cleavage of nn and c n produced the nitrosobenzene naphthalene ring with the substituent and 2 amino 4 6 dichlorotriarine 47 superoxide radical o 2 initiates cycloaddition reactions with unsaturated bonds in addition to electrophilic assault and leads to the creation of a carbonyl group co or nitroso group no compounds 56 cationic dye molecules interact with o2 ho2 or ho species to generate unstable intermediates to detect the presence of intermediate by products the process samples were analysed by hplc uv dad technique gradient elution program was used in these studies to detect any additional peaks appearing during the hc assisted degradation of bcb the analytical method used in this studies is very sensitive with detection limits for compounds having aromatic rings in their structure below 0 1 ppm thus any intermediate by products possible to be formed would be detected the studies revealed that bcb is completely degraded and there was no intermediate present in the samples the complete disappearance of peaks on the hplc chromatogram indicates the absence of any organic moiety analysis of final samples revealed that no additional compounds or by products are present in the treated medium these results confirmed the high removal efficiency of cod almost 100 the dye is a heteropolyaromatic compound having nitrogen n oxygen o zinc zn and chlorine cl atoms attached to the central aromatic ring initially ozone selectively attacks activated aromatic rings or double bonds which are both present in bcb dye owing to the elevated electronic densities on these aromatic carbons replaced with electron donor groups they are particularly reactive with ozone and the reaction will take place mainly concerning the carbon atoms situated in the ortho and para positions the electron withdrawing groups cooh no2 replaced aromatics are weakly reactive to ozone the molecular structure of bcb dye contains both electron donating groups oh nhr and electron withdrawing groups zncl2 hence ozone reactions should occur initially in certain preferential sites sites with high electronic density have been recognized and the evaluation has shown that ozone attacks are likely to occur in the azo group 57 58 the degradation pathway similarly includes the following reactions i hydroxylation reaction where deformation of c h bonds intended to the formation of small carbon chain compounds ii direct oxidation cleavage of benzene ring in bcb molecules iii cleavage of co in the hetero ring of bcb molecule 59 iv splitting of the chromophoric azo c nc bond via the direct oxidation 60 the proposed degradation pathway of bcb is illustrated in fig 8 3 11 influence of water matrix on the degradation rate of bcb dye the presence of inorganic anions affects the decolorization of dye polluted wastewater due to their specific properties nacl imposes the fiber staining by the ability to enhance the dye diffusion being therefore easily absorbed in fiber meanwhile carbonate and bicarbonate ions increase the ph media which helps in dye fiber binding assisted through the formation of covalent bonds 61 sodium sulfate helps in dye fixation in fabric because it reduces negative charges in fiber 62 inorganic anions scavenge ho and inhibit dye degradation thus these inorganic ions were studied as potential inhibitors of degradation that can be present in real wastewaters since hc o3 process was considered as the most effective process to be degradation efficiency of 100 in 1 min therefore it was seen reasonable to study the effect of the presence of co existing compounds on its effectiveness in the degradation of bcb for this purpose two different concentrations 5 and 10 mm of salts nacl na2so4 na2co3 ca no3 2 under two different ph values 7 0 and 10 0 were taken into consideration these studies revealed fig 9 that the presence of the salts as mentioned above initiates a slight decrease in the degradation of bcb dye comparison of bcb degradation results within the same group of anions concentration 10 mm under two different ph 7 0 and 10 0 revealed that the lowest degradation was obtained in the presence of sulfate and carbonate anions with 91 and 92 degradation in the first minute of treatment meanwhile complete degradation was achieved within 5 min of treatment time 100 of degradation was achieved in 5 min of treatment time carbonate anion reacts with hydroxyl radical resulting in the formation of carbonate radical it is a very selective and strong one electron oxidant competing therefore with hydroxyl radicals and scavenging them 61 in a higher concentration of carbonates present in aqueous media the scavenging effect is more visible 61 the same effect was also observed for a lower concentration of anions 5 mm where the lowest degradation of bcb still was obtained in the presence of sulfate and carbonate anions with degradation efficiency of 92 6 and 94 respectively the maximum degradation of 100 was achieved in 5 and 4 min of treatment in the presence of sulfate and carbonate anions respectively as it corresponds to the effect of other anions their inhibition effect was small and comparable in between them and degradation values varied from 95 to 99 8 for nitrate 10 mm nitrate at initial ph of 10 0 in the first minute of treatment time but it is worth mentioning that removal efficiency of 100 was obtained in only 5 min treatment time the fastest time to achieve 100 in the presence of anions was 2 and 3 min in case of chloride ph 7 0 10 mm and 5 mm and nitrate 5 mm ph 10 0 and ph 7 0 anions respectively further experimental results of the effect of anions on the degradation of bcb dye are compiled in table 6 results were compared with the experimental value found in table 3 exp15 for hc o3 in which the degradation efficiency of 100 was achieved within the short treatment time of 1 min it can be seen that sulfates and carbonates exhibited the most suppressive effect among the studied anions from experimental observations we found out that as the concentration of anion increases degradation of dye slightly decreased this effect is even more enforced in basic ph conditions herewith the treatment process of hc o3 can be considered as a promising process for the degradation of organic pollutants such as organic dyes in real industrial wastewaters containing several co existing inorganic compounds moreover it can be implemented in future studies for treating saline wastewaters containing a high value of tds 4 economic assessment treatment costs of the model solution containing bcb dye treated by the hc process combined with aops were estimated the analysis was performed using the same methodology as in the previous study of our research team 63 the compilation is provided in table 7 they were calculated considering such factors as treatment time cost of oxidants and cost of electric energy the hc system uses the power of 1100 w and the ozone generator uses the power of 380 w the cost of electricity in 2019 for industrial customers in poland is 0 164 us dollars usd per 1 kwh 3600 kj the cost of treatment was first estimated for each 6 l batch volume of experiments and then it was recalculated to 1 m3 model solution treatment two alternative options for the treatment process were analysed higher degradation of the bcb dye takes 0 5 m place at basic ph conditions for the sole use of the hc process with degradation efficiency of 99 5 in treatment time of 180 min table 2 exp 12 in this case the cost of treatment of one cubic meter of effluents containing 5 mg l of bcb dye was estimated at 15 03 usd in the case of real effluents having a primary basic ph the hc should be a process of the first choice the second option relates to the treatment of effluents containing bcb dye at neutral ph conditions correction of ph to basic conditions to perform the treatment and further back correction to neutral ph for effluent discharge could be not reasonable from the practical point of view from the aspect of cost estimation both experiments share the same cost of treatment of 15 03 usd table 7 exp 13 12 the most economical approach for the degradation of bcb dye by the hc based aops turned out to be the combined process of hc o3 with the total treatment cost of 0 15 usd m3 followed by sole o3 0 73 usd m3 and hc uv o3 h2o2 0 99 usd m3 table 7 exp 15 14 25 it was observed that the lowest treatment costs belong to the processes with a short treatment time up to 1 min for hc o3 and uv o3 hc uv o3 h2o2 up to 5 min in case of cost evaluation for the highest concentration of bcb dye 20 and 50 ppm the lowest treatment costs belong to the combined process of hc uv o3 h2o2 0 99 and 5 95 usd m3 table 7 exp 25 47 the efficiency of combined processes of hydrodynamic cavitation and aops also was expressed in terms of electrical energy per order eeo it was calculated for the most effective processes to give an insight into the significance of usage of hydrodynamic cavitation electrical energy per order eeo is a parameter that describes the amount of electrical energy needed to decline the concentration of pollutants by one order of magnitude 90 reduction in a unit of volume water 64 65 the equation used to determine electrical energy per order eeo is the same equation reported by asaithambi et al 66 where he determined the removal of the organic pollutant from industrial wastewater using the uv fe2 h2o2 process and he determined the electrical energy per order for processes applied in wastewater treatment the evaluation of eeo was limited to processes that attained 100 degradation of bcb this analysis revealed that the lowest electrical energy per order eeo was obtained for the combined process of hc o3 with a value of 0 03 kwh m 3 order 1 meanwhile eeo for the process of sole ozonation was 0 74 kwh m 3 order 1 these results are followed then by the combined process of hc uv o3 h2o2 0 75 kwh m 3 order 1 and sole process of uv o3 h2o2 3 01 kwh m 3 order 1 higher eeo values were obtained with an increase in the concentration of bcb from 5 mg l hc o3 0 03 kwh m 3 order 1 to 20 mg l hc o3 6 70 kwh m 3 order 1 this can be explained by the fact that with an increase in the concentration of dye more time is needed to completely degrade the bcb as a result more energy is required in the system effectiveness of hydrodynamic cavitation is once more reinforced by comparing eeo for the processes as mentioned above and it can be understood that by using hc eeo was strongly declined comparing sole processes to hydrodynamic cavitation based combined processes evaluated results of electrical energy per order are presented in the table 7 exp 14 15 22 23 24 25 38 40 41 therefore it can be concluded that amount of energy needed for wastewater treatment by hydrodynamic cavitation aided aops is less than sole hybrid aop processes contributing thus to the cost effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes 5 conclusions these studies revealed that the combined process of hydrodynamic cavitation and ozone hc o3 may be considered as a very effective method in the degradation of bcb dye containing effluents broadly explained our findings indicate that under optimal parameters such as cv 0 27 inlet pressure 1 70 bar the sole process of hydrodynamic cavitation provided only 10 bcb degradation in 180 min treatment time meanwhile the addition of ozone increased degradation of dye to 100 in only 1 min of treatment time the synergistic coefficient of 1 84 for the combined process of hc o3 indicated the high effectiveness of both methods as a successful attempt which led to total dye degradation additionally the rate of bcb degradation for the combined process of hc o3 is almost twice the added values of independent processes despite the highest degradation achieved the time of treatment is also the shortest compared to other processes finally this rapid process revealed to be the cheapest one with a treatment cost of 0 15 usd m3 calculated for degradation efficiency of 100 in treatment time of 1 min these results appear to be consistent with comparison performed for studied processes in terms of electrical energy per order eeo where once more it was proved the effectiveness of combined processes of hc and other external oxidants a significant difference between eeo for sole ozone 0 74 kwh m 3 order 1 and combined process of hc o3 0 03 kwh m 3 order 1 reinforce the finding that the use of hydrodynamic cavitation and ozone lower the treatment time and consequently the cost of treatment rapid degradation of the target pollutant in the present study allows performing the treatment on line without the need for high volume tanks due to short retention time needed finally low costs of treatment make the developed method ideal for implementation in real industrial practice credit authorship contribution statement elvana cako
