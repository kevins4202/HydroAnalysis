6970,a particle tracking algorithm was developed to simulate colloid transport subject to wall effects on diffusion as well as colloid surface attachment as described by dlvo kinetics the effects of spatially variable fracture surface potential which contributed to spatially variable attachment strength affecting colloid transport were investigated the fracture surface potential was assumed to be either positively neutrally zero or negatively correlated with the lognormally distributed local fracture aperture described with a mean variance and isotropic correlation length the results from several model simulations indicated that wall effects were negligible for the synthetic fractures studied here when fracture surface potential was negatively correlated with local aperture colloids were preferentially transported through the fracture because they tended to enter high flow large aperture regions where they underwent less attachment have the largest first moment measured upon exit of the first colloid from the fracture the variance second moment increased for flowing colloids when comparing negatively to zero and then positively correlated surface potentials to fracture apertures because spreading notably increased when suspended colloids were temporarily attached onto fracture surfaces for colloids attached onto fracture surfaces both first and second moments decreased from negatively to neutrally zero to positively correlated surface potentials to apertures this is an intuitive result consistent with fewer colloids attaching along the larger aperture preferential flow paths keywords colloid transport particle tracking wall effects on diffusion dlvo attachment 1 introduction studying the physicochemical behavior of colloids in variable aperture fractures is an important aspect in characterizing their transport therein berkowitz 2002 zhang et al 2012 the spatial moments of these colloids are integral to understanding co transport of hazardous materials in subsurface environments for example radioactive wastes are stored in fractured rock systems bossart et al 2001 kickmaier et al 2000 mckenna and james 2007 nrc 1999 numo 2004 in geologic formations with low matrix permeability the primary conduit for fluid flow is through fractures cardenas et al 2007 therefore fractures and the presence of colloids within a saturated fracture system may enhance the transport of low solubility sorptive contaminants james et al 2005 colloids range in size from 10 3 to 10 μm in diameter and can be fine particles of minerals biocolloids viruses bacteria and organic macromolecules elimelech et al 1995 fine particles of minerals are commonly found in groundwater due to well drilling or the introduction of cementing agents in fractured media colloids are typically formed by microerosion of matrix minerals and can be generated by formation crushing associated with tectonic activity drever 1985 colloids can also move through groundwater systems faster than conservative solutes due in part to their low diffusivity preventing them from flowing into regions with low velocities bales et al 1989 because colloids have a large surface area to volume ratio sorbing contaminants are afforded the opportunity to migrate with these particles ouyang et al 1996 in addition if the colloid is assumed to travel at the flow speed at its centroid the physical size of the colloid prohibits it from sampling the slowest moving portions of the velocity profile nearest the wall stoll et al 2017 to fully understand generalized colloid transport in water saturated fractures attachment dynamics and wall effects in a variable aperture fracture must be considered generating multiple fracture realizations facilitates a quantitative understanding of the flow and transport of these particles while assessing uncertainty in this study fracture apertures were assigned according to a lognormally distributed and spatially correlated random field using statistical measurements from a real fracture wang and cardenas 2014 colloid wall effects were first considered then fracture aperture and fracture surface potential were randomly varied for each fracture realization ultimately colloid transport through variable aperture fractures subject to attachment was simulated 2 model development 2 1 variable aperture fracture generation a fractured welded rhyolitic tuff 12 15 4 cm3 from the santana formation in trans pecos texas usa was examined by x ray computed tomography to measure the aperture at approximately 0 23 mm horizontal resolution cardenas et al 2007 these aperture data were supplied to the variogram estimation and spatial prediction plus error vesper program a variogram and kriging modeling software to estimate the statistical parameters describing aperture variability minasny et al 1999 the modified fracture aperture data comprising 240 400 rows of x m y m and b aperture m were input to vesper to determine the aperture mean 0 46 mm variance 0 25 mm2 and isotropic correlation length 12 mm fit with a spherical variogram these parameters were used to generate 100 realizations of aperture fields for 4 m long by 2 m wide 3d fractures using the code sprt2d gutjahr 1989 which uses a fast fourier transform method grid cells were 1 1 mm2 fig 1 is an example color plot of the 8 million fracture apertures generated with sprt2d 2 2 flow field calculation because the ratios of fracture length and width to aperture were so large a quasi 3d assumption was made meaning that advective flows perpendicular to the fracture were implemented through z coordinate scaling as a colloid transitioned from one model cell with a given fracture aperture to another with a different aperture james and chrysikopoulos 2000 of course diffusion in the z direction was always considered the hydraulic head throughout the fracture was calculated using the modified local cubic law of wang et al 2015 by solving the 2 d steady state partial differential equation describing newtonian fluid flow in a spatially variable fracture abdel salam and chrysikopoulos 1995 1 x b 3 x y η x y x y b 3 x y η x y y 0 where b 3 m3 is the modified local aperture cubed which considers roughness and tortuosity and η m is the piezometric head throughout a fracture boundary conditions were assigned as no flux along the y boundaries and constant heads along the x boundaries driving flow from left to right each head field required solution of a 32 000 000 32 000 000 matrix which was solved in minutes with a matlab sparse matrix solver that required 35 gb of memory next the in plane average velocity vectors in the x and y directions were calculated for every variable aperture cell from the steady state η field as 2 u x x y γ b 2 x y 12 μ η x y x 3 u y x y γ b 2 x y 12 μ η x y y where γ n m 3 is the fluid specific weight and μ pa s is the fluid dynamic viscosity velocity profiles were parabolic in the z direction i e normal to the fracture plane and governed advection through the 3 d rough fractures the flow field for fig 1 subject to 0 025 m of head difference across the x direction is shown in fig 2 2 3 particle tracking particle tracking was used for simulating colloid transport instead of a 2 d finite element or finite difference solution this is because the particle tracking algorithm is a stochastic solution to the linear partial differential advection dispersion equation and particles are tracked individually so that each retains its own characteristics including sorption status and effects due to wall proximity delay et al 2005 hence the impact of irregular boundaries of the 3 d variable aperture fracture on colloid transport were well preserved particle tracking has often been used to study transport in porous and fractured media james and chrysikopoulos 1999 james and chrysikopoulos 2000 james and chrysikopoulos 2004 james and chrysikopoulos 2011 james et al 2005 kinzelbach 1988 reimus and james 2002 smith and schwartz 1980 wang and cardenas 2015 the general particle tracking transport equation consists of an absolute term representing advection and a stochastic term representing

the specific effects of fracture roughness were not considered with regard to diffusion although aperture variability impacted the flow field at small separation distances from the wall both parallel

transport although the irregular shapes of natural colloids can certainly impact their transport and attachment characteristics here they were represented as neutrally buoyant spheres to focus on how wall effects on diffusion and variable surface attachment characteristics influenced colloid transport a monodisperse plume of 1 000 colloids with 0 05 μ m radii was released instantaneously into each realization of the fracture flow field at x 0 where η 0 025 m η 0 at x 4 m across the inlet using a flux weighted scheme reimus 1995 and colloid positions were tracked with time the shape of the curve describing the dlvo potential fig 3 has the secondary minimum separated from the primary minimum by a maximum potential that cannot be overcome for the parameters used in this study shown in table 1 because of this when a colloid diffused closer to the wall than the location of the secondary minimum it was assumed to attach in the secondary minimum in subsequent time steps the potential diffusive movement of each attached colloid was calculated the advective force exerted on a colloid was goldman et al 1967 o neill 1968 15 f 1 7009 6 π r μ u loc where the local velocity was 16 u loc 6 r b 1 r b u x 2 x y u y 2 x y if this force exceeded the φ dlvo attachment force then the colloid was released back into fracture flow at the location of the dlvo minimum plus one colloid diameter distance toward the fracture center two cases without attachment were run without case 1 and with case 2 wall effects on diffusion next three cases of surface potential correlation were developed for this investigation parameters in table 1 are appropriate for neutrally buoyant colloids in water at room temperature the ionic strength of the suspending liquid which was a sensitive parameter was selected to ensure that neither too few nor too many colloids attached in these simulations to represent a realistic system in all cases the normally distributed surface potentials were assigned a mean of 35 mv with a standard deviation of 5 mv all surface potentials fell between 13 1 and 58 4 mv these yielded a range of separation distances locations of the minimum from 144 to 177 nm the first instance case 3 negatively correlated the surface potential with the local aperture the second instance case 4 randomly assigned surface potentials the third instance case 5 positively correlated the surface potentials to the local fracture aperture as specified surface potential histograms for cases 3 and 5 look similar but the distributions were skewed oppositely so that high surface potentials for case 3 corresponded to locations of low surface potential in case 5 such correlations could arise for example through sorption or precipitation of dissolved constituents along preferential flow paths another example albeit for multi phase systems is altered surface wettability e g invasion of supercritical co2 which is important because two phase flow is strongly governed by the aperture field 4 results and discussion five scenarios were run with the model case 1 no attachment and no wall effects on diffusion i e d d d case 2 no attachment with wall effects on diffusion and the three attachment scenarios with negative case 3 zero or random case 4 and positive case 5 correlation of the wall surface potential with the local fracture aperture cases 3 through 5 were run both with and without wall effects on diffusion but the results were statistically equivalent so only simulations without wall effects are discussed when both attachment and wall effects were included sensitivity in the transport simulations was due to variability in attachment characteristics wall potential correlated to local aperture altered diffusivities due to wall proximity were clearly higher order effects an ensemble average was taken across the 100 fracture realizations to quantify uncertainty fig 4 shows snapshots of suspended left and attached right colloids at 10 top 20 middle and 30 h bottom for case 4 without attachment all colloids successfully negotiated the fractures so exit times were compared as shown in table 2 there were only slight differences in exit times between cases 1 and 2 with the diffusive wall effects considered the average colloid exit time increased from 34 9 to 35 2 h with a fairly large average aperture wall effects on diffusion were only evident when colloids were within about one colloid diameter from the wall which was only about 0 5 of the average aperture for smaller average apertures wall effects on diffusion would be more prominent because wall effects on diffusion were minimally important for the fractures studied here they were not presented for subsequent cases fig 5 shows the time evolution for the first and second moments for suspended and attached colloids for cases 3 5 the slightly sublinear slopes of the first moments for all cases indicated a fairly constant velocity that deceased only slightly over time as colloids attached there was a trend of delayed transit time of particles evident in the time statistics in table 2 across all realizations when the surface potential was correlated negatively randomly and positively with the local fracture aperture see table 2 the opposite trend held for the total number of colloids exiting the fracture although the standard deviations were sufficiently high that the trend was statistically significant only to p 0 08 for increasing mean exit times for the trend of decreasing number of colloids exiting from cases 3 to 5 p 0 001 these results were consistent with colloids following preferential flow paths through larger apertures with less attachment when surface potential was negatively correlated with local aperture case 3 because of this colloids flowing through preferential flow paths of larger apertures experienced less attachment more colloids exiting and exited slightly earlier on average also because the force exerted on a colloid according to 15 is a function of local velocity 16 detachment was more likely in regions with larger apertures given the difficulty in drawing conclusions from fig 5 two additional analyses were conducted fig 6 shows violin plots of the first and second spatial moments chrysikopoulos et al 1990 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2018 for both the suspended and attached colloids calculated at the instant when the first colloid exited the fracture ranges frequencies means and medians for the 100 realizations are indicated for case 3 colloids preferentially transported through the fracture because they tended to enter high flow large aperture regions where they underwent less attachment have the largest first moment variances second moment increased for suspended colloids when comparing cases 3 to 4 to 5 because spreading increased when more members of the colloid plume temporarily attached to the fracture surface for attached colloids both first and second moments decreased from negatively case 3 to zero case 4 to positively case 5 correlated surface potentials to apertures consistent with more colloids attaching along the larger aperture preferential flow paths finally tailing was investigated by calculating power law fits to the tails of log transformed breakthrough curves i e residence time distributions or rtds wang and cardenas 2017 rtds can be approximated using the definition of a breakthrough curve 17 c t n t n 0 which can be used to characterize the relationship between d c t d t and t and thus provide an additional metric for examining non fickian transport features like heavy tailing fig 7 shows example rates of change of cumulative particles d c t d t as a function of time i e rtd in log log space for cases 3 to 5 each red line is the power law fit to 70 of the last 80 data points the final 10 were discarded the power law exponent n is the slope of the red line statistical measures for n across the 100 fractures are listed in table 3 larger n indicates less tailing and vice versa the largest ns were for cases 1 and 2 without attachment for case 3 n was larger than the next two cases meaning it took less time for these colloids to exit the fracture for cases 4 and 5 n was smaller indicating that some colloids took a long time to exit n 3 suggests an infinitely long time for colloids to exit the fracture indicating the potential for effectively permanent attachment this analysis has identified that wall effects on diffusion are a secondary consideration when colloid attachment is important but additional discussion of relevance and limitations is warranted because colloid diffusion is only altered by wall proximity when they are less than a few diameters away effects in fractures with apertures several thousand times larger than the colloids were minimal if apertures were on the order of colloid size however both attachment and physical straining become important processes to consider regarding the demonstrated importance of surface potential variability it is acknowledged that the most common situation would not be one where it was correlated to aperture although for reactive or multi phase flows this is possible nevertheless this research highlights the importance of better characterizing variability in wall surface potentials because of their effects on colloid transport 5 conclusions a particle tracking simulation of colloids flowing through variable aperture fractures subject to wall effects on diffusion as well as colloid attachment according to dlvo energies was developed the 100 synthetic variable aperture fracture realizations were generated with the code sprt2d parameterized by the statistical properties of a real rough fracture it was determined that when wall effects on diffusion were included colloids took slightly longer to exit the fractures because of decreased diffusion near the walls but for the fractures with a fairly large average aperture studied here this change was minimal when the fracture wall surface potential was correlated either negatively randomly or positively with the local aperture colloid transport was altered because colloids preferentially travel in large aperture regions of the fracture when wall surface potential was negatively correlated with local aperture fewer colloids attached and those colloids that did so exited sooner than when fracture wall surface potential was not correlated or positively correlated with the local aperture power law fits to the tails of the breakthrough curves confirmed that tailing was more pronounced when colloids were subject to attachment increased tailing up to infinite residence time was observed as the surface potential became neutrally and then positively correlated with the local fracture aperture for the fractures studied here this research highlights the importance of variability in surface attachment characteristics wall potential on colloid transport while wall effects on diffusion were higher order processes

the flow and transport of these particles while assessing uncertainty in this study fracture apertures were assigned according to a lognormally distributed and spatially correlated random field using statistical measurements from a real fracture wang and cardenas 2014 colloid wall effects were first considered then fracture aperture and fracture surface potential were randomly varied for each fracture realization ultimately colloid transport through variable aperture fractures subject to attachment was simulated 2 model development 2 1 variable aperture fracture generation a fractured welded rhyolitic tuff 12 15 4 cm3 from the santana formation in trans pecos texas usa was examined by x ray computed tomography to measure the aperture at approximately 0 23 mm horizontal resolution cardenas et al 2007 these aperture data were supplied to the variogram estimation and spatial prediction plus error vesper program a variogram and kriging modeling software to estimate the statistical parameters describing aperture variability minasny et al 1999 the modified fracture aperture data comprising 240 400 rows of x m y m and b aperture m were input to vesper to determine the aperture mean 0 46 mm variance 0 25 mm2 and isotropic correlation length 12 mm fit with a spherical variogram these parameters were used to generate 100 realizations of aperture fields for 4 m long by 2 m wide 3d fractures using the code sprt2d gutjahr 1989 which uses a fast fourier transform method grid cells were 1 1 mm2 fig 1 is an example color plot of the 8 million fracture apertures generated with sprt2d 2 2 flow field calculation because the ratios of fracture length and width to aperture were so large a quasi 3d assumption was made meaning that advective flows perpendicular to the fracture were implemented through z coordinate scaling as a colloid transitioned from one model cell with a given fracture aperture to another with a different aperture james and chrysikopoulos 2000 of course diffusion in the z direction was always considered the hydraulic head throughout the fracture was calculated using the modified local cubic law of wang et al 2015 by solving the 2 d steady state

particle tracking was used for simulating colloid transport instead of a 2 d finite element or finite difference solution this is because the particle tracking algorithm is a stochastic solution to the linear partial differential advection dispersion equation and particles are tracked individually so that each retains its own characteristics including sorption status and effects due to wall proximity delay et al 2005 hence the impact of irregular boundaries of the 3 d variable aperture fracture on colloid transport were well preserved particle tracking has often been used to study

transport although the irregular shapes of natural colloids can certainly impact their transport and attachment characteristics here they were represented as neutrally buoyant spheres to focus on how wall effects on diffusion and variable surface attachment characteristics influenced colloid transport a monodisperse plume of 1 000 colloids with 0 05 μ m radii was released instantaneously into each

describing the dlvo potential fig 3 has the secondary minimum separated from the primary minimum by a maximum potential that cannot be overcome for the parameters used in this study shown in table 1 because of this when a colloid diffused closer to the wall than the location of the secondary minimum it was assumed to attach in the secondary minimum in subsequent time steps the potential diffusive

toward the fracture center two cases without attachment were run without case 1 and with case 2 wall effects on diffusion next three cases of surface potential correlation were developed for this investigation parameters in table 1 are appropriate for neutrally buoyant colloids in water at room temperature the ionic strength of the suspending liquid which was a sensitive parameter was selected to ensure that neither too few nor too many colloids attached in these simulations to represent a realistic system in all cases the normally distributed surface potentials were assigned a mean of 35 mv with a standard deviation of 5 mv all surface potentials fell between 13 1 and 58 4 mv these yielded a range of separation distances locations of the minimum from 144 to 177 nm the first instance case 3 negatively correlated the surface potential with the local aperture the second instance case 4 randomly assigned surface potentials the third instance case 5 positively correlated the surface potentials to the local fracture aperture as specified surface potential histograms for cases 3 and 5 look similar but the distributions were skewed oppositely so that high surface potentials for case 3 corresponded to locations of low surface potential in case 5 such correlations could arise for example through sorption or precipitation of dissolved constituents along preferential flow paths another example albeit for multi phase systems is altered surface wettability e g invasion of supercritical co2 which is important because two phase flow is strongly governed by the aperture field 4 results and discussion five scenarios were run with the model case 1 no attachment and no wall effects on diffusion i e d d d case 2 no attachment with wall effects on diffusion and the three attachment scenarios with negative case 3 zero or random case 4 and positive case 5 correlation of the wall surface potential with the local fracture aperture cases 3 through 5 were run both with and without wall effects on diffusion but the results were statistically equivalent so only simulations without wall effects are discussed when both attachment and wall effects were included sensitivity in the transport simulations was due to variability in attachment characteristics wall potential correlated to local aperture altered diffusivities due to wall proximity were clearly higher order effects an ensemble average was taken across the 100 fracture realizations to quantify uncertainty fig 4 shows snapshots of suspended left and attached right colloids at 10 top 20 middle and 30 h bottom for case 4 without attachment all colloids successfully negotiated the fractures so exit times were compared as shown in table 2 there were only slight differences in exit times between cases 1 and 2 with the diffusive wall effects considered the average colloid exit time increased from 34 9 to 35 2 h with a fairly large average aperture wall effects on diffusion were only evident when colloids were within about one colloid diameter from the wall which was only about 0 5 of the average aperture for smaller average apertures wall effects on diffusion would be more prominent because wall effects on diffusion were minimally important for the fractures studied here they were not presented for subsequent cases fig 5 shows the time evolution for the first and second moments for suspended and attached colloids for cases 3 5 the slightly sublinear slopes of the first moments for all cases indicated a fairly constant velocity that deceased only slightly over time as colloids attached there was a trend of delayed transit time of particles evident in the time statistics in table 2 across all realizations when the surface potential was correlated negatively randomly and positively with the local fracture aperture see table 2 the opposite trend held for the total number of colloids exiting the fracture although the standard deviations were sufficiently high that the trend was statistically significant only to p 0 08 for increasing mean exit times for the trend of decreasing number of colloids exiting from cases 3 to 5 p 0 001 these results were consistent with colloids following preferential flow paths through larger apertures with less attachment when surface potential was negatively correlated with local aperture case 3 because of this colloids flowing through preferential flow paths of larger apertures experienced less attachment more colloids exiting and exited slightly earlier on average also because the force exerted on a colloid according to 15 is a function of local velocity 16 detachment was more likely in regions with larger apertures given the difficulty in drawing conclusions from fig 5 two additional analyses were conducted fig 6 shows violin plots of the first and second spatial moments chrysikopoulos et al 1990 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2018 for both the suspended and attached colloids calculated at the instant when the first colloid exited the fracture ranges frequencies means and medians for the 100 realizations are indicated for case 3 colloids preferentially transported through the fracture because they tended to enter high flow large aperture regions where they underwent less attachment have the largest first moment variances second moment increased for suspended colloids when comparing cases 3 to 4 to 5 because spreading increased when more members of the colloid plume temporarily attached to the fracture surface for attached colloids both first and second moments decreased from negatively case 3 to zero case 4 to positively case 5 correlated surface potentials to apertures consistent with more colloids attaching along the larger aperture preferential flow paths finally tailing was investigated by calculating power law fits to the tails of log transformed breakthrough curves i e residence time distributions or rtds wang and cardenas 2017 rtds can be approximated using the definition of a breakthrough curve 17 c t n t n 0 which can be used to characterize the relationship between d c t d t and t and thus provide an additional metric for examining non fickian transport features like heavy tailing fig 7 shows example rates of change of cumulative particles d c t d t as a function of time i e rtd in log log space for cases 3 to 5 each red line is the power law fit to 70 of the last 80 data points the final 10 were discarded the power law exponent n is the slope of the red line statistical measures for n across the 100 fractures are listed in table 3 larger n indicates less tailing and vice versa the largest ns were for cases 1 and 2 without attachment for case 3 n was larger than the next two cases meaning it took less time for these colloids to exit the fracture for cases 4 and 5 n was smaller indicating that some colloids took a long time to exit n 3 suggests an infinitely long time for colloids to exit the fracture indicating the potential for effectively permanent attachment this analysis has identified that wall effects on diffusion are a secondary consideration when colloid attachment is important but additional discussion of relevance and limitations is warranted because colloid diffusion is only altered by wall proximity when they are less than a few diameters away effects in fractures with apertures several thousand times larger than the colloids were minimal if apertures were on the order of colloid size however both attachment and physical straining become important processes to consider regarding the demonstrated importance of surface potential variability it is acknowledged that the most common situation would not be one where it was correlated to aperture although for reactive or multi phase flows this is possible nevertheless this research highlights the importance of better characterizing variability in wall surface potentials because of their effects on colloid transport 5 conclusions a particle tracking simulation of colloids flowing through variable aperture fractures subject to wall effects on diffusion as well as colloid attachment according to dlvo energies was developed the 100 synthetic variable aperture fracture realizations were generated with the code sprt2d parameterized by the statistical properties of a real rough fracture it was determined that when wall effects on diffusion were included colloids took slightly longer to exit the fractures because of decreased diffusion near the walls but for the fractures with a fairly large average aperture studied here this change was minimal when the fracture wall surface potential was correlated either negatively randomly or positively with the local aperture colloid transport was altered because colloids preferentially travel in large aperture regions of the fracture when wall surface potential was negatively correlated with local aperture fewer colloids attached and those colloids that did so exited sooner than when fracture wall surface potential was not correlated or positively correlated with the local aperture power law fits to the tails of the breakthrough curves confirmed that tailing was more pronounced when colloids were subject to attachment increased tailing up to infinite residence time was observed as the surface potential became neutrally and then positively correlated with the local fracture aperture for the fractures studied here this research highlights the importance of variability in surface attachment characteristics wall potential on colloid transport while wall effects on diffusion were higher order processes 
6971,accurate quantification of large scale evapotranspiration et has an important scientific and practical significance in this study three global high resolution et products were intercompared and evaluated across china the evaluated et products were the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 2 the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 0 catchment land surface model clsm dataset and the numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg dataset the evaluations were performed at the site scale with eddy covariance ec based observations from eight flux stations and at the basin scale with water balance based et estimates from 22 river basins in china the intercomparison results indicated that the three products consistently presented an increasing trend over a large proportion of china but large differences in the trend of the annual et and the mean annual et estimates the trends of the annual et estimates derived from the gleam gldas and ntsg products are 0 449 0 904 and 1 261 mm yr2 respectively the countrywide mean annual et derived from the three products are 390 2 443 4 and 419 9 mm yr respectively the site scale evaluation results indicated that the gleam and ntsg products achieved comparable consistencies with the monthly gauge observations and outperformed the gldas product gleam was more consistent with the daily gauge observations than gldas at the basin scale all three products were unable to reasonably reproduce the water balance based annual et time series in most basins the three products systematically overestimated et in the wet basins compared with the water balance based et estimates the differences in the et estimates among the et products may be largely attributed to the discrepancies in the forcing data and model algorithms keywords evapotranspiration assessment uncertainty water balance china 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is an essential component of the terrestrial water balance and plays an important role in regulating the spatial temporal distribution of water availability jung et al 2010 vinukollu et al 2011 liu et al 2016 accurate estimates of et are crucial for a better understanding of the changes in hydrological regimes in the context of a changing environment and have a large variety of practical implications such as weather forecasting agricultural drought forecasting and water resource management however accurate et estimation on a large scale is still a challenge due to the complexity of et processes and the heterogeneity in the factors controlling et mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016c liu et al 2018 et is controlled by various factors including climatic factors e g precipitation temperature solar radiation wind and relative humidity land surface factors e g soil moisture topography and vegetation types and human activities e g human induced land use land cover change dam construction and agricultural irrigation these controlling factors are interactions and are highly variable in space and time which makes large scale et estimation highly complicated bai et al 2018b liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 et is difficult to measure directly as a water variable conventional techniques only provide indirect measurements at a point or field scale and are subject to the issues of globally sparse gauges miralles et al 2015 wang et al 2015 large scale et estimates are usually determined by the water balance method remote sensing rs models and hydrological models or land surface models li et al 2012 long et al 2014 the water balance method is commonly used to calculate basin average et over monthly or even coarser temporal scales which treats et as the residual between precipitation p and the sum of runoff q and total water storage change δs rodell 2004 zeng et al 2012 wan et al 2015 on a multiyear scale δs can be neglected and et can be derived from observed p and q the advantage of this method is that the water balance terms except for et come from the direct observations which ensures that the method can provide reasonable basin scale et flux rodell 2004 senay et al 2011 currently this method is widely used for the validation of large scale et estimates on the annual or mean annual time scale zeng et al 2012 wan et al 2015 liu et al 2016 bai et al 2018a the disadvantages of the water balance approach are also obvious and include the following 1 it only offers the basin mean et estimates and cannot estimate the spatial distribution of et within a basin and 2 it is not suitable for et evaluations in small basins and at fine temporal scales e g daily because some unmeasured water balance terms e g water exchange with neighboring basins and infiltration loss to deep aquifers may greatly influence the et estimates in small basins satellite rs provides global coverage and continuous observations of land surface variables affecting et but cannot measure et directly cleugh et al 2007 li et al 2012 numerous empirically and physically based et models have been developed to translate the satellite derived land surface variables to et estimates most of which are based on the surface energy balance seb or penman monteith pm equation li et al 2012 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016b the seb approaches calculate the latent heat λe which can be simply interpreted as the portion of energy used for evaporation as a residual of the surface energy budget which have low requirements for meteorological data but are only suitable for et estimates under clear sky conditions li et al 2012 zhang et al 2016b the pm based methods have a clear physical mechanism and explicitly account for the radiative and aerodynamic controls on evaporation and are suitable for various weather and climatic conditions however the pm based methods are limited by their requirements for extensive parameterizations of highly variable controlling factors on evaporation such as maximum stomatal conductance and soil water content leuning et al 2008 vinukollu et al 2011 bai et al 2017 the land surface models lsms or hydrological models hms for et estimates combine the advantages of satellite based and water balance based methods which fully use various rs information and constrain the estimation of et within the framework of water balance the lsms or hms have a flexible complexity for et estimates they can either embed the complex and physical based et methods e g pm based methods or use simple and empirical methods however the lsms generally emphasize the overall performances of water and energy flux simulations the hms focus on the accuracy of runoff simulations leading to the large uncertainties in the et estimates from these models fisher et al 2017 the optimal use of the global et products for various practical applications requires a systematic evaluation of their uncertainties several evaluation studies of global et products have been performed on regional and global scales mueller et al 2011 vinukollu et al 2011 long et al 2014 trambauer et al 2014 michel et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the evaluation results revealed that 1 there are significant differences among the et products in depicting the spatial temporal distribution of et 2 there is no consensus on which product is best and 3 the uncertainties of the et products vary with the climatic regions land cover types and spatial and temporal scales previous evaluation studies have employed a wide variety of et products and performance statistics however many studies have considered only a single evaluation approach e g cleugh et al 2007 and michel et al 2015 or have a regional focus e g xue et al 2013 and abiodun et al 2018 which could reduce the general applicability of the conclusions in addition some promising recently released et products such as gleam v3 2 and gldas clsm v2 0 see section 2 1 have not been evaluated yet in china the major objective of this study is to intercompare and evaluate three global high resolution et products across china the evaluations were performed using ec based observations and water balance based et estimates the selected products include a pm based rs et product and two lsm based et products see section 2 2 the three products follow different theoretical bases in estimating et and have their own advantages and limitations we first intercompared the three products to examine their consistency in depicting the spatial temporal patterns of et during the period 1982 2013 section 3 1 and then evaluated their et estimates with eight flux tower observations on monthly and daily scales section 3 2 we also performed a basin scale evaluation of the three products using the water balance method on annual and multiannual time scales section 3 3 in the discussion section we discussed the uncertainties in the evaluation results section 4 1 potential impacts of the forcing data and model algorithms on the et products sections 4 1 and 4 2 this study provides useful information to potential data users to help them choose the appropriate et product s for their research or applications and helps the product developers to improve the accuracy of their et products 2 data and methodology 2 1 global evapotranspiration products advances in rs techniques have greatly promoted the development of the global et products yielding several freely available global et products however some of these products are not suitable for a site scale point to pixel evaluation against the flux tower observations due to their coarse spatial resolution moreover the products with high spatial resolution but short time spans are also excluded e g modis et product 2000 present since the basin scale et evaluation based on water balance method covers the period 1982 2013 see section 2 2 through data screening three high spatial resolution et products with long term temporal coverage were selected which are the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 2 gleam v3 2 miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 the gldas version 2 0 clsm dataset gldas clsm v2 0 rodell 2004 li et al 2018 and the numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg dataset zhang et al 2010a zhang et al 2015 more information of the three et products can be found in table 1 gleam can be classified as a simple land surface model that only focuses on the terrestrial et and soil moisture simulations within a simple water balance framework miralles et al 2011 miralles et al 2015 the rational of the method is to take full advantages of the rs climatic and land surface variables affecting et estimates martens et al 2017 in the gleam model et is computed as a function of the evaporative demand i e potential evaporation pet and soil moisture stress such algorithms required less input data and were also commonly used in hydrological models wallace 1995 gleam calculates pet with the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 which is a simplified form of the pm equation and implicitly accounts for the aerodynamic term in the pm equation chen et al 2014 zhou and wang 2015 the soil moisture stress for bare soil short vegetation and tall vegetation is considered in detail in gleam based on a three layer soil water balance model and rs based vegetation optical depth gleam includes four evaporation components interception loss bare soil evaporation plant transpiration and evaporation from water bodies and regions covered by ice and or snow gldas is a global scale terrestrial modeling system that integrates multisource information of the land surface and atmosphere with advanced land surface models and data assimilation techniques aiming to model the optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 gldas v2 0 drives four land surface models disc 2018 noah clsm the community land model clm and the variable infiltration capacity vic in this study the dataset of land surface parameters simulated by the clsm model was selected given that its spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 and temporal coverage 1948 2014 are more suitable for our assessment needs than other lsm outputs unlike the traditional lsms the clsm utilizes the watershed as the fundamental calculation unit instead of a rectangular grid cell koster et al 2000 in each catchment unit the pm equation is applied to calculate et ntsg employs the modified pm equation combined with rs based vegetation parameters for et estimates zhang et al 2010a the pm based et algorithms possess similar assumptions and calculation procedures the major difference between them is the method used to parameterize the canopy conductance which is the most sensitive and elusive parameter in the pm equation and determines the plant transpiration rate leuning et al 2008 ntsg employs a jarvis based stomatal conductance equation to parameterize the canopy conductance and calibrates the canopy conductance parameters using eddy covariance ec based measurements representative of the major global ecological types zhang et al 2010a zhang et al 2015 note that the spatial and temporal resolutions of the ntsg product are different from those of the gleam and gldas products table 1 ntsg only provides the monthly et estimates at a spatial resolution of 1 12 1 12 while gleam and gldas use daily et estimates at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 to make them comparable the ntsg product was resampled at the same spatial resolution as gleam and gldas and does not use the daily scale comparison with the ec based observations see section 2 2 in addition the gleam and ntsg quantify open water evaporation using a priestley taylor approach while the gldas do not include the open water evaporation in its et components 2 2 evaluation method and data in this study two methods were used to assess the et products a comparison with the ec based measurements and a comparison with the water balance based et estimates ec based measurements at eight flux stations from chinaflux http www chinaflux org were used for a point to pixel evaluation the flux stations cover different climatic conditions and ecosystem types across china fig 1 with an aridity index that range from 0 67 to 2 26 table 2 the ecosystem types of the flux stations are forest 4 stations grassland 3 stations and cropland 1 station consecutive daily measurements were recorded during the period 2003 2005 at six of the eight flux stations at the xlht and dx stations daily measurements were only recorded in 2004 and 2005 the annual et derived by the water balance method was used to assess the et products on a basin scale the evaluation was performed over 22 river basins in china fig 1 on annual 2003 2013 and mean annual 1983 2013 time scales these basins cover a broad range of climatic and landscape conditions table 3 we chose the basins based on the following two principles 1 the basin area must be large enough to ensure that the water balance components such as groundwater exchange with the neighboring basins and water leakage to deep aquifers are negligible compared with p q r and δs and 2 the catchments have limited anthropogenic effects on the river discharge the water balance method assumes that the annual water balance closure in the large basins is dominated by p et q and δs see section 1 therefore the basin average et can be derived from the observed p q and δs et p q δs prior to the grace satellites large scale δs monitoring was impossible to achieve particularly on the continental and global scales the annual δs is often assumed to be small enough to ignore for the water balance based et estimates e g pike 1964 milly 1994 yang et al 2007 senay et al 2011 however grace monitoring data indicates that the annual δs may play an important role in the annual water balance rodell 2004 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 particularly in extremely dry or wet years where the δs may exceed the annual runoff leblanc marc et al 2009 in this study the importance of δs in the annual water balance was also confirmed in the study basins fig 2 shows that grace derived δs on an annual scale is an important water balance component the fluctuation ranges of the annual δs exceed 100 mm yr in most basins and are even up to 400 mm yr in individual basins on the multiannual scale 2003 2013 however the mean annual δs values in the 22 basins are close to zero which confirms the assumption that the long term δs is negligible at the basin scale in addition the annual δs values in the wetter basins tend to present larger interannual variabilities than those in the drier basins the latest release of grace data rl05 processed by the university of texas center for space research csr were employed with a spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 http www2 csr utexas edu grace the streamflow records were provided by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn in addition we combined the fao 56 pm method allen et al 1998 and the china meteorological fording dataset cmfd to derive net radiation data across china the derived net radiation data were employed as baseline data to evaluate the accuracy of net radiation forcing data used in the three et products see section 4 2 http westdc westgis ac cn data 7a35329c c53f 4267 aa07 e0037d913a21 the cmfd dataset was developed specifically for china based on the noah land surface model and merged a variety of data sources including the satellite reanalysis and gauge observations from 800 meteorological stations in china chen et al 2011 he and yang 2011 2 3 evaluation criteria three performance metrics were used to assess the et products the coefficient of determination r2 bias and kling gupta efficiency kge the r2 measures how much variability in the observations can be explained by the simulations the bias measures the average tendency of the observations to be overestimated negative value or underestimated positive value by the simulations the kge integrates three independent metrics of model skill namely linear correlation bias and relative variability into a single multimetric performance statistic and measures the overall goodness of fit between the observations and simulations gupta et al 2009 haas et al 2016 the optimal values of the three metrics are r2 1 bias 0 and keg 1 3 results 3 1 intercomparison of the et products the intercomparison of multiple et products provides helpful insights to examine the consistency and discrepancy between the et products in depicting the spatial temporal distribution of et we compared the mean annual et and its spatial pattern and seasonal cycles among the three products over the period 1982 2013 across china fig 3 overall the spatial patterns of the mean annual et derived from the three products are consistent with the spatial pattern of the aridity index fig 1 showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest china however the mean annual et values obtained from the three products showed a large discrepancy especially in northwest china north china and yangtze basin a systematic difference was found over most regions of north china where gldas generally has the highest et values followed by gleam and ntsg the countrywide mean annual et estimates also present a substantial difference between the three products gldas has the highest value 443 4 mm yr followed by ntsg 419 9 mm yr and gleam 390 2 mm yr the seasonal cycles in the mean annual et among the products are similar to each other overall fig 3d in general the et estimates from the products peak in july and are lowest in january or december we also compared the spatial pattern of the trends in the annual et and the interannual changes in the national average et estimates among the products during the period 1982 2013 fig 4 the trends from the three et products consistently show positive values increasing trends over a large proportion of china increasing trends derived from gleam gldas and ntsg account for 73 71 and 85 of the land area in china respectively however significant differences were found in the spatial pattern of trends and the interannual variability in et among the products from the maps of the spatial pattern of trends in the annual et fig 4a c the consistency among the et products is much lower than that among the mean annual et values the inconsistency in the et trends are widespread throughout china fig 3a c in some regions such as northeast china the gleam and gldas results contradicted the ntsg results this suggests that the et trends are controlled by more factors and are thus estimated differently from the mean annual et values in general the most significant increasing trends from gldas focus on southeast china while those from ntsg lie in east central china on a national scale the trend magnitudes derived from the three products are also substantially different ntsg shows the largest trend magnitude followed by gldas and gleam fig 4d the trend values derived from the three products are 1 261 0 904 and 0 449 mm yr2 respectively 3 2 point to pixel evaluation a point to pixel evaluation was performed for the et products using the ec based observations from eight flux stations the evaluation was conducted on monthly and daily time scales note that the ntsg product was only used in the monthly et evaluation since it does not include the daily et estimates the monthly scale evaluation results are shown in fig 5 and table 4 from the average results of the eight stations table 4 the gleam and ntsg products achieved comparable performances and significantly outperformed the gldas product the mean r2 values from the gleam gldas and ntsg products are 0 77 0 56 and 0 77 respectively the values of absolute bias from the three products are 22 5 44 0 and 22 2 respectively and the kge values from the three products are 0 64 0 21 and 0 62 respectively from the statistical results of a single station no single product consistently outperformed the others over all stations the et estimates from the three products captured the variability in the ec based observations well except for gldas and ntsg at xsbn station with r2 values that range from 0 58 to 0 94 a systematic overestimation was found for all products in the four flux stations of the forest ecosystem i e the cbs qyz dhs and xsbn stations with the bias values that range from 10 6 to 92 5 and gldas shows the largest overestimation gleam systematically underestimated the et estimates against the ec based observations in the three flux stations of the grassland ecosystem xlht hb and dx stations and one station of the cropland yc station in terms of the kge statistic gleam and ntsg each achieved the best performance metric in four out of eight stations the daily scale evaluation results are shown in fig 6 in most stations the two products can largely capture the variability in daily et but exhibit varying degrees of bias the average r2 values obtained from gleam and gldas are 0 57 and 0 40 respectively the average kge values obtained from the two products are 0 60 and 0 23 respectively overall gleam performs better than gldas over the eight flux stations 3 3 bain scale et evaluation we evaluated the basin average et estimates from the three products against the reference et et wb estimated from the water balance method in 22 large river basins the evaluation was conducted on annual scale 2003 2013 and multiannual 1982 2013 time scales δs was considered in the annual et wb estimates using grace data while it was neglected for the multiannual average et wb estimates on the multiannual scale fig 7 the three products can generally capture the et changes with climatic conditions and simulate higher et in wetter basins the three products tend to overestimate the mean annual et over most basins with bias values in the range of 16 25 gleam has the best performance of the r2 and bias statistics and ntsg performs the best in the kge statistic on the annual scale fig 8 the performance metrics of the three products also display large differences overall the three products are unable to reasonably reproduce the reference et time series over most basins comparatively gleam performs the best followed by ntsg and gldas the median r2 values obtained from the three products are 0 15 0 12 and 0 07 respectively the median bias values for the three products are 14 29 and 22 respectively the median kge values for the three products are 0 13 0 11 and 0 06 respectively in addition the three products consistently overestimate et in the wetter basins compared to et wb of which gldas presents the largest overestimation fig 8c the r2 and kge values do not present a tendency to change with climatic conditions fig 8a and c 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties in the evaluation results in this study three global high resolution et products were evaluated based on the ec based observations and the water balance method although the two methods have been widely used for et evaluations rodell 2004 chen et al 2014 long et al 2014 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the inherent deficiencies in the two methods might result in some degree of uncertainties in the evaluation results the ec based measurements represent the most direct and accurate et estimates at a site scale wang et al 2015 however a direct comparison of ec based measurements with et products is always subject to the issues of scale mismatch long et al 2014 the footprint of the flux towers which varies with the measurement height above the canopy layer and wind speed is usually limited to a few kilometers around the flux station li et al 2012 therefore ec based measurements from a single flux station hardly represent a grid scale 0 25 0 25 625 km2 average et given the strong spatial variability in et particularly over complex mountainous terrain moreover ec based measurements also suffer from the issues of energy closure wang et al 2015 the unclosed energy balance can reach up to 10 30 as reported by twine et al 2000 the water balance based et estimates also have limitations as the reference et at the basin scale the uncertainty of this method primarily comes from the grace derived δs estimates in general grace satellites can provide reliable δs estimates at a spatial resolution greater than its footprint 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 long et al 2015 for areas smaller than the grace footprint the δs estimates may have some degree of uncertainty long et al 2017 to reduce the uncertainty of grace derived δs estimates we applied the water balance method on an annual scale rather than a monthly scale nevertheless the uncertainty in the water balance based et estimates indeed exists considering that the areas of most river basins are smaller than the grace footprint 4 2 potential influences of the forcing data on the accuracy of the et products the accuracy of the forcing data has a large influence on the et estimates for meteorological variables precipitation and radiation are the two most important variables affecting the et estimates which determine the quantity of available water and energy that can be used for evaporation brutsaert 1982 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2016a the three et products used in this study were developed by different agencies and employed different forcing data sources for example the precipitation data used in the gleam and gldas products come from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset beck et al 2017 and the princeton global fording dataset sheffield et al 2006 respectively the former is a merged precipitation dataset using gauge satellite and reanalysis data while the latter is a reanalysis dataset generated from a climate model here we evaluated the precipitation and net radiation data used in the et products over 22 river basins fig 9 the precipitation data used in the gleam and gldas products were compared with the gauge based precipitation the net radiation data used in the three et products were compared with the net radiation derived from the fao 56 pm method and the china meteorological fording dataset cmfd see section 2 2 the evaluation results indicated that the precipitation data used in the gleam and gldas products exhibit good accuracy on a monthly scale but are largely different from the gauge based observations on a daily scale the kge values for the gleam and gldas products are 0 89 and 0 87 respectively on a monthly scale the values for the two products are 0 73 and 0 41 respectively on a daily scale comparatively the data used in gleam was more consistent with the gauge based observations than those used in gldas the net radiation data used in the three products are adequately consistent with the baseline data i e the net radiation in the cmfd implying no large differences among the three net radiation datasets a smilar finding was also reported by liu et al 2016 on 35 large river basins globally the above results indicate that the different forcing data sources might be an important cause of the differences in the et estimates from the et products the better performances achieved by gleam than by gldas might be partly attributed to the higher quality precipitation forcing data used in gleam 4 3 potential impacts of the et algorithms on the accuracy of the et products in addition to the forcing data the differences in the model algorithms also affect the accuracy of the et estimates as mentioned in section 2 1 the et algorithms used in the three products represent three typical et calculation methods each of these algorithms has its own advantages and limitations the gleam product first calculated pet with the priestley taylor equation and then tried to correct pet to et using a range of soil moisture stress factors miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 one of most prominent features of the gleam product is that the influence of the soil water stress on et was thoroughly considered based on a soil water balance model miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 this might be an important reason for the better performance achieved by gleam than by the other products a potential limitation of the et algorithms in the gleam product is the pet method i e priestley taylor equation this equation generally works well in humid climatic conditions where the aerodynamic term is relative small but fails to work in drier semiarid regions gunston and batchelor 1983 allen et al 1998 moreover it does not consider the impact of vegetation changes on pet both the gldas and ntsg products employed the physically based pm based equation for the et estimates and used a similar method i e jarvis based stomatal conduction equation to parameterize the canopy conductance specifically the canopy conductance in the jarvis based method is treated as a function of the maximum stomatal conductance and a series of dimensionless environmental stress functions that range from 0 to 1 jarvis 1976 among these environmental stress factors the soil water stress factor is critically important for plant transpiration suppression however this factor was implicitly considered by both the gldas and ntsg products with the vapor pressure deficit vpd it is potentially problematic to use vpd to reflect soil water stress for transpiration especially in drier regions some studies have reported that incorporating soil water stress into the canopy conduction calculation can improve et simulations therefore the improvement of et algorithms should highlight the importance of including the water stress module in model structures in addition it should be noted that the poor consistency with the reference et for the gldas product does not mean that its et algorithm is inferior to the algorithms of the other products the goal of gldas is to provide the optimal fields of the land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 which means that the objective of the default parameter settings and data assimilation in gldas is not limited to the accuracy of the et simulations this may be one of the reasons for the poor consistency of the gldas product with the reference et 4 4 future direction of improving et simulations to achieve better global scale et simulations the product developers should take full advantage of the complementary nature of satellite retrieval data and ground based observations thereby improving the quality of forcing data in addition developing an efficient scheme of parameter estimation can also greatly reduce the uncertainty of the et output whereas the difficulty in this regard is how to obtain a reliable benchmark data for parameter calibration unlike the river discharge observations et cannot be measured directly at a large scale as a water variable fisher et al 2017 large scale hydrological simulations are often unable to efficiently constrain et related parameter estimation in a model due to the lack of benchmark data resulting in unreasonable et estimates e g mean annual et estimates larger than mean annual pet or p the budyko framework provides a feasible solution to constrain et related parameter s in rs based et models lsms and hydrological models this framework accounts for the water and energy limits for et and can efficiently estimate long term et only using the climate aridity index pet p xu et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 zhang et al 2010b have utilized the long term et estimates from a budyko model to calibrate surface conductance in the pm equation across australia the et estimates using the calibrated surface conductance showed a good agreement with the ec based measurements xu et al 2013 have evaluated the et estimates from ntsg product globally using the budyko framework and found that the et estimates in many basins are physically unreasonable improvements in the et model algorithms should focus on incorporating or enhancing the parameterization scheme of water stress on et in the current et algorithms the gleam product might benefit from detailed parameterization scheme of water stress on et thereby achieving the better performance than the other products 5 summary and conclusions the major objective of this study is to compare and evaluate three global high resolution et products across china to fulfill this objective we first performed an intercomparison of the three et products to identify their consistencies and discrepancies in et estimates then the three products were separately evaluated at the site scale with ec based observations and at the basin scale with water balance based et estimates the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the three et products consistently showed an increasing trend in the annual et over a large proportion of china but large differences in the mean annual et estimates and the trend of the annual et on a countrywide scale the mean annual et derived from the gleam gldas and ntsg products are 390 2 443 4 and 419 9 mm yr respectively the trends of the annual et derived from the three products are 0 449 0 904 and 1 261 mm yr2 respectively 2 at the site scale gleam and ntsg showed comparable consistencies with the monthly observations and performed better than the gldas product gleam exhibited a better consistency than gldas with the daily observations 3 at the basin scale all the three products failed to reproduce the water balance based annual et time series over most basins in comparison gleam performed the best followed by ntsg and gldas moreover the three et products consistently overestimated the et compared to the water balance based et estimates in the wetter basins overall among the three products gleam shows the best consistency with the point observations and basin scale benchmark data we thus recommend this product as the preferred choice for application among the three products this study highlights that product users should carefully select et product s for basin scale applications and fully understand the potential risks caused by the uncertainty in the selected et product s this study offers useful information for product users to choose the appropriate et product s to conduct their specific studies or applications and also helps product developers to improve the accuracy of their et products acknowledgments this research was supported by the natural science foundation of china projects 41330529 41601034 and 41571024 the authors appreciate the

6971,accurate quantification of large scale evapotranspiration et has an important scientific and practical significance in this study three global high resolution et products were intercompared and evaluated across china the evaluated et products were the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 2 the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 0 catchment land surface model clsm dataset and the numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg dataset the evaluations were performed at the site scale with eddy covariance ec based observations from eight flux stations and at the basin scale with water balance based et estimates from 22 river basins in china the intercomparison results indicated that the three products consistently presented an increasing trend over a large proportion of china but large differences in the trend of the annual et and the mean annual et estimates the trends of the annual et estimates derived from the gleam gldas and ntsg products are 0 449 0 904 and 1 261 mm yr2 respectively the countrywide mean annual et derived from the three products are 390 2 443 4 and 419 9 mm yr respectively the site scale evaluation results indicated that the gleam and ntsg products achieved comparable consistencies with the monthly gauge observations and outperformed the gldas product gleam was more consistent with the daily gauge observations than gldas at the basin scale all three products were unable to reasonably reproduce the water balance based annual et time series in most basins the three products systematically overestimated et in the wet basins compared with the water balance based et estimates the differences in the et estimates among the et products may be largely attributed to the discrepancies in the forcing data and model algorithms keywords evapotranspiration assessment uncertainty water balance china 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is an essential component of the terrestrial water balance and plays an important role in regulating the spatial temporal distribution of water availability jung et al 2010 vinukollu et al 2011 liu et al 2016 accurate estimates of et are crucial for a better understanding of the changes in hydrological regimes in the context of a changing environment and have a large variety of practical implications such as weather forecasting agricultural drought forecasting and water resource management however accurate et estimation on a large scale is still a challenge due to the complexity of et processes and the heterogeneity in the factors controlling et mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016c liu et al 2018 et is controlled by various factors including climatic factors e g precipitation temperature solar radiation wind and relative humidity land surface factors e g soil moisture topography and vegetation types and human activities e g human induced land use land cover change dam construction and agricultural irrigation these controlling factors are interactions and are highly variable in space and time which makes large scale et estimation highly complicated bai et al 2018b liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 et is difficult to measure directly as a water variable conventional techniques only provide indirect measurements at a point or field scale and are subject to the issues of globally sparse gauges miralles et al 2015 wang et al 2015 large scale et estimates are usually determined by the water balance method remote sensing rs models and hydrological models or land surface models li et al 2012 long et al 2014 the water balance method is commonly used to calculate basin average et over monthly or even coarser temporal scales which treats et as the residual between precipitation p and the sum of runoff q and total water storage change δs rodell 2004 zeng et al 2012 wan et al 2015 on a multiyear scale δs can be neglected and et can be derived from observed p and q the advantage of this method is that the water balance terms except for et come from the direct observations which ensures that the method can provide reasonable basin scale et flux rodell 2004 senay et al 2011 currently this method is widely used for the validation of large scale et estimates on the annual or mean annual time scale zeng et al 2012 wan et al 2015 liu et al 2016 bai et al 2018a the disadvantages of the water balance approach are also obvious and include the following 1 it only offers the basin mean et estimates and cannot estimate the spatial distribution of et within a basin and 2 it is not suitable for et evaluations in small basins and at fine temporal scales e g daily because some unmeasured water balance terms e g water exchange with neighboring basins and infiltration loss to deep aquifers may greatly influence the et estimates in small basins satellite rs provides global coverage and continuous observations of land surface variables affecting et but cannot measure et directly cleugh et al 2007 li et al 2012 numerous empirically and physically based et models have been developed to translate the satellite derived land surface variables to et estimates most of which are based on the surface energy balance seb or penman monteith pm equation li et al 2012 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016b the seb approaches calculate the latent heat λe which can be simply interpreted as the portion of energy used for evaporation as a residual of the surface energy budget which have low requirements for meteorological data but are only suitable for et estimates under clear sky conditions li et al 2012 zhang et al 2016b the pm based methods have a clear physical mechanism and explicitly account for the radiative and aerodynamic controls on evaporation and are suitable for various weather and climatic conditions however the pm based methods are limited by their requirements for extensive parameterizations of highly variable controlling factors on evaporation such as maximum stomatal conductance and soil water content leuning et al 2008 vinukollu et al 2011 bai et al 2017 the land surface models lsms or hydrological models hms for et estimates combine the advantages of satellite based and water balance based methods which fully use various rs information and constrain the estimation of et within the framework of water balance the lsms or hms have a flexible complexity for et estimates they can either embed the complex and physical based et methods e g pm based methods or use simple and empirical methods however the lsms generally emphasize the overall performances of water and energy flux simulations the hms focus on the accuracy of runoff simulations leading to the large uncertainties in the et estimates from these models fisher et al 2017 the optimal use of the global et products for various practical applications requires a systematic evaluation of their uncertainties several evaluation studies of global et products have been performed on regional and global scales mueller et al 2011 vinukollu et al 2011 long et al 2014 trambauer et al 2014 michel et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the evaluation results revealed that 1 there are significant differences among the et products in depicting the spatial temporal distribution of et 2 there is no consensus on which product is best and 3 the uncertainties of the et products vary with the climatic regions land cover types and spatial and temporal scales previous evaluation studies have employed a wide variety of et products and performance statistics however many studies have considered only a single evaluation approach e g cleugh et al 2007 and michel et al 2015 or have a regional focus e g xue et al 2013 and abiodun et al 2018 which could reduce the general applicability of the conclusions in addition some promising recently released et products such as gleam v3 2 and gldas clsm v2 0 see section 2 1 have not been evaluated yet in china the major objective of this study is to intercompare and evaluate three global high resolution et products across china the evaluations were performed using ec based observations and water balance based et estimates the selected products include a pm based rs et product and two lsm based et products see section 2 2 the three products follow different theoretical bases in estimating et and have their own advantages and limitations we first intercompared the three products to examine their consistency in depicting the spatial temporal patterns of et during the period 1982 2013 section 3 1 and then evaluated their et estimates with eight flux tower observations on monthly and daily scales section 3 2 we also performed a basin scale evaluation of the three products using the water balance method on annual and multiannual time scales section 3 3 in the discussion section we discussed the uncertainties in the evaluation results section 4 1 potential impacts of the forcing data and model algorithms on the et products sections 4 1 and 4 2 this study provides useful information to potential data users to help them choose the appropriate et product s for their research or applications and helps the product developers to improve the accuracy of their et products 2 data and methodology 2 1 global evapotranspiration products advances in rs techniques have greatly promoted the development of the global et products yielding several freely available global et products however some of these products are not suitable for a site scale point to pixel evaluation against the flux tower observations due to their coarse spatial resolution moreover the products with high spatial resolution but short time spans are also excluded e g modis et product 2000 present since the basin scale et evaluation based on water balance method covers the period 1982 2013 see section 2 2 through data screening three high spatial resolution et products with long term temporal coverage were selected which are the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 2 gleam v3 2 miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 the gldas version 2 0 clsm dataset gldas clsm v2 0 rodell 2004 li et al 2018 and the numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg dataset zhang et al 2010a zhang et al 2015 more information of the three et products can be found in table 1 gleam can be classified as a simple land surface model that only focuses on the terrestrial et and soil moisture simulations within a simple water balance framework miralles et al 2011 miralles et al 2015 the rational of the method is to take full advantages of the rs climatic and land surface variables affecting et estimates martens et al 2017 in the gleam model et is computed as a function of the evaporative demand i e potential evaporation pet and soil moisture stress such algorithms required less input data and were also commonly used in hydrological models wallace 1995 gleam calculates pet with the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 which is a simplified form of the pm equation and implicitly accounts for the aerodynamic term in the pm equation chen et al 2014 zhou and wang 2015 the soil moisture stress for bare soil short vegetation and tall vegetation is considered in detail in gleam based on a three layer soil water balance model and rs based vegetation optical depth gleam includes four evaporation components interception loss bare soil evaporation plant transpiration and evaporation from water bodies and regions covered by ice and or snow gldas is a global scale terrestrial modeling system that integrates multisource information of the land surface and atmosphere with advanced land surface models and data assimilation techniques aiming to model the optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 gldas v2 0 drives four land surface models disc 2018 noah clsm the community land model clm and the variable infiltration capacity vic in this study the dataset of land surface parameters simulated by the clsm model was selected given that its spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 and temporal coverage 1948 2014 are more suitable for our assessment needs than other lsm outputs unlike the traditional lsms the clsm utilizes the watershed as the fundamental calculation unit instead of a rectangular grid cell koster et al 2000 in each catchment unit the pm equation is applied to calculate et ntsg employs the modified pm equation combined with rs based vegetation parameters for et estimates zhang et al 2010a the pm based et algorithms possess similar assumptions and calculation procedures the major difference between them is the method used to parameterize the canopy conductance which is the most sensitive and elusive parameter in the pm equation and determines the plant transpiration rate leuning et al 2008 ntsg employs a jarvis based stomatal conductance equation to parameterize the canopy conductance and calibrates the canopy conductance parameters using eddy covariance ec based measurements representative of the major global ecological types zhang et al 2010a zhang et al 2015 note that the spatial and temporal resolutions of the ntsg product are different from those of the gleam and gldas products table 1 ntsg only provides the monthly et estimates at a spatial resolution of 1 12 1 12 while gleam and gldas use daily et estimates at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 to make them comparable the ntsg product was resampled at the same spatial resolution as gleam and gldas and does not use the daily scale comparison with the ec based observations see section 2 2 in addition the gleam and ntsg quantify open water evaporation using a priestley taylor approach while the gldas do not include the open water evaporation in its et components 2 2 evaluation method and data in this study two methods were used to assess the et products a comparison with the ec based measurements and a comparison with the water balance based et estimates ec based measurements at eight flux stations from chinaflux http www chinaflux org were used for a point to pixel evaluation the flux stations cover different climatic conditions and ecosystem types across china fig 1 with an aridity index that range from 0 67 to 2 26 table 2 the ecosystem types of the flux stations are forest 4 stations grassland 3 stations and cropland 1 station consecutive daily measurements were recorded during the period 2003 2005 at six of the eight flux stations at the xlht and dx stations daily measurements were only recorded in 2004 and 2005 the annual et derived by the water balance method was used to assess the et products on a basin scale the evaluation was performed over 22 river basins in china fig 1 on annual 2003 2013 and mean annual 1983 2013 time scales these basins cover a broad range of climatic and landscape conditions table 3 we chose the basins based on the following two principles 1 the basin area must be large enough to ensure that the water balance components such as groundwater exchange with the neighboring basins and water leakage to deep aquifers are negligible compared with p q r and δs and 2 the catchments have limited anthropogenic effects on the river discharge the water balance method assumes that the annual water balance closure in the large basins is dominated by p et q and δs see section 1 therefore the basin average et can be derived from the observed p q and δs et p q δs prior to the grace satellites large scale δs monitoring was impossible to achieve particularly on the continental and global scales the annual δs is often assumed to be small enough to ignore for the water balance based et estimates e g pike 1964 milly 1994 yang et al 2007 senay et al 2011 however grace monitoring data indicates that the annual δs may play an important role in the annual water balance rodell 2004 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 particularly in extremely dry or wet years where the δs may exceed the annual runoff leblanc marc et al 2009 in this study the importance of δs in the annual water balance was also confirmed in the study basins fig 2 shows that grace derived δs on an annual scale is an important water balance component the fluctuation ranges of the annual δs exceed 100 mm yr in most basins and are even up to 400 mm yr in individual basins on the multiannual scale 2003 2013 however the mean annual δs values in the 22 basins are close to zero which confirms the assumption that the long term δs is negligible at the basin scale in addition the annual δs values in the wetter basins tend to present larger interannual variabilities than those in the drier basins the latest release of grace data rl05 processed by the university of texas center for space research csr were employed with a spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 http www2 csr utexas edu grace the streamflow records were provided by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn in addition we combined the fao 56 pm method allen et al 1998 and the china meteorological fording dataset cmfd to derive net radiation data across china the derived net radiation data were employed as baseline data to evaluate the accuracy of net radiation forcing data used in the three et products see section 4 2 http westdc westgis ac cn data 7a35329c c53f 4267 aa07 e0037d913a21 the cmfd dataset was developed specifically for china based on the noah land surface model and merged a variety of data sources including the satellite reanalysis and gauge observations from 800 meteorological stations in china chen et al 2011 he and yang 2011 2 3 evaluation criteria three performance metrics were used to assess the et products the coefficient of determination r2 bias and kling gupta efficiency kge the r2 measures how much variability in the observations can be explained by the simulations the bias measures the average tendency of the observations to be overestimated negative value or underestimated positive value by the simulations the kge integrates three independent metrics of model skill namely linear correlation bias and relative variability into a single multimetric performance statistic and measures the overall goodness of fit between the observations and simulations gupta et al 2009 haas et al 2016 the optimal values of the three metrics are r2 1 bias 0 and keg 1 3 results 3 1 intercomparison of the et products the intercomparison of multiple et products provides helpful insights to examine the consistency and discrepancy between the et products in depicting the spatial temporal distribution of et we compared the mean annual et and its spatial pattern and seasonal cycles among the three products over the period 1982 2013 across china fig 3 overall the spatial patterns of the mean annual et derived from the three products are consistent with the spatial pattern of the aridity index fig 1 showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest china however the mean annual et values obtained from the three products showed a large discrepancy especially in northwest china north china and yangtze basin a systematic difference was found over most regions of north china where gldas generally has the highest et values followed by gleam and ntsg the countrywide mean annual et estimates also present a substantial difference between the three products gldas has the highest value 443 4 mm yr followed by ntsg 419 9 mm yr and gleam 390 2 mm yr the seasonal cycles in the mean annual et among the products are similar to each other overall fig 3d in general the et estimates from the products peak in july and are lowest in january or december we also compared the spatial pattern of the trends in the annual et and the interannual changes in the national average et estimates among the products during the period 1982 2013 fig 4 the trends from the three et products consistently show positive values increasing trends over a large proportion of china increasing trends derived from gleam gldas and ntsg account for 73 71 and 85 of the land area in china respectively however significant differences were found in the spatial pattern of trends and the interannual variability in et among the products from the maps of the spatial pattern of trends in the annual et fig 4a c the consistency among the et products is much lower than that among the mean annual et values the inconsistency in the et trends are widespread throughout china fig 3a c in some regions such as northeast china the gleam and gldas results contradicted the ntsg results this suggests that the et trends are controlled by more factors and are thus estimated differently from the mean annual et values in general the most significant increasing trends from gldas focus on southeast china while those from ntsg lie in east central china on a national scale the trend magnitudes derived from the three products are also substantially different ntsg shows the largest trend magnitude followed by gldas and gleam fig 4d the trend values derived from the three products are 1 261 0 904 and 0 449 mm yr2 respectively 3 2 point to pixel evaluation a point to pixel evaluation was performed for the et products using the ec based observations from eight flux stations the evaluation was conducted on monthly and daily time scales note that the ntsg product was only used in the monthly et evaluation since it does not include the daily et estimates the monthly scale evaluation results are shown in fig 5 and table 4 from the average results of the eight stations table 4 the gleam and ntsg products achieved comparable performances and significantly outperformed the gldas product the mean r2 values from the gleam gldas and ntsg products are 0 77 0 56 and 0 77 respectively the values of absolute bias from the three products are 22 5 44 0 and 22 2 respectively and the kge values from the three products are 0 64 0 21 and 0 62 respectively from the statistical results of a single station no single product consistently outperformed the others over all stations the et estimates from the three products captured the variability in the ec based observations well except for gldas and ntsg at xsbn station with r2 values that range from 0 58 to 0 94 a systematic overestimation was found for all products in the four flux stations of the forest ecosystem i e the cbs qyz dhs and xsbn stations with the bias values that range from 10 6 to 92 5 and gldas shows the largest overestimation gleam systematically underestimated the et estimates against the ec based observations in the three flux stations of the grassland ecosystem xlht hb and dx stations and one station of the cropland yc station in terms of the kge statistic gleam and ntsg each achieved the best performance metric in four out of eight stations the daily scale evaluation results are shown in fig 6 in most stations the two products can largely capture the variability in daily et but exhibit varying degrees of bias the average r2 values obtained from gleam and gldas are 0 57 and 0 40 respectively the average kge values obtained from the two products are 0 60 and 0 23 respectively overall gleam performs better than gldas over the eight flux stations 3 3 bain scale et evaluation we evaluated the basin average et estimates from the three products against the reference et et wb estimated from the water balance method in 22 large river basins the evaluation was conducted on annual scale 2003 2013 and multiannual 1982 2013 time scales δs was considered in the annual et wb estimates using grace data while it was neglected for the multiannual average et wb estimates on the multiannual scale fig 7 the three products can generally capture the et changes with climatic conditions and simulate higher et in wetter basins the three products tend to overestimate the mean annual et over most basins with bias values in the range of 16 25 gleam has the best performance of the r2 and bias statistics and ntsg performs the best in the kge statistic on the annual scale fig 8 the performance metrics of the three products also display large differences overall the three products are unable to reasonably reproduce the reference et time series over most basins comparatively gleam performs the best followed by ntsg and gldas the median r2 values obtained from the three products are 0 15 0 12 and 0 07 respectively the median bias values for the three products are 14 29 and 22 respectively the median kge values for the three products are 0 13 0 11 and 0 06 respectively in addition the three products consistently overestimate et in the wetter basins compared to et wb of which gldas presents the largest overestimation fig 8c the r2 and kge values do not present a tendency to change with climatic conditions fig 8a and c 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties in the evaluation results in this study three global high resolution et products were evaluated based on the ec based observations and the water balance method although the two methods have been widely used for et evaluations rodell 2004 chen et al 2014 long et al 2014 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the inherent deficiencies in the two methods might result in some degree of uncertainties in the evaluation results the ec based measurements represent the most direct and accurate et estimates at a site scale wang et al 2015 however a direct comparison of ec based measurements with et products is always subject to the issues of scale mismatch long et al 2014 the footprint of the flux towers which varies with the measurement height above the canopy layer and wind speed is usually limited to a few kilometers around the flux station li et al 2012 therefore ec based measurements from a single flux station hardly represent a grid scale 0 25 0 25 625 km2 average et given the strong spatial variability in et particularly over complex mountainous terrain moreover ec based measurements also suffer from the issues of energy closure wang et al 2015 the unclosed energy balance can reach up to 10 30 as reported by twine et al 2000 the water balance based et estimates also have limitations as the reference et at the basin scale the uncertainty of this method primarily comes from the grace derived δs estimates in general grace satellites can provide reliable δs estimates at a spatial resolution greater than its footprint 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 long et al 2015 for areas smaller than the grace footprint the δs estimates may have some degree of uncertainty long et al 2017 to reduce the uncertainty of grace derived δs estimates we applied the water balance method on an annual scale rather than a monthly scale nevertheless the uncertainty in the water balance based et estimates indeed exists considering that the areas of most river basins are smaller than the grace footprint 4 2 potential influences of the forcing data on the accuracy of the et products the accuracy of the forcing data has a large influence on the et estimates for meteorological variables precipitation and radiation are the two most important variables affecting the et estimates which determine the quantity of available water and energy that can be used for evaporation brutsaert 1982 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2016a the three et products used in this study were developed by different agencies and employed different forcing data sources for example the precipitation data used in the gleam and gldas products come from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset beck et al 2017 and the princeton global fording dataset sheffield et al 2006 respectively the former is a merged precipitation dataset using gauge satellite and reanalysis data while the latter is a reanalysis dataset generated from a climate model here we evaluated the precipitation and net radiation data used in the et products over 22 river basins fig 9 the precipitation data used in the gleam and gldas products were compared with the gauge based precipitation the net radiation data used in the three et products were compared with the net radiation derived from the fao 56 pm method and the china meteorological fording dataset cmfd see section 2 2 the evaluation results indicated that the precipitation data used in the gleam and gldas products exhibit good accuracy on a monthly scale but are largely different from the gauge based observations on a daily scale the kge values for the gleam and gldas products are 0 89 and 0 87 respectively on a monthly scale the values for the two products are 0 73 and 0 41 respectively on a daily scale comparatively the data used in gleam was more consistent with the gauge based observations than those used in gldas the net radiation data used in the three products are adequately consistent with the baseline data i e the net radiation in the cmfd implying no large differences among the three net radiation datasets a smilar finding was also reported by liu et al 2016 on 35 large river basins globally the above results indicate that the different forcing data sources might be an important cause of the differences in the et estimates from the et products the better performances achieved by gleam than by gldas might be partly attributed to the higher quality precipitation forcing data used in gleam 4 3 potential impacts of the et algorithms on the accuracy of the et products in addition to the forcing data the differences in the model algorithms also affect the accuracy of the et estimates as mentioned in section 2 1 the et algorithms used in the three products represent three typical et calculation methods each of these algorithms has its own advantages and limitations the gleam product first calculated pet with the priestley taylor equation and then tried to correct pet to et using a range of soil moisture stress factors miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 one of most prominent features of the gleam product is that the influence of the soil water stress on et was thoroughly considered based on a soil water balance model miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 this might be an important reason for the better performance achieved by gleam than by the other products a potential limitation of the et algorithms in the gleam product is the pet method i e priestley taylor equation this equation generally works well in humid climatic conditions where the aerodynamic term is relative small but fails to work in drier semiarid regions gunston and batchelor 1983 allen et al 1998 moreover it does not consider the impact of vegetation changes on pet both the gldas and ntsg products employed the physically based pm based equation for the et estimates and used a similar method i e jarvis based stomatal conduction equation to parameterize the canopy conductance specifically the canopy conductance in the jarvis based method is treated as a function of the maximum stomatal conductance and a series of dimensionless environmental stress functions that range from 0 to 1 jarvis 1976 among these environmental stress factors the soil water stress factor is critically important for plant transpiration suppression however this factor was implicitly considered by both the gldas and ntsg products with the vapor pressure deficit vpd it is potentially problematic to use vpd to reflect soil water stress for transpiration especially in drier regions some studies have reported that incorporating soil water stress into the canopy conduction calculation can improve et simulations therefore the improvement of et algorithms should highlight the importance of including the water stress module in model structures in addition it should be noted that the poor consistency with the reference et for the gldas product does not mean that its et algorithm is inferior to the algorithms of the other products the goal of gldas is to provide the optimal fields of the land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 which means that the objective of the default parameter settings and data assimilation in gldas is not limited to the accuracy of the et simulations this may be one of the reasons for the poor consistency of the gldas product with the reference et 4 4 future direction of improving et simulations to achieve better global scale et simulations the product developers should take full advantage of the complementary nature of satellite retrieval data and ground based observations thereby improving the quality of forcing data in addition developing an efficient scheme of parameter estimation can also greatly reduce the uncertainty of the et output whereas the difficulty in this regard is how to obtain a reliable benchmark data for parameter calibration unlike the river discharge observations et cannot be measured directly at a large scale as a water variable fisher et al 2017 large scale hydrological simulations are often unable to efficiently constrain et related parameter estimation in a model due to the lack of benchmark data resulting in unreasonable et estimates e g mean annual et estimates larger than mean annual pet or p the budyko framework provides a feasible solution to constrain et related parameter s in rs based et models lsms and hydrological models this framework accounts for the water and energy limits for et and can efficiently estimate long term et only using the climate aridity index pet p xu et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 zhang et al 2010b have utilized the long term et estimates from a budyko model to calibrate surface conductance in the pm equation across australia the et estimates using the calibrated surface conductance showed a good agreement with the ec based measurements xu et al 2013 have evaluated the et estimates from ntsg product globally using the budyko framework and found that the et estimates in many basins are physically unreasonable improvements in the et model algorithms should focus on incorporating or enhancing the parameterization scheme of water stress on et in the current et algorithms the gleam product might benefit from detailed parameterization scheme of water stress on et thereby achieving the better performance than the other products 5 summary and conclusions the major objective of this study is to compare and evaluate three global high resolution et products across china to fulfill this objective we first performed an intercomparison of the three et products to identify their consistencies and discrepancies in et estimates then the three products were separately evaluated at the site scale with ec based observations and at the basin scale with water balance based et estimates the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the three et products consistently showed an increasing trend in the annual et over a large proportion of china but large differences in the mean annual et estimates and the trend of the annual et on a countrywide scale the mean annual et derived from the gleam gldas and ntsg products are 390 2 443 4 and 419 9 mm yr respectively the trends of the annual et derived from the three products are 0 449 0 904 and 1 261 mm yr2 respectively 2 at the site scale gleam and ntsg showed comparable consistencies with the monthly observations and performed better than the gldas product gleam exhibited a better consistency than gldas with the daily observations 3 at the basin scale all the three products failed to reproduce the water balance based annual et time series over most basins in comparison gleam performed the best followed by ntsg and gldas moreover the three et products consistently overestimated the et compared to the water balance based et estimates in the wetter basins overall among the three products gleam shows the best consistency with the point observations and basin scale benchmark data we thus recommend this product as the preferred choice for application among the three products this study highlights that product users should carefully select et product s for basin scale applications and fully understand the potential risks caused by the uncertainty in the selected et product s this study offers useful information for product users to choose the appropriate et product s to conduct their specific studies or applications and also helps product developers to improve the accuracy of their et products acknowledgments this research was supported by the natural science foundation of china projects 41330529 41601034 and 41571024 the authors appreciate the

6972,relating stream dynamics to catchment properties is essential to anticipate the influence of changing environmental conditions and to predict flows of ungauged rivers although the importance of subsurface processes in catchment hydrology is widely acknowledged geological characteristics are rarely explicitly included in studies assessing physiographic controls on catchment dynamics in this investigation of 22 catchments of the swiss plateau and prealpes we use a simple linear regression approach to analyze the relationship between streamflow indicators and various geological and hydrogeological properties of the bedrock and quaternary deposits along with meteorological soil land use and topographical characteristics we use long term discharge percentiles as well as dimensionless flow duration curves fdc standardized by long term mean discharge that allow to evaluate the catchment response to climate forcing while climate conditions dominate the high to medium discharge percentiles q5 q50 the capacity of the catchments to buffer the meteorological forcing can only be attributed to geological characteristics the sandstone proportion in the catchments explains 54 of the variance of both extremities of the dimensionless fdc q5 qmean and q95 qmean and productive quaternary deposits are responsible of 55 resp 58 of the variance of the two ratios examining the hydrogeological characteristics of both bedrock and quaternary lithologies considerably improves the understanding of catchment dynamics keywords streamflow dynamics catchment classification geology hydrogeological properties bedrock 1 introduction stream discharge integrating hydrological processes across various spatial and temporal scales is a valuable indicator for the assessment of water resources understanding stream dynamics implies a thorough characterization of the influence of physical catchment properties on streamflow generating mechanisms this knowledge is essential for apprehending the behavior of ungauged rivers and predicting the dynamics of gauged ones in response to climate change consequently assessing how catchment properties influence streamflow dynamics is a central topic in hydrological research stream dynamics reflects infiltration evapotranspiration and interception overland flow and subsurface flows and is consequently influenced by various catchment characteristics related to vegetation soil topography and geology numerous studies have been dedicated to assessing the impact of these properties on the catchment response to the meteorological signal for instance in the framework of hydrological prediction in ungauged basins pub see reviews of hrachowitz et al 2013 or blöschl et al 2013 another series of studies focuses on expressing the flow duration curve fdc based on meteorological and geomorphological attributes e g müller et al 2014 pugliese et al 2014 castellarin et al 2004b castellarin et al 2007 botter et al 2007 doulatyari et al 2015 cheng et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 recession flow in unconfined hillslope aquifers is also a topic studied by many authors using the boussinesq equation either solved analytically or numerically e g brutsaert 1994 szilagyi et al 1998 verhoest and troch 2000 huyck et al 2005 paniconi et al 2003 troch et al 2003 pauwels et al 2003 rocha et al 2007 bartlett and porporato 2018 the relationships between catchment properties and dynamics are also widely used in regionalization methods which use these established correlations to extrapolate the hydrological understanding of gauged catchments to ungauged ones e g review by razavi and coulibaly 2013 among these numerous studies geological features are rarely considered while surface properties such as topography land use and soil are often taken into account the lack of geological consideration has been pointed out by several authors e g barthel 2014a barthel and banzhaf 2016 haaf and barthel 2018 bloomfield et al 2009 pointed out the often simplistic representation of geology in studies dedicated to catchment controls on baseflow and advocated for a more systematic quantification of the effect of geology on the baseflow index dassargues et al 1999 also pointed out the necessity to use three dimensional groundwater models for describing the impact of drought conditions on streamflow regimes in continuous streamflow regionalization studies razavi and coulibaly 2013 highlighted catchment area elevation and slope to be the most widely used properties considered by researchers he et al 2011 showed that among the 39 characteristics used in several reviewed studies drainage area is the most frequently used one followed by land use slope soil classification and elevation they suggest that emphasis should be placed on subsurface descriptors whose influence on catchment dynamics is less understood groundwater storage and release mechanisms defined by geological features impact catchment dynamics and are of particular relevance during dry periods when the contribution of aquifers to streamflow can be significant smakhtnin 2001 as stated by oudin et al 2008 in a comparison of regionalization methods the difficult characterization of the subsurface remains a major obstacle for the identification of the relevant catchment controls on streamflow based on regression analysis nonetheless a few studies have integrated geological characteristics and identified the influence of specific lithologies on streamflow ward and robinson 1990 for instance highlighted the role of geology in influencing the fdc shape of catchments in the uk based on multiple regression models bloomfield et al 2009 quantified the relative influence of various lithologies on the baseflow index both mayer and naman 2011 and jefferson et al 2008 have shown with their study based in california and oregon that the geology of the studied catchments significantly determines their response to climate change besides tague and grant 2004 pointed out the dominant control of a highly permeable volcanic unit on flow regime of this studied oregon region in other studies the importance of sandstone for streamflow dynamics has been identified its influence on mean transit time and its buffering effect on streamflow have been illustrated in two studies in montana jencso and mcglynn 2011 nippgen et al 2011 in switzerland the importance of sandstone in sustaining streamflow during dry periods has also been highlighted by naef et al 2015 these findings suggest that the bedrock plays an active storage role as proposed by the hydrologically active bedrock hypothesis uchida et al 2008 and that it can considerably contribute to baseflow andermann et al 2012 birkel et al 2014 welch and allen 2012 especially the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock seems to be of high relevance for storage processes hale et al 2016 pfister et al 2017 while alluvial aquifers are of major interest in hydrogeology their effect on streamflow has received little attention in hydrology it has however been shown that these hydrogeological units although limited in size can notably impact the catchment outflow under dry conditions käser and hunkeler 2016 the presence of permeable quaternary deposits can also affect streamflow if infiltration from the stream to the groundwater is important naef et al 2015 showed for instance that catchments for which discharge is measured after an infiltration section are often characterized by lower low flows these studies suggest that the understanding of catchment dynamics can benefit from considering the various geological units present in the catchment and their hydrogeological properties freeze and cherry 1979 already articulated the importance of considering a catchment as a combination of the surface drainage area and of subsurface soils and geological formations they even argued that subsurface hydrological processes might play a predominant role in the hydrological cycle as subsurface materials govern infiltration rates and thus determine surface runoff river networks are influenced by the configuration of the water table which is in turn defined by groundwater processes and the inherent geology subsurface flow is constrained by the three dimensional setting of geological deposits freeze and cherry 1979 and thus related to topography moreover the hydrogeological properties of the geological formations and especially their hydraulic conductivity determine groundwater flow rates as expressed by darcy s law moreover subsurface flow and the associated water table are dependent on recharge and thus on meteorological forcing studies by gleeson and manning 2008 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 welch and allen 2012 have identified the influence of topography recharge and hydraulic conductivity on subsurface processes which suggests that these features might also be relevant for catchment dynamics our aim is consequently to improve the understanding of streamflow dynamics by integrating detailed geological descriptors in a study of catchment controls on discharge the identification of the geological characteristics relevant to streamflow dynamics along with other possibly important catchment properties is primarily carried out using simple regression analysis the influence of the identified descriptors on streamflow indicators is then investigated individually although various statistical methods exist to assess this link kroll and song 2013 this simple approach is preferred to model based or more complex statistical methods as it prevents bias from the predefined model structure and parameterization moreover the multicollinearity effects inherent to multiple regression models kroll and song 2013 are avoided our scope is to provide observable predictors for the assessment of catchment dynamics for ungauged catchments or for changing environmental conditions by quantifying the influence of the various catchment properties on the whole streamflow range we aim at identifying the relevant physical features for water resources management data on geology soil land use topography and meteorological conditions are gathered for 22 swiss catchments located in the molasse basin and compared to their long term streamflow indicators the discharge indicators are composed of both absolute and normalized divided by the long term mean discharge discharge percentiles the dimensionless indices allow focusing on the dynamics of catchment response to precipitation sauquet and catalogne 2011 the meteorological impact being filtered out by the normalization the use of these various descriptors of stream dynamics might thus enable us to distinguish between the meteorological and the catchment impacts on streamflow indicators this study is built on two hypotheses hypothesis 1 if geology influences low flows as shown by various studies by defining the slow drainage units contributing to the river during dry periods it should also impact the higher streamflow range i e through storage processes during precipitation events hypothesis 2 geology as it strongly determines storage and release processes presumably influences the ability of the catchment to buffer the meteorological signal its impact on streamflow indicators should be identifiable if geological descriptors actually describe the capacity of geological formations to store and release water the paper is structured as follows a general outline of the methodology and the statistical analysis the criteria for catchment selection and the associated description of factors such as topography climatic forcing and geology is provided in the methods section the results first explore potential cross correlations between catchment properties followed by the analysis of the relationship between streamflow indicators as well as the meteorological and catchment properties in the final sections the results and implications for both hydrology and hydrogeology are discussed 2 method and catchment characteristics the relationship between streamflow indicators of a 20 years period 01 01 1993 31 12 2012 and catchment properties encompassing meteorological topographical soil and geological characteristics is analyzed for 22 swiss rivers using simple linear regression the investigated time period covers exceptionally dry years e g 2003 2011 as well as major flood events e g 2005 data describing topography soil land use geology and hydrogeology precipitation and evapotranspiration as well as discharge are compiled the discharge indicators are obtained from both the absolute and the dimensionless flow duration curves fdc the flow duration curve is a widely used tool to characterize streamflow dynamics see e g review by smakhtnin 2001 the dimensionless fdc obtained by averaging the discharge percentiles by a long term discharge mean and also known as the index flow approach has been used in various studies notably for catchment intercomparison and regionalization purposes castellarin et al 2004a holmes et al 2002 sauquet and catalogne 2011 ganora et al 2009 the standardization allows focusing on the shape of the curve and hence more on the dynamics rather than on the absolute magnitude of discharge that way the dependency of streamflow indicators on climate conditions is minimized and the specificities of the catchment response to meteorological forcing are better identifiable the influence of meteorological and catchment characteristics on streamflow dynamics is quantified using a linear regression model between each streamflow indicator and the catchment descriptor the coefficient of determination r2 is computed as follows for each relationship and corresponds to the proportion of the variance of the streamflow indicator y explained by the linear model based on the catchment characteristic lm p n being the number of studied catchments and i each catchment r 2 1 i n y i l m p i 2 i n y i y 2 the calculation is also applied between catchment and meteorological characteristics in this way potential interdependencies between physical properties and or climate conditions are identified 2 1 catchment selection and description the geographic location of the 22 catchments is shown in fig 1 and the most relevant characteristics are summarised in table 1 details on how the indicators have been derived are provided in the following sections we investigate catchments of the swiss plateau and prealpes located in the molasse basin indicated by yellow lines in fig 1 we focus on catchments that are part of the same broad geological environment the molasse to explore in detail its hydrogeological variability and the impact of its different lithologies on streamflow indicators besides this selection excludes regions dominated by glaciers and snow see hydrological regime in table 1 additional criteria for the choice of the catchments are the absence of lakes and of important anthropogenic influences which could influence the water balance e g dams for electricity production or inter basin water transfers finally the quality of the discharge measurements was also considered in particular the low flow range for example some measurement stations indicate that below a certain threshold the reliability of the measurements cannot be guaranteed the surfaces areas of the catchments range from 0 6 to 416 km2 and they are located at mean altitudes from 467 to 1159 m the following hydrological regimes are represented all of them being characterized by moderate seasonal amplitude prealpine nivo pluvial superior pluvial inferior pluvial jurassic pluvial weingartner and anschwanden 1992 the land cover consists principally of a mixture of rural fields and forest 2 2 topography the geographic information system quantum gis qgis development team 2014 is used to obtain topographical features and for other operations requiring gis support based on a digital terrain model dhm25 grid cell resolution of 25 produced by the swiss federal of topography swisstopo the following characteristics are calculated for each catchment see table 1 elevation area maximum elevation difference longest distance straight line from catchment boundary to outlet max l to outlet width to length ratio aspect ratio river network density mean and maximum catchment surface slope total catchment volume above outlet total vol and topographical wetness index twi mean see beven and kirkby 1979 for the calculation of the twi combining the digital model and stream order data strahler stream order swiss federal office for the environment foen allows for calculating the following properties mean slope

derived from the aptitude map of swiss soils swiss federal office for agriculture that define the following aspects depth stone content structure wetness hydraulic conductivity and capacity for water storage 2 4 geology and hydrogeology for the characterization of the bedrock geology the geocover dataset 1 25000 geological vector datasets swisstopo is used this dataset provides a digitalized compilation of swiss geological maps that allows evaluating the percentage of selected lithologies at the surface in a certain catchment with the purpose of a hydrogeological classification of the bedrock occurring in the catchments we first organized the molasse in four lithologies and then attributed these lithologies with average values for hydraulic conductivity k from existing hydrogeological studies on the molasse balderer 1997 gander 2004 keller 1992 waber et al 2014 it is noteworthy that few studies aiming at a hydrogeological overview of the molasse exist for our study keller 1992 is particularly useful because this work discusses the varying molasse lithologies following a n s transect through the basin and it provides average hydraulic conductivities for these lithologies the four bedrock lithologies with corresponding hydraulic conductivities for the hydrogeological characterization of the selected catchments are marine sandstone sandstone k 10 4 10 5 m s fan conglomerate fan k 10 6 10 8 m s fine grained deposit fine grained k 10 7 10 11 m s and the subalpine molasse sub molasse k 10 5 10 7 m s the marine sandstone results from deposits in a beach like environment dominated by tidal processes these sandstones may represent regional aquifers that are separated from each other by finer grained deposits keller 1992 the fan conglomerates represent the coarse grained fluvial deposits deposited proximally to the alps while the fine grained deposits primarily silt and clay with some sand lenses represent the distal deposits of the alpine debris both are in general considered as aquitards with locally occurring permeable layers keller 1992 the subalpine molasse is the part of the molasse that was tectonically overthrusted onto the molasse basin and that has therefore experienced substantial stress and compaction therefore the subalpine molasse has a low primary porosity but might be importantly fractured due to uplift and decompression and therefore act as a fractured aquifer for every catchment the surface percentage of each lithology is calculated sandstone fan fine grained sub molasse and an average hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is estimated using the hydraulic conductivities from the literature for the four lithologies table 1 quaternary hydrogeology is characterized based on available 2d and 3d data 2d hydrogeological data hydrogeological map of switzerland groundwater resources 1 500 000 swisstopo is used to spatially delineate productive quaternary deposits in 2d obtaining the productive aquifer surface as a percentage of the total catchment area 2d prod quat the geomol product which models the top of the bedrock surface diepolder et al 2013 enables to calculate volumes of quaternary deposits for each catchment the raster of the top of the bedrock surface is subtracted from the surface raster the total volume of quaternary deposits in each catchment and per total catchment area is thus obtained tot quat vol per surface the raster of the top of the bedrock is also used to calculate the mean slope of the quaternary base quat slope combining the geomol raster and the 2d hydrogeological map of productive aquifers it is possible to calculate the productive quaternary volume of each catchment expressed as volume per total catchment area prod quat vol per surface to obtain it the 2d extent of productive aquifers is used as a clip to extract the volume of productive quaternary deposits from the total quaternary deposits in doing so it is assumed that the aquifers marked as productive in the 2d dataset are productive across their entire thickness the productive quaternary volume is also expressed as percentage of the total rock volume or total vol defined previously in the catchment obtaining prod quat vol 2 5 precipitation and evapotranspiration daily precipitation data for the studied period 01 01 1993 31 12 2012 are calculated from gridded data frei 2014 provided by the national meteorological service of switzerland meteoswiss by averaging the spatially distributed values for each catchment area mean annual actual evapotranspiration is obtained from the spatially distributed model proposed by hades hydrological atlas of switzerland table 4 1 see also https www bafu admin ch bafu en home topics water state maps hydrological atlas of switzerland hades html the number of dry days per year is averaged over the 20 years studied in order to evaluate precipitation dynamics daily precipitation intensities are sorted separately for each year in the decreasing order these classified values are then averaged over the 20 years and plotted against the number of days per year when the intensity is reached the obtained curve is comparable to the flow duration curve fdc see section 2 6 for streamflows for each catchment the obtained precipitation duration curve is fitted with the following equation pdc d a b dk d being the days 1 365 and a b and k referred to as pdc a pdc b and pdc k the calibrated parameters used to quantify the precipitation dynamics 2 6 discharge all the investigated rivers are part of the swiss national river monitoring network and daily discharge measurements for the period 01 01 1993 31 12 2012 are obtained from the foen three catchments of the selection are nested in other basins langete in murg walliselen luthern in wigger and murg wängi in murg frauenfeld to assess the general behavior of the 22 catchments streamflow indicators are based on the 20 years period 01 01 1993 31 12 2012 streamflow is described by means of 1 absolute percentiles of discharge q5 to q95 expressed in mm day 2 ratios of percentiles q5 q50 q95 q50 and q95 q5 and 3 ratios and characteristics derived from the dimensionless flow duration curve fdcnorm the percentiles are obtained from the flow duration curve fdc that is calculated for each year and averaged over the 20 year period the absolute values describe the magnitude of discharge from high flows q5 the discharge exceeded 5 of the time to low flows q95 the discharge exceeded 95 of the time the normalized flow indicators 2 and 3 allow filtering out the effect of climate and water balance issues and can thus be interpreted as descriptors of how catchments buffer the meteorological signal from now on we refer to these indicators as normalized streamflow indicators as opposed to absolute streamflow indicators we define the buffering potential as the dampening effect the catchment exerts on the precipitation signal the more stable the streamflow dynamics the higher this buffering potential conversely a low buffering potential implies erratic stream dynamics with high peaks and low flows close to zero the ratios q5 q50 resp q95 q50 describe the variability of flows in the higher resp the lower part of the fdc whereas q95 q5 is the ratio between low and high flows the dimensionless flow duration curve fdcnorm is obtained by normalizing the flow percentiles with a long term index flow generally corresponding to the mean annual discharge the yearly absolute discharge percentiles are divided by the yearly mean and the resulting yearly fdcnorm is averaged over the 20 years specific points of the fdcnorm are analyzed in this study the standardized high flow and low flow percentiles q5 qmean resp q95 qmean the shape of the fdcnorm is also quantified with a parametric approach the curve is fitted with the following equation fdcnorm calc d a b dk d being the days 1 to 365 and a b and k the calibrated parameters the calibration is done on the logarithmic value of the fdcnorm to best reproduce low flow dynamics the k parameter of the equation kfdc norm is used as streamflow indicator to describe the shape of the curve 2 7 water balances a first step towards assessing the catchment response to the meteorological forcing is to assess the long term water balance which is established by averaging the equation terms net precipitation and catchment outflow over numerous years to exclude storage effects from one year to the other the ratio of annual discharge to annual net precipitation precipitation evapotranspiration is thus averaged for the 20 years period to account for the uncertainty related to the estimation of evapotranspiration the ratio is calculated with 10 higher and lower evapotranspiration rates the resulting ratio with uncertainty margins is plotted in fig 2 the majority of the catchments have ratios close to one which indicates that their water balance is closed however the ratio is consequentially smaller than one even when considering uncertainty margins for the following river catchments biber ilfis luthern sense and wigger in the case of luthern surface flow constitutes only 60 of the net input to the catchment this indicates that an important amount of water might exit the catchment as groundwater unnoticed by the gauging station the hydrometric stations should ideally be located on a geological unit that is impervious enough to prevent substantial groundwater flow under the station this is however not the case for all catchments except for the biber the location of the gauging stations of the catchments with q p et ratios lower than 1 is not adequate as they are situated on top of permeable quaternary deposits for the luthern and wigger catchments a local study arbeitsgemeinschaft grundwasserforschung luthern und wiggertal 1978 estimates the groundwater flow in the river section close to the gauging stations to 0 108 m3 s resp 0 367 m3 s the water balance ratios corrected with the groundwater flow are shown in red in fig 2 in both cases the ratio increases although the improvement is limited further reasons for the inability to close the water balance could be higher evapotranspiration and precipitation uncertainties a discrepancy between the hydrological and the hydrogeological catchment leading to groundwater losses to neighboring catchments or inter basin transfers that have not been identified although the water balance discrepancies are not corrected identifying catchments with unclosed water balances can help to identify a biased interpretation of catchment dynamics 3 results 3 1 analysis of interdependency among catchment properties and meteorological conditions before analyzing the influence of catchment properties and precipitation on streamflow indicators the interdependency among meteorological topographical and geological characteristics is assessed identifying potential cross correlations between the descriptors is crucial to avoid attributing an effect of a specific catchment property on streamflow that is actually due to another characteristic mean elevation and mean net precipitation are strongly linearly and positively correlated r2 74 due to orographic lifting consequently various catchment properties that vary with altitude also exhibit a notable correlation with meteorological conditions the following topographical properties are affected mean catchment slope smallest stream slope and the topographical wetness index are correlated to elevation r2 of 86 78 resp 68 and to mean net precipitation r2 of 59 47 resp 44 the soil depth and storage capacity decrease with elevation r2 of 61 resp 71 and are also correlated to mean net precipitation r2 of 81 resp 60 the high correlation between mean net precipitation and soil depth is due to both the elevation dependency of soil characteristics and the fact that the evapotranspiration values used in this study are calculated based on the soil depth data finally the percentage of subalpine molasse and fine grained material are to a lesser extent correlated to mean net precipitation r2 of 51 resp 39 which can partially be attributed to the dependency on altitude r2 of 28 resp 46 for all the mentioned catchment characteristics potential correlations to streamflow indicators should be considered with care as precipitation likely strongly governs streamflow the listed properties might be correlated to discharge indicators even though no physical link exists between them besides the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock of each catchment see methodology section is highly correlated to the percentage of sandstone present in the catchment r2 99 5 sandstone is characterized by the highest hydraulic conductivity among the identified lithologies and thus exerts a dominating impact on the estimated hydraulic conductivity for catchments with sandstone for the catchments lacking sandstone the influences of the other lithologies on the calculated hydraulic conductivity are mixed 3 2 relationship between streamflow indicator catchment and meteorological properties 3 2 1 overview fig 3 gives an overview of the influence of all climate and catchment characteristics on streamflow indicators and allows identifying relevant characteristics for stream dynamics whose importance will be quantified and discussed in next section in total 33 catchment properties describing topography soil land use and geology and 7 meteorological indices are compared to 14 streamflow indicators streamflow indicators are split into two groups indicators based on absolute numbers discharge percentiles and mean discharge and indicators related to the normalized flow duration curve along with ratios of discharge percentiles the control of mean precipitation p mean and net mean precipitation p et on the absolute discharge percentiles q5 q70 i e except the lower ones is obviously dominant most of the catchment properties that seem to influence absolute streamflow indicators correspond to the characteristics that are strongly correlated to precipitation as indicated by the red vertical dotted lines in fig 3 other features such as the proportion of 1st order stream and bedrock hydraulic conductivity k bedrock show a certain relationship to the indicators based on absolute numbers but their impact is negligible compared to the dominant control of precipitation on these indicators the discharge indicators q90 and q95 describing low flows are the only streamflow indicators that are not correlated significantly r2 20 to any catchment or climate characteristics the results are distinctly different from the relative indicators by expressing streamflow dynamics with ratios or percentiles normalized by mean discharge the impact of precipitation is excluded as illustrated by the small variance explained by meteorological properties consequently the catchment properties correlated to precipitation and thus to absolute streamflow indicators are not correlated to the relative streamflow indicators the only characteristics revealing a notable relationship to the indicators describing streamflow dynamics are the geological properties especially the quaternary feature 2d prod quat the surface proportion of catchment occupied by productive quaternary deposits as well as the bedrock hydraulic conductivity and thus the proportion of sandstone are relevant also worth mentioning is the higher influence of the productive quaternary descriptors prod quat vol per surface prod quat vol compared to total quaternary descriptors tot quat vol per surface the proportion of 1st order stream and to a lesser extent the depth and hydraulic conductivity of the soil characteristics explain a certain part of the variance of the relative indicators even though their explanatory value is smaller 3 2 2 assessment of the influence of identified relevant characteristics on streamflow dynamics based on the previous section the characteristics exerting the highest influence on streamflow indicators r2 40 are selected for further investigation see fig 4 detailed version of fig 3 catchment properties that are correlated to precipitation and thus to specific absolute streamflow indicators are left out as we assume that precipitation the input to the catchment is the main driver of streamflow magnitude for climate forcing only mean net precipitation is kept for quaternary features we here focus on the proportion of productive 2d quaternary deposits as the correlation is slightly higher than for the 3d descriptor and the 2d descriptor is easier to obtain the importance of the 3d characteristic will however be subsequently discussed 3 2 2 1 absolute streamflow indicators net mean precipitation p et explains 88 of the variance of mean discharge and between 81 and 89 of the variance of the discharge percentiles characterizing the higher part of the absolute flow duration curve q5 to q30 from q30 to the low flow indicator q95 a clear decreasing trend of the importance of precipitation on discharge percentile is observed only 20 of the variance of q90 is for instance explained by mean net precipitation and the correlation is insignificant for q95 p value 0 1 as mentioned previously no catchment or climatic characteristic explains a substantial proportion of the variance of q95 this is further illustrated in fig 5 the coefficient of determination for the q5 estimation based on mean net precipitation is of 81 p value 9 74e 9 as q95 is both dependent on precipitation and catchment properties we divide the indicator by the net mean precipitation to focus on the influence of the latter q95 pnet right subplot b in the x axis a linear regression model composed of the percentage of sandstone and the percentage of productive quaternary deposits whose parameters are fitted against q95 pnet see equation above fig 5 b the correlation between q95 pnet or the part of net precipitation that will be released during dry periods and the model based on geological parameters is characterized by a r2 of 55 p value 7 19e 5 for the biber and especially the luthern catchments the q95 pnet ratio is considerably underestimated by geological factors as indicated by their unclosed water balance fig 2 this discrepancy might be due to groundwater flowing out of the catchment without being measured at the gauging station in the case of the glatt langeten and murg walliswil catchments actual low flows are higher than the estimation based on sandstone and quaternary deposits other storage units in the catchment such as soil or local geological units that are not accounted for might contribute substantially to the stream in the absence of rain 3 2 2 2 streamflow ratios and dimensionless fdc descriptors the normalised flow percentiles describing both the high q5 qmean q5 q50 and the low q95 qmean q95 q50 parts of the dimensionless flow duration curve highlighted by a red rectangle in fig 4 are characterised by similar percentage of explained variance attributed to the catchment properties 37 44 by the topographical feature of 1st order stream 48 58 by the proportion of productive quaternary aquifer 47 52 by the hydraulic conductivity of bedrock and 49 54 by the proportion of sandstone with p values equal or smaller to 10 3 for all these relationships fig 4 the recession parameter of the dimensionless flow duration curve k of fdc which also describes its shape is slightly more correlated to bedrock 50 52 than to quaternary 41 characteristics and not significantly explained by the topographical feature 16 as expected due to their high interdependency bedrock hydraulic conductivity and proportion of sandstone indicate similar r2 values the correlation between the logarithm of the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock and relative streamflow indicators is however rather limited r2 of 24 36 this suggests that the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock might be a less efficient predictor for catchments with low hydraulic conductivity i e the catchments without sandstone when the hydraulic conductivity of bedrock is limited other catchment characteristics potentially have a higher explanatory potential moreover the variability of estimated hydraulic conductivities in the absence of sandstone is smaller as the permeabilities of the other geological lithologies are more similar among these remaining geological units none seem to exert a dominant impact on streamflow fig 6 illustrates the relationship between the relevant catchment characteristics sandstone and productive quaternary deposits and the normalized high q5 qmean and low q95 qmean flow percentiles discussed above higher proportions of permeable geological units sandstone and quaternary deposits generally imply higher normalized low flow subplots a and b and lower normalized high flow percentiles subplots c and d fig 7 explores in more detail the relationships between geology and the normalized discharge indicators in the left scatter plots a and b the normalized high and low discharge percentiles are strongly correlated r2 93 to each other the location of the catchment along that line strongly depends on geology as indicated by the size of circles that are proportional to the sandstone proportion a and to the proportion of productive quaternary deposits b on the right side of fig 7 c catchments are sorted according to decreasing q95 qmean the classification hence approximately following the high low percentile correlation line from top left to bottom right of subplots a and b high q95 qmean and low q5 qmean ratios imply moderate streamflow dynamics and reflect a high buffering potential of the catchment which substantially dampens the precipitation signal the 6 catchments with the highest buffering potential correspond to the basins composed of the highest percentage of sandstone orange bar plots 60 to 80 in the 6 cases the proportion of productive quaternary deposits coral bar plots is also significant the buffering potential of the catchment is not guaranteed for high proportion of productive quaternary only as illustrated for instance by the alp and aach catchments to better quantify the importance of quaternary deposits the volume of productive quaternary averaged by catchment area is included in black in fig 7 the productive quaternary deposits although covering a considerable percentage of the alp and the aach catchments are rather limited in terms of volume which might explain the relatively low buffering potential of the two basins the guerbe catchment is characterized by the more important relative volume of productive quaternary despite these important deposits and similar sandstone percentage its buffering potential is lower than in the case of murg walliswil langeten and wigger a more detailed investigation of the valley fillings of the guerbe valley based on the hydrogeological map of switzerland sarine region 1 100 000 swisstopo indicated however that the deposits are rather heterogeneous with local fine grained and lacustrine clay units that act as an aquitard the volume of productive quaternary deposits is therefore overestimated in the case of the guerbe considering this correction fig 7 thus suggests that for catchments with a high percentage of sandstone the volume of productive quaternary deposits averaged by surface might be the second factor determining the buffering potential of the catchment we also observe that the murg waengi and murg frauenfeld catchments although lacking sandstone have a relatively high buffering potential that might be owed to the very important volume of productive quaternary deposits 4 discussion 4 1 climate and catchment controls on streamflow dynamics numerous catchment properties describing topography soil land use and geology as well as meteorological characteristics are compared to both absolute and normalized streamflow indicators while climate forcing is dominant on the high to medium absolute flow indicators this influence decreases for low flows and the buffering influence of the catchment becomes relevant these results are consistent with the findings of yaeger et al 2012 who showed that whereas the middle part of the flow duration curve is influenced by the precipitation the low flow end of the curve reflects catchment characteristics moreover our results show that the use of the dimensionless flow duration curve and discharge indicators indeed allow distinguishing how the catchment buffers the precipitation signal based on the results illustrated in fig 3 we propose a conceptualization of climate and catchment control on absolute and normalized long term flow duration curve fig 8 both high and low flow normalized percentiles q5 qmean and q95 qmean i e the two vertical extremes of the curve are dominated by the physical catchment properties and are highly correlated to each other catchments with high q95 qmean and hence relatively high low flows feature an important buffering potential for these catchments storage is substantial during precipitation events and their normalized high flows are thus limited the dimensionless flow duration curve of such catchments will be flatter than for catchments with low buffering potential their curve following more closely the dynamics of precipitation this distribution of streamflow between high and low ranges i e the shape of the normalized curve depends mainly on catchment properties although the mean net precipitation varies considerably among the 22 studied catchments up to 1000 mm yearly difference the seasonal distribution of precipitation is rather homogeneous due to their proximity and relatively small differences in altitude in this study the different amplitudes of the dimensionless flow duration curve are thus mainly due to varying catchment properties for catchments with different precipitation regimes the shape difference of the curve might however also be influenced by the meteorological signal nonetheless the comparison of dimensionless flow duration curves between catchments of similar precipitation regimes is a highly valuable approach to compare catchment buffering potentials this way the resilience of catchments to climatic changes and their sensitivity to dry periods can for instance be compared 4 2 the influence of geology on the buffering potential of catchments fig 3 illustrates that among the 33 catchment properties describing topography soil land use and geology a clear relationship can only be observed between the geological characteristics and the normalized streamflow indicators the obtained correlations r2 around 50 are slightly lower than the values indicated for instance by tague and grant 2004 or pfister et al 2017 76 for the correlation between summer streamflow and the portion of highly permeable volcanic rock resp 64 between the impervious part of the catchment and the ratio of summer and winter flow these studies however focus on specific periods of the year whereas we presently consider the entire streamflow range the p values of the correlations between the relevant geological descriptors and relative streamflow indicators however are all equal or smaller to 10 3 suggesting that they are statistically significant considering the widely used 95 confidence interval these findings suggest that the degree of buffering of the precipitation signal exerted by the catchment is mainly governed by geology as assumed in the introduction 1st hypothesis geology not only influences low flow dynamics but equally impacts the entire dimensionless flow duration curve including q5 qmean the consideration of geological units by taking into account their hydrogeological characteristics thus leads to a better understanding of catchment dynamics our results suggest that both the bedrock and quaternary alluvial fillings considerably impact streamflow dynamics 4 2 1 bedrock geology in the studied region of the swiss plateau and prealpes marine sandstone seems to significantly influence the ability of the catchment to generate a continuous streamflow this geological unit being relatively permeable 10 5 to 10 4 m s as illustrated in fig 7 catchments with the highest buffering potential are all mainly composed of sandstone 60 80 of their surface this molasse type or any geological formation with similar hydrogeological properties seems to be a prerequisite for high normalized low flows its hydraulic conductivity is high enough to store water in the subsurface during precipitation events and low enough to still contribute to streamflow after prolonged dry spells as an illustration the estimated hydraulic conductivity of sandstone 10 5 m s for the calculation corresponds to a daily rate of 864 mm d and the hydraulic conductivity of fine grained material can optimistically reach a value of 8 64 mm d 10 7 m s sandstone can store large amounts of water and consequently considerably buffer rainfall events whereas the second only allows the infiltrating of a limited portion this buffering potential of sandstone on streamflow corresponds to the findings of various studies jencso mcglynn 2011 nippgen et al 2011 naef et al 2015 more generally these results support the various case studies that highlighted the importance of the hydraulic conductivity of bedrock for low flows tague and grant 2004 pfister et al 2017 giving credit to the hypothesis of the hydrologically active bedrock uchida et al 2008 4 2 2 quaternary deposits our study also shows the relative importance of productive quaternary deposits for streamflow dynamics these aquifers although limited in size can contribute substantially to outflow as suggested by the case study by käser and hunkeler 2016 the integration of total versus productive quaternary deposits characteristics highlight the importance of using appropriate hydro geological descriptors whereas the total volume of quaternary deposits in the catchments tot quat vol per surface is not correlated to streamflow indicators the exclusive consideration of the productive portion of these deposits prod quat vol per surface allows linking the presence of quaternary aquifers to streamflow dynamics see fig 3 it is thus crucial that the geological characterization of catchments for hydrological purposes focuses on the hydrogeological productivity of the various geological units our results suggest that the use of 2d hydrogeological information describing the productivity of the aquifers already leads to a substantial explanatory power of quaternary deposits on streamflow dynamics e g r2 of 58 between q95 qmean and 2d prod quat looking at the volumes of these deposits further improves the analysis of the relationship between geology and catchment dynamics in several cases see fig 7 however the overall correlation between the 3d quaternary indicator prod quat vol per surface and streamflow dynamics is not higher than with the 2d descriptor 2d prod quat this can be attributed to the assumption that quaternary deposits are homogeneous in terms of hydraulic conductivity it highlights the importance of characterizing the heterogeneity of these structures as illustrated with the guerbe catchment fig 7 moreover in a more local context the presence of permeable quaternary deposits under the gauging station of the catchment can have a determining impact on the measured streamflow and on the water balance as illustrated in fig 2 specific outlet configurations will result in unclosed water balances 4 3 buffering potential and dynamic storage a groundwater perspective as defined previously the buffering potential of the catchment on the precipitation signal can be assimilated to the dynamic storage of the catchment commonly defined as the storage that governs streamflow dynamics buttle 2016 it describes how much water can be stored during precipitation events and subsequently released to the stream the results of the present study suggest that catchments with relatively permeable geological units have a high buffering potential on precipitation and hence a notable dynamic storage in the framework of groundwater studies bedrock hydraulic conductivity and meteorological input expressed as recharge are commonly related to assess flow processes gleeson and manning 2008 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 welch and allen 2012 gleeson and manning 2008 and haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 notably have highlighted the influence of the ratio between recharge and hydraulic conductivity r k along with topographical considerations on the water table configuration groundwater levels in turn impact the partitioning of precipitation into recharge to groundwater and contribution to local stream network briefly stated the mentioned authors show that a high r k ratio generally implies a water table located close to the surface topography controlled whereas a low ratio indicates that the water table is recharge controlled in the first case high r k ratio the dynamic storage of the catchment is limited as the water table is constrained by topography during precipitation events the overland flow is substantial and less water is stored and contributions to stream during dry periods are thus limited when r k is low the water table fluctuates according to recharge the dynamic storage and hence the buffering potential of the catchment is important the ratio of 1st order stream is the only topographical characteristic explaining a considerable part of the variance of the normalized discharge percentiles 38 44 and provides another similarity with the study by gleeson and manning 2008 our results suggest that streamflow dynamics of catchments with a less dense upper stream network will likely be more stable low peaks and high low flows using a groundwater modeling approach in mountainous terrain the study by gleeson and manning 2008 shows that the percentage length of first order stream with perennial flow comparable to of 1st order stream is a function of the water table which in turn depends on the r k ratio they demonstrate that in case of low percentage of 1st order stream less developed upper stream network the relative recharge contribution to regional groundwater flow is more important under the assumption that this groundwater flow contributes to the stabilization of streamflow dynamics i e higher buffering potential of the catchment our results are consistent with gleeson and manning 2008 in this sense the ratio of 1st order stream thus reflects the r k ratio and the geological characteristics of the catchment as it is directly impacted by infiltration and groundwater processes these considerations should however be further investigated as the resulting correlations are rather limited 4 4 importance of other catchment properties for streamflow dynamics topography and soil as they impact overland flow infiltration and subsurface processes are frequently identified amongst the most important controls on streamflow dynamics in the introduction some of these classical studies are cited our results suggest a more differentiated picture and only partially confirm their importance in fact except for the percentage of 1st order stream discussed before our results suggest that no soil and topography characteristics explain an important part of the variance of normalized streamflow indicators our results do not exclude the importance of soil characteristics in e g humid regions with low relief and do not exclude that other physiographic characteristics might be relevant for regions with climate and relief different to the swiss plateau also if a catchments surface is impermeable owing to e g widespread soil compaction or urbanization which is not the case in our catchments the soil might constitute the limiting factor for infiltration and thus largely control the catchments dynamics nevertheless our results suggest that the relative importance of soil characteristics has so far been overestimated especially compared to the importance of deeper geological units in steeper regions there are several reasons for this as suggested by various studies haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 welch and allen 2012 both topography and hydrogeological properties constrain streamflow dynamics in a combined way and a unique identification of their influence is challenging especially if the hydrogeological properties are not or only partially considered moreover even if some of the topographical and soil characteristics can be related to absolute streamflow indicators these relationships can be biased by their correlation to precipitation finally as opposed to the classical hydrological studies in catchment hydrology discussed in the introduction our analysis considers the subsurface in a more explicit way this additional consideration naturally reduces the relative importance of surface features even though this study goes far beyond the geological information considered in previous studies more data for the conceptualization of the subsurface would be highly desirable for example assessing characteristics of distinct geological units with their specific storage and geometry might improve our understanding of the relationship between catchment properties and dynamics such data are however rarely available to date 5 conclusions and implications in this study a total of 33 characteristics describing catchment topography soil land use and geology are compared to streamflow indicators along with various meteorological indices our approach distinguishes itself from previous studies by including geological characteristics that describe the capacity of different lithologies to store and release water i e their hydrogeological properties and by considering both the large scale geological environment bedrock and the local scale quaternary deposits the following conclusions can be drawn for the wide range of catchments we analyzed geology has by far the largest influence of all catchment characteristics both for low flow as well as for high flow conditions hypothesis 1 our results further confirm that the geological characteristics substantially determine the ability of the catchment to buffer the meteorological signal hypothesis 2 these results underline the crucial need to take into account groundwater dynamics as well as geological factors in hydrological studies we show that both the general geological environment bedrock and the more local scale quaternary deposits influence the catchments response to precipitation this highlights the necessity of considering the hydrogeological productivity of both the bedrock and quaternary deposits there is an especially large potential for including the bedrock a so far rarely considered geological unit in hydrological studies in general these results demonstrate that the mere classification of aquifers into wide categories e g unconsolidated porous and fractured is not adequate for describing the hydro geo logical setting of catchments and thus should not be used in catchment classification schemes high and low flow indicators are highly correlated an important outcome that can provide insights into a catchments behavior under changing climatic conditions the flow duration curve is influenced by different geological units more specifically bedrock and more permeable quaternary deposits the reproduction of a catchments response to climatic forcing will thus benefit from an explicit consideration of these different lithologies the explicit consideration of the bedrock is expected to be especially useful for the simulation of low flow dynamics the presence of relatively permeable lithologies is an indicator of an important dynamic groundwater storage and thus sustained low flows sandstone like porous lithologies which feature a rather high hydraulic conductivity e g 10 5 m s have a potentially high buffering effect on climate forcing and are thus favorable for the contribution to low flows the presence of permeable and vertically extended quaternary deposits is also correlated to higher normalized low flows due to the slow yet sustained release of groundwater the importance of high quality geological data describing both the bedrock and the alluvial aquifers is emphasized in this study even though the geological characterization in our study goes far beyond the geological assessment in comparable studies there is room for improvement for example more information concerning the slopes volumes specific storage or specific yields of the bedrock would certainly contribute to our current hydrological understanding we are convinced that the scientific community will strongly benefit from increasing the efforts to characterize the subsurface rather than continue to focus on easily accessible surface characteristics of catchments projects such as geomol assessing subsurface potentials of the alpine foreland basins for sustainable planning and use of natural resources diepolder et al 2013 that characterize bedrock and quaternary deposits are thus of crucial importance to improve our current understanding of catchment dynamics 6 conflict of interest none acknowledgments most of this work was funded by the swiss federal office for the environment foen we thank the two reviewers

6972,relating stream dynamics to catchment properties is essential to anticipate the influence of changing environmental conditions and to predict flows of ungauged rivers although the importance of subsurface processes in catchment hydrology is widely acknowledged geological characteristics are rarely explicitly included in studies assessing physiographic controls on catchment dynamics in this investigation of 22 catchments of the swiss plateau and prealpes we use a simple linear regression approach to analyze the relationship between streamflow indicators and various geological and hydrogeological properties of the bedrock and quaternary deposits along with meteorological soil land use and topographical characteristics we use long term discharge percentiles as well as dimensionless flow duration curves fdc standardized by long term mean discharge that allow to evaluate the catchment response to climate forcing while climate conditions dominate the high to medium discharge percentiles q5 q50 the capacity of the catchments to buffer the meteorological forcing can only be attributed to geological characteristics the sandstone proportion in the catchments explains 54 of the variance of both extremities of the dimensionless fdc q5 qmean and q95 qmean and productive quaternary deposits are responsible of 55 resp 58 of the variance of the two ratios examining the hydrogeological characteristics of both bedrock and quaternary lithologies considerably improves the understanding of catchment dynamics keywords streamflow dynamics catchment classification geology hydrogeological properties bedrock 1 introduction stream discharge integrating hydrological processes across various spatial and temporal scales is a valuable indicator for the assessment of water resources understanding stream dynamics implies a thorough characterization of the influence of physical catchment properties on streamflow generating mechanisms this knowledge is essential for apprehending the behavior of ungauged rivers and predicting the dynamics of gauged ones in response to climate change consequently assessing how catchment properties influence streamflow dynamics is a central topic in hydrological research stream dynamics reflects infiltration evapotranspiration and interception overland flow and subsurface flows and is consequently influenced by various catchment characteristics related to vegetation soil topography and geology numerous studies have been dedicated to assessing the impact of these properties on the catchment response to the meteorological signal for instance in the framework of hydrological prediction in ungauged basins pub see reviews of hrachowitz et al 2013 or blöschl et al 2013 another series of studies focuses on expressing the flow duration curve fdc based on meteorological and geomorphological attributes e g müller et al 2014 pugliese et al 2014 castellarin et al 2004b castellarin et al 2007 botter et al 2007 doulatyari et al 2015 cheng et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 recession flow in unconfined hillslope aquifers is also a topic studied by many authors using the boussinesq equation

bartlett and porporato 2018 the relationships between catchment properties and dynamics are also widely used in regionalization methods which use these established correlations to extrapolate the hydrological understanding of gauged catchments to ungauged ones e g review by razavi and coulibaly 2013 among these numerous studies geological features are rarely considered while surface properties such as topography land use and soil are often taken into account the lack of geological consideration has been pointed out by several authors e g barthel 2014a barthel and banzhaf 2016 haaf and barthel 2018 bloomfield et al 2009 pointed out the often simplistic representation of geology in studies dedicated to catchment controls on baseflow and advocated for a more systematic quantification of the effect of geology on the baseflow index dassargues et al 1999 also pointed out the necessity to use three dimensional groundwater models for describing the impact of drought conditions on streamflow regimes in continuous streamflow regionalization studies razavi and coulibaly 2013 highlighted catchment area elevation and slope to be the most widely used properties considered by researchers he et al 2011 showed that among the 39 characteristics used in several reviewed studies drainage area is the most frequently used one followed by land use slope soil classification and elevation they suggest that emphasis should be placed on subsurface descriptors whose influence on catchment dynamics is less understood groundwater storage and release mechanisms defined by geological features impact catchment dynamics and are of particular relevance during dry periods when the contribution of aquifers to streamflow can be significant smakhtnin 2001 as stated by oudin et al 2008 in a comparison of regionalization methods the difficult characterization of the subsurface remains a major obstacle for the identification of the relevant catchment controls on streamflow based on regression analysis nonetheless a few studies have integrated geological characteristics and identified the influence of specific lithologies on streamflow ward and robinson 1990 for instance highlighted the role of geology in influencing the fdc shape of catchments in the uk based on multiple regression models bloomfield et al 2009 quantified the relative influence of various lithologies on the baseflow index both mayer and naman 2011 and jefferson et al 2008 have shown with their study based in california and oregon that the geology of the studied catchments significantly determines their response to climate change besides tague and grant 2004 pointed out the dominant control of a highly permeable volcanic unit on flow regime of this studied oregon region in other studies the importance of sandstone for streamflow dynamics has been identified its influence on mean transit time and its buffering effect on streamflow have been illustrated in two studies in montana jencso and mcglynn 2011 nippgen et al 2011 in switzerland the importance of sandstone in sustaining streamflow during dry periods has also been highlighted by naef et al 2015 these findings suggest that the bedrock plays an active storage role as proposed by the hydrologically active bedrock hypothesis uchida et al 2008 and that it can considerably contribute to baseflow andermann et al 2012 birkel et al 2014 welch and allen 2012 especially the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock seems to be of high relevance for storage processes hale et al 2016 pfister et al 2017 while alluvial aquifers are of major interest in hydrogeology their effect on streamflow has received little attention in hydrology it has however been shown that these hydrogeological units although limited in size can notably impact the catchment outflow under dry conditions käser and hunkeler 2016 the presence of permeable quaternary deposits can also affect streamflow if infiltration from the stream to the groundwater is important naef et al 2015 showed for instance that catchments for which discharge is measured after an infiltration section are often characterized by lower low flows these studies suggest that the understanding of catchment dynamics can benefit from considering the various geological units present in the catchment and their hydrogeological properties freeze and cherry 1979 already articulated the importance of considering a catchment as a combination of the surface drainage area and of subsurface soils and geological formations they even argued that subsurface hydrological processes might play a predominant role in the hydrological cycle as subsurface materials govern infiltration rates and thus determine surface runoff river networks are influenced by the configuration of the water table which is in turn defined by groundwater processes and the inherent geology subsurface flow is constrained by the three dimensional setting of geological deposits freeze and cherry 1979 and thus related to topography moreover the hydrogeological properties of the geological formations and especially their hydraulic conductivity determine groundwater flow rates as expressed by darcy s law moreover subsurface flow and the associated water table are dependent on recharge and thus on meteorological forcing studies by gleeson and manning 2008 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 welch and allen 2012 have identified the influence of topography recharge and hydraulic conductivity on subsurface processes which suggests that these features might also be relevant for catchment dynamics our aim is consequently to improve the understanding of streamflow dynamics by integrating detailed geological descriptors in a study of catchment controls on discharge the identification of the geological characteristics relevant to streamflow dynamics along with other possibly important catchment properties is primarily carried out using simple regression analysis the influence of the identified descriptors on streamflow indicators is then investigated individually although various statistical methods exist to assess this link kroll and song 2013 this simple approach is preferred to model based or more complex statistical methods as it prevents bias from the predefined model structure and parameterization moreover the multicollinearity effects inherent to multiple regression models kroll and song 2013 are avoided our scope is to provide observable predictors for the assessment of catchment dynamics for ungauged catchments or for changing environmental conditions by quantifying the influence of the various catchment properties on the whole streamflow range we aim at identifying the relevant physical features for water resources management data on geology soil land use topography and meteorological conditions are gathered for 22 swiss catchments located in the molasse basin and compared to their long term streamflow indicators the discharge indicators are composed of both absolute and normalized divided by the long term mean discharge discharge percentiles the dimensionless indices allow focusing on the dynamics of catchment response to precipitation sauquet and catalogne 2011 the meteorological impact being filtered out by the normalization the use of these various descriptors of stream dynamics might thus enable us to distinguish between the meteorological and the catchment impacts on streamflow indicators this study is built on two hypotheses hypothesis 1 if geology influences low flows as shown by various studies by defining the slow drainage units contributing to the river during dry periods it should also impact the higher streamflow range i e through storage processes during precipitation events hypothesis 2 geology as it strongly determines storage and release processes presumably influences the ability of the catchment to buffer the meteorological signal its impact on streamflow indicators should be identifiable if geological descriptors actually describe the capacity of geological formations to store and release water the paper is structured as follows a general outline of the methodology and the statistical analysis the criteria for catchment selection and the associated description of factors such as topography climatic forcing and geology is provided in the methods section the results first explore potential cross correlations between catchment properties followed by the analysis of the relationship between streamflow indicators as well as the meteorological and catchment properties in the final sections the results and implications for both hydrology and hydrogeology are discussed 2 method and catchment characteristics the relationship between streamflow indicators of a 20 years period 01 01 1993 31 12 2012 and catchment properties encompassing meteorological topographical soil and geological characteristics is analyzed for 22 swiss rivers using simple linear regression the investigated time period covers exceptionally dry years e g 2003 2011 as well as major flood events e g 2005 data describing topography soil land use geology and hydrogeology precipitation and evapotranspiration as well as discharge are compiled the discharge indicators are obtained from both the absolute and the dimensionless flow duration curves fdc the flow duration curve is a widely used tool to characterize streamflow dynamics see e g review by smakhtnin 2001 the dimensionless fdc obtained by averaging the discharge percentiles by a long term discharge mean and also known as the index flow approach has been used in various studies notably for catchment intercomparison and regionalization purposes castellarin et al 2004a holmes et al 2002 sauquet and catalogne 2011 ganora et al 2009 the standardization allows focusing on the shape of the curve and hence more on the dynamics rather than on the absolute magnitude of discharge that way the dependency of streamflow indicators on climate conditions is minimized and the specificities of the catchment response to meteorological forcing are better identifiable the influence of meteorological and catchment characteristics on streamflow dynamics is quantified using a linear regression model between each streamflow indicator and the catchment descriptor the coefficient of determination r2 is computed as follows for each relationship and corresponds to the proportion of the variance of the streamflow indicator y explained by the linear model based on the catchment characteristic lm p n being the number of studied catchments and i each catchment r 2 1 i n y i l m p i 2 i n y i y 2 the calculation is also applied between catchment and meteorological characteristics in this way potential interdependencies between physical properties and or climate conditions are identified 2 1 catchment selection and description the geographic location of the 22 catchments is shown in fig 1 and the most relevant characteristics are summarised in table 1 details on how the indicators have been derived are provided in the following sections we investigate catchments of the swiss plateau and prealpes located in the molasse basin indicated by yellow lines in fig 1 we focus on catchments that are part of the same broad geological environment the molasse to explore in detail its hydrogeological variability and the impact of its different lithologies on streamflow indicators besides this selection excludes regions dominated by glaciers and snow see hydrological regime in table 1 additional criteria for the choice of the catchments are the absence of lakes and of important anthropogenic influences which could influence the water balance e g dams for electricity production or inter basin water transfers finally the quality of the discharge measurements was also considered in particular the low flow range for example some measurement stations indicate that below a certain threshold the reliability of the measurements cannot be guaranteed the surfaces areas of the catchments range from 0 6 to 416 km2 and they are located at mean altitudes from 467 to 1159 m the following hydrological regimes are

compilation of swiss geological maps that allows evaluating the percentage of selected lithologies at the surface in a certain catchment with the purpose of a hydrogeological classification of the bedrock occurring in the catchments we first organized the molasse in four lithologies and then attributed these lithologies with average values for hydraulic conductivity k from existing hydrogeological studies on the molasse balderer 1997 gander 2004 keller 1992 waber et al 2014 it is noteworthy that few studies aiming at a hydrogeological overview of the molasse exist for our study keller 1992 is particularly useful because this work discusses the varying molasse lithologies following a n s transect through the basin and it provides average hydraulic conductivities for these lithologies the four bedrock lithologies with corresponding hydraulic conductivities for the hydrogeological characterization of the selected catchments are marine sandstone sandstone k 10 4 10 5 m s

environment dominated by tidal processes these sandstones may represent regional aquifers that are separated from each other by finer grained deposits keller 1992 the fan conglomerates represent the coarse grained fluvial deposits deposited proximally to the alps while the fine grained deposits primarily silt and clay with some sand lenses represent the distal deposits of the alpine debris both are in general considered as aquitards with locally occurring permeable layers keller 1992 the subalpine molasse is the part of the molasse that was tectonically overthrusted onto the molasse basin and that has therefore experienced substantial stress and compaction therefore the subalpine molasse has a low primary porosity but might be importantly fractured due to uplift and decompression and therefore act as a fractured aquifer for every catchment the surface percentage of each lithology is calculated sandstone fan fine grained sub molasse and an average hydraulic conductivity of the

surface as a percentage of the total catchment area 2d prod quat the geomol product which models the top of the bedrock surface diepolder et al 2013 enables to calculate volumes of quaternary deposits for each catchment the raster of the top of the bedrock surface is subtracted from the surface raster the total volume of quaternary deposits in each catchment and per total catchment area is thus obtained tot quat vol per surface the raster of the top of the bedrock is also used to calculate the mean slope of the quaternary base quat slope combining the geomol raster and the 2d hydrogeological map of productive aquifers it is possible to calculate the productive quaternary volume of each catchment expressed as volume per total catchment area prod quat vol per surface to obtain it the 2d extent of productive aquifers is used as a clip to extract the volume of productive quaternary deposits from the total quaternary deposits in doing so it is assumed that the aquifers marked as productive in the 2d dataset are productive across their entire thickness the productive quaternary volume is also expressed as percentage of the total rock volume or total vol defined previously in

by the national meteorological service of switzerland meteoswiss by averaging the spatially distributed values for each catchment area mean annual actual evapotranspiration is obtained from the spatially distributed model proposed by hades hydrological atlas of switzerland table 4 1 see also https www bafu admin ch bafu en home topics water state maps hydrological atlas of switzerland hades html the number of dry days per year is averaged over the 20 years studied in order to evaluate precipitation dynamics daily precipitation intensities are sorted separately for each year in the decreasing order these classified values are then averaged over the 20 years and plotted against the number of days per year when the intensity is reached the obtained curve is comparable to the flow duration curve fdc see section 2 6 for streamflows for each catchment the obtained precipitation duration curve is fitted with the following equation pdc d a b dk d being the days 1 365 and a b and k referred to as pdc a pdc b and pdc k the calibrated parameters used to quantify the precipitation dynamics 2 6 discharge all the investigated rivers are part of the swiss national river monitoring network and daily discharge measurements for the period 01 01 1993 31 12 2012 are obtained from the foen three catchments of the selection are nested in other basins langete in murg walliselen luthern in wigger and murg wängi in murg frauenfeld to assess the general behavior of the 22 catchments streamflow indicators are based on the 20 years period 01 01 1993 31 12 2012 streamflow is described by means of 1 absolute percentiles of discharge q5 to q95 expressed in mm day 2 ratios of percentiles q5 q50 q95 q50 and q95 q5 and 3 ratios and characteristics derived from the dimensionless flow duration curve fdcnorm the percentiles are obtained from the flow duration curve fdc that is calculated for each year and averaged over the 20 year period the absolute values describe the magnitude of discharge from high flows q5 the discharge exceeded 5 of the time to low flows q95 the discharge exceeded 95 of the time the normalized flow indicators 2 and 3 allow filtering out the effect of climate and water balance issues and can thus be interpreted as descriptors of how catchments buffer the meteorological signal from now on we refer to these indicators as normalized streamflow indicators as opposed to absolute streamflow indicators we define the buffering potential as the dampening effect the catchment exerts on the precipitation signal the more stable the streamflow dynamics the higher this buffering potential conversely a low buffering potential implies erratic stream dynamics with high peaks and low flows close to zero the ratios q5 q50 resp q95 q50 describe the variability of flows in the higher resp the lower part of the fdc whereas q95 q5 is the ratio between low and high flows the dimensionless flow duration curve fdcnorm is obtained by normalizing the flow percentiles with a long term index flow generally corresponding to the mean annual discharge the yearly absolute discharge percentiles are divided by the yearly mean and the resulting yearly fdcnorm is averaged over the 20 years specific points of the fdcnorm are analyzed in this study the standardized high flow and low flow percentiles q5 qmean resp q95 qmean the shape of the fdcnorm is also quantified with a parametric approach the curve is fitted with the following equation fdcnorm calc d a b dk d being the days 1 to 365 and a b and k the calibrated parameters the calibration is done on the logarithmic value of the fdcnorm to best reproduce low flow dynamics the k parameter of the equation kfdc norm is used as streamflow indicator to describe the shape of the curve 2 7 water balances a first step towards assessing the catchment response to the meteorological forcing is to assess the long term water balance which is established by averaging the equation terms net precipitation and catchment outflow over numerous years to exclude storage effects from one year to the other the ratio of annual discharge to annual net precipitation precipitation evapotranspiration is thus averaged for the 20 years period to account for the uncertainty related to the estimation of evapotranspiration the ratio is calculated with 10 higher and lower evapotranspiration rates the resulting ratio with uncertainty margins is plotted in fig 2 the majority of the catchments have ratios close to one which indicates that their water balance is closed however the ratio is consequentially smaller than one even when considering uncertainty margins for the following river catchments biber ilfis luthern sense and wigger in the case of luthern surface flow constitutes only 60 of the net input to the catchment this indicates that an important amount of water might exit the catchment as groundwater unnoticed by the gauging station the hydrometric stations should ideally be located on a geological unit that is impervious enough to prevent substantial groundwater flow under the station this is however not the case for all catchments except for the biber the location of the gauging stations of the catchments with q p et ratios lower than 1 is not adequate as they are situated on top of permeable quaternary deposits for the luthern and wigger catchments a local study arbeitsgemeinschaft grundwasserforschung luthern und wiggertal 1978 estimates the groundwater flow in the river section close to the gauging stations to 0 108 m3 s resp 0 367 m3 s the water balance ratios corrected with the groundwater flow are shown in red in fig 2 in both cases the ratio increases although the improvement is limited further reasons for the inability to close the water balance could be higher evapotranspiration and precipitation uncertainties a discrepancy between the hydrological and the hydrogeological catchment leading to groundwater losses to neighboring catchments or inter basin transfers that have not been identified although the water balance discrepancies are not corrected identifying catchments with unclosed water balances can help to identify a biased interpretation of catchment dynamics 3 results 3 1 analysis of interdependency among catchment properties and meteorological conditions before analyzing the influence of catchment properties and precipitation on streamflow indicators the interdependency among meteorological topographical and geological characteristics is assessed identifying potential cross correlations between the descriptors is crucial to avoid attributing an effect of a specific catchment property on streamflow that is actually due to another characteristic mean elevation and mean net precipitation are strongly linearly and positively correlated r2 74 due to orographic lifting consequently various catchment properties that vary with altitude also exhibit a notable correlation with meteorological conditions the following topographical properties are affected mean catchment slope smallest stream slope and the topographical wetness index are correlated to elevation r2 of 86 78 resp 68 and to mean net precipitation r2 of 59 47 resp 44 the soil depth and storage capacity decrease with elevation r2 of 61 resp 71 and are also correlated to mean net precipitation r2 of 81 resp 60 the high correlation between mean net precipitation and soil depth is due to both the elevation dependency of soil characteristics and the fact that the evapotranspiration values used in this study are calculated based on the soil depth data finally the percentage of subalpine molasse and fine grained material are to a lesser extent correlated to mean net precipitation r2 of 51 resp 39 which can partially be attributed to the dependency on altitude r2 of 28 resp 46 for all the mentioned catchment characteristics potential correlations to streamflow indicators should be considered with care as precipitation likely strongly governs streamflow the listed properties might be correlated to discharge indicators even though no physical link exists between them besides the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock of each catchment see methodology section is highly correlated to the percentage of sandstone present in the catchment r2 99 5 sandstone is characterized by the highest hydraulic conductivity among the identified lithologies and thus exerts a dominating impact on the estimated hydraulic conductivity for catchments with sandstone for the catchments lacking sandstone the influences of the other lithologies on the calculated hydraulic conductivity are mixed 3 2 relationship between streamflow indicator catchment and meteorological properties 3 2 1 overview fig 3 gives an overview of the influence of all climate and catchment characteristics on streamflow indicators and allows identifying relevant characteristics for stream dynamics whose importance will be quantified and discussed in next section in total 33 catchment properties describing topography soil land use and geology and 7 meteorological indices are compared to 14 streamflow indicators streamflow indicators are split into two groups indicators based on absolute numbers discharge percentiles and mean discharge and indicators related to the normalized flow duration curve along with ratios of discharge percentiles the control of mean precipitation p mean and net mean precipitation p et on the absolute discharge percentiles q5 q70 i e except the lower ones is obviously dominant most of the catchment properties that seem to influence absolute streamflow indicators correspond to the characteristics that are strongly correlated to precipitation as indicated by the red vertical dotted lines in fig 3 other features such as the proportion of 1st order stream and bedrock hydraulic conductivity k bedrock show a certain relationship to the indicators based on absolute numbers but their impact is negligible compared to the dominant control of precipitation on these indicators the discharge indicators q90 and q95 describing low flows are the only streamflow indicators that are not correlated significantly r2 20 to any catchment or climate characteristics the results are distinctly different from the relative indicators by expressing streamflow dynamics with ratios or percentiles normalized by mean discharge the impact of precipitation is excluded as illustrated by the small variance explained by meteorological properties consequently the catchment properties correlated to precipitation and thus to absolute streamflow indicators are not correlated to the relative streamflow indicators the only characteristics revealing a notable relationship to the indicators describing streamflow dynamics are the geological properties especially the quaternary feature 2d prod quat the surface proportion of catchment occupied by productive quaternary deposits as well as the bedrock hydraulic conductivity and thus the proportion of sandstone are relevant also worth mentioning is the higher influence of the productive quaternary descriptors prod quat vol per surface prod quat vol compared to total quaternary descriptors tot quat vol per surface the proportion of 1st order stream and to a lesser extent the depth and hydraulic conductivity of the soil characteristics explain a certain part of the variance of the relative indicators even though their explanatory value is smaller 3 2 2 assessment of the influence of identified relevant characteristics on streamflow dynamics based on the previous section the characteristics exerting the highest influence on streamflow indicators r2 40 are selected for further investigation see fig 4 detailed version of fig 3 catchment properties that are correlated to precipitation and thus to specific absolute streamflow indicators are left out as we assume that precipitation the input to the catchment is the main driver of streamflow magnitude for climate forcing only mean net precipitation is kept for quaternary features we here focus on the proportion of productive 2d quaternary deposits as the correlation is slightly higher than for the 3d descriptor and the 2d descriptor is easier to obtain the importance of the 3d characteristic will however be subsequently discussed 3 2 2 1 absolute streamflow indicators net mean precipitation p et explains 88 of the variance of mean discharge and between 81 and 89 of the variance of the discharge percentiles characterizing the higher part of the absolute flow duration curve q5 to q30 from q30 to the low flow indicator q95 a clear decreasing trend of the importance of precipitation on discharge percentile is observed only 20 of the variance of q90 is for instance explained by mean net precipitation and the correlation is insignificant for q95 p value 0 1 as mentioned previously no catchment or climatic characteristic explains a substantial proportion of the variance of q95 this is further illustrated in fig 5 the coefficient of determination for the q5 estimation based on mean net precipitation is of 81 p value 9 74e 9 as q95 is both dependent on precipitation and catchment properties we divide the indicator by the net mean precipitation to focus on the influence of the latter q95 pnet right subplot b in the x axis a linear regression model composed of the percentage of sandstone and the percentage of productive quaternary deposits whose parameters are fitted against q95 pnet see equation above fig 5 b the correlation between q95 pnet or the part of net precipitation that will be released during dry periods and the model based on geological parameters is characterized by a r2 of 55 p value 7 19e 5 for the biber and especially the luthern catchments the q95 pnet ratio is considerably underestimated by geological factors as indicated by their unclosed water balance fig 2 this discrepancy might be due to groundwater flowing out of the catchment without being measured at the gauging station in the case of the glatt langeten and murg walliswil catchments actual low flows are higher than the estimation based on sandstone and quaternary deposits other storage units in the catchment such as soil or local geological units that are not accounted for might contribute substantially to the stream in the absence of rain 3 2 2 2 streamflow ratios and dimensionless fdc descriptors the normalised flow percentiles describing both the high q5 qmean q5 q50 and the low q95 qmean q95 q50 parts of the dimensionless flow duration curve highlighted by a red rectangle in fig 4 are characterised by similar percentage of explained variance attributed to the catchment properties 37 44 by the topographical feature of 1st order stream 48 58 by the proportion of productive quaternary aquifer 47 52 by the hydraulic conductivity of bedrock and 49 54 by the proportion of sandstone with p values equal or smaller to 10 3 for all these relationships fig 4 the recession parameter of the dimensionless flow duration curve k of fdc which also describes its shape is slightly more correlated to bedrock 50 52 than to quaternary 41 characteristics and not significantly explained by the topographical feature 16 as expected due to their high interdependency bedrock hydraulic conductivity and proportion of sandstone indicate similar r2 values the correlation between the logarithm of the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock and relative streamflow indicators is however rather limited r2 of 24 36 this suggests that the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock might be a less efficient predictor for catchments with low hydraulic conductivity i e the catchments without sandstone when the hydraulic conductivity of bedrock is limited other catchment characteristics potentially have a higher explanatory potential moreover the variability of estimated hydraulic conductivities in the absence of sandstone is smaller as the permeabilities of the other geological lithologies are more similar among these remaining geological units none seem to exert a dominant impact on streamflow fig 6 illustrates the relationship between the relevant catchment characteristics sandstone and productive quaternary deposits and the normalized high q5 qmean and low q95 qmean flow percentiles discussed above higher proportions of permeable geological units sandstone and quaternary deposits generally imply higher normalized low flow subplots a and b and lower normalized high flow percentiles subplots c and d fig 7 explores in more detail the relationships between geology and the normalized discharge indicators in the left scatter plots a and b the normalized high and low discharge percentiles are strongly correlated r2 93 to each other the location of the catchment along that line strongly depends on geology as indicated by the size of circles that are proportional to the sandstone proportion a and to the proportion of productive quaternary deposits b on the right side of fig 7 c catchments are sorted according to decreasing q95 qmean the classification hence approximately following the high low percentile correlation line from top left to bottom right of subplots a and b high q95 qmean and low q5 qmean ratios imply moderate streamflow dynamics and reflect a high buffering potential of the catchment which substantially dampens the precipitation signal the 6 catchments with the highest buffering potential correspond to the basins composed of the highest percentage of sandstone orange bar plots 60 to 80 in the 6 cases the proportion of productive quaternary deposits coral bar plots is also significant the buffering potential of the catchment is not guaranteed for high proportion of productive quaternary only as illustrated for instance by the alp and aach catchments to better quantify the importance of quaternary deposits the volume of productive quaternary averaged by catchment area is included in black in fig 7 the productive quaternary deposits although covering a considerable percentage of the alp and the aach catchments are rather limited in terms of volume which might explain the relatively low buffering potential of the two basins the guerbe catchment is characterized by the more important relative volume of productive quaternary despite these important deposits and similar sandstone percentage its buffering potential is lower than in the case of murg walliswil langeten and wigger a more detailed investigation of the valley fillings of the guerbe valley based on the hydrogeological map of switzerland sarine region 1 100 000 swisstopo indicated however that the deposits are rather heterogeneous with local fine grained and lacustrine clay units that act as an aquitard the volume of productive quaternary deposits is therefore overestimated in the case of the guerbe considering this correction fig 7 thus suggests that for catchments with a high percentage of sandstone the volume of productive quaternary deposits averaged by surface might be the second factor determining the buffering potential of the catchment we also observe that the murg waengi and murg frauenfeld catchments although lacking sandstone have a relatively high buffering potential that might be owed to the very important volume of productive quaternary deposits 4 discussion 4 1 climate and catchment controls on streamflow dynamics numerous catchment properties describing topography soil land use and geology as well as meteorological characteristics are compared to both absolute and normalized streamflow indicators while climate forcing is dominant on the high to medium absolute flow indicators this influence decreases for low flows and the buffering influence of the catchment becomes relevant these results are consistent with the findings of yaeger et al 2012 who showed that whereas the middle part of the flow duration curve is influenced by the precipitation the low flow end of the curve reflects catchment characteristics moreover our results show that the use of the dimensionless flow duration curve and discharge indicators indeed allow distinguishing how the catchment buffers the precipitation signal based on the results illustrated in fig 3 we propose a conceptualization of climate and catchment control on absolute and normalized long term flow duration curve fig 8 both high and low flow normalized percentiles q5 qmean and q95 qmean i e the two vertical extremes of the curve are dominated by the physical catchment properties and are highly correlated to each other catchments with high q95 qmean and hence relatively high low flows feature an important buffering potential for these catchments storage is substantial during precipitation events and their normalized high flows are thus limited the dimensionless flow duration curve of such catchments will be flatter than for catchments with low buffering potential their curve following more closely the dynamics of precipitation this distribution of streamflow between high and low ranges i e the shape of the normalized curve depends mainly on catchment properties although the mean net precipitation varies considerably among the 22 studied catchments up to 1000 mm yearly difference the seasonal distribution of precipitation is rather homogeneous due to their proximity and relatively small differences in altitude in this study the different amplitudes of the dimensionless flow duration curve are thus mainly due to varying catchment properties for catchments with different precipitation regimes the shape difference of the curve might however also be influenced by the meteorological signal nonetheless the comparison of dimensionless flow duration curves between catchments of similar precipitation regimes is a highly valuable approach to compare catchment buffering potentials this way the resilience of catchments to climatic changes and their sensitivity to dry periods can for instance be compared 4 2 the influence of geology on the buffering potential of catchments fig 3 illustrates that among the 33 catchment properties describing topography soil land use and geology a clear relationship can only be observed between the geological characteristics and the normalized streamflow indicators the obtained correlations r2 around 50 are slightly lower than the values indicated for instance by tague and grant 2004 or pfister et al 2017 76 for the correlation between summer streamflow and the portion of highly permeable volcanic rock resp 64 between the impervious part of the catchment and the ratio of summer and winter flow these studies however focus on specific periods of the year whereas we presently consider the entire streamflow range the p values of the correlations between the relevant geological descriptors and relative streamflow indicators however are all equal or smaller to 10 3 suggesting that they are statistically significant considering the widely used 95 confidence interval these findings suggest that the degree of buffering of the precipitation signal exerted by the catchment is mainly governed by geology as assumed in the introduction 1st hypothesis geology not only influences low flow dynamics but equally impacts the entire dimensionless flow duration curve including q5 qmean the consideration of geological units by taking into account their hydrogeological characteristics thus leads to a better understanding of catchment dynamics our results suggest that both the bedrock and quaternary alluvial fillings considerably impact streamflow dynamics 4 2 1 bedrock geology in the studied region of the swiss plateau and prealpes marine sandstone seems to significantly influence the ability of the catchment to generate a continuous streamflow this geological unit being relatively permeable 10 5 to 10 4 m s as illustrated in fig 7 catchments with the highest buffering potential are all mainly composed of sandstone 60 80 of their surface this molasse type or any geological formation with similar hydrogeological properties seems to be a prerequisite for high normalized low flows its hydraulic conductivity is high enough to store water in the subsurface during precipitation events and low enough to still contribute to streamflow after prolonged dry spells as an illustration the estimated hydraulic conductivity of sandstone 10 5 m s for the calculation corresponds to a daily rate of 864 mm d and the hydraulic conductivity of fine grained material can optimistically reach a value of 8 64 mm d 10 7 m s sandstone can store large amounts of water and consequently considerably buffer rainfall events whereas the second only allows the infiltrating of a limited portion this buffering potential of sandstone on streamflow corresponds to the findings of various studies jencso mcglynn 2011 nippgen et al 2011 naef et al 2015 more generally these results support the various case studies that highlighted the importance of the hydraulic conductivity of bedrock for low flows tague and grant 2004 pfister et al 2017 giving credit to the hypothesis of the hydrologically active bedrock uchida et al 2008 4 2 2 quaternary deposits our study also shows the relative importance of productive quaternary deposits for streamflow dynamics these aquifers although limited in size can contribute substantially to outflow as suggested by the case study by käser and hunkeler 2016 the integration of total versus productive quaternary deposits characteristics highlight the importance of using appropriate hydro geological descriptors whereas the total volume of quaternary deposits in the catchments tot quat vol per surface is not correlated to streamflow indicators the exclusive consideration of the productive portion of these deposits prod quat vol per surface allows linking the presence of quaternary aquifers to streamflow dynamics see fig 3 it is thus crucial that the geological characterization of catchments for hydrological purposes focuses on the hydrogeological productivity of the various geological units our results suggest that the use of 2d hydrogeological information describing the productivity of the aquifers already leads to a substantial explanatory power of quaternary deposits on streamflow dynamics e g r2 of 58 between q95 qmean and 2d prod quat looking at the volumes of these deposits further improves the analysis of the relationship between geology and catchment dynamics in several cases see fig 7 however the overall correlation between the 3d quaternary indicator prod quat vol per surface and streamflow dynamics is not higher than with the 2d descriptor 2d prod quat this can be attributed to the assumption that quaternary deposits are homogeneous in terms of hydraulic conductivity it highlights the importance of characterizing the heterogeneity of these structures as illustrated with the guerbe catchment fig 7 moreover in a more local context the presence of permeable quaternary deposits under the gauging station of the catchment can have a determining impact on the measured streamflow and on the water balance as illustrated in fig 2 specific outlet configurations will result in unclosed water balances 4 3 buffering potential and dynamic storage a groundwater perspective as defined previously the buffering potential of the catchment on the precipitation signal can be assimilated to the dynamic storage of the catchment commonly defined as the storage that governs streamflow dynamics buttle 2016 it describes how much water can be stored during precipitation events and subsequently released to the stream the results of the present study suggest that catchments with relatively permeable geological units have a high buffering potential on precipitation and hence a notable dynamic storage in the framework of groundwater studies bedrock hydraulic conductivity and meteorological input expressed as recharge are commonly related to assess flow processes gleeson and manning 2008 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 welch and allen 2012 gleeson and manning 2008 and haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 notably have highlighted the influence of the ratio between recharge and hydraulic conductivity r k along with topographical considerations on the water table configuration groundwater levels in turn impact the partitioning of precipitation into recharge to groundwater and contribution to local stream network briefly stated the mentioned authors show that a high r k ratio generally implies a water table located close to the surface topography controlled whereas a low ratio indicates that the water table is recharge controlled in the first case high r k ratio the dynamic storage of the catchment is limited as the water table is constrained by topography during precipitation events the overland flow is substantial and less water is stored and contributions to stream during dry periods are thus limited when r k is low the water table fluctuates according to recharge the dynamic storage and hence the buffering potential of the catchment is important the ratio of 1st order stream is the only topographical characteristic explaining a considerable part of the variance of the normalized discharge percentiles 38 44 and provides another similarity with the study by gleeson and manning 2008 our results suggest that streamflow dynamics of catchments with a less dense upper stream network will likely be more stable low peaks and high low flows using a groundwater modeling approach in mountainous terrain the study by gleeson and manning 2008 shows that the percentage length of first order stream with perennial flow comparable to of 1st order stream is a function of the water table which in turn depends on the r k ratio they demonstrate that in case of low percentage of 1st order stream less developed upper stream network the relative recharge contribution to regional groundwater flow is more important under the assumption that this groundwater flow contributes to the stabilization of streamflow dynamics i e higher buffering potential of the catchment our results are consistent with gleeson and manning 2008 in this sense the ratio of 1st order stream thus reflects the r k ratio and the geological characteristics of the catchment as it is directly impacted by infiltration and groundwater processes these considerations should however be further investigated as the resulting correlations are rather limited 4 4 importance of other catchment properties for streamflow dynamics topography and soil as they impact overland flow infiltration and subsurface processes are frequently identified amongst the most important controls on streamflow dynamics in the introduction some of these classical studies are cited our results suggest a more differentiated picture and only partially confirm their importance in fact except for the percentage of 1st order stream discussed before our results suggest that no soil and topography characteristics explain an important part of the variance of normalized streamflow indicators our results do not exclude the importance of soil characteristics in e g humid regions with low relief and do not exclude that other physiographic characteristics might be relevant for regions with climate and relief different to the swiss plateau also if a catchments surface is impermeable owing to e g widespread soil compaction or urbanization which is not the case in our catchments the soil might constitute the limiting factor for infiltration and thus largely control the catchments dynamics nevertheless our results suggest that the relative importance of soil characteristics has so far been overestimated especially compared to the importance of deeper geological units in steeper regions there are several reasons for this as suggested by various studies haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 welch and allen 2012 both topography and hydrogeological properties constrain streamflow dynamics in a combined way and a unique identification of their influence is challenging especially if the hydrogeological properties are not or only partially considered moreover even if some of the topographical and soil characteristics can be related to absolute streamflow indicators these relationships can be biased by their correlation to precipitation finally as opposed to the classical hydrological studies in catchment hydrology discussed in the introduction our analysis considers the subsurface in a more explicit way this additional consideration naturally reduces the relative importance of surface features even though this study goes far beyond the geological information considered in previous studies more data for the conceptualization of the subsurface would be highly desirable for example assessing characteristics of distinct geological units with their specific storage and geometry might improve our understanding of the relationship between catchment properties and dynamics such data are however rarely available to date 5 conclusions and implications in this study a total of 33 characteristics describing catchment topography soil land use and geology are compared to streamflow indicators along with various meteorological indices our approach distinguishes itself from previous studies by including geological characteristics that describe the capacity of different lithologies to store and release water i e their hydrogeological properties and by considering both the large scale geological environment bedrock and the local scale quaternary deposits the following conclusions can be drawn for the wide range of catchments we analyzed geology has by far the largest influence of all catchment characteristics both for low flow as well as for high flow conditions hypothesis 1 our results further confirm that the geological characteristics substantially determine the ability of the catchment to buffer the meteorological signal hypothesis 2 these results underline the crucial need to take into account groundwater dynamics as well as geological factors in hydrological studies we show that both the general geological environment bedrock and the more local scale quaternary deposits influence the catchments response to precipitation this highlights the necessity of considering the hydrogeological productivity of both the bedrock and quaternary deposits there is an especially large potential for including the bedrock a so far rarely considered geological unit in hydrological studies in general these results demonstrate that the mere classification of aquifers into wide categories e g unconsolidated porous and fractured is not adequate for describing the hydro geo logical setting of catchments and thus should not be used in catchment classification schemes high and low flow indicators are highly correlated an important outcome that can provide insights into a catchments behavior under changing climatic conditions the flow duration curve is influenced by different geological units more specifically bedrock and more permeable quaternary deposits the reproduction of a catchments response to climatic forcing will thus benefit from an explicit consideration of these different lithologies the explicit consideration of the bedrock is expected to be especially useful for the simulation of low flow dynamics the presence of relatively permeable lithologies is an indicator of an important dynamic groundwater storage and thus sustained low flows sandstone like porous lithologies which feature a rather high hydraulic conductivity e g 10 5 m s have a potentially high buffering effect on climate forcing and are thus favorable for the contribution to low flows the presence of permeable and vertically extended quaternary deposits is also correlated to higher normalized low flows due to the slow yet sustained release of groundwater the importance of high quality geological data describing both the bedrock and the alluvial aquifers is emphasized in this study even though the geological characterization in our study goes far beyond the geological assessment in comparable studies there is room for improvement for example more information concerning the slopes volumes specific storage or specific yields of the bedrock would certainly contribute to our current hydrological understanding we are convinced that the scientific community will strongly benefit from increasing the efforts to characterize the subsurface rather than continue to focus on easily accessible surface characteristics of catchments projects such as geomol assessing subsurface potentials of the alpine foreland basins for sustainable planning and use of natural resources diepolder et al 2013 that characterize bedrock and quaternary deposits are thus of crucial importance to improve our current understanding of catchment dynamics 6 conflict of interest none acknowledgments most of this work was funded by the swiss federal office for the environment foen we thank the two reviewers

6973,accurate prediction of the long term average dimensions of alluvial stable channels is a significant problem in river engineering the goal of this research is to investigate the effect of flow

the rate of sediment transport is approximately equivalent to the existing sediment load and thus the average dimensions of the channel are preserved constant over time julien 2002 accurate design of cross section dimensions of stable alluvial channels has a significant role in different branches of engineering such as sediment transport capacity estimation flood mapping bridges construction crossing rivers estimation of stream water quality and estimating maintenance costs shields et al 2003 muthukrishnavellaisamy et al 2009 jang et al 2016 gazendam et al 2016 atieh et al 2015 2017 top width w mean flow depth d and longitudinal slope s are the main geometric parameters of defining stable channels afzalimehr et al 2010 according to fig 1 historic methods for determining stable channels dimensions can be classified into three main groups including empirical theoretical and extremal methods empirical relations are those that are obtained based on statistical rules employed on data from different rivers which relate the independent parameters such as flow discharge or mean sediment size to geometric dependent variables of the channel such as width depth and slope empirical methods have been a consideration of many researchers due to their simplicity and requiring less independent variables data set hey and thorne 1986 estimated w d and s of 62 stable river reaches in the form of independent variables of the flow discharge bed sediment size bank vegetation type bed sediment load and valley slope by employing multiple regression technique hey and thorne 1986 stated that the flow discharge and the vegetation growth are the primary drivers in the adjustment of width and depth to reach to the stable state and the slope adjustment is more influenced by particle size hey and thorne 1986 stated that the lack of a hydraulic basis for the empirical relations was the primary limitation of these methods since the empirical relations were obtained based on a limited data theoretical methods gained increasing attention theoretical methods are those that predict stable channel geometry parameters through solving the governing hydraulic rules on the flow and sediment particle and are gained based on the simultaneously solving the governing hydraulic equations henderson 1961 julien and wargadalam 1995 determined stable channel dimensions by the simultaneous solving continuity of the flow flow resistance secondary flow and transport of sediment equations in coarse grained alluvial bed rivers julien and wargadalam 1995 reported that the theoretical based equations are more reliable than empirical relations due to the usage of the governing rules of hydraulics and fluid mechanics and thus can be used for any river geomorphology conditions afzalimehr et al 2010 concluded that their empirical methods have better prediction capability and their relative simplicity and lack of complicated calculations present another advantage over theoretical method although empirical relations may produce acceptable results for geometry estimations of the rivers which they are obtained from they may lead to unsatisfactory results for other rivers with different geomorphology and environmental conditions and this issue limits their general use stevens and nordin 1987 the empirically derived equations are not based on the fundamentals of hydraulics and fluid mechanics and thus cannot be accurately used for different rivers bose 1936 the simplicity of the empirical relations causes empirical method to be considered by many researchers and enables this method to predict stable channel geometry parameters with just one or two variables without need of a vast data set however most of the empirical relations are presented only in the form of flow discharge or considering the mean sediment size as the second factor and neglect the influence of other effective variables such as sediment transport sediment concentration and the shields parameter in addition to the complicated calculation process of theoretical methods which demand vast data set with various variables and despite their advantage of greater applicability for different rivers conditions these methods also fail to present an exact estimation extremal methods usually relate w d and s of stable channels to flow resistance and sediment transport equations and a third equation that is usually expressed as minimization or maximization of a parameter the most applied theories used in an extremal method for stable channels design can be mentioned as minimum stream power maximum sediment transport rate and minimum froude number chang 1979 white et al 1982 jia 1990 millar 2005 presented equations for calculating w d and s of stable channels in the form of flow discharge and mean sediment size by assuming the maximum sediment transport efficiency hypothesis and compared their results with empirical and theoretical equations millar 2005 concluded that the results from extremal based equations are in agreement with theoretical and empirical methods and their results didn t show a remarkable improvement in comparison with other methods therefore due to the above mentioned deficiencies of previous methods empirical theoretical and extremal a more robust method which can be used to estimate stable channel geometry with a greater degree of accuracy in a variety of hydraulic and geomorphological conditions is necessary the most recent advanced artificial intelligence ai methods can be employed on a range of environmental conditions and they lead to more precise results in comparison with empirical and theoretical methods gholami et al 2017a some examples and applications of ai methods in different fields of science included modeling hydrological time series nayak et al 2004 forecasting streamflow shiri and kisi 2010 prediction of lake level variations kisi et al 2012 prediction of flow pattern in curved channels gholami et al 2016a b 2017b friction factor prediction roushangar et al 2014a energy dissipation roushangar et al 2014b bed load discharge roushangar et al 2014c in the context of the stable channels riahi madvar et al 2011 developed multilayer perceptron mlp artificial neural network with a back propagation algorithm for estimating width depth and slope of stable channels tahershamsi et al 2012 investigated two different mlp and radial basis function rbf for predicting the stable width of channels mohamed 2013 predicted hydraulic radius wetted perimeter and slope of stable channels using regression equations and multi layer feed forward ann based on back propagation algorithm bonakdari and gholami 2016 predicted the width of stable channels in gravel bed rivers using an ann method the above mentioned previous research demonstrated the superiority of the ai methods in comparison with empirical theoretical methods most notably gholami et al 2017a used the group method of data handling gmdh method to estimate stable channel geometry in a gravel bed stream gholami et al 2017a compared their results with previous empirical and theoretical relations presented by other investigators and concluded that gmdh led to more precise design shaghaghi et al 2017 evaluated and compared different evolutionary algorithms in combination with gmdh method to predict stable channel width shaghaghi et al 2017 concluded that the gmdh method based on particle swarm optimization pso learning algorithm gave worse results compared to the gmdh method based on ga and also they demonstrated that the empirical relations failed to give precise predictions in comparison with gmdh the above literature showed that there are very few if any research related to the application of gs gmdh and gep methods for stable channel design with the exception of the recent contribution of gholami et al 2018a b c who investigated the ability of different ai methods in prediction of shape profile formed on stable channel banks in state of static equilibrium and referred to the high accuracy of ai methods in estimation of bank profile characteristics however these authors did not report any results about channel geometry and the influential parameters in addition most of the ai methods applied by other researchers in the field of designing stable channels ann rbf are not able to produce an explicit equation relating the input variables with the outputs therefore the ai methods with the ability to produce an explicit equation to determine the output parameters are remarkable for designers among the ai methods both gmdh and gep are capable of giving a practical equation to determine the output parameters w d s in the form of input variables q d50 and τ the objectives of the present study are to 1 evaluate and compare the capability of gs gmdh and gep for predicting the w d and s of stable channels 2 diagnose the most influential parameters on stable channels geometry w d and s through a sensitivity analysis by considering different combinations of input variables q d50 and τ and 3 compare the most accurate models of gs gmdh and gep with nlr based equations to introduce the best solution for the investigated problem 2 material and methods 2 1 used data this study is conducted based on data from 85 gaging stations in three gravel bed rivers in iran the hydraulic specifications of kaaj river southwestern iran behesht abad river southwestern iran and gamasiab river western iran were used for training testing and validation of the used methods gs gmdh gep and nlr the measurement and collection of all used data in the present study were done by afzalimehr et al 2010 for each of the 85 cross sections three to five velocity profiles were measured in each velocity profile 13 to 16 point velocity measurements were taken therefore in total 85 cross sections 425 velocity profiles and approximately 6000 point velocities were measured these velocity profiles were used to accurately characterize the flow discharge at a specified section of the river for each cross section the exact position of the section was first marked by putting bars on the both sides of the channel and fencing with rope in each reach using the current meter bar the flow depth was measured at 0 5 m intervals across each cross section after depth the top width was recorded afzalimehr et al 2010 divided the water surface width into five parts vertical intervals to mark the locations of measuring profiles of velocity the velocities at each site were gauged across the depth direction from the bed to water surface by employing a butterfly meter with horizontal axes during measurements with the butterfly meter the cylindrical leg diameter 15 cm and thickness 5 cm was jointed to the current meter bar in this way the nearest point to the bed was measured 5 cm above the bed as in 20 of the depth and between 3 and 5 cm in the upper 80 of the depth for measuring velocity points this was done because of the relatively smaller velocity gradient in the upper 80 depth compared to 20 of the depth nearest to the bed the time step for each point velocity measurement was taken as 50 s afzalimehr et al 2010 calculated the shear velocity u using recorded point velocities by applying the log law then by applying the boundary layer theory the shields parameter was calculated without the presence of channel depth and slope d s certain practically such estimation will eliminate the risk of any interdependence and will provide a better understanding of the flow behavior as verified by afzalimehr and anctil 2000 the longitudinal slope was determined by surveying in selected stations at the central axis of the river therefore two stations were chosen and the water surface was marked in both stations then the water surface slope was determined by dividing the difference of water surface elevations by the space between the two stations the bed material size was determined by wolman s method wolman 1954 the average flow depth of each station was computed by dividing the cross sectional area a by the water surface width d a w hey and thorne 1986 lee and julien 2006 afzalimehr et al 2010 observations in the selected rivers were done during different seasons that revealed that the sections were generally stable afzalimehr et al 2010 in other words despite occurring erosion and sedimentation in bed and banks of each section erosion and sedimentation are in equilibrium different sections and reaches attain to stable state so that the mean dimensions especially width of channel do not have any variation in different periods of time one season to another along a year and this criterion is confirmed by many researchers mikhailova et al 1980 abdelhaleem et al 2016 the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of all used data in this study which are gathered by afzalimehr et al 2010 is represented in supplementary materials section q d50 and τ are used as inputs of the models and w d and s are the target variables that are estimate according to the observational data see the supplementary material τ represents the dimensionless shields parameter calculated based on the shear velocity and boundary layer theory defined as 1 τ τ ρ s ρ g d s where ρs represents the sediment mass density ρs 26 5 kn m3 ρ is the water mass density ρ 10 kn m3 g denotes the gravitational acceleration g 9 81 m2 s ds denotes the diameter of the particle or d s d 50 ν g g 1 1 3 with relative density g ρ s ρ ν is the kinematic viscosity ν 1 10 6 m2 s and τ is the shear stress expressed as 2 τ ρ u 2 where u is shear velocity which is derived from the st venant equations and zero pressure gradient methods such as u gd s f u gd s 0 respectively where sf and s0 are the friction and channel bed slope respectively and d is the average flow depth according to bray 1982 most studies on natural channels have been done based on average geometric elements and steady uniform flow is assumed to occur such an assumption has allowed the shear velocity to be approximated as u gd s 0 using zero pressure gradient method in estimation of shear velocity for the gravel bed rivers is the primary source of error and discrepancy between the calculated and estimated flow resistance also the pressure gradient affects the reynolds stress distribution over the gravel bed channel and consequently leads to a shear velocity considerably different from the zero pressure gradient case bettess et al 1988 afzalimehr 1998 in order to develop methods of calculating turbulent boundary layers in the presence of a pressure gradient the need for a method to measure the shields parameter is manipulated in the present paper the shear velocity is obtained based on st venant equations which is calculated by velocity value located on inner region of boundary layer theory this technique was first introduced by afzalimehr 1998 2 2 group method of data handling gmdh gmdh was firstly introduced by ivakhnenko 1971 as an evolutionary computation technique based on a self organized learning machine to model the complex systems amanifard et al 2008 the system identification problem in gmdh algorithms is to achieve a function by the feed forward network which can be used to predict the output y instead of actual output y for a set n input variable as x 1 x 2 x 3 x n using gmdh neural network provides an appropriate connection between input and output variables with no definition of the related under study subject in this way gmdh builds a mathematical description between output and input variable with a nonlinear function which is called the volterra series in the form of eq 3 farlow 1984 ivakhnenko and muller 1997 3 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a ij x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n x j a ijk x i x j x k where n is a number of input variables and x x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x in shows the input variable vector with m observational patterns a system of partial quadratic polynomials including two variables neurons in the form of eq 4 is utilized by the gmdh algorithm to analyze the eq 3 4 g x i x j a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a 3 x i 2 a 4 x j 2 a 5 x i x j the main aim of the gmdh neural network is to find the existing coefficients ai in eq 4 using the regression technique ivakhnenko 1971 iba and sato 1995 nariman zadeh et al 2005 for each pair of input variables xi and xj out of total n input variable in this case each coefficient of quadric function gi of eq 4 is obtained to fit optimally the predicted y according to eq 6 in the all input output data pair set with the least square error as farlow 1984 ivakhnenko and muller 1997 nariman zadeh et al 2005 5 e i 1 m y i g i 2 m min 6 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x in i 1 2 m therefore the neuron number in the first feed forward network hidden layer is chosen as m n n 1 2 2 3 generalized structure of gmdh gs gmdh gmdh network is a very flexible algorithm which can be hybridized by other evolutionary algorithms in this paper the ga is employed for designing an accurate and applicable model based on a gmdh algorithm therefore a robust simple and novel encoding scheme is produced to evolutionary design of the generalized structure of gmdh gs gmdh where the connectivity configuration is not bounded to an adjacent layer as developed by nariman zadeh and jamali 2007 additionally the encoding scheme of gs gmdh technique produces an accurate solution using ga and three different objective functions i e training error testing error and neuron number the advantages of this approach over the previous gmdh are 1 the connection of neurons related to two non adjacent layers in the previous gmdh method each neuron is connected with only a neuron in an adjacent layer structures of neurons are encoded in a string of chromosomes that can be linked with non adjacent layers moreover the genetic operators such as crossover and mutation are allocated randomly for all length of chromosomes string 2 minimization of training error the training error is minimized in gs gmdh method to keep the modeling error at a minimum level and prevent from overfitting 3 minimization of model size the model can be simplified as much as possible using neuron number minimization to achieve a precise and practical model with the minimum complexity through akaike s information criterion aic as kondo and ueno 2006 7 aic n log m s e 2 k 1 c m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n where yi and y i denote the observed and predicted values respectively n and k are the number of test train samples and model neuron respectively mse is the mean squared error and c is a constant the aic is a relative goodness measurement index of a statistical model fit the gs gmdh neural network has the ability for specification of different sizes and lengths of neural networks refer to the supplementary material section the random chosen points are selected from the 2j 1 set where j is the number of hidden layer neurons of chromosomes producing different chromosomes length by crossover operation makes different size of gs gmdh structure on the other hand the mutation operator is related to population diversity which changes the genes in a chromosome by symbolic digits to another symbol these operators are iterated until a valid chromosome is achieved otherwise these operators are not acceptable in the present paper the gs gmdh neural network is optimally designed based on 100 individual populations with 0 95 crossover probability also the 250 generations are used with mutation probability of 0 1 moreover exceeding such population number would not produce better results as discussed by previous studies e g nariman zadeh et al 2005 nariman zadeh and jamali 2007 amanifard et al 2008 ebtehaj et al 2015 shaghaghi et al 2017 2 4 gene expression programming gep according to ferreira 2001 gep is linear based genetic programming gep was produced from two evolutionary algorithms namely ga and genetic programming gp by koza 1992 ferreira 2001 employed the benefits of both ga linear chromosome with constant length and gp expression trees with different shapes and sizes simultaneously to overcome the limitations of these methods by gep gep is also considered multigenetic which can solve more and different complex programs ferreira 2001 2006 alavi et al 2013 the main components of gep mathematical algorithms include control fitness function function set terminal set and terminal condition parameters mousavi et al 2014 each gene in gep consists of a fixed length set of symbols these symbols can be any components of the terminal set z l m n 1 or function set tan sin alavi et al 2013 the gep modeling process is initialized by the random generation of an initial chromosome population each individual chromosome in the initial population is assessed using the defined fitness functions for the problem ferreira 2001 azamathulla and ahmad 2012 kisi and shiri 2012 chromosomes that are considered to have better fitness function values are chosen to use in the next generation accordingly the chosen chromosomes are modified using different genetic operators as such chromosomes are reproduced this process continues until the stopping criterion is reached a simple example of gep chromosome is included in the supplementary material section the chromosomes can have one or more genes when using gep genes include two different types of information the first type which is stored in the head includes information which is used in generating the whole gep model the head includes some predetermined set of functions and some terminals related to the terminal set fixed parameters or variables the second type of gene information is stored within the tail which only contains the terminals the tail includes information which could be used in the succeeding generations of the gep model the arrangement of the functions and the terminals within the head and the tail is related to one gene in gep which is known as structural architecture different types of genetic operators i e mutation inversion three transportation operators insertion sequence is transportation root insertion sequence ris transportation gene transportation and crossover are used to reproduce different generations of the selected chromosomes which have been thoroughly explained by ferreira 2001 this process goes on and chromosomes are reproduced through it until the stopping criterion complies the gep flowchart is provided in the supplementary material section 2 5 non linear regression nlr finding a suitable relationship between dependent and independent variables is one of the classical problems in statistical relations regression relations are usually used to describe quantitative relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables tabari et al 2010 non linear regression nlr is a form of regression which can estimate dependent variables related to independent variables through non linear relationship in this study the dependent variables are width w depth d and slope s of the channel in stable conditions and the independent variables are the flow discharge q mean sediment size d50 and shields parameter τ of 85 gaging stations of three stable iranian rivers afzalimehr et al 2010 obtained three non linear regression equations for predicting width depth and slope of stable channels these equations were obtained from the non linear regression on the same data sets used for gs gmdh and gep modeling as follows 8 w 5 876 q 0 743 9 d 0 226 q 0 345 10 s 1 565 d 50 0 821 τ 0 851 afzalimehr et al 2010 found that q is the main influential parameter in width and depth estimation while the channel slope is mainly affected by parameters d50 and τ 2 6 models inputs and processes in order to achieve the objectives eight different gs gmdh and gep models with various input combinations q d50 and τ are obtained to find the most appropriate combination for predicting each target parameter 24 models for w d and s prediction in total training and testing of the models are carried out using 85 gaging stations of three stable rivers in this paper 60 data 70 of all data 85 data and 25 data 30 of all data 85 data are randomly selected for training and testing the applied models respectively accordingly in order to comprehend the effect of each mentioned parameters of q d50 and τ on stable channel dimensions w d and s four different models input configurations for each method gs gmdh and gep were defined as follow gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 w d and s f d50 τ gs gmdh 2 and gep 2 w d and s f q d50 gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 w d and s f q τ gs gmdh 4 and gep 4 w d and s f q d50 τ as it can be observed model 4 includes all parameters simultaneously and other models are conducted to study the effect of neglecting each input parameter in prediction accuracy the equations that were obtained by gs gmdh and gep methods for stable channel width depth and slope design are represented in the following sections 2 7 evaluation of the results six statistical evaluation criteria are used for assessing the model s efficiency as follows 1 the correlation coefficient r 11 r i 1 n y i y i y i y i i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 2 mean absolute error mae 12 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 3 root mean square error rmse 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 4 mean absolute relative error mare 14 mare 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 5 average absolute deviation δ 15 δ i 1 n y i y i i 1 n y i 100 6 bias bias 16 bias i 1 n y i y i n where yi and y i denote the observed and predicted values and y i and y i represent the mean observed and predicted values respectively n is the number of used data r provides a measure of how well the observed values are replicated by the models values of r close to unit represent a better agreement of the observed and predicted values the superiority of rmse and mae is in that both have the same units as the predicted target variable the benefit of δ index is the non dimensionality which enables the comparison of the models regardless of dimension and size pulido calvo and portela 2007 totally low mae rmse mare δ and high r coefficient prove model superiority against other rival models also positive and negative bias values show the over under estimation of the applied models respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluations of gs gmdh and gep methods in width prediction fig 2 shows the scatter plot of observed vs estimated channel width w of gep and gs gmdh 1 4 models for all data set due to the limited number of data 85 the scatter plots are drawn for all data set 10 and 20 relative bands are also illustrated in fig 2 to highlight the difference between the models table 1 presents the statistical indices for proposed gs gmdh and gep models in predicting w in training and test stages as shown in fig 2 the gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 models present the worst performance where lots of their results have exceeded the 20 error lines presented statistical indexes of table 1 also indicate the weak performance of the gs gmdh 1 r 0 45 and gep 1 r 0 463 the inputs of model 1 are d50 and τ that implies the consequence of not considering q parameter as input also the high values of δ and mare around 16 and 10 in gs gmdh and gep methods respectively admit the above description also negative values of bias in these two models gs gmdh and gep show an underestimation of the models in the test stage after model 1 gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 with higher r values have slightly improved both models performance however their overall performance accuracy is not acceptable in model 3 in the test stage a decrease of 62 in relative error value is seen for gs gmdh 3 in comparison with gs gmdh 1 while the relative error value of gep 3 has decreased only about 7 this might partly explain the better performance of the gs gmdh over gep improvement of gs gmdh 3 in comparison with gs gmdh 1 is noticeable due to the better accordance of fitted line with exact line while the gep 3 has not a considerable development with a high deviation of fitted line with the exact line models 2 and 4 are observed as superior models to the rest with the highest r values approximately 0 97 and 0 70 for gs gmdh and gep respectively and the lowest error values approximately 4 and 7 δ respectively the remarkable improvement in prediction accuracy of gep in comparison with gs gmdh is observed in these two models the error indexes of two models of 2 and 4 are almost the same but the fitted line in model 2 is in better accordance with its exact line which indicates better agreement of model 2 with observed data also the scattering of data in model 2 is more uniform but in model 4 some central points have no data and the results are gathered in some points the values of bias and δ indices confirm this statement comparison of gs gmdh and gep shows that both methods have the same procedure for w design which admits the influence of mentioned effective hydraulic parameters on w as it is seen both gs gmdh and gep have almost the same performance in predicting w due to close values of r and error indices but gs gmdh r 0 97 mare 0 037 performs slightly better than gep r 0 7 mare 0 065 from the table model 2 which includes two input parameters of q and d50 produces the most accurate results with minimum error values while the weakest estimation belongs to model 1 with d50 and τ inputs the difference between these two models is in the presence of q as an input parameter which causes significant increase of the accuracy of model 2 comparison of models 4 and 2 reveals the lowest impact of τ on w prediction accuracy afzalimehr et al 2010 so that excluding τ from the inputs leads to only 13 increase in relative error and 1 decrease in correlation coefficient in gs gmdh 2 comparison of models 2 and 3 which both comprise q as input shows the higher effect of d50 versus τ in w prediction so that the absence of d50 causes 40 and 27 increase in mare values of gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 models respectively it shows the dominant effect of d50 on w in comparison with τ effect comparison of models 1 and 3 which both includes τ input approves the aforementioned statement of the dominant effect of q on w by 62 decrease of mare value in gs gmdh 3 due to the inclusion of q as an input parameter it is clearly seen that q has the greater effect on w than d50 and this result is accurately matched with hey and thorne s 1986 research considering table 1 the stable channel width w showed a strong medium and weak relation with q d50 and τ respectively model 2 with q and d50 inputs is selected as the best model and between two methods of gs gmdh and gep the gs gmdh with better prediction is selected as the superior method r 0 97 rmse 0 135 mae 0 106 mare 0 037 as mentioned before the ai models have wider applications than previous models empirical theoretical and extremal ai models are able to predict the stable channel geometry for different rivers and artificial channels with the various hydraulic conditions however the main problem with these models concerns how to set the models parameters in order to have an efficient estimation therefore the absence of required information about the effective parameters on the functions of these models is the limitation of ai models furthermore in some cases despite accurate adjusting of different models variables the model is not capable of detecting and predicting a governing trend of the dataset in other words one of the noticeable limitations of the ai methods is the disability of these methods to identify the physics of the process which can sometimes cause inefficiency of the models in prediction of the investigated variables based on the available dataset on the other hand simple and easy usage of the ai methods and representation of reliable relations between input and output parameters by an empirical function are the advantages of the ai methods however a lack of explanation about the process of obtaining results by ai methods is one of the disadvantages of these methods also despite the capability of ai models to make accurate predictions of output variables in different hydraulic conditions it is possible that these models cannot accurately predict the intended variables based on the other datasets with a significant difference with the initial datasets used to train and test the models the reason of this issue is that the results of ai methods are not obtained based on the fundamentals of hydraulics and they simulate the results based on mathematical calculations in addition despite presenting a reliable relation another disadvantage of the gs gmdh model is the complexity of the gs gmdh relation in comparison with gep however one of the remarkable points of the gs gmdh method is the strong ability of this method to recognize the most effective variables for output prediction indeed in a problem with various input variables it is a considerable ability of a method to recognize the most least influential variables the greatest advantages of gmdh model are 1 offering a function in a feed forward network based on a second degree transfer function 2 changing number of layers and neurons within hidden layers and 3 adjusting automatic resolute effective input variables and optimal model structure furthermore the gs gmdh algorithm supplies a mean to attain accurate estimation for limited number of data 3 2 evaluations of gs gmdh and gep methods in depth prediction fig 3 present the scatter plots of predicting stable channel depth for two methods of gep and gs gmdh in comparison with corresponding observed values for all dataset table 2 sums up the statistical indices for each gs gmdh and gep methods in depth prediction in training and testing stages the table shows that gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 models which include d50 and τ as input parameters produce the worst results with minimum and maximum values of r and error indices respectively the poor performance of model 1 in fig 3 can be seen clearly with the significant deviation of the fitted line from the exact line as well as the high dispersion of the results around 20 error lines average values of δ and mare around 10 in both gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 in the test stage show the similar performance of these methods with a slight greater correlation of gep 1 than gs gmdh 1 the gs gmdh 2 and gep 2 models provide better results than the gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 models by an increase of 62 and 31 in r and a decrease of 34 and 30 in mare values for the gs gmdh and gep methods respectively due to the inclusion of q instead of τ as an input parameter in model 2 the results imply the higher effect of q versus τ on accurate depth prediction the improvement of both gs gmdh 2 and 3 and gep 2 and 3 models in comparison with gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 can be seen in fig 3 and table 2 by the increase of r values although the correlation coefficient values of both gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 have been increased in comparison with gs gmdh 2 and gep 2 the error index values of mare mae and δ of these two models gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 show their identical performance the comparison between model 2 mare 0 06 and 0 071 for gs gmdh and gep respectively and model 3 mare 0 058 and 0 057 for gs gmdh and gep respectively which both have q as input parameter reveals the more intense effect of τ on d prediction in comparison with d50 by producing higher r values and lower error indexes in both gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 models in all models 2 3 and 4 the gep with higher r values and lower error values act more efficiently in the prediction of stable channel depth in comparison with the gs gmdh the results of these two methods gep and gs gmdh have almost the same procedure as both provide the best results in models 3 and 4 model 4 is slightly better and the superiority of gep versus gs gmdh is seen in all the models except model 1 by comparing the first three models models 1 3 it is observed that q is the most dominant variable in channel depth prediction and the τ and d50 are ranked as the second and third influential variables respectively model 3 with q and τ inputs produced identical statistical indexes with model 4 which employs all the input variables this demonstrates the superior accuracy of model 3 among the first three models and near equal performance to model 4 as has been previously documented the flow discharge is the most important factor adjusting and changing the width and depth of the channel to achieve the stable state and τ and d50 are the second and third most important factors in achieving stability of depth bray 1982 hey and thorne 1986 afzalimehr et al 2009 2010 the results of this study are in full accordance with previous studies as the models with the presence of q input have better performance models 2 3 and 4 and between these models models 3 and 4 have the best estimations also comparison of model 3 with inputs of q and τ with model 4 with inputs of q τ and d50 shows the slight difference of these two models which indicates the negligible effect of d50 in stable channel depth prediction therefore it can be said that although model 4 for both methods gs gmdh and gep has the best estimation in depth prediction model 3 only slightly less accurate than model 4 is more acceptable from the point of view of hydraulic principles q and τ are main parameters affecting stable channel depth model 3 has a more logical hydraulic justification to be chosen as the best model but model 4 is selected as the superior model due to lower error indexes in both training and test stages and thus is more reliable to use in real cases design since it produces more precise results with the least error values in comparison with other models both gs gmdh 4 and gep 4 models have the best prediction by relative error reduction of 6 and 26 in comparison with gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 models respectively comparison of gep 4 and gs gmdh 4 models shows better performance of gep as observed with the fitted line shown in fig 3 also generating simple equations by gep in comparison with complicated relations produced by gs gmdh is another advantage of gep accordingly model 4 and the method of gep is introduced as the best method for stable channel depth design due to its high accuracy and since it results in a simple relation that can be used in real cases with different q d50 and τ one of the significant advantages of gep is to examine the mechanical behavior of the neurons and produce equations for estimating target parameters with no previous assumptions gholami et al 2018a however the slow convergence speed high running time is the significant disadvantage of gep model furthermore one of the remarkable points of the gep model is the attendance of different operators and functions exp sin etc in the obtained equation which increases the complexity of this model compared to previous empirical and theoretical methods 3 3 evaluations of gs gmdh and gep methods in slope prediction table 3 shows the performance of the gs gmdh and gep methods in predicting stable channel slope s in training and testing stages fig 4 shows models performance through scatter plots between the modeled and observed values as it is clear from fig 4 model 1 and 4 are closer to diagonal line and are restricted between 10 error lines despite the fact that models 2 and 3 have exceeded the 20 error lines these scatter plots confirm the models results reported in table 3 as the table shows the worst results belong to gs gmdh 2 and gep 2 models with q and d50 inputs with minimum r and maximum values of error indices in both methods after model 2 model 3 with τ input instead of d50 is ranked in the next position from the aspect of performance weakness comparison of two models of 2 and 3 which both have q parameter as input reveals the dominant effect of τ on slope prediction versus d50 that makes a considerable difference of gep 2 19 increase of r values in gep 3 with gs gmdh 2 70 increase of r values in gs gmdh 3 fig 4 demonstrates the weak performance of models of 2 and 3 by a considerable deviation of the fitted line with the exact line in model 2 lots of the predicted values by gep are fallen out of 20 error line and also the high negative amount of bias and high deviation of the fitted line shows the unreliability of model 2 gs gmdh 2 presents weaker performance with high error value r 0 17 and mare 0 183 in comparison with gep 2 r 0 63 and mare 0 080 in model 3 movement of the fitted line toward exact line shows performance enhancement of both gs gmdh and gep methods in comparison with model 2 and also the elimination of large under and over estimations of model 2 after model 3 model 1 with d50 and τ inputs show the best prediction among the first three models 30 and 17 increase in r and 40 and 58 decrease in mare values in gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 methods respectively the comparison of model 1 d50 and τ and model 3 q and τ which both have τ input signifies the greater effect of d50 on s versus q comparison of models 1 and 4 shows close values of the statistical indexes for both methods eliminating q from the calculation process leads to only a 4 change of r values of these models 1 and 4 in another words close values of statistical indexes of model 1 d50 and τ and model 4 q d50 and τ show the negligible effect of q on the prediction accuracy of s that by excluding q from calculation process as input the prediction accuracy doesn t show a remarkable change according to afzalimehr et al 2010 q has just a slight improving role in estimating slope despite the fact that the τ and d50 are the main factors to achieve an accurate slope design afzalimehr et al 2010 accordingly gep 1 is chosen as the best method for stable channel slope design which can present a simple relation moreover its high prediction capability a remarkable point achieved from the above mentioned discussions sections 3 1 3 3 is that both employed ai methods of this study could accurately diagnose the most influential parameters among the utilized input variables q d50 and τ on stable channel dimensions w d and s and all achieved results are in agreement with previous research hey and thorne 1986 afzalimehr et al 2009 2010 the primary advantage of the ai methods used for stable channel design is the excellent performance in identifying controlling parameters on stable channels dimensions as these models can readily recognize the effect of including or excluding each input variable while most of the results investigated in previous studies are on the basis of theoretical principles or regression methods hey and thorne 1986 julien and wargadalam 1995 lee and julien 2006 in summary the stable channel width adjustment is highly dependent on flow discharge and mean sediment size and the flow depth is mainly affected by flow discharge and shields parameter and the shields parameter and mean sediment size are the most effective variables in stable channel slope prediction selecting a suitable input combination for predicting each geometric parameter of stable channels width depth and slope is a critical aspect to make precise estimates as demonstrated in this research even using a strong novel method with inappropriate input variables can lead to an undesirable result while this paper investigated the effect of each variable of flow discharge mean sediment size and shields parameter on stable channel dimensions there might be other influential factors affecting stable channel geometry that are not considered in this paper also in most hydraulic measurements there are two probable groups of errors sample errors and model errors harman et al 2008 therefore the sample errors which are raised from measurement and observational errors could reduce the models certainty and accuracy in estimating the shape and geometry of stable channels the errors produced by the models are another factor to decrease the accuracy of the obtained results gholami et al 2018b the next section provides a brief comparison between the chosen ai methods with regression based equations to highlight the performance of the applied methods 3 4 comparison of gs gmdh and gep methods with nlr in this section the results of the superior gs gmdh and gep models according to the previous sections 3 1 3 3 and the nlr equations eqs 8 10 presented by afzalimehr et al 2010 for w d and s prediction are evaluated in fig 5 box plots are drawn to illustrate the comparison of real data values with used ai methods and nlr model for all dataset also the error values based on all dataset both training and testing data between the predicted and observed values related to superior gs gmdh and gep models are compared with nlr results in table 4 from the box plots to predict the width it can be seen that in the gep and nlr methods the middle line is not located in the middle of the box and is related to up and down of the box indicating that the channel width values are estimated greater and less than the corresponding observational values respectively also in the gs gmdh the middle line is located with a tiny difference in the middle of the box and same level with the median line of observational values that indicates the greater accuracy of gs gmdh than the remaining two models also the lowest box length in the nlr model indicates that the data scattering is less in middle 50 while the larger whisker line at 25 lower data quartile third indicates that data scattering in this quartet is more than other models as opposed to the gep model in the depth prediction the nlr model again has the smallest length of the box and with a greater lower whisker line the majority of the data is located at a lower 25 of the data in the two gs gmdh and gep models the median line of data is toward to lower and higher values indicating underestimation and overestimation of the models respectively however the median line in the gep model with slight difference is consistent with the median line of observational values indicating greater accuracy of gep the slope prediction graphs show that the length of the box in both gs gmdh and nlr models is almost equal and larger than the corresponding observational values which indicates more data scattering in these two models while the box length in the gep model has the same length of the box of the observational values that represent the best fit of gep with observational values the great length of up and down of the whisker line in the gep model indicates the presence possibility of a 2 3 outlier data which is negligible beside the acceptable length of the box in this model generally as represented in table 4 the gs gmdh and gep models outperforms nlr method with 24 21 and 2 for gs gmdh model and 17 31 and 53 for gep model reduction of mae values for width depth and slope respectively one of the remarkable advantages of the gep and gs gmdh methods is that they are capable of producing equations for prediction target variables through the appropriate combination of input variables and thus can be compared with other relations obtained from empirical or theoretical methods the derived equations by the methods of gep and gs gmdh for prediction of width depth and slope are gathered in box 1 fig 6 is provided to better show the mae error difference of gs gmdh and gep in all dataset with nlr method in the form of bar graphs fig 6 indicates that all the error values of nlr equations are higher than the gs gmdh and gep models as illustrated in fig 6 the performance of gs gmdh is the best in width estimation while in depth and slope estimation the gep outperforms the other methods according to fig 6 a notable point is the acceptable results of nlr method in comparison with gs gmdh and gep this may have two main reasons the first is that using the most dominant variables in the presented equations by afzalimehr et al 2010 flow discharge for width and depth prediction and mean sediment size and shields parameter for slope prediction and the high coefficients and exponents of the dominant variables for prediction of each target variable improves the effect of influential parameters on prediction accuracy the second reason is that the equations of afzalimehr et al 2010 eqs 8 10 are obtained based on the same data set that the gs gmdh and gep have been trained and tested these two main reasons made afzalimehr et al 2010 regression equations produce reasonable results in comparison with ai methods 4 conclusions in this study gs gmdh gep and nlr methods were employed to develop new accurate empirical equations for prediction of stable channel dimensions width depth and slope data from 85 river cross sections were used to train and test the models the sensitivity analysis was conducted to provide new insights on the effect of each input variable including flow discharge q mean sediment size d50 and shields parameter τ on the predicted stable channel geometry i e the width w the depth d and the slope s the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the results showed that both gs gmdh and gep models were able to accurately estimate stable channel dimensions the gs gmdh model could predict the channel width with high accuracy by creation of a polynomial mathematical relation between input and output values despite the high capability of gs gmdh model in the prediction of limited number of data 85 cross sections the gep model predicted the depth and slope of the channel more accurately in agreement with all advantages of gp and ga methods 2 among three different parameters used as inputs in gs gmdh and gep models flow discharge q and mean sediment size d50 had the highest effect on w prediction so that the lack of q and d50 led to 77 and 40 increase in relative error values 3 among four different gep models presented for stable channel depth design d model 3 including two input parameters of flow discharge and shields parameter had more rational and hydraulically justification than other models it was found that d is mainly dependent on q and τ parameters 4 the best model to predict stable channel slope s was the model that includes d50 and τ as inputs while the worst model was found as model 2 with q and d50 inputs in contrast to the width and depth design in which model 1 had the weakest performance model 1 was the best model in slope prediction because the slope is strongly dependent on τ and d50 5 comparing ai and regression methods gs gmdh and gep had a superior performance in stable channel design due to high correlation coefficients and least error indexes r 0 89 and mare 0 055 r 0 8 and mare 0 035 r 0 96 and mare 0 03 for width depth and slope respectively 6 according to obtained results except width prediction the gep model performs more accurately than gs gmdh model in depth and slope estimations the reason of the superiority of the gep to the gs gmdh is the method s ability to estimate the target variables with closer values to observed data and thus producing lower error indexes 7 because of the linear encoding method the proposed relations by the gep model are simpler than the gs gmdh model which leads to easier application of gep in estimation of stable channels dimensions furthermore the prediction sets in the gep model are selected automatically in the gep model the setting of parameters is less than the gs gmdh model and most of the parameters do not need to be set in the gs gmdh model certain parameters inevitably need to be initially determined however the gs gmdh method can automatically adjust its structure and neuron numbers in the training stage 8 one of the notable points of this study was that both employed ai methods could accurately identify the effect of each input variable on stable channel dimensions and the obtained results were in complete agreement with other studies therefore the findings of this study provide essential guidance to river engineers and hydrologists in the design of stable channels with similar input variables further studies are needed to test the applied methods with a wider range of input variables in addition to q d50 and τ appendix a supplementary material supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2018 09 057 appendix a

6973,accurate prediction of the long term average dimensions of alluvial stable channels is a significant problem in river engineering the goal of this research is to investigate the effect of flow discharge q mean sediment size d50 and shields parameter τ on the stable channel dimensions by employing non linear regression nlr and two artificial intelligence ai methods including generalized structure of group method of data handling gs gmdh neural network and gene expression programming gep discharge grain size and shields parameter from 85 gaging stations situated in three stable iranian rivers were used as input data for the three methods to estimate the water surface width w average flow depth d and longitudinal slope s of the rivers based on the results it was found that the gs gmdh produced more accurate results for simulating the channel width with a mean absolute relative error mare value of 0 055 and gep produced better estimations for channel depth and slope with mare values of 0 035 and 0 03 respectively furthermore by employing artificial intelligence ai methods gs gmdh and gep the rmse values decreased by 22 25 and 75 in predicting width depth and slope respectively compared to nlr method the overall results showed that the ai methods generally produced better estimations than the non linear regression method to determine the effect of each input variable q d50 τ on the target variables w d s a sensitivity analysis comprising various combinations of input variables was conducted based on the results the flow discharge had a dominant role on depth and width estimation of stable channels in slope estimation the most important parameter was τ and then d50 while the discharge had a weak effect on slope prediction in general the shields

the rate of sediment transport is approximately equivalent to the existing sediment load and thus the average dimensions of the channel are preserved constant over time julien 2002 accurate design of cross section dimensions of stable alluvial channels has a significant role in different branches of engineering such as sediment transport capacity estimation flood mapping bridges construction crossing rivers estimation of stream water quality and estimating maintenance costs shields et al 2003 muthukrishnavellaisamy et al 2009 jang et al 2016 gazendam et al 2016 atieh et al 2015 2017 top width w mean flow depth d and longitudinal slope s are the main geometric parameters of defining stable channels afzalimehr et al 2010 according to fig 1 historic methods for determining stable channels dimensions can be classified into three main groups including empirical theoretical and extremal methods empirical relations are those that are obtained based on statistical rules employed on data from different rivers which relate the independent parameters such as flow discharge or mean sediment size to geometric dependent variables of the channel such as width depth and slope empirical methods have been a consideration of many researchers due to their simplicity and requiring less independent variables data set hey and thorne 1986 estimated w d and s of 62 stable river reaches in the form of independent variables of the flow discharge bed sediment size bank vegetation type bed sediment load and valley slope by employing multiple regression technique hey and thorne 1986 stated that the flow discharge and the vegetation growth are the primary drivers in the adjustment of width and depth to reach to the stable state and the slope adjustment is more influenced by particle size hey and thorne 1986 stated that the lack of a hydraulic basis for the empirical relations was the primary limitation of these methods since the empirical relations were obtained based on a limited data theoretical methods gained increasing attention theoretical methods are those that predict stable channel geometry parameters through solving the governing hydraulic rules on the flow and sediment particle and are gained based on the simultaneously solving the governing hydraulic equations henderson 1961 julien and wargadalam 1995 determined stable channel dimensions by the simultaneous solving continuity of the flow flow resistance secondary flow and transport of sediment equations in coarse grained alluvial bed rivers julien and wargadalam 1995 reported that the theoretical based equations are more reliable than empirical relations due to the usage of the governing rules of hydraulics and fluid mechanics and thus can be used for any river geomorphology conditions afzalimehr et al 2010 concluded that their empirical methods have better prediction capability and their relative simplicity and lack of complicated calculations present another advantage over theoretical method although empirical relations may produce acceptable results for geometry estimations of the rivers which they are obtained from they may lead to unsatisfactory results for other rivers with different geomorphology and environmental conditions and this issue limits their general use stevens and nordin 1987 the empirically derived equations are not based on the fundamentals of hydraulics and fluid mechanics and thus cannot be accurately used for different rivers bose 1936 the simplicity of the empirical relations causes empirical method to be considered by many researchers and enables this method to predict stable channel geometry parameters with just one or two variables without need of a vast data set however most of the empirical relations are presented only in the form of flow discharge or considering the mean sediment size as the second factor and neglect the influence of other effective variables such as sediment transport sediment concentration and the shields parameter in addition to the complicated calculation process of theoretical methods which demand vast data set with various variables and despite their advantage of greater applicability for different rivers conditions these methods also fail to present an exact estimation extremal methods usually relate w d and s of stable channels to flow resistance and sediment transport equations and a third equation that is usually expressed as minimization or maximization of a parameter the most applied theories used in an extremal method for stable channels design can be mentioned as minimum stream power maximum sediment transport rate and minimum froude number chang 1979 white et al 1982 jia 1990 millar 2005 presented equations for calculating w d and s of stable channels in the form of flow discharge and mean sediment size by assuming the maximum sediment transport efficiency hypothesis and compared their results with empirical and theoretical equations millar 2005 concluded that the results from extremal based equations are in agreement with theoretical and empirical methods and their results didn t show a remarkable improvement in comparison with other methods therefore due to the above mentioned deficiencies of previous methods empirical theoretical and extremal a more robust method which can be used to estimate stable channel geometry with a greater degree of accuracy in a variety of hydraulic and geomorphological conditions is necessary the most recent advanced artificial intelligence ai methods can be employed on a range of environmental conditions and they lead to more precise results in comparison with empirical and theoretical methods gholami et al 2017a some examples and applications of ai methods in different fields of science included modeling hydrological time series nayak et al 2004 forecasting streamflow shiri and kisi 2010 prediction of lake level variations kisi et al 2012 prediction of flow pattern in curved channels gholami et al 2016a b 2017b friction factor prediction roushangar et al 2014a energy dissipation roushangar et al 2014b bed load discharge roushangar et al 2014c in the context of the stable channels riahi madvar et al 2011 developed multilayer perceptron mlp artificial neural network with a back propagation algorithm for estimating width depth and slope of stable channels tahershamsi et al 2012 investigated two different mlp and radial basis function rbf for predicting the stable width of channels mohamed 2013 predicted hydraulic radius wetted perimeter and slope of stable channels using regression equations and multi layer feed forward ann based on back propagation algorithm bonakdari and gholami 2016 predicted the width of stable channels in gravel bed rivers using an ann method the above mentioned previous research demonstrated the superiority of the ai methods in comparison with empirical theoretical methods most notably gholami et al 2017a used the group method of data handling gmdh method to estimate stable channel geometry in a gravel bed stream gholami et al 2017a compared their results with previous empirical and theoretical relations presented by other investigators and concluded that gmdh led to more precise design shaghaghi et al 2017 evaluated and compared different evolutionary algorithms in combination with gmdh method to predict stable channel width shaghaghi et al 2017 concluded that the gmdh method based on particle swarm optimization pso learning algorithm gave worse results compared to the gmdh method based on ga and also they demonstrated that the empirical relations failed to give precise predictions in comparison with gmdh the above literature showed that there are very few if any research related to the application of gs gmdh and gep methods for stable channel design with the exception of the recent contribution of gholami et al 2018a b c who investigated the ability of different ai methods in prediction of shape profile formed on stable channel banks in state of static equilibrium and referred to the high accuracy of ai methods in estimation of bank profile characteristics however these authors did not report any results about channel geometry and the influential parameters in addition most of the ai methods applied by other researchers in the field of designing stable channels ann rbf are not able to produce an explicit equation relating the input variables with the outputs therefore the ai methods with the ability to produce an explicit equation to determine the output parameters are remarkable for designers among the ai methods both gmdh and gep are capable of giving a practical equation to determine the output parameters w d s in the form of input variables q d50 and τ the objectives of the present study are to 1 evaluate and compare the capability of gs gmdh and gep for predicting the w d and s of stable channels 2 diagnose the most influential parameters on stable channels geometry w d and s through a sensitivity analysis by considering different combinations of input variables q d50 and τ and 3 compare the most accurate models of gs gmdh and gep with nlr based equations to introduce the best solution for the investigated problem 2 material and methods 2 1 used data this study is conducted based on data from 85 gaging stations in three gravel bed rivers in iran the hydraulic specifications of kaaj river southwestern iran behesht abad river southwestern iran and gamasiab river western iran were used for training testing and validation of the used methods gs gmdh gep and nlr the measurement and collection of all used data in the present study were done by afzalimehr et al 2010 for each of the 85 cross sections three to five velocity profiles were measured in each velocity profile 13 to 16 point velocity measurements were taken therefore in total 85 cross sections 425 velocity profiles and approximately 6000 point velocities were measured these velocity profiles were used to accurately characterize the flow discharge at a specified section of the river for each cross section the exact position of the section was first marked by putting bars on the both sides of the channel and fencing with rope in each reach using the current meter bar the flow depth was measured at 0 5 m intervals across each cross section after depth the top width was recorded afzalimehr et al 2010 divided the water surface width into five parts vertical intervals to mark the locations of measuring profiles of velocity the velocities at each site were gauged across the depth direction from the bed to water surface by employing a butterfly meter with horizontal axes during measurements with the butterfly meter the cylindrical leg diameter 15 cm and thickness 5 cm was jointed to the current meter bar in this way the nearest point to the bed was measured 5 cm above the bed as in 20 of the depth and between 3 and 5 cm in the upper 80 of the depth for measuring velocity points this was done because of the relatively smaller velocity gradient in the upper 80 depth compared to 20 of the depth nearest to the bed the time step for each point velocity measurement was taken as 50 s afzalimehr et al 2010 calculated the shear velocity u using recorded point velocities by applying the log law then by applying the boundary layer theory the shields parameter was calculated without the presence of channel depth and slope d s certain practically such estimation will eliminate the risk of any interdependence and will provide a better understanding of the flow behavior as verified by afzalimehr and anctil 2000 the longitudinal slope was determined by surveying in selected stations at the central axis of the river therefore two stations were chosen and the water surface was marked in both stations then the water surface slope was determined by dividing the difference of water surface elevations by the space between the two stations the bed material size was determined by wolman s method wolman 1954 the average flow depth of each station was computed by dividing the cross sectional area a by the water surface width d a w hey and thorne 1986 lee and julien 2006 afzalimehr et al 2010 observations in the selected rivers were done during different seasons that revealed that the sections were generally stable afzalimehr et al 2010 in other words despite occurring erosion and sedimentation in bed and banks of each section erosion and sedimentation are in equilibrium different sections and reaches attain to stable state so that the mean dimensions especially width of channel do not have any variation in different periods of time one season to another along a year and this criterion is confirmed by many researchers mikhailova et al 1980 abdelhaleem et al 2016 the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of all used data in this study which are gathered by afzalimehr et al 2010 is represented in supplementary materials section q d50 and τ are used as inputs of the models and w d and s are the target variables that are estimate according to the observational data see the supplementary material τ represents the dimensionless shields parameter calculated based on the shear velocity and boundary layer theory defined as 1 τ τ ρ s ρ g d s where ρs represents the sediment mass density ρs 26 5 kn m3 ρ is the water mass density ρ 10 kn m3 g denotes the gravitational acceleration g 9 81 m2 s ds denotes the diameter of the particle or d s d 50 ν g g 1 1 3 with relative density g ρ s ρ ν is the kinematic viscosity ν 1 10 6 m2 s and τ is the shear stress expressed as 2 τ ρ u 2 where u is shear velocity which is derived from the st venant equations and zero pressure gradient methods such as u gd s f u gd s 0 respectively where sf and s0 are the friction and channel bed slope respectively and d is the average flow depth according to bray 1982 most studies on natural channels have been done based on average geometric elements and steady uniform flow is assumed to occur such an assumption has allowed the shear velocity to be approximated as u gd s 0 using zero pressure gradient method in estimation of shear velocity for the gravel bed rivers is the primary source of error and discrepancy between the calculated and estimated flow resistance also the pressure gradient affects the reynolds stress distribution over the gravel bed channel and consequently leads to a shear velocity considerably different from the zero pressure gradient case bettess et al 1988 afzalimehr 1998 in order to develop methods of calculating turbulent boundary layers in the presence of a pressure gradient the need for a method to measure the shields parameter is manipulated in the present paper the shear velocity is obtained based on st venant equations which is calculated by velocity value located on inner region of boundary layer theory this technique was first introduced by afzalimehr 1998 2 2 group method of data handling gmdh gmdh was firstly introduced by ivakhnenko 1971 as an evolutionary computation technique based on a self organized learning machine to model the complex systems amanifard et al 2008 the system identification problem in gmdh algorithms is to achieve a function by the feed forward network which can be used to predict the output y instead of actual output y for a set n input variable as x 1 x 2 x 3 x n using gmdh neural network provides an appropriate connection between input and output variables with no definition of the related under study subject in this way gmdh builds a mathematical description between output and input variable with a nonlinear function which is called the volterra series in the form of eq 3 farlow 1984 ivakhnenko and muller 1997 3 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a ij x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n x j a ijk x i x j x k where n is a number of input variables and x x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x in shows the input variable vector with m observational patterns a system of partial quadratic polynomials including two variables neurons in the form of eq 4 is utilized by the gmdh algorithm to analyze the eq 3 4 g x i x j a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a 3 x i 2 a 4 x j 2 a 5 x i x j the main aim of the gmdh neural network is to find the existing coefficients ai in eq 4 using the regression technique ivakhnenko 1971 iba and sato 1995 nariman zadeh et al 2005 for each pair of input variables xi and xj out of total n input variable in this case each coefficient of quadric function gi of eq 4 is obtained to fit optimally the predicted y according to eq 6 in the all input output data pair set with the least square error as farlow 1984 ivakhnenko and muller 1997 nariman zadeh et al 2005 5 e i 1 m y i g i 2 m min 6 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x in i

hybridized by other evolutionary algorithms in this paper the ga is employed for designing an accurate and applicable model based on a gmdh algorithm therefore a robust simple and novel encoding scheme is produced to evolutionary design of the generalized structure of gmdh gs gmdh where the connectivity configuration is not bounded to an adjacent layer as developed by nariman zadeh and jamali 2007 additionally the encoding scheme of gs gmdh technique produces an accurate solution using ga and three different objective functions i e training error testing error and neuron number the advantages of this approach over the previous gmdh are 1 the connection of neurons related to two non adjacent layers in the previous gmdh method each neuron is connected with only a neuron in an adjacent layer structures of neurons are encoded in a string of chromosomes that can be linked with non adjacent layers moreover the genetic operators such as crossover and mutation are allocated randomly for all length of chromosomes string 2 minimization of training error the training error is minimized in gs gmdh method to keep the modeling error at a minimum level and prevent from overfitting 3 minimization of model size the model can be simplified as much as possible using neuron number minimization to achieve a precise and practical model with the minimum complexity through akaike s information criterion aic as kondo and ueno 2006 7 aic n log m s e 2 k 1 c m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n where yi and y i denote the observed and predicted values respectively n and k are the number of test train samples and model neuron respectively mse is the mean squared error and c is a constant the aic is a relative goodness measurement index of a statistical model fit the gs gmdh neural network has the ability for specification of different sizes and lengths of neural networks refer to the supplementary material section the random chosen points are selected from the 2j 1 set where j is the number of hidden layer neurons of chromosomes producing different chromosomes length by crossover operation makes different size of gs gmdh structure on the other hand the mutation operator is related to population diversity which changes the genes in a chromosome by symbolic digits to another symbol these operators are iterated until a valid chromosome is achieved otherwise these operators are not acceptable in the present paper the gs gmdh neural network is optimally designed based on 100 individual populations with 0 95 crossover probability also the 250 generations are used with mutation probability of 0 1 moreover exceeding such population number would not produce better results as discussed by previous studies e g nariman zadeh et al 2005 nariman zadeh and jamali 2007 amanifard et al 2008 ebtehaj et al 2015 shaghaghi et al 2017 2 4 gene expression programming gep according to ferreira 2001 gep is linear based genetic programming gep was produced from two evolutionary algorithms namely ga and genetic programming gp by koza 1992 ferreira 2001 employed the benefits of both ga linear chromosome with constant length and gp expression trees with different shapes and sizes simultaneously to overcome the limitations of these methods by gep gep is also considered multigenetic which can solve more and different complex programs ferreira 2001 2006 alavi et al 2013 the main components of gep mathematical algorithms include control fitness function function set terminal set and terminal condition parameters mousavi et al 2014 each gene in gep consists of a fixed length set of symbols these symbols can be any components of the terminal set z l m n 1 or function set tan sin alavi et al 2013 the gep modeling process is initialized by the random generation of an initial chromosome population each individual chromosome in the initial population is assessed using the defined fitness functions for the problem ferreira 2001 azamathulla and ahmad 2012 kisi and shiri 2012 chromosomes that are considered to have better fitness function values are chosen to use in the next generation accordingly the chosen chromosomes are modified using different genetic operators as such chromosomes are reproduced this process continues until the stopping criterion is reached a simple example of gep chromosome is included in the supplementary material section the chromosomes can have one or more genes when using gep genes include two different types of information the first type which is stored in the head includes information which is used in generating the whole gep model the head includes some predetermined set of functions and some terminals related to the terminal set fixed parameters or variables the second type of gene information is stored within the tail which only contains the terminals the tail includes information which could be used in the succeeding generations of the gep model the arrangement of the functions and the terminals within the head and the tail is related to one gene in gep which is known as structural architecture different types of genetic operators i e mutation inversion three transportation operators insertion sequence is transportation root insertion sequence ris transportation gene transportation and crossover are used to reproduce different generations of the selected chromosomes which have been thoroughly explained by ferreira 2001 this process goes on and chromosomes are reproduced through it until the stopping criterion complies the gep flowchart is provided in the supplementary material section 2 5 non linear regression nlr finding a suitable relationship between dependent and independent variables is one of the classical problems in statistical relations regression relations are usually used to describe quantitative relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables tabari et al 2010 non linear regression nlr is a form of regression which can estimate dependent variables related to independent variables through non linear relationship in this study the dependent variables are width w depth d and slope s of the channel in stable conditions and the independent variables are the flow discharge q mean sediment size d50 and shields parameter τ of 85 gaging stations of three stable iranian rivers afzalimehr et al 2010 obtained three non linear regression equations for predicting width depth and slope of stable channels these equations were obtained from the non linear regression on the same data sets used for gs gmdh and gep modeling as follows 8 w 5 876 q 0 743 9 d 0 226 q 0 345 10 s 1 565 d 50 0 821 τ 0 851 afzalimehr et al 2010 found that q is the main influential parameter in width and depth estimation while the channel slope is mainly affected by parameters d50 and τ 2 6 models inputs and processes in order to achieve the objectives eight different gs gmdh and gep models with various input combinations q d50 and τ are obtained to find the most appropriate combination for predicting each target parameter 24 models for w d and s prediction in total training and testing of the models are carried out using 85 gaging stations of three stable rivers in this paper 60 data 70 of all data 85 data and 25 data 30 of all data 85 data are randomly selected for training and testing the applied models respectively accordingly in order to comprehend the effect of each mentioned parameters of q d50 and τ on stable channel dimensions w d and s four different models input configurations for each method gs gmdh and gep were defined as follow gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 w d and s f d50 τ gs gmdh 2 and gep 2 w d and s f q d50 gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 w d and s f q τ gs gmdh 4 and gep 4 w d and s f q d50 τ as it can be observed model 4 includes all parameters simultaneously and other models are conducted to study the effect of neglecting each input parameter in prediction accuracy the equations that were obtained by gs gmdh and gep methods for stable channel width depth and slope design are represented in the following sections 2 7 evaluation of the results six statistical evaluation criteria are used for assessing the model s efficiency as follows 1 the correlation coefficient r 11 r i 1 n y i y i y i y i i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 2 mean absolute error mae 12 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 3 root mean square error rmse 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 4 mean absolute relative error mare 14 mare 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 5 average absolute deviation δ 15 δ i 1 n y i y i i 1 n y i 100 6 bias bias 16 bias i 1 n y i y i n where yi and y i denote the observed and predicted values and y i and y i represent the mean observed and predicted values respectively n is the number of used data r provides a measure of how well the observed values are replicated by the models values of r close to unit represent a better agreement of the observed and predicted values the superiority of rmse and mae is in that both have the same units as the predicted target variable the benefit of δ index is the non dimensionality which enables the comparison of the models regardless of dimension and size pulido calvo and portela 2007 totally low mae rmse mare δ and high r coefficient prove model superiority against other rival models also positive and negative bias values show the over under estimation of the applied models respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluations of gs gmdh and gep methods in width prediction fig 2 shows the scatter plot of observed vs estimated channel width w of gep and gs gmdh 1 4 models for all data set due to the limited number of data 85 the scatter plots are drawn for all data set 10 and 20 relative bands are also illustrated in fig 2 to highlight the difference between the models table 1 presents the statistical indices for proposed gs gmdh and gep models in predicting w in training and test stages as shown in fig 2 the gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 models present the worst performance where lots of their results have exceeded the 20 error lines presented statistical indexes of table 1 also indicate the weak performance of the gs gmdh 1 r 0 45 and gep 1 r 0 463 the inputs of model 1 are d50 and τ that implies the consequence of not considering q parameter as input also the high values of δ and mare around 16 and 10 in gs gmdh and gep methods respectively admit the above description also negative values of bias in these two models gs gmdh and gep show an underestimation of the models in the test stage after model 1 gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 with higher r values have slightly improved both models performance however their overall performance accuracy is not acceptable in model 3 in the test stage a decrease of 62 in relative error value is seen for gs gmdh 3 in comparison with gs gmdh 1 while the relative error value of gep 3 has decreased only about 7 this might partly explain the better performance of the gs gmdh over gep improvement of gs gmdh 3 in comparison with gs gmdh 1 is noticeable due to the better accordance of fitted line with exact line while the gep 3 has not a considerable development with a high deviation of fitted line with the exact line models 2 and 4 are observed as superior models to the rest with the highest r values approximately 0 97 and 0 70 for gs gmdh and gep respectively and the lowest error values approximately 4 and 7 δ respectively the remarkable improvement in prediction accuracy of gep in comparison with gs gmdh is observed in these two models the error indexes of two models of 2 and 4 are almost the same but the fitted line in model 2 is in better accordance with its exact line which indicates better agreement of model 2 with observed data also the scattering of data in model 2 is more uniform but in model 4 some central points have no data and the results are gathered in some points the values of bias and δ indices confirm this statement comparison of gs gmdh and gep shows that both methods have the same procedure for w design which admits the influence of mentioned effective hydraulic parameters on w as it is seen both gs gmdh and gep have almost the same performance in predicting w due to close values of r and error indices but gs gmdh r 0 97 mare 0 037 performs slightly better than gep r 0 7 mare 0 065 from the table model 2 which includes two input parameters of q and d50 produces the most accurate results with minimum error values while the weakest estimation belongs to model 1 with d50 and τ inputs the difference between these two models is in the presence of q as an input parameter which causes significant increase of the accuracy of model 2 comparison of models 4 and 2 reveals the lowest impact of τ on w prediction accuracy afzalimehr et al 2010 so that excluding τ from the inputs leads to only 13 increase in relative error and 1 decrease in correlation coefficient in gs gmdh 2 comparison of models 2 and 3 which both comprise q as input shows the higher effect of d50 versus τ in w prediction so that the absence of d50 causes 40 and 27 increase in mare values of gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 models respectively it shows the dominant effect of d50 on w in comparison with τ effect comparison of models 1 and 3 which both includes τ input approves the aforementioned statement of the dominant effect of q on w by 62 decrease of mare value in gs gmdh 3 due to the inclusion of q as an input parameter it is clearly seen that q has the greater effect on w than d50 and this result is accurately matched with hey and thorne s 1986 research considering table 1 the stable channel width w showed a strong medium and weak relation with q d50 and τ respectively model 2 with q and d50 inputs is selected as the best model and between two methods of gs gmdh and gep the gs gmdh with better prediction is selected as the superior method r 0 97 rmse 0 135 mae 0 106 mare 0 037 as mentioned before the ai models have wider applications than previous models empirical theoretical and extremal ai models are able to predict the stable channel geometry for different rivers and artificial channels with the various hydraulic conditions however the main problem with these models concerns how to set the models parameters in order to have an efficient estimation therefore the absence of required information about the effective parameters on the functions of these models is the limitation of ai models furthermore in some cases despite accurate adjusting of different models variables the model is not capable of detecting and predicting a governing trend of the dataset in other words one of the noticeable limitations of the ai methods is the disability of these methods to identify the physics of the process which can sometimes cause inefficiency of the models in prediction of the investigated variables based on the available dataset on the other hand simple and easy usage of the ai methods and representation of reliable relations between input and output parameters by an empirical function are the advantages of the ai methods however a lack of explanation about the process of obtaining results by ai methods is one of the disadvantages of these methods also despite the capability of ai models to make accurate predictions of output variables in different hydraulic conditions it is possible that these models cannot accurately predict the intended variables based on the other datasets with a significant difference with the initial datasets used to train and test the models the reason of this issue is that the results of ai methods are not obtained based on the fundamentals of hydraulics and they simulate the results based on mathematical calculations in addition despite presenting a reliable relation another disadvantage of the gs gmdh model is the complexity of the gs gmdh relation in comparison with gep however one of the remarkable points of the gs gmdh method is the strong ability of this method to recognize the most effective variables for output prediction indeed in a problem with various input variables it is a considerable ability of a method to recognize the most least influential variables the greatest advantages of gmdh model are 1 offering a function in a feed forward network based on a second degree transfer function 2 changing number of layers and neurons within hidden layers and 3 adjusting automatic resolute effective input variables and optimal model structure furthermore the gs gmdh algorithm supplies a mean to attain accurate estimation for limited number of data 3 2 evaluations of gs gmdh and gep methods in depth prediction fig 3 present the scatter plots of predicting stable channel depth for two methods of gep and gs gmdh in comparison with corresponding observed values for all dataset table 2 sums up the statistical indices for each gs gmdh and gep methods in depth prediction in training and testing stages the table shows that gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 models which include d50 and τ as input parameters produce the worst results with minimum and maximum values of r and error indices respectively the poor performance of model 1 in fig 3 can be seen clearly with the significant deviation of the fitted line from the exact line as well as the high dispersion of the results around 20 error lines average values of δ and mare around 10 in both gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 in the test stage show the similar performance of these methods with a slight greater correlation of gep 1 than gs gmdh 1 the gs gmdh 2 and gep 2 models provide better results than the gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 models by an increase of 62 and 31 in r and a decrease of 34 and 30 in mare values for the gs gmdh and gep methods respectively due to the inclusion of q instead of τ as an input parameter in model 2 the results imply the higher effect of q versus τ on accurate depth prediction the improvement of both gs gmdh 2 and 3 and gep 2 and 3 models in comparison with gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 can be seen in fig 3 and table 2 by the increase of r values although the correlation coefficient values of both gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 have been increased in comparison with gs gmdh 2 and gep 2 the error index values of mare mae and δ of these two models gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 show their identical performance the comparison between model 2 mare 0 06 and 0 071 for gs gmdh and gep respectively and model 3 mare 0 058 and 0 057 for gs gmdh and gep respectively which both have q as input parameter reveals the more intense effect of τ on d prediction in comparison with d50 by producing higher r values and lower error indexes in both gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 models in all models 2 3 and 4 the gep with higher r values and lower error values act more efficiently in the prediction of stable channel depth in comparison with the gs gmdh the results of these two methods gep and gs gmdh have almost the same procedure as both provide the best results in models 3 and 4 model 4 is slightly better and the superiority of gep versus gs gmdh is seen in all the models except model 1 by comparing the first three models models 1 3 it is observed that q is the most dominant variable in channel depth prediction and the τ and d50 are ranked as the second and third influential variables respectively model 3 with q and τ inputs produced identical statistical indexes with model 4 which employs all the input variables this demonstrates the superior accuracy of model 3 among the first three models and near equal performance to model 4 as has been previously documented the flow discharge is the most important factor adjusting and changing the width and depth of the channel to achieve the stable state and τ and d50 are the second and third most important factors in achieving stability of depth bray 1982 hey and thorne 1986 afzalimehr et al 2009 2010 the results of this study are in full accordance with previous studies as the models with the presence of q input have better performance models 2 3 and 4 and between these models models 3 and 4 have the best estimations also comparison of model 3 with inputs of q and τ with model 4 with inputs of q τ and d50 shows the slight difference of these two models which indicates the negligible effect of d50 in stable channel depth prediction therefore it can be said that although model 4 for both methods gs gmdh and gep has the best estimation in depth prediction model 3 only slightly less accurate than model 4 is more acceptable from the point of view of hydraulic principles q and τ are main parameters affecting stable channel depth model 3 has a more logical hydraulic justification to be chosen as the best model but model 4 is selected as the superior model due to lower error indexes in both training and test stages and thus is more reliable to use in real cases design since it produces more precise results with the least error values in comparison with other models both gs gmdh 4 and gep 4 models have the best prediction by relative error reduction of 6 and 26 in comparison with gs gmdh 3 and gep 3 models respectively comparison of gep 4 and gs gmdh 4 models shows better performance of gep as observed with the fitted line shown in fig 3 also generating simple equations by gep in comparison with complicated relations produced by gs gmdh is another advantage of gep accordingly model 4 and the method of gep is introduced as the best method for stable channel depth design due to its high accuracy and since it results in a simple relation that can be used in real cases with different q d50 and τ one of the significant advantages of gep is to examine the mechanical behavior of the neurons and produce equations for estimating target parameters with no previous assumptions gholami et al 2018a however the slow convergence speed high running time is the significant disadvantage of gep model furthermore one of the remarkable points of the gep model is the attendance of different operators and functions exp sin etc in the obtained equation which increases the complexity of this model compared to previous empirical and theoretical methods 3 3 evaluations of gs gmdh and gep methods in slope prediction table 3 shows the performance of the gs gmdh and gep methods in predicting stable channel slope s in training and testing stages fig 4 shows models performance through scatter plots between the modeled and observed values as it is clear from fig 4 model 1 and 4 are closer to diagonal line and are restricted between 10 error lines despite the fact that models 2 and 3 have exceeded the 20 error lines these scatter plots confirm the models results reported in table 3 as the table shows the worst results belong to gs gmdh 2 and gep 2 models with q and d50 inputs with minimum r and maximum values of error indices in both methods after model 2 model 3 with τ input instead of d50 is ranked in the next position from the aspect of performance weakness comparison of two models of 2 and 3 which both have q parameter as input reveals the dominant effect of τ on slope prediction versus d50 that makes a considerable difference of gep 2 19 increase of r values in gep 3 with gs gmdh 2 70 increase of r values in gs gmdh 3 fig 4 demonstrates the weak performance of models of 2 and 3 by a considerable deviation of the fitted line with the exact line in model 2 lots of the predicted values by gep are fallen out of 20 error line and also the high negative amount of bias and high deviation of the fitted line shows the unreliability of model 2 gs gmdh 2 presents weaker performance with high error value r 0 17 and mare 0 183 in comparison with gep 2 r 0 63 and mare 0 080 in model 3 movement of the fitted line toward exact line shows performance enhancement of both gs gmdh and gep methods in comparison with model 2 and also the elimination of large under and over estimations of model 2 after model 3 model 1 with d50 and τ inputs show the best prediction among the first three models 30 and 17 increase in r and 40 and 58 decrease in mare values in gs gmdh 1 and gep 1 methods respectively the comparison of model 1 d50 and τ and model 3 q and τ which both have τ input signifies the greater effect of d50 on s versus q comparison of models 1 and 4 shows close values of the statistical indexes for both methods eliminating q from the calculation process leads to only a 4 change of r values of these models 1 and 4 in another words close values of statistical indexes of model 1 d50 and τ and model 4 q d50 and τ show the negligible effect of q on the prediction accuracy of s that by excluding q from calculation process as input the prediction accuracy doesn t show a remarkable change according to afzalimehr et al 2010 q has just a slight improving role in estimating slope despite the fact that the τ and d50 are the main factors to achieve an accurate slope design afzalimehr et al 2010 accordingly gep 1 is chosen as the best method for stable channel slope design which can present a simple relation moreover its high prediction capability a remarkable point achieved from the above mentioned discussions sections 3 1 3 3 is that both employed ai methods of this study could accurately diagnose the most influential parameters among the utilized input variables q d50 and τ on stable channel dimensions w d and s and all achieved results are in agreement with previous research hey and thorne 1986 afzalimehr et al 2009 2010 the primary advantage of the ai methods used for stable channel design is the excellent performance in identifying controlling parameters on stable channels dimensions as these models can readily recognize the effect of including or excluding each input variable while most of the results investigated in previous studies are on the basis of theoretical principles or regression methods hey and thorne 1986 julien and wargadalam 1995 lee and julien 2006 in summary the stable channel width adjustment is highly dependent on flow discharge and mean sediment size and the flow depth is mainly affected by flow discharge and shields parameter and the shields parameter and mean sediment size are the most effective variables in stable channel slope prediction selecting a suitable input combination for predicting each geometric parameter of stable channels width depth and slope is a critical aspect to make precise estimates as demonstrated in this research even using a strong novel method with inappropriate input variables can lead to an undesirable result while this paper investigated the effect of each variable of flow discharge mean sediment size and shields parameter on stable channel dimensions there might be other influential factors affecting stable channel geometry that are not considered in this paper also in most hydraulic measurements there are two probable groups of errors sample errors and model errors harman et al 2008 therefore the sample errors which are raised from measurement and observational errors could reduce the models certainty and accuracy in estimating the shape and geometry of stable channels the errors produced by the models are another factor to decrease the accuracy of the obtained results gholami et al 2018b the next section provides a brief comparison between the chosen ai methods with regression based equations to highlight the performance of the applied methods 3 4 comparison of gs gmdh and gep methods with nlr in this section the results of the superior gs gmdh and gep models according to the previous sections 3 1 3 3 and the nlr equations eqs 8 10 presented by afzalimehr et al 2010 for w d and s prediction are evaluated in fig 5 box plots are drawn to illustrate the comparison of real data values with used ai methods and nlr model for all dataset also the error values based on all dataset both training and testing data between the predicted and observed values related to superior gs gmdh and gep models are compared with nlr results in table 4 from the box plots to predict the width it can be seen that in the gep and nlr methods the middle line is not located in the middle of the box and is related to up and down of the box indicating that the channel width values are estimated greater and less than the corresponding observational values respectively also in the gs gmdh the middle line is located with a tiny difference in the middle of the box and same level with the median line of observational values that indicates the greater accuracy of gs gmdh than the remaining two models also the lowest box length in the nlr model indicates that the data scattering is less in middle 50 while the larger whisker line at 25 lower data quartile third indicates that data scattering in this quartet is more than other models as opposed to the gep model in the depth prediction the nlr model again has the smallest length of the box and with a greater lower whisker line the majority of the data is located at a lower 25 of the data in the two gs gmdh and gep models the median line of data is toward to lower and higher values indicating underestimation and overestimation of the models respectively however the median line in the gep model with slight difference is consistent with the median line of observational values indicating greater accuracy of gep the slope prediction graphs show that the length of the box in both gs gmdh and nlr models is almost equal and larger than the corresponding observational values which indicates more data scattering in these two models while the box length in the gep model has the same length of the box of the observational values that represent the best fit of gep with observational values the great length of up and down of the whisker line in the gep model indicates the presence possibility of a 2 3 outlier data which is negligible beside the acceptable length of the box in this model generally as represented in table 4 the gs gmdh and gep models outperforms nlr method with 24 21 and 2 for gs gmdh model and 17 31 and 53 for gep model reduction of mae values for width depth and slope respectively one of the remarkable advantages of the gep and gs gmdh methods is that they are capable of producing equations for prediction target variables through the appropriate combination of input variables and thus can be compared with other relations obtained from empirical or theoretical methods the derived equations by the methods of gep and gs gmdh for prediction of width depth and slope are gathered in box 1 fig 6 is provided to better show the mae error difference of gs gmdh and gep in all dataset with nlr method in the form of bar graphs fig 6 indicates that all the error values of nlr equations are higher than the gs gmdh and gep models as illustrated in fig 6 the performance of gs gmdh is the best in width estimation while in depth and slope estimation the gep outperforms the other methods according to fig 6 a notable point is the acceptable results of nlr method in comparison with gs gmdh and gep this may have two main reasons the first is that using the most dominant variables in the presented equations by afzalimehr et al 2010 flow discharge for width and depth prediction and mean sediment size and shields parameter for slope prediction and the high coefficients and exponents of the dominant variables for prediction of each target variable improves the effect of influential parameters on prediction accuracy the second reason is that the equations of afzalimehr et al 2010 eqs 8 10 are obtained based on the same data set that the gs gmdh and gep have been trained and tested these two main reasons made afzalimehr et al 2010 regression equations produce reasonable results in comparison with ai methods 4 conclusions in this study gs gmdh gep and nlr methods were employed to develop new accurate empirical equations for prediction of stable channel dimensions width depth and slope data from 85 river cross sections were used to train and test the models the sensitivity analysis was conducted to provide new insights on the effect of each input variable including flow discharge q mean sediment size d50 and shields parameter τ on the predicted stable channel geometry i e the width w the depth d and the slope s the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the results showed that both gs gmdh and gep models were able to accurately estimate stable channel dimensions the gs gmdh model could predict the channel width with high accuracy by creation of a polynomial mathematical relation between input and output values despite the high capability of gs gmdh model in the prediction of limited number of data 85 cross sections the gep model predicted the depth and slope of the channel more accurately in agreement with all advantages of gp and ga methods 2 among three different parameters used as inputs in gs gmdh and gep models flow discharge q and mean sediment size d50 had the highest effect on w prediction so that the lack of q and d50 led to 77 and 40 increase in relative error values 3 among four different gep models presented for stable channel depth design d model 3 including two input parameters of flow discharge and shields parameter had more rational and hydraulically justification than other models it was found that d is mainly dependent on q and τ parameters 4 the best model to predict stable channel slope s was the model that includes d50 and τ as inputs while the worst model was found as model 2 with q and d50 inputs in contrast to the width and depth design in which model 1 had the weakest performance model 1 was the best model in slope prediction because the slope is strongly dependent on τ and d50 5 comparing ai and regression methods gs gmdh and gep had a superior performance in stable channel design due to high correlation coefficients and least error indexes r 0 89 and mare 0 055 r 0 8 and mare 0 035 r 0 96 and mare 0 03 for width depth and slope respectively 6 according to obtained results except width prediction the gep model performs more accurately than gs gmdh model in depth and slope estimations the reason of the superiority of the gep to the gs gmdh is the method s ability to estimate the target variables with closer values to observed data and thus producing lower error indexes 7 because of the linear encoding method the proposed relations by the gep model are simpler than the gs gmdh model which leads to easier application of gep in estimation of stable channels dimensions furthermore the prediction sets in the gep model are selected automatically in the gep model the setting of parameters is less than the gs gmdh model and most of the parameters do not need to be set in the gs gmdh model certain parameters inevitably need to be initially determined however the gs gmdh method can automatically adjust its structure and neuron numbers in the training stage 8 one of the notable points of this study was that both employed ai methods could accurately identify the effect of each input variable on stable channel dimensions and the obtained results were in complete agreement with other studies therefore the findings of this study provide essential guidance to river engineers and hydrologists in the design of stable channels with similar input variables further studies are needed to test the applied methods with a wider range of input variables in addition to q d50 and τ appendix a supplementary material supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2018 09 057 appendix a

6974,large scale in situ soil moisture monitoring networks are becoming increasingly valuable research tools but existing networks feature almost exclusive deployment of stations in grassland vegetation these grassland soil moisture observations are unlikely to adequately represent the real soil moisture patterns in landscapes with intermixed land cover types here we demonstrate the severity of the problem for one particular landscape and introduce a flexible new method for solving the problem the specific objectives of this study were i to compare root zone soil moisture dynamics of two dominant vegetation types across oklahoma grassland observed and winter wheat cropland simulated ii to relate the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and cropland vegetation using an artificial neural network ann as an observation operator and iii to use the resulting ann to estimate the soil moisture spatial patterns for a landscape of intermixed grassland and wheat cropland root zone soil moisture was represented by plant available water paw in the top 0 8 m of the soil profile paw under grassland was calculated from 18 years of soil moisture observations at 83 stations of the oklahoma mesonet whereas paw under winter wheat was simulated for the same 83 locations using a calibrated and validated soil water balance model then we trained an ann to reproduce the simulated paw under winter wheat using only six inputs day of the year latitude and longitude measured paw under grassland and percent sand and clay the resulting ann was used along with grassland soil moisture observations to estimate the detailed soil moisture pattern for a 9 9 km2 soil moisture active passive smap grid cell the seasonal dynamics of root zone paw for grassland and winter wheat were strongly asynchronous so grassland soil moisture observations rarely reflect cropland soil moisture conditions in the region the simple ann approach facilitated efficient and accurate prediction of the simulated paw under winter wheat rmsd 21 mm and normalized rmsd 0 17 using observed paw under grassland as an input this new method for estimating soil moisture under adjacent contrasting land covers at a relatively low computational cost could be employed for any region and land cover pairing with training data available and it may significantly enhance the applications of existing large scale soil moisture monitoring networks keywords soil moisture in situ networks cropland grassland temporal stability oklahoma mesonet 1 introduction the increasing relevance of soil moisture measurements for climate modeling hirschi et al 2010 koster and suarez 2001 hydrologic prediction houser et al 1998 western et al 2004 and agricultural drought monitoring bolten et al 2010 mozny et al 2012 torres et al 2013 has propelled the deployment of new observing systems including aerial and satellite remote sensing emerging proximal sensing technologies and large scale in situ monitoring networks ochsner et al 2013 while soil moisture observations using remote and proximal sensing are typically limited to the soil surface in situ networks fill a unique niche by accurately monitoring both surface and root zone soil moisture across relatively large spatial extents e g watershed state or nation at high temporal resolution e g hourly dorigo et al 2011 these networks can provide soil moisture measurements for greater depths and higher temporal resolutions that can be achieved using satellites such as advanced scatterometer ascat gelsthorpe et al 2000 soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 the in situ networks can also play a vital role in calibration and validation of satellite derived soil moisture estimates if the point measurements from the network can be effectively upscaled to the satellite footprint however most existing large scale networks share in common the limitation that stations have been deployed almost exclusively under grassland vegetation since soil moisture sensors are often associated with automated weather stations grassland sites are usually chosen over forest sites where fetch is typically inadequate for above ground measurements grassland sites also offer greater long term operational stability than cropland where farming operations make long term deployment of automated soil moisture sensors impractical the bias of in situ networks towards grassland sites and the presence of unmonitored contrasting land covers between the network stations create substantial uncertainty when estimating the soil moisture condition in landscapes with intermixed land covers how well can grassland soil moisture observations represent the actual soil moisture patterns in landscapes with intermixed and contrasting land covers to help answer this question we explore here the relationship between grassland soil moisture measurements and soil moisture values in nearby cropland soil moisture values under grassland and adjacent cropland can differ substantially due to dissimilarities in plant functional types phenology and land management practices and the differences are typically not temporally stable i e differences are time dependent for example 5 cm grassland soil moisture measurements from an nrcs scan network schaefer et al 2007 station in the walnut creek watershed in iowa overestimated soil moisture in nearby corn and soybean fields by 20 on average and the difference was not stable over time cosh et al 2004 in the upper cedar creek watershed in indiana sensors located under grassland at the edge of two soybean fields overestimated field average 5 cm soil moisture by 4 12 on average but again the difference was not temporally stable heathman et al 2012 for the same watershed han et al 2012 found that the cumulative density function cdf matching operator was able to reliably translate soil moisture observations from permanent sensors at the edge of the field into average field soil moisture but the cdf observation operator was not constant in time the absence of a temporally stable relationship between soil moisture values under grassland and cropland is likely due to differences in phenology fig 1 and growth habit between these land cover types and this absence hinders the use of data from in situ networks in a variety of contexts from agricultural drought monitoring to soil moisture satellite validation there is a clear need to better understand how effectively grassland based in situ networks can represent the soil moisture dynamics of landscapes with intermixed and contrasting land covers there is also a need to develop upscaling methods that do not require temporally stable relationships between land covers in order to enhance the value and applications of large scale soil moisture monitoring networks particularly for validation of remote sensing soil moisture products and to improve the estimation of water and heat fluxes in land surface models and large scale hydrological models yeh and eltahir 2005 in this study set in the us southern great plains we examine whether soil moisture observations in warm season grassland can be used to effectively estimate soil moisture conditions of nearby winter wheat cropland the specific objectives of this study were i to compare root zone soil moisture dynamics of two dominant and intermixed vegetation types in the southern great plains grassland measured and winter wheat cropland simulated ii to relate the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and cropland vegetation using a neural network as an observation operator and iii to apply the resulting neural network to estimate the soil moisture spatial patterns and spatial mean for a landscape of intermixed grassland and wheat cropland specifically a 9 9 km2 smap grid cell 2 materials and methods 2 1 setting of the study the study was conducted in oklahoma usa where winter wheat is cultivated on approximately 2 million hectares mostly in the western part of the state fig 2 in this region most producers grow rainfed continuous winter wheat i e wheat monoculture using conventional tillage practices grasslands cover approximately 8 million hectares in oklahoma and are more evenly distributed across the state fig 2 as a result of the co existence and predominance of these two land covers in central and western oklahoma the landscapes in this region often consists of intermixed grassland and winter wheat at spatial scales 1 km grassland soil moisture measurements are available through the oklahoma mesonet an environmental monitoring network that spans the entire state mcpherson et al 2007 since its inception in 1994 the oklahoma mesonet has deployed a total of 140 stations with 120 stations currently active in the immediate vicinity 25 m radius of most stations the landscape is typically dominated by perennial warm season grasses such as bermuda grass cynodon dactylon l big bluestem andropogon gerardii l and little bluestem schizachyrium scoparium l although species vary depending on the geographic location of the station the soil at the stations is kept free from anthropogenic disturbance but the vegetation at the stations is mowed once or twice per year as needed to keep the vegetation height similar to that in the immediate surroundings and to facilitate access to the stations all stations monitor air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction rainfall incoming solar radiation and barometric pressure for 83 out of the 140 stations soil moisture observations are available from sensors installed at 0 05 0 25 and 0 60 m depths fig 2 we assumed each sensor to be located at the center of its representative soil layer scott et al 2013 thus the sensor installed at 0 05 m depth was assumed to be representative of the layer between the soil surface and 0 10 m depth similarly the sensors located at 0 25 and 0 60 m depth were assumed to be representative of the 0 10 to 0 40 m and 0 40 to 0 80 m soil layers respectively we defined root zone soil moisture as the plant available water paw in the top 0 8 m of the soil profile to allow direct comparisons of paw between grassland and winter wheat we assumed the root zone for both was limited to a depth of 0 8 m although we acknowledge that 0 8 m is a relatively shallow rooting depth we were constrained by the depth of soil moisture observations at the oklahoma mesonet stations nonetheless shallow soils and root restricting layers are common in the region and our choice of rooting depth is similar to that used in other related studies in the southern great plains e g heathman et al 2003 plant available water under grassland was calculated from 18 years of soil moisture observations at 83 stations of the oklahoma mesonet whereas paw under winter wheat was simulated for the same 83 locations using a soil water balance model described below the reason for relying on simulations of the soil moisture dynamics of wheat cropland was twofold i a modeling approach was the only way to obtain soil moisture estimates for the same points in space and time for both land covers and ii a modeling approach was the only practical alternative to conduct a soil moisture comparison among two land covers with adequate spatial and temporal extent to ensure the results are broadly applicable 2 2 plant available water observations under grassland daily values of plant available water under grassland were calculated from the output of the heat dissipation sensors cs 229l campbell scientific inc logan ut at the selected oklahoma mesonet sites following the steps detailed in scott et al 2013 briefly this approach consists of converting daily average normalized temperature differentials from the heat dissipation sensors into soil matric potential which was subsequently converted into volumetric water content using site and depth specific soil water retention parameters meso soil database version 1 3 available at http soilphysics okstate edu data for any given station the days with missing temperature differentials were excluded from the analysis daily paw was calculated by subtracting the lower limit soil moisture at 1500 kpa from the observed volumetric water content for each of the sensor depths and then multiplying the resulting values by the thickness of the corresponding soil layer root zone paw was calculated as the sum of the paw in each the three layers 2 3 plant available water model for winter wheat for each of the 83 selected locations we simulated paw in continuous winter wheat using the food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 dual crop coefficient dual kc method allen et al 1998 with daily time steps the dual kc is a parsimonious and well established two layer soil water balance model that has been calibrated and validated for wheat in several environments hunsaker et al 2007 lópez urrea et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 the dual kc model estimates crop evapotranspiration etc based on the evapotranspiration of a hypothetical well watered grass reference surface eto and empirically determined basal crop coefficients kcb that change with the different growth stages of the crop for winter wheat we used crop coefficients for specific wheat growth stages derived from prior lysimeter studies in the southern great plains ko et al 2009 piccinni et al 2007 because these authors reported single crop coefficients rather than basal crop coefficients values were adjusted following recommended methods allen et al 1998 table 1 we used the modified wang engel wes quantitative wheat phenological model streck et al 2003 wang and engel 1998 to simulate wheat growth stages the wes is a multiplicative phenological model that incorporates the effects of temperature and photoperiod to predict wheat stages the wes model consists of three main developmental stages emergence terminal spikelet initiation em ts terminal spikelet anthesis ts an and anthesis physiological maturity an pm both vegetative em ts and ts an and reproductive an pm stages have maximum developmental rates that are modulated by non linear functions that describe the effect of temperature and photoperiod on wheat development we adopted the set of parameters table 2 for winter wheat used by streck et al 2003 who modeled wheat phenological stages in the central great plains using cultivars that are also common in the southern great plains i e karl 92 to simulate daily paw using the dual kc model daily precipitation data were obtained from the oklahoma mesonet station at each simulation site missing precipitation values were retrieved from the nearest neighboring station with available rainfall data daily surface runoff was approximated using the natural resources conservation service curve number method hawkins et al 2009 the curve number for each location was estimated based on land cover i e winter wheat or fallow an estimated residue cover of 50 and the soil hydrologic group which was retrieved from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo soil survey staff 2015 upper and lower soil water retention limits and percent clay and sand were obtained from prior measurements at each oklahoma mesonet site scott et al 2013 simulations of the winter wheat growing season started on 15 october across the entire state although average winter wheat planting dates for the southern and northern part of oklahoma usually differ by about 10 days the selected date represents a reasonable midpoint growing season simulations were terminated on 1 june which is a reasonable date for physiological maturity in this region root growth was simulated using thermal time based on the empirical function proposed by steduto et al 2009 2 4 calibration and validation of the dual kc model the dual kc model was calibrated using a set of soil moisture measurements collected under continuous no till winter wheat from july 2009 to june 2011 at lahoma ok soil moisture was recorded every 15 days using a neutron probe soil moisture meter at 0 2 m intervals for each soil layer paw was calculated by subtracting the lower limit from the daily volumetric water content and then multiplying the resulting value by the thickness of each layer root zone paw was then determined by adding up the paw of the top four layers further details about this dataset were provided by patrignani et al 2012 calibration of the dual kc consisted of optimizing one model parameter that regulates the proportion of the plant available water capacity that can be depleted before plant stress occurs other parameters commonly included in the calibration process of the dual kc model are the effective evaporative layer and the total and readily evaporable water allen et al 2005 zhao et al 2013 in our study these parameters were not calibrated but were estimated using the fraction of sand and clay as described by allen et al 2005 the calibrated dual kc model was validated using three independent validation sets the first validation set consisted of a time series of paw in continuous no till winter wheat from 2011 to 2013 recorded at lahoma ok this validation set helped us to corroborate that the model was adequately predicting paw at the calibration site a second validation set was created using soil moisture observations from 2009 to 2011 at lake carl blackwell ok this site was located on a side slope 5 a landscape position on which winter wheat is sometimes cultivated in the southern great plains because of its topography this site served as a challenging scenario to evaluate the dual kc model at this location soil moisture was also measured using a neutron probe soil moisture meter at 0 2 m intervals under continuous conventional and no till wheat patrignani et al 2012 the third validation set consisted of 23 measurements of paw in the top 0 8 m from 8 site years across the state of oklahoma from march to may of 2014 and 2015 four measurements per field were collected at each sampling date from large scale 0 5 ha experimental fields and wheat producer fields during 2014 volumetric water content was measured using an impedance probe ml2x theta probe delta t devices with an attached extension to reach 0 8 m depth a manual auger eijkelkamp 65 mm o d was used to facilitate the access of the probe to 0 8 m depth in each core volumetric water content was recorded at six depths approximately every 0 15 m all volumetric water content values for each core were averaged to estimate the soil water content of the soil profile in 2015 soil moisture was also measured in four cores per field of 0 8 m depth using the thermo gravimetric method at each sampling date homogenized soil samples for each of the 0 8 m cores were used to estimate soil water content particle size analysis gavlak et al 2003 and soil water retention at 1500 kpa i e lower limit the upper limit for each soil was estimated by adding the available water holding capacity to the lower limit the water holding capacity for each soil was retrieved from a previous study in the region where this variable was measured in field conditions lollato and edwards 2015 in this third validation set the initial soil moisture condition of the sampled sites at the start of the winter wheat growing season was unknown therefore plant available water at wheat sowing was estimated using the method described by lollato et al 2016 which briefly consisted in starting model simulations in 1 june of the preceding summer fallow period root mean squared error rmse mean bias error mbe and wilmott s index of agreement willmott 1981 were used to describe the overall goodness of fit of the dual kc against field observations of paw 2 5 temporal and spatial soil moisture analyses for the purpose of comparing the temporal dynamics of root zone soil moisture in grassland and winter wheat we computed the long term 18 yr mean paw for four selected climate divisions of oklahoma with contrasting precipitation regimes these means were calculated by taking the arithmetic mean for each day of the year using paw values from 1 june 1997 to 1 june 2015 spatial soil moisture patterns were compared by generating state level maps of root zone paw for selected days maps were generated by interpolating paw at the selected locations to a grid of 15 cells per unit of latitude and longitude covering the state of oklahoma using the natural neighbor interpolation method sibson 1981 ledoux and gold 2005 the natural interpolation method relies on simple and objective geometrical assumptions voronoi diagrams or thiessen polygons and has shown good performance interpolating irregularly distributed geoscientific data ledoux and gold 2005 other spatial interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging were not used in this study since the number of points i e 83 stations is below the generally suggested value of 100 points goovaerts 1999 webster and oliver 1993 although these maps ignore the spatial distribution of the land cover they are useful to describe the broad spatial patterns imposed by the weather and vegetation grassland vs winter wheat across the state we used the median to characterize the central tendency of root zone paw at state level and the highest density interval hdi as a measure of dispersion the hdi represents the shortest interval that spans 95 of the values in a distribution kruschke 2015 2 6 relating grassland and cropland soil moisture using an observation operator to relate the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and winter wheat we developed an artificial neural network to serve as an observation operator drusch et al 2005 this approach can be summarized as ϕ wheat h ϕ grass β n ε where ϕwheat represents the soil moisture time series under wheat cropland ϕgrass represents the soil moisture time series under grassland ℋ represents the observation operator β n is the set of other covariates used to estimate cropland soil moisture and ε is the error term although models based on first principles are often preferred to explain environmental processes supervised machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks are ideal in scenarios with complex non linear interactions unknown relationships and abundant high quality data that can be used for proper training validation and testing abu mostafa et al 2012 a key benefit of developing an observation operator capable of estimating cropland soil moisture from grassland soil moisture observations is that it would dramatically reduce computational burdens associated with operational large scale high resolution soil moisture mapping we used a multi layer feedforward neural network trained by a backpropagation algorithm with stochastic gradient descent the simple feedforward neural network consisted of one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer the input layer had six neurons that corresponded to day of the year latitude and longitude observed root zone paw under grassland and the weighted percent of sand and clay in the top 0 8 m in addition to percent sand and clay content latitude and longitude were used to represent spatial environmental gradients in the studied region similarly day of the year was used as a temporal indicator of average atmospheric demand the hidden layer had 7 neurons fletcher and goss 1993 and the output layer had one neuron representing the root zone paw in continuous wheat the activation function between the input and the hidden layer was the following hyperbolic tangent function lecun et al 2012 x 1 7159 t a n h 2 x 3 this function has carefully selected parameter values so that saturation of the activation function is minimized while still taking advantage of its non linearity since this is a regression rather than a classification problem we used a linear activation function between the hidden and output layer to improve training performance we added a learning rate with value of 0 01 and a momentum of 0 25 to help with escaping local minima lecun et al 2012 using the same network structure an alternative neural network excluding grassland paw was trained validated and tested to evaluate the contribution of root zone grassland paw to predict root zone paw under wheat cropland for training validation and testing of the neural network a full dataset was created totaling over 400 000 entries for each of the six input and output variables 400 000 rows by 6 columns matrix for the period of 1 june 1997 to 1 june 2015 for the 83 selected oklahoma mesonet stations as output targets we used the paw for winter wheat simulated with the dual kc model rows with missing values in at least one of the six input or the output variable were eliminated from the dataset inputs and outputs were standardized by centering the data with a mean of zero and a variance of one the mean and variance were stored and were used to restore the standardized input and output values then we subdivided the full dataset to generate a training validation and testing set we assigned 70 of the values in the full dataset to the training set assigning large fractions of the full dataset to the training set is a common practice to ensure that most plausible scenarios are presented to the network during the training stage for better training performance values in the training set were shuffled using a pseudo random generator in matlab mathworks nantick ma lecun et al 2012 the randomization of the entries was performed for individual rows to keep inputs and outputs associated to each other the next step consisted in generating a validation set which was composed of only 10 of the values in the full dataset the validation set is intended to evaluate the neural network during the training process to identify the set of training weights that minimized the error in the validation set and thus minimize the risk of over fitting we selected the training weights that minimized the root mean squared error rmse of the validation set since the selected training weights were dependent on the validation set a third independent set of information was required to assess the prediction power of the trained neural network this was accomplished by creating a test set using the remaining 20 of the full dataset the test set included a total of 81 000 entries encompassing 18 stations with different annual precipitation regimes and contrasting soil properties because only the entries of the training set were shuffled none of the stations in the test set participated during the training process resulting in a robust test for the neural network other more complex approaches such as recurrent neural networks may hold potential for predicting soil moisture time series but we opted for a relatively simple feedforward neural network to avoid dependence on prior time steps which constitutes an advantage when dealing with time series that often contain missing data in light of the large number of values that were used for training validation and testing we used a bivariate histogram to pictorially represent the performance of the network the root mean squared difference rmsd the mean biased error mbe and the pearson s correlation coefficient r were used to evaluate the predictions of the neural network relative to paw simulated using the dual kc model for the evaluation of the neural network we used the term rmsd to emphasize that the differences were calculated relative to simulated and thus uncertain paw in winter wheat instead of ground truth field observations normalized rmsd nrmsd was calculated by dividing the rmsd value by the range of paw pawmax pawmin shcherbakov et al 2013 2 7 application of the neural network to estimate root zone paw patterns across a heterogeneous smap grid cell to demonstrate the significance of the observation operator we used it along with grassland soil moisture observations to estimate the detailed soil moisture pattern for a 9 9 km2 smap easev2 grid cell the soil moisture active passive smap mission was launched in january 2015 by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the goal of the mission is to provide information of surface soil moisture top 0 05 m and freeze thaw state at global scale with a latency of two to three days for this example we selected a grid encompassing an area dominated by winter wheat and grassland and also including the lahoma station of the oklahoma mesonet and the field site at which some of the calibration and validation data were recorded to estimate the paw under grassland and winter wheat cropland across the grid we followed these steps i identify locations of winter wheat cropland and grassland within the grid using the 2011 usda cropland data layer 30 30 m resolution ii retrieve observations of temperature differentials for the oklahoma mesonet stations recording soil moisture at all three sensor depths for the selected date iii convert temperature differentials into root zone paw under grassland iv use an interpolation method in this case natural neighbor to estimate grassland root zone paw for all locations i e assume that all pixels are under grassland vegetation within the smap grid cell v collect and normalize inputs for the neural network including day of the year for the selected date latitude and longitude of the wheat fields the interpolated grassland paw for the wheat cropland and the weighted percent sand and clay for each wheat cropland location within the grid and vi estimate the paw for the wheat cropland using the neural network as an observation operator that relates grassland and wheat cropland 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation considering all calibration and validation sets modeling root zone paw of winter wheat cropland using the dual kc model decreased estimation errors approximately 65 compared to the default approach of assuming that soil moisture observations under grassland represent soil moisture conditions under winter wheat the calibration of the dual kc model using the data set for lahoma 2009 2011 resulted in a rmse of 19 mm relative to the measured paw under winter wheat whereas direct use of the observed grassland paw at the nearest mesonet station resulted in a rmsd of 50 mm fig 3 a validation of the dual kc model using the sets of winter wheat paw measured at lahoma 2011 2013 and lake carl blackwell 2009 2011 fig 3b and c had rmse ranging from 18 to 20 mm mbe from 2 to 1 mm and d from 0 87 to 0 88 as in the calibration set prediction of winter wheat paw using observed grassland paw at the nearest mesonet station had rmsd values ranging from 72 to 62 mm in the validation set containing multiple sites from across the state fig 3d predictions of paw resulted in a rmse of 25 mm a good result considering that the soil moisture condition at the beginning of the growing season was unknown and had to be estimated by initializing the model in the preceding summer fallow although the model predictions were satisfactory lower rmse values for the dual kc model have been reported for winter wheat in the literature a study by zhao et al 2013 reported rmse of approximately 7 mm in the top meter of the soil profile a value three times lower than our study nonetheless in that study the calibration and validation sets contained soil moisture collected only during two growing seasons at a single location in contrast the strength of our study relies on a calibration and validation set totaling 148 field observations over a period of six years across multiple locations with diverse soil properties landscape positions and climate conditions also our study requires year round simulation of the winter wheat cropping system which is a greater challenge than simulating individual growing seasons under these circumstances predictions of root zone paw might be improved using more advance models such as the root zone and water quality model rzwqm or the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat but a drawback associated with more sophisticated models is the large number of parameters requiring calibration 3 2 asynchronous soil moisture dynamics long term mean root zone paw for grassland measured and winter wheat simulated displayed distinct sinusoidal seasonal cycles that were strongly asynchronous fig 4 winter wheat consistently had minimum paw values at the end of the growing season in early june doy 110 150 and maximum paw values at the end of the summer fallow doy 280 290 during the fallow period summer rainfall partial residue cover left from the prior wheat harvest and the absence of an actively growing vegetation contribute to a slow but positive soil moisture recharge on the other hand grassland showed minimum paw values from late july to mid august doy 210 280 and maximum paw values from early to late march doy 50 100 clearly the soil moisture dynamics under grassland were not representative of conditions under winter wheat the seasonal soil moisture cycles of each land cover were closely linked with vegetation dynamics while winter wheat is an annual cool season fall winter spring crop grasslands surrounding the stations of the oklahoma mesonet are predominantly composed of perennial warm season spring summer fall grasses in mid to late february winter wheat reaches the end of its dormant growth stage with green canopy cover typically 75 fig 1 although dormant the high percentage of green canopy cover can become fully active with a few days of warm temperatures explaining the typical rapid drying phase of winter wheat early in the spring compared to grassland fig 4 at the same time warm season grasslands typically have almost no green canopy cover which explains the lower soil moisture depletion rate in the early spring compared to continuous wheat despite the contrasting temporal dynamics of soil moisture between these land covers the mean annual paw of winter wheat and grassland vegetation were similar within different climate divisions within each climate division differences in median annual paw between grassland and winter wheat ranged from 8 mm in the north central division to 13 mm in the north east division across climate divisions median annual paw for continuous wheat ranged from 56 to 111 mm while the median annual paw of grassland ranged from 44 to 124 mm the lowest median annual paw for both land covers was in the oklahoma panhandle 460 mm 30 yr annual rainfall and the greatest median annual paw was observed in the northeast division of oklahoma 1200 mm 30 yr annual rainfall while the seasonal variations of paw within each climatic division were dominated by the land cover the median annual paw values were dominated by the climate and precipitation regime the seasonal soil moisture patterns of winter wheat observed in this study were in agreement with a prior study conducted by zhang 2004 who studied the soil moisture dynamics of continuous winter wheat in a watershed near el reno ok similarly the soil moisture dynamics in grassland vegetation closely matched those found by illston et al 2004 who conducted an analysis of the soil moisture patterns for the oklahoma mesonet the unique contribution of our study lies in the direct comparison of the soil moisture dynamics of these two dominant land covers that are usually intermixed in the landscape of the southern great plains at scales 1 km our results show that soil moisture observations from in situ networks deployed on warm season grassland vegetation should not be used directly to assess the soil moisture conditions of winter wheat in the southern great plains or climatically similar regions around the world the asynchronous soil moisture patterns observed for grassland and winter wheat in oklahoma would cause a lack of temporal stability in the relationship between edge of the field sensors and the actual soil moisture values under cropland a phenomenon which has been reported in prior studies e g han et al 2012 heathman et al 2012 3 3 spatial pattern of vegetation impacts on soil moisture state level interpolation of the long term average root zone paw of grassland measured and wheat cropland simulated for 1 april and 10 october revealed three distinct patterns as a consequence of the interaction between climate and land cover fig 5 in the oklahoma panhandle and southwestern portion of the state the low annual rainfall and the high atmospheric demand create soil moisture conditions that are typically in the dry range regardless of the land cover similarly in the northeastern part of the state the average annual rainfall regime 1000 mm consistently generates the relatively wet soil moisture conditions regardless of the land cover in contrast the central portion of the state shows a strong influence of the land cover on root zone soil moisture this is of particular relevance because a great portion of the wheat cropland in oklahoma is concentrated in the central western part of the state fig 2 where using observed soil moisture under grassland vegetation as a surrogate of the soil moisture condition under wheat cropland can induce substantial errors in root zone paw numerous studies aimed at better understanding the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture under varied topography and vegetation have focused on a highly instrumented watershed in southwest oklahoma called the little washita jackson et al 1999 mohanty and skaggs 2001 starks et al 2006 a study in the little washita conducted by mohanty and skaggs 2001 using soil moisture observations collected during southern great plains 1997 sgp97 hydrology experiment showed that areas with intermixed grassland and cropland had the least temporal stability in soil moisture the results in figs 4 and 5 help explain that previous finding the sgp97 experiment was conducted from mid june through mid july a time when soil moisture conditions under grassland and winter wheat cropland are typically trending in opposite directions fig 4 3 4 neural network based observation operator after training the neural network that included grassland paw as an input variable effectively mimicked the soil moisture dynamics under winter wheat as simulated by the dual kc model fig 6 a the only required inputs for operational use of this neural network are the day of the year latitude and longitude observed root zone paw under grassland and the depth weighted percent of sand and clay in the top 80 cm of the soil profile this neural network exploits information in grassland soil moisture observations to predict the soil moisture condition under winter wheat cropland the training of the neural network using over 280 000 simulated winter wheat paw values from the dual kc model resulted in mbe of 0 mm and correlation coefficient of 0 91 table 3 in the validation set this neural network resulted in mbe of 6 6 mm and correlation coefficient of 0 76 despite the lower correlation coefficient the validation set was effective to select the set of training weights that minimized overfitting of the neural network the performance of the neural network in the test set which was withheld in the training procedure showed a mbe of 0 1 mm correlation coefficient equal to 0 79 and rmsd equal to 21 1 mm values that are similar to those obtained with the dual kc model when compared to field observations conversely predictions of root zone paw under wheat using the neural network that excluded grassland paw from the input set showed poor predicting power in the validation and test sets resulting in rmsd of 34 mm and correlation coefficients ranging from 0 44 to 0 5 table 3 values that are substantially lower than those observed with the neural network including grassland paw the soil moisture time series for a particular location the waurika mesonet station shows the relatively close match between simulated paw dynamics using the dual kc model and the neural network observation operator that included grassland paw rmsd 20 9 assuming that the grassland soil moisture observations were representative of neighboring winter wheat cropland would have resulted in a rmsd of 46 8 mm relative to the dual kc model at waurika this suggests that the neural network that has grassland paw as input variable improves the prediction accuracy by 55 relative to the default assumption comparing the predictions of both neural networks with and without grassland paw for the waurika station fig 6a and b showed that excluding grassland paw from the input set fig 6b severely limited the predicting power of the neural network which was unable to predict the sharp drying and wetting events predicted by the dual kc 3 5 application of the neural network to a smap pixel one practical application of this approach can be demonstrated using a single 9 9 km2 grid cell fid 153137 row 329 column 877 of the recently launched smap mission this grid cell which includes the lahoma oklahoma mesonet station has a total of 8266 ha including intermixed grassland 23 of the area and winter wheat 59 of the area as the dominant land covers fig 7 a and b the estimation of paw at 30 m resolution for grassland by natural neighbor interpolation and wheat cropland by neural network within the selected grid cell on 15 oct 2011 unveiled the strongly contrasting soil moisture patterns that can be present in intermixed landscapes fig 7c for the selected date the median paw under grassland fields in this domain was 20 mm a value similar to the minimum long term paw presented in fig 4b this low value of paw seems reasonable since active grassland vegetation probably depleted a large portion of the soil moisture during the summer period a completely different situation was predicted in the wheat fields where the median paw was 103 mm a value five times higher than the median paw in grassland the median paw in wheat cropland was also in agreement with the long term median paw shown in fig 4b for winter wheat and more importantly with field observations of no till wheat at lahoma ok where paw was 132 mm on 13 oct and 122 mm on 18 oct 2011 fig 3b the mean paw across both land covers in the domain was 80 mm or in other units the mean root zone soil moisture across both land covers was approximately 0 075 cm3 cm 3 80 mm 20 mm 800 mm higher than the value which would have been estimated using the grassland observations alone this is the bias in estimated soil moisture which would occur if grassland values were used directly for smap validation and that bias is large relative to the smap mission requirement of measuring 0 5 cm soil moisture to within 0 04 cm3 cm 3 entekhabi et al 2010 3 6 limitations and significance a general limitation of using a neural network as an observation operator was the inability to exactly mimic the daily variations of paw predicted by the dual kc model particularly the sharp rise of paw as a consequence of rainfall events perhaps the addition of other variables such as daily precipitation could improve the performance of the neural network however there is no guarantee of increased performance by including apparently more meaningful variables for instance pan et al 2015 showed that using day of the year was as effective as using reference evapotranspiration to approximate the atmospheric demand at in situ stations of the soil and climate analysis network scan demonstrating that simple assumptions can be as effective as more complex approaches when modeling soil moisture dynamics likewise rodríguez fernández et al 2016 used a relatively simple feedforward back propagation neural network to accurately hindcast the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos level 3 soil moisture product using brightness temperatures from the advance scanning microwave radiometer earth observing system sensor amsr e showing that neural networks can be effective tools for predicting soil moisture time series based on a related variable our intention in this study was not to maximize similarity between the neural network and the mechanistic model but to demonstrate the possibility of relating the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and cropland vegetation using a neural network as an observation operator given the complexity of the problem and the few input variables provided to the neural network it performed surprisingly well a second limitation of our proposed method is that predictions of soil moisture under wheat cropland at locations other than the in situ stations rely on interpolated grassland soil moisture values meaning that the spatial interpolation of grassland paw represents an added source of uncertainty prior studies have demonstrated relatively good results for soil moisture interpolation in oklahoma using simple methods such as inverse distance weighted interpolation correlation coefficient of 0 78 and ordinary kriging correlation coefficient of 0 84 lakhankar et al 2010 yuan and quiring 2017 more complex interpolation methods could be developed using covariates such as radar based precipitation estimates and digital soil maps dong and ochsner 2018 or existing hydrologic model outputs yuan and quiring 2017 as the density of in situ soil moisture monitoring stations grows the uncertainty due to interpolation should decrease despite these limitations the proposed method allowed us to effectively translate root zone soil moisture from the oklahoma mesonet stations to adjacent wheat fields and also to estimate the weighted mean paw of a smap grid cell without relying on identification of representative locations that exhibit temporally stable relationships to the grid mean vachaud et al 1985 chen 2006 the method developed here can potentially be useful for upscaling sparse in situ stations to validate remote sensing soil moisture products crow et al 2012 yee et al 2016 reichle et al 2017 advancing streamflow forecasting by improved quantification of pre storm soil moisture conditions crow et al 2018 and better assessing drought conditions in landscapes with intermixed land covers that exhibit asynchronous soil moisture regimes a particular scenario where our approach has great potential is in sites currently having locally dense soil moisture monitoring networks such as the little washita watershed or smap core validation sites where soil moisture information under grassland vegetation could be coupled with a neural network to generate improved estimations of soil moisture across the landscape the use of a neural network based observation operator to relate the soil moisture of two different and adjacent land covers is a departure from the use of mechanistic models that heavily rely on weather data and typically require a larger number of parameters to model cropland soil moisture high spatial resolution simulation of soil moisture using mechanistic models is computationally demanding and offers no guarantee of increased accuracy relative to empirical models the neural network provides a faster computational alternative with limited input requirements which is well suited for operational use to enhance the value of existing in situ soil moisture monitoring networks 4 conclusion the calibrated dual crop coefficient model was able to effectively predict the root zone soil moisture dynamics of wheat cropland for a wide range of conditions simulations using the dual crop coefficient method allowed us to compare wheat cropland and grassland soil moisture at 83 stations of the oklahoma mesonet grassland and winter wheat had similar median annual root zone paw across several climate divisions in oklahoma but the strongly asynchronous dynamics demonstrated that soil moisture observations under grassland vegetation should not be used to represent the soil moisture condition of nearby wheat cropland a simple neural network proved to be an effective observation operator to translate soil moisture measurements under grassland into soil moisture estimates under nearby wheat cropland exploiting embedded information present in the grassland soil moisture data the use of a neural network as an observation operator allowed us to identify and quantify the contrasting soil moisture patterns of intermixed grassland and cropland within a 9 9 km2 smap grid cell this promising new approach for estimating soil moisture under adjacent contrasting land covers at a relatively low computational cost and without depending on the assumption of temporal stability may significantly enhance the

6974,large scale in situ soil moisture monitoring networks are becoming increasingly valuable research tools but existing networks feature almost exclusive deployment of stations in grassland vegetation these grassland soil moisture observations are unlikely to adequately represent the real soil moisture patterns in landscapes with intermixed land cover types here we demonstrate the severity of the problem for one particular landscape and introduce a flexible new method for solving the problem the specific objectives of this study were i to compare root zone soil moisture dynamics of two dominant vegetation types across oklahoma grassland observed and winter wheat cropland simulated ii to relate the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and cropland vegetation using an artificial neural network ann as an observation operator and iii to use the resulting ann to estimate the soil moisture spatial patterns for a landscape of intermixed grassland and wheat cropland root zone soil moisture was represented by plant available water paw in the top 0 8 m of the soil profile paw under grassland was calculated from 18 years of soil moisture observations at 83 stations of the oklahoma mesonet whereas paw under winter wheat was simulated for the same 83 locations using a calibrated and validated soil water balance model then we trained an ann to reproduce the simulated paw under winter wheat using only six inputs day of the year latitude and longitude measured paw under grassland and percent sand and clay the resulting ann was used along with grassland soil moisture observations to estimate the detailed soil moisture pattern for a 9 9 km2 soil moisture active passive smap grid cell the seasonal dynamics of root zone paw for grassland and winter wheat were strongly asynchronous so grassland soil moisture observations rarely reflect cropland soil moisture conditions in the region the simple ann approach facilitated efficient and accurate prediction of the simulated paw under winter wheat rmsd 21 mm and normalized rmsd 0 17 using observed paw under grassland as an input this new method for estimating soil moisture under adjacent contrasting land covers at a relatively low computational cost could be employed for any region and land cover pairing with training data available and it may significantly enhance the applications of existing large scale soil moisture monitoring networks keywords soil moisture in situ networks cropland grassland temporal stability oklahoma mesonet 1 introduction the increasing relevance of soil moisture measurements for climate modeling hirschi et al 2010 koster and suarez 2001 hydrologic prediction houser et al 1998 western et al 2004 and agricultural drought monitoring bolten et al 2010 mozny et al 2012 torres et al 2013 has propelled the deployment of new observing systems including aerial and satellite remote sensing emerging proximal sensing technologies and large scale in situ monitoring networks ochsner et al 2013 while soil moisture observations using remote and proximal sensing are typically limited to the soil surface in situ networks fill a unique niche by accurately monitoring both surface and root zone soil moisture across relatively large spatial extents e g watershed state or nation at high temporal resolution e g hourly dorigo et al 2011 these networks can provide soil moisture measurements for greater depths and higher temporal resolutions that can be achieved using satellites such as advanced scatterometer ascat gelsthorpe et al 2000 soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 the in situ networks can also play a vital role in calibration and validation of satellite derived soil moisture estimates if the point measurements from the network can be effectively upscaled to the satellite footprint however most existing large scale networks share in common the limitation that stations have been deployed almost exclusively under grassland vegetation since soil moisture sensors are often associated with automated weather stations grassland sites are usually chosen over forest sites where fetch is typically inadequate for above ground measurements grassland sites also offer greater long term operational stability than cropland where farming operations make long term deployment of automated soil moisture sensors impractical the bias of in situ networks towards grassland sites and the presence of unmonitored contrasting land covers between the network stations create substantial uncertainty when estimating the soil moisture condition in landscapes with intermixed land covers how well can grassland soil moisture observations represent the actual soil moisture patterns in landscapes with intermixed and contrasting land covers to help answer this question we explore here the relationship between grassland soil moisture measurements and soil moisture values in nearby cropland soil moisture values under grassland and adjacent cropland can differ substantially due to dissimilarities in plant functional types phenology and land management practices and the differences are typically not temporally stable i e differences are time dependent for example 5 cm grassland soil moisture measurements from an nrcs scan network schaefer et al 2007 station in the walnut creek watershed in iowa overestimated soil moisture in nearby corn and soybean fields by 20 on average and the difference was not stable over time cosh et al 2004 in the upper cedar creek watershed in indiana sensors located under grassland at the edge of two soybean fields overestimated field average 5 cm soil moisture by 4 12 on average but again the difference was not temporally stable heathman et al 2012 for the same watershed han et al 2012 found that the cumulative density function cdf matching operator was able to reliably translate soil moisture observations from permanent sensors at the edge of the field into average field soil moisture but the cdf observation operator was not constant in time the absence of a temporally stable relationship between soil moisture values under grassland and cropland is likely due to differences in phenology fig 1 and growth habit between these land cover types and this absence hinders the use of data from in situ networks in a variety of contexts from agricultural drought monitoring to soil moisture satellite validation there is a clear need to better understand how effectively grassland based in situ networks can represent the soil moisture dynamics of landscapes with intermixed and contrasting land covers there is also a need to develop upscaling methods that do not require temporally stable relationships between land covers in order to enhance the value and applications of large scale soil moisture monitoring networks particularly for validation of remote sensing soil moisture products and to improve the estimation of water and heat fluxes in land surface models and large scale hydrological models yeh and eltahir 2005 in this study set in the us southern great plains we examine whether soil moisture observations in warm season grassland can be used to effectively estimate soil moisture conditions of nearby winter wheat cropland the specific objectives of this study were i to compare root zone soil moisture dynamics of two dominant and intermixed vegetation types in the southern great plains grassland measured and winter wheat cropland simulated ii to relate the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and cropland vegetation using a neural network as an observation operator and iii to apply the resulting neural network to estimate the soil moisture spatial patterns and spatial mean for a landscape of intermixed grassland and wheat cropland specifically a 9 9 km2 smap grid cell 2 materials and methods 2 1 setting of the study the study was conducted in oklahoma usa where winter wheat is cultivated on approximately 2 million hectares mostly in the western part of the state fig 2 in this region most producers grow rainfed continuous winter wheat i e wheat monoculture using conventional tillage practices grasslands cover approximately 8 million hectares in oklahoma and are more evenly distributed across the state fig 2 as a result of the co existence and predominance of these two land covers in central and western oklahoma the landscapes in this region often consists of intermixed grassland and winter wheat at spatial scales 1 km grassland soil moisture measurements are available through the oklahoma mesonet an environmental monitoring network that spans the entire state mcpherson et al 2007 since its inception in 1994 the oklahoma mesonet has deployed a total of 140 stations with 120 stations currently active in the immediate vicinity 25 m radius of most stations the landscape is typically dominated by perennial warm season grasses such as bermuda grass cynodon dactylon l big bluestem andropogon gerardii l and little bluestem schizachyrium scoparium l although species vary depending on the geographic location of the station the soil at the stations is kept free from anthropogenic disturbance but the vegetation at the stations is mowed once or twice per year as needed to keep the vegetation height similar to that in the immediate surroundings and to facilitate access to the stations all stations monitor air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction rainfall incoming solar radiation and barometric pressure for 83 out of the 140 stations soil moisture observations are available from sensors installed at 0 05 0 25 and 0 60 m depths fig 2 we assumed each sensor to be located at the center of its representative soil layer scott et al 2013 thus the sensor installed at 0 05 m depth was assumed to be representative of the layer between the soil surface and 0 10 m depth similarly the sensors located at 0 25 and 0 60 m depth were assumed to be representative of the 0 10 to 0 40 m and 0 40 to 0 80 m soil layers respectively we defined root zone soil moisture as the plant available water paw in the top 0 8 m of the soil profile to allow direct comparisons of paw between grassland and winter wheat we assumed the root zone for both was limited to a depth of 0 8 m although we acknowledge that 0 8 m is a relatively shallow rooting depth we were constrained by the depth of soil moisture observations at the oklahoma mesonet stations nonetheless shallow soils and root restricting layers are common in the region and our choice of rooting depth is similar to that used in other related studies in the southern great plains e g heathman et al 2003 plant available water under grassland was calculated from 18 years of soil moisture observations at 83 stations of the oklahoma mesonet whereas paw under winter wheat was simulated for the same 83 locations using a soil water balance model described below the reason for relying on simulations of the soil moisture dynamics of wheat cropland was twofold i a modeling approach was the only way to obtain soil moisture estimates for the same points in space and time for both land covers and ii a modeling approach was the only practical alternative to conduct a soil moisture comparison among two land covers with adequate spatial and temporal extent to ensure the results are broadly applicable 2 2 plant available water observations under grassland daily values of plant available water under grassland were calculated from the output of the heat dissipation sensors cs 229l campbell scientific inc logan ut at the selected oklahoma mesonet sites following the steps detailed in scott et al 2013 briefly this approach consists of converting daily average normalized temperature differentials from the heat dissipation sensors into soil matric potential which was subsequently converted into volumetric water content using site and depth specific soil water retention parameters meso soil database version 1 3 available at http soilphysics okstate edu data for any given station the days with missing temperature differentials were excluded from the analysis daily paw was calculated by subtracting the lower limit soil moisture at 1500 kpa from the observed volumetric water content for each of the sensor depths and then multiplying the resulting values by the thickness of the corresponding soil layer root zone paw was calculated as the sum of the paw in each the three layers 2 3 plant available water model for winter wheat for each of the 83 selected locations we simulated paw in continuous winter wheat using the food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 dual crop coefficient dual kc method allen et al 1998 with daily time steps the dual kc is a parsimonious and well established two layer soil water balance model that has been calibrated and validated for wheat in several environments hunsaker et al 2007 lópez urrea et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 the dual kc model estimates crop evapotranspiration etc based on the evapotranspiration of a hypothetical well watered grass reference surface eto and empirically determined basal crop coefficients kcb that change with the different growth stages of the crop for winter wheat we used crop coefficients for specific wheat growth stages derived from prior lysimeter studies in the southern great plains ko et al 2009 piccinni et al 2007 because these authors reported single crop coefficients rather than basal crop coefficients values were adjusted following recommended methods allen et al 1998 table 1 we used the modified wang engel wes quantitative wheat phenological model streck et al 2003 wang and engel 1998 to simulate wheat growth stages the wes is a multiplicative phenological model that incorporates the effects of temperature and photoperiod to predict wheat stages the wes model consists of three main developmental stages emergence terminal spikelet initiation em ts terminal spikelet anthesis ts an and anthesis physiological maturity an pm both vegetative em ts and ts an and reproductive an pm stages have maximum developmental rates that are modulated by non linear functions that describe the effect of temperature and photoperiod on wheat development we adopted the set of parameters table 2 for winter wheat used by streck et al 2003 who modeled wheat phenological stages in the central great plains using cultivars that are also common in the southern great plains i e karl 92 to simulate daily paw using the dual kc model daily precipitation data were obtained from the oklahoma mesonet station at each simulation site missing precipitation values were retrieved from the nearest neighboring station with available rainfall data daily surface runoff was approximated using the natural resources conservation service curve number method hawkins et al 2009 the curve number for each location was estimated based on land cover i e winter wheat or fallow an estimated residue cover of 50 and the soil hydrologic group which was retrieved from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo soil survey staff 2015 upper and lower soil water retention limits and percent clay and sand were obtained from prior measurements at each oklahoma mesonet site scott et al 2013 simulations of the winter wheat growing season started on 15 october across the entire state although average winter wheat planting dates for the southern and northern part of oklahoma usually differ by about 10 days the selected date represents a reasonable midpoint growing season simulations were terminated on 1 june which is a reasonable date for physiological maturity in this region root growth was simulated using thermal time based on the empirical function proposed by steduto et al 2009 2 4 calibration and validation of the dual kc model the dual kc model was calibrated using a set of soil moisture measurements collected under continuous no till winter wheat from july 2009 to june 2011 at lahoma ok soil moisture was recorded every 15 days using a neutron probe soil moisture meter at 0 2 m intervals for each soil layer paw was calculated by subtracting the lower limit from the daily volumetric water content and then multiplying the resulting value by the thickness of each layer root zone paw was then determined by adding up the paw of the top four layers further details about this dataset were provided by patrignani et al 2012 calibration of the dual kc consisted of optimizing one model parameter that regulates the proportion of the plant available water capacity that can be depleted before plant stress occurs other parameters commonly included in the calibration process of the dual kc model are the effective evaporative layer and the total and readily evaporable water allen et al 2005 zhao et al 2013 in our study these parameters were not calibrated but were estimated using the fraction of sand and clay as described by allen et al 2005 the calibrated dual kc model was validated using three independent validation sets the first validation set consisted of a time series of paw in continuous no till winter wheat from 2011 to 2013 recorded at lahoma ok this validation set helped us to corroborate that the model was adequately predicting paw at the calibration site a second validation set was created using soil moisture observations from 2009 to 2011 at lake carl blackwell ok this site was located on a side slope 5 a landscape position on which winter wheat is sometimes cultivated in the southern great plains because of its topography this site served as a challenging scenario to evaluate the dual kc model at this location soil moisture was also measured using a neutron probe soil moisture meter at 0 2 m intervals under continuous conventional and no till wheat patrignani et al 2012 the third validation set consisted of 23 measurements of paw in the top 0 8 m from 8 site years across the state of oklahoma from march to may of 2014 and 2015 four measurements per field were collected at each sampling date from large scale 0 5 ha experimental fields and wheat producer fields during 2014 volumetric water content was measured using an impedance probe ml2x theta probe delta t devices with an attached extension to reach 0 8 m depth a manual auger eijkelkamp 65 mm o d was used to facilitate the access of the probe to 0 8 m depth in each core volumetric water content was recorded at six depths approximately every 0 15 m all volumetric water content values for each core were averaged to estimate the soil water content of the soil profile in 2015 soil moisture was also measured in four cores per field of 0 8 m depth using the thermo gravimetric method at each sampling date homogenized soil samples for each of the 0 8 m cores were used to estimate soil water content particle size analysis gavlak et al 2003 and soil water retention at 1500 kpa i e lower limit the upper limit for each soil was estimated by adding the available water holding capacity to the lower limit the water holding capacity for each soil was retrieved from a previous study in the region where this variable was measured in field conditions lollato and edwards 2015 in this third validation set the initial soil moisture condition of the sampled sites at the start of the winter wheat growing season was unknown therefore plant available water at wheat sowing was estimated using the method described by lollato et al 2016 which briefly consisted in starting model simulations in 1 june of the preceding summer fallow period root mean squared error rmse mean bias error mbe and wilmott s index of agreement willmott 1981 were used to describe the overall goodness of fit of the dual kc against field observations of paw 2 5 temporal and spatial soil moisture analyses for the purpose of comparing the temporal dynamics of root zone soil moisture in grassland and winter wheat we computed the long term 18 yr mean paw for four selected climate divisions of oklahoma with contrasting precipitation regimes these means were calculated by taking the arithmetic mean for each day of the year using paw values from 1 june 1997 to 1 june 2015 spatial soil moisture patterns were compared by generating state level maps of root zone paw for selected days maps were generated by interpolating paw at the selected locations to a grid of 15 cells per unit of latitude and longitude covering the state of oklahoma using the natural neighbor interpolation method sibson 1981 ledoux and gold 2005 the natural interpolation method relies on simple and objective geometrical assumptions voronoi diagrams or thiessen polygons and has shown good performance interpolating irregularly distributed geoscientific data ledoux and gold 2005 other spatial interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging were not used in this study since the number of points i e 83 stations is below the generally suggested value of 100 points goovaerts 1999 webster and oliver 1993 although these maps ignore the spatial distribution of the land cover they are useful to describe the broad spatial patterns imposed by the weather and vegetation grassland vs winter wheat across the state we used the median to characterize the central tendency of root zone paw at state level and the highest density interval hdi as a measure of dispersion the hdi represents the shortest interval that spans 95 of the values in a distribution kruschke 2015 2 6 relating grassland and cropland soil moisture using an observation operator to relate the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and winter wheat we developed an artificial neural network to serve as an observation operator drusch et al 2005 this approach can be summarized as ϕ wheat h ϕ grass β n ε where ϕwheat represents the soil moisture time series under wheat cropland ϕgrass represents the soil moisture time series under grassland ℋ represents the observation operator β n is the set of other covariates used to estimate cropland soil moisture and ε is the error term although models based on first principles are often preferred to explain environmental processes supervised machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks are ideal in scenarios with complex non linear interactions unknown relationships and abundant high quality data that can be used for proper training validation and testing abu mostafa et al 2012 a key benefit of developing an observation operator capable of estimating cropland soil moisture from grassland soil moisture observations is that it would dramatically reduce computational burdens associated with operational large scale high resolution soil moisture mapping we used a multi layer feedforward neural network trained by a backpropagation algorithm with stochastic gradient descent the simple feedforward neural network consisted of one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer the input layer had six neurons that corresponded to day of the year latitude and longitude observed root zone paw under grassland and the weighted percent of sand and clay in the top 0 8 m in addition to percent sand and clay content latitude and longitude were used to represent spatial environmental gradients in the studied region similarly day of the year was used as a temporal indicator of average atmospheric demand the hidden layer had 7 neurons fletcher and goss 1993 and the output layer had one neuron representing the root zone paw in continuous wheat the activation function between the input and the hidden layer was the following hyperbolic tangent function lecun et al 2012 x 1 7159 t a n h 2 x 3 this function has carefully selected parameter values so that saturation of the activation function is minimized while still taking advantage of its non linearity since this is a regression rather than a classification problem we used a linear activation function between the hidden and output layer to improve training performance we added a learning rate with value of 0 01 and a momentum of 0 25 to help with escaping local minima lecun et al 2012 using the same network structure an alternative neural network excluding grassland paw was trained validated and tested to evaluate the contribution of root zone grassland paw to predict root zone paw under wheat cropland for training validation and testing of the neural network a full dataset was created totaling over 400 000 entries for each of the six input and output variables 400 000 rows by 6 columns matrix for the period of 1 june 1997 to 1 june 2015 for the 83 selected oklahoma mesonet stations as output targets we used the paw for winter wheat simulated with the dual kc model rows with missing values in at least one of the six input or the output variable were eliminated from the dataset inputs and outputs were standardized by centering the data with a mean of zero and a variance of one the mean and variance were stored and were used to restore the standardized input and output values then we subdivided the full dataset to generate a training validation and testing set we assigned 70 of the values in the full dataset to the training set assigning large fractions of the full dataset to the training set is a common practice to ensure that most plausible scenarios are presented to the network during the training stage for better training performance values in the training set were shuffled using a pseudo random generator in matlab mathworks nantick ma lecun et al 2012 the randomization of the entries was performed for individual rows to keep inputs and outputs associated to each other the next step consisted in generating a validation set which was composed of only 10 of the values in the full dataset the validation set is intended to evaluate the neural network during the training process to identify the set of training weights that minimized the error in the validation set and thus minimize the risk of over fitting we selected the training weights that minimized the root mean squared error rmse of the validation set since the selected training weights were dependent on the validation set a third independent set of information was required to assess the prediction power of the trained neural network this was accomplished by creating a test set using the remaining 20 of the full dataset the test set included a total of 81 000 entries encompassing 18 stations with different annual precipitation regimes and contrasting soil properties because only the entries of the training set were shuffled none of the stations in the test set participated during the training process resulting in a robust test for the neural network other more complex approaches such as recurrent neural networks may hold potential for predicting soil moisture time series but we opted for a relatively simple feedforward neural network to avoid dependence on prior time steps which constitutes an advantage when dealing with time series that often contain missing data in light of the large number of values that were used for training validation and testing we used a bivariate histogram to pictorially represent the performance of the network the root mean squared difference rmsd the mean biased error mbe and the pearson s correlation coefficient r were used to evaluate the predictions of the neural network relative to paw simulated using the dual kc model for the evaluation of the neural network we used the term rmsd to emphasize that the differences were calculated relative to simulated and thus uncertain paw in winter wheat instead of ground truth field observations normalized rmsd nrmsd was calculated by dividing the rmsd value by the range of paw pawmax pawmin shcherbakov et al 2013 2 7 application of the neural network to estimate root zone paw patterns across a heterogeneous smap grid cell to demonstrate the significance of the observation operator we used it along with grassland soil moisture observations to estimate the detailed soil moisture pattern for a 9 9 km2 smap easev2 grid cell the soil moisture active passive smap mission was launched in january 2015 by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the goal of the mission is to provide information of surface soil moisture top 0 05 m and freeze thaw state at global scale with a latency of two to three days for this example we selected a grid encompassing an area dominated by winter wheat and grassland and also including the lahoma station of the oklahoma mesonet and the field site at which some of the calibration and validation data were recorded to estimate the paw under grassland and winter wheat cropland across the grid we followed these steps i identify locations of winter wheat cropland and grassland within the grid using the 2011 usda cropland data layer 30 30 m resolution ii retrieve observations of temperature differentials for the oklahoma mesonet stations recording soil moisture at all three sensor depths for the selected date iii convert temperature differentials into root zone paw under grassland iv use an interpolation method in this case natural neighbor to estimate grassland root zone paw for all locations i e assume that all pixels are under grassland vegetation within the smap grid cell v collect and normalize inputs for the neural network including day of the year for the selected date latitude and longitude of the wheat fields the interpolated grassland paw for the wheat cropland and the weighted percent sand and clay for each wheat cropland location within the grid and vi estimate the paw for the wheat cropland using the neural network as an observation operator that relates grassland and wheat cropland 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation considering all calibration and validation sets modeling root zone paw of winter wheat cropland using the dual kc model decreased estimation errors approximately 65 compared to the default approach of assuming that soil moisture observations under grassland represent soil moisture conditions under winter wheat the calibration of the dual kc model using the data set for lahoma 2009 2011 resulted in a rmse of 19 mm relative to the measured paw under winter wheat whereas direct use of the observed grassland paw at the nearest mesonet station resulted in a rmsd of 50 mm fig 3 a validation of the dual kc model using the sets of winter wheat paw measured at lahoma 2011 2013 and lake carl blackwell 2009 2011 fig 3b and c had rmse ranging from 18 to 20 mm mbe from 2 to 1 mm and d from 0 87 to 0 88 as in the calibration set prediction of winter wheat paw using observed grassland paw at the nearest mesonet station had rmsd values ranging from 72 to 62 mm in the validation set containing multiple sites from across the state fig 3d predictions of paw resulted in a rmse of 25 mm a good result considering that the soil moisture condition at the beginning of the growing season was unknown and had to be estimated by initializing the model in the preceding summer fallow although the model predictions were satisfactory lower rmse values for the dual kc model have been reported for winter wheat in the literature a study by zhao et al 2013 reported rmse of approximately 7 mm in the top meter of the soil profile a value three times lower than our study nonetheless in that study the calibration and validation sets contained soil moisture collected only during two growing seasons at a single location in contrast the strength of our study relies on a calibration and validation set totaling 148 field observations over a period of six years across multiple locations with diverse soil properties landscape positions and climate conditions also our study requires year round simulation of the winter wheat cropping system which is a greater challenge than simulating individual growing seasons under these circumstances predictions of root zone paw might be improved using more advance models such as the root zone and water quality model rzwqm or the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat but a drawback associated with more sophisticated models is the large number of parameters requiring calibration 3 2 asynchronous soil moisture dynamics long term mean root zone paw for grassland measured and winter wheat simulated displayed distinct sinusoidal seasonal cycles that were strongly asynchronous fig 4 winter wheat consistently had minimum paw values at the end of the growing season in early june doy 110 150 and maximum paw values at the end of the summer fallow doy 280 290 during the fallow period summer rainfall partial residue cover left from the prior wheat harvest and the absence of an actively growing vegetation contribute to a slow but positive soil moisture recharge on the other hand grassland showed minimum paw values from late july to mid august doy 210 280 and maximum paw values from early to late march doy 50 100 clearly the soil moisture dynamics under grassland were not representative of conditions under winter wheat the seasonal soil moisture cycles of each land cover were closely linked with vegetation dynamics while winter wheat is an annual cool season fall winter spring crop grasslands surrounding the stations of the oklahoma mesonet are predominantly composed of perennial warm season spring summer fall grasses in mid to late february winter wheat reaches the end of its dormant growth stage with green canopy cover typically 75 fig 1 although dormant the high percentage of green canopy cover can become fully active with a few days of warm temperatures explaining the typical rapid drying phase of winter wheat early in the spring compared to grassland fig 4 at the same time warm season grasslands typically have almost no green canopy cover which explains the lower soil moisture depletion rate in the early spring compared to continuous wheat despite the contrasting temporal dynamics of soil moisture between these land covers the mean annual paw of winter wheat and grassland vegetation were similar within different climate divisions within each climate division differences in median annual paw between grassland and winter wheat ranged from 8 mm in the north central division to 13 mm in the north east division across climate divisions median annual paw for continuous wheat ranged from 56 to 111 mm while the median annual paw of grassland ranged from 44 to 124 mm the lowest median annual paw for both land covers was in the oklahoma panhandle 460 mm 30 yr annual rainfall and the greatest median annual paw was observed in the northeast division of oklahoma 1200 mm 30 yr annual rainfall while the seasonal variations of paw within each climatic division were dominated by the land cover the median annual paw values were dominated by the climate and precipitation regime the seasonal soil moisture patterns of winter wheat observed in this study were in agreement with a prior study conducted by zhang 2004 who studied the soil moisture dynamics of continuous winter wheat in a watershed near el reno ok similarly the soil moisture dynamics in grassland vegetation closely matched those found by illston et al 2004 who conducted an analysis of the soil moisture patterns for the oklahoma mesonet the unique contribution of our study lies in the direct comparison of the soil moisture dynamics of these two dominant land covers that are usually intermixed in the landscape of the southern great plains at scales 1 km our results show that soil moisture observations from in situ networks deployed on warm season grassland vegetation should not be used directly to assess the soil moisture conditions of winter wheat in the southern great plains or climatically similar regions around the world the asynchronous soil moisture patterns observed for grassland and winter wheat in oklahoma would cause a lack of temporal stability in the relationship between edge of the field sensors and the actual soil moisture values under cropland a phenomenon which has been reported in prior studies e g han et al 2012 heathman et al 2012 3 3 spatial pattern of vegetation impacts on soil moisture state level interpolation of the long term average root zone paw of grassland measured and wheat cropland simulated for 1 april and 10 october revealed three distinct patterns as a consequence of the interaction between climate and land cover fig 5 in the oklahoma panhandle and southwestern portion of the state the low annual rainfall and the high atmospheric demand create soil moisture conditions that are typically in the dry range regardless of the land cover similarly in the northeastern part of the state the average annual rainfall regime 1000 mm consistently generates the relatively wet soil moisture conditions regardless of the land cover in contrast the central portion of the state shows a strong influence of the land cover on root zone soil moisture this is of particular relevance because a great portion of the wheat cropland in oklahoma is concentrated in the central western part of the state fig 2 where using observed soil moisture under grassland vegetation as a surrogate of the soil moisture condition under wheat cropland can induce substantial errors in root zone paw numerous studies aimed at better understanding the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture under varied topography and vegetation have focused on a highly instrumented watershed in southwest oklahoma called the little washita jackson et al 1999 mohanty and skaggs 2001 starks et al 2006 a study in the little washita conducted by mohanty and skaggs 2001 using soil moisture observations collected during southern great plains 1997 sgp97 hydrology experiment showed that areas with intermixed grassland and cropland had the least temporal stability in soil moisture the results in figs 4 and 5 help explain that previous finding the sgp97 experiment was conducted from mid june through mid july a time when soil moisture conditions under grassland and winter wheat cropland are typically trending in opposite directions fig 4 3 4 neural network based observation operator after training the neural network that included grassland paw as an input variable effectively mimicked the soil moisture dynamics under winter wheat as simulated by the dual kc model fig 6 a the only required inputs for operational use of this neural network are the day of the year latitude and longitude observed root zone paw under grassland and the depth weighted percent of sand and clay in the top 80 cm of the soil profile this neural network exploits information in grassland soil moisture observations to predict the soil moisture condition under winter wheat cropland the training of the neural network using over 280 000 simulated winter wheat paw values from the dual kc model resulted in mbe of 0 mm and correlation coefficient of 0 91 table 3 in the validation set this neural network resulted in mbe of 6 6 mm and correlation coefficient of 0 76 despite the lower correlation coefficient the validation set was effective to select the set of training weights that minimized overfitting of the neural network the performance of the neural network in the test set which was withheld in the training procedure showed a mbe of 0 1 mm correlation coefficient equal to 0 79 and rmsd equal to 21 1 mm values that are similar to those obtained with the dual kc model when compared to field observations conversely predictions of root zone paw under wheat using the neural network that excluded grassland paw from the input set showed poor predicting power in the validation and test sets resulting in rmsd of 34 mm and correlation coefficients ranging from 0 44 to 0 5 table 3 values that are substantially lower than those observed with the neural network including grassland paw the soil moisture time series for a particular location the waurika mesonet station shows the relatively close match between simulated paw dynamics using the dual kc model and the neural network observation operator that included grassland paw rmsd 20 9 assuming that the grassland soil moisture observations were representative of neighboring winter wheat cropland would have resulted in a rmsd of 46 8 mm relative to the dual kc model at waurika this suggests that the neural network that has grassland paw as input variable improves the prediction accuracy by 55 relative to the default assumption comparing the predictions of both neural networks with and without grassland paw for the waurika station fig 6a and b showed that excluding grassland paw from the input set fig 6b severely limited the predicting power of the neural network which was unable to predict the sharp drying and wetting events predicted by the dual kc 3 5 application of the neural network to a smap pixel one practical application of this approach can be demonstrated using a single 9 9 km2 grid cell fid 153137 row 329 column 877 of the recently launched smap mission this grid cell which includes the lahoma oklahoma mesonet station has a total of 8266 ha including intermixed grassland 23 of the area and winter wheat 59 of the area as the dominant land covers fig 7 a and b the estimation of paw at 30 m resolution for grassland by natural neighbor interpolation and wheat cropland by neural network within the selected grid cell on 15 oct 2011 unveiled the strongly contrasting soil moisture patterns that can be present in intermixed landscapes fig 7c for the selected date the median paw under grassland fields in this domain was 20 mm a value similar to the minimum long term paw presented in fig 4b this low value of paw seems reasonable since active grassland vegetation probably depleted a large portion of the soil moisture during the summer period a completely different situation was predicted in the wheat fields where the median paw was 103 mm a value five times higher than the median paw in grassland the median paw in wheat cropland was also in agreement with the long term median paw shown in fig 4b for winter wheat and more importantly with field observations of no till wheat at lahoma ok where paw was 132 mm on 13 oct and 122 mm on 18 oct 2011 fig 3b the mean paw across both land covers in the domain was 80 mm or in other units the mean root zone soil moisture across both land covers was approximately 0 075 cm3 cm 3 80 mm 20 mm 800 mm higher than the value which would have been estimated using the grassland observations alone this is the bias in estimated soil moisture which would occur if grassland values were used directly for smap validation and that bias is large relative to the smap mission requirement of measuring 0 5 cm soil moisture to within 0 04 cm3 cm 3 entekhabi et al 2010 3 6 limitations and significance a general limitation of using a neural network as an observation operator was the inability to exactly mimic the daily variations of paw predicted by the dual kc model particularly the sharp rise of paw as a consequence of rainfall events perhaps the addition of other variables such as daily precipitation could improve the performance of the neural network however there is no guarantee of increased performance by including apparently more meaningful variables for instance pan et al 2015 showed that using day of the year was as effective as using reference evapotranspiration to approximate the atmospheric demand at in situ stations of the soil and climate analysis network scan demonstrating that simple assumptions can be as effective as more complex approaches when modeling soil moisture dynamics likewise rodríguez fernández et al 2016 used a relatively simple feedforward back propagation neural network to accurately hindcast the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos level 3 soil moisture product using brightness temperatures from the advance scanning microwave radiometer earth observing system sensor amsr e showing that neural networks can be effective tools for predicting soil moisture time series based on a related variable our intention in this study was not to maximize similarity between the neural network and the mechanistic model but to demonstrate the possibility of relating the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and cropland vegetation using a neural network as an observation operator given the complexity of the problem and the few input variables provided to the neural network it performed surprisingly well a second limitation of our proposed method is that predictions of soil moisture under wheat cropland at locations other than the in situ stations rely on interpolated grassland soil moisture values meaning that the spatial interpolation of grassland paw represents an added source of uncertainty prior studies have demonstrated relatively good results for soil moisture interpolation in oklahoma using simple methods such as inverse distance weighted interpolation correlation coefficient of 0 78 and ordinary kriging correlation coefficient of 0 84 lakhankar et al 2010 yuan and quiring 2017 more complex interpolation methods could be developed using covariates such as radar based precipitation estimates and digital soil maps dong and ochsner 2018 or existing hydrologic model outputs yuan and quiring 2017 as the density of in situ soil moisture monitoring stations grows the uncertainty due to interpolation should decrease despite these limitations the proposed method allowed us to effectively translate root zone soil moisture from the oklahoma mesonet stations to adjacent wheat fields and also to estimate the weighted mean paw of a smap grid cell without relying on identification of representative locations that exhibit temporally stable relationships to the grid mean vachaud et al 1985 chen 2006 the method developed here can potentially be useful for upscaling sparse in situ stations to validate remote sensing soil moisture products crow et al 2012 yee et al 2016 reichle et al 2017 advancing streamflow forecasting by improved quantification of pre storm soil moisture conditions crow et al 2018 and better assessing drought conditions in landscapes with intermixed land covers that exhibit asynchronous soil moisture regimes a particular scenario where our approach has great potential is in sites currently having locally dense soil moisture monitoring networks such as the little washita watershed or smap core validation sites where soil moisture information under grassland vegetation could be coupled with a neural network to generate improved estimations of soil moisture across the landscape the use of a neural network based observation operator to relate the soil moisture of two different and adjacent land covers is a departure from the use of mechanistic models that heavily rely on weather data and typically require a larger number of parameters to model cropland soil moisture high spatial resolution simulation of soil moisture using mechanistic models is computationally demanding and offers no guarantee of increased accuracy relative to empirical models the neural network provides a faster computational alternative with limited input requirements which is well suited for operational use to enhance the value of existing in situ soil moisture monitoring networks 4 conclusion the calibrated dual crop coefficient model was able to effectively predict the root zone soil moisture dynamics of wheat cropland for a wide range of conditions simulations using the dual crop coefficient method allowed us to compare wheat cropland and grassland soil moisture at 83 stations of the oklahoma mesonet grassland and winter wheat had similar median annual root zone paw across several climate divisions in oklahoma but the strongly asynchronous dynamics demonstrated that soil moisture observations under grassland vegetation should not be used to represent the soil moisture condition of nearby wheat cropland a simple neural network proved to be an effective observation operator to translate soil moisture measurements under grassland into soil moisture estimates under nearby wheat cropland exploiting embedded information present in the grassland soil moisture data the use of a neural network as an observation operator allowed us to identify and quantify the contrasting soil moisture patterns of intermixed grassland and cropland within a 9 9 km2 smap grid cell this promising new approach for estimating soil moisture under adjacent contrasting land covers at a relatively low computational cost and without depending on the assumption of temporal stability may significantly enhance the
