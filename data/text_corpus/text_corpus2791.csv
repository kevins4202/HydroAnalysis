13955,photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes using novel metal based composite materials is one of the most intriguing and sustainable ways to reduce water pollution herein facile synthesis of agnps zif 8 via in situ generation of agnps and zif 8 zeolitic imidazolate framework was demonstrated and composites with different ag contents abbreviated as sz sz1 sz2 sz3 were well characterized by powder x ray diffraction pxrd pattern x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and fourier transform infra red ft ir spectroscopy encapsulation decoration of agnps particle size 96 nm in sz and 17 32 2 35 nm in sz1 to sz3 in zif 8 matrix has been ensured by tem and edx analysis brunauer emmett teller bet adsorption desorption studies indicate that the surface area of sz 982 m2 g 1 is less than those of sz1 to sz3 due to the encapsulation of large amount of ag nanoparticles in sz the synthesized composites are thermally stable up to 400 c in air and nitrogen atmosphere agnps zif 8 exhibited excellent photocatalytic efficiency to degrade organic dyes compared to zif 8 due to its large surface area highly porous and unique synergistic properties sz2 degrades off 97 25 methylene blue mb and 100 congo red cr at ph 7 further degraded fragments were analysed by gc ms and plausible degradation mechanism was discussed keywords composite materials heterogeneous catalysis photocatalyst silver nanoparticles organic pollutants 1 introduction due to the rapid global industrialization water pollution is progressively increased by offloading the industrial dye effluents because the organic dyes mainly based on heterocyclic aromatic aromatic azo compounds are highly toxic carcinogenic and difficult to be degraded due to their low biodegradability nowadays purification and detoxification of wastewater has become the prime concern and a challenging task for researchers therefore to design and develop new efficient methods materials to degrade the dyes in aqueous solution is becoming progressively imminent during the last few decades many efforts have been dedicated for heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants using semiconductors nanoparticles because photocatalytic degradation is one of the most easy and cost effective technique for wastewater treatment 1 4 one of the most important key points herein lies to develop an efficient photocatalyst which affords the fast migration of photo induced generated electrons and holes to the interfaces to react with pollutants further novel metal viz ag nanoparticles doped metal oxides ag tio2 ag sno2 ag zno ag fe3o4 and α fe2o3 ag sno2 have also been employed as photocatalyst for wastewater treatment 5 9 table 1 due to surface plasmon resonance srp agnps allow the absorption of extension of radiation of wide band gap semiconducting materials 10 thereby enhancing their photocatalytic activity however the agglomeration of agnps due to increase in surface energy becomes a serious problem which effectively reduces their catalytic performance 11 13 in order to find out a suitable solution of this problem various inorganic and organic matrixes have been used as support for agnps viz polymers such as biopolymer hydrogel surface modified poly n vinyl imidazole sba 15 cellular foams functionalized poly glycidyl methacrylate microspheres and procyanidin grafted eggshell membrane 14 19 recently many fibrous matrices such as carbon nanofiber polyaniline nanofiber and amino modified cellulose paper have also been employed as a suitable support for the immobilization of agnps for their catalytic applications 20 22 in addition agnps have been decorated on porous materials viz metal organic frameworks mofs table 1 bimetallic nanoparticles au ag and ag pd have been successfully deposited on zif 8 for the reduction of 4 nitrophenol 23 and dehydrogenation of formic acid 24 respectively further ag nanowire fabricated zif 8 has been used for butanol separation 25 and antibacterial application 26 ag agcl zif 8 composites have been synthesized and exploited as photocatalyst for the degradation of rhodamine b 27 28 and acetaminophen 29 further ag agcl nanofilm was grown on the zif 8 surface 30 which has been employed as visible light driven photocatalyst for the degradation of methylene blue table 1 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zifs are chemically and thermally stable and used for various applications such as hydrogen evolution co2 reduction capturing organic transformation and pollutant s degradation 31 33 in zif 8 band gap 5 14 ev e moves easily from valence band vb to conduction band cb as a result of homo to lumo charge transfer 34 further metallic ag acts as e scavenger facilitating the transfer of photogenerated e in the conduction band of zif 8 due to surface plasmon resonance spr 5 7 10 hence photo induced e and h due to synergistic effect of ag and zif 8 can easily react with oxygenated water producing reactive oxidative species ros such as h oh for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants in such composite materials the uniform distribution and the interfaces between the two components are very important and critical also to obtain a high performance catalyst in order to obtain agnps doped or decorated zif 8 with excellent photocatalytic properties in situ generation of agnps during the synthesis of zif 8 or vice versa has been designed which may provide well distributed components and enhanced interfacial interactions in the resulting composite from overview of literature agnps encapsulated decorated zif 8 has not been explored for photocatalytic dye degradation so far thus it is envisioned for the synthesis of agnps zif 8 composite and its application for photocatalytic degradation and removal of methylene blue mb and congo red cr this manuscript describes the controlled synthesis of agnps zif 8 via in situ generation of agnps as well as zif 8 for environmental remediation zif 8 being a shell material effectively retards the immobilisation and agglomeration of agnps and so enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency of agnps zif 8 composite 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and methods anhydrous zinc

reported method 37 according to that stock solutions of 50 mm nabh4 30 mm of trisodium citrate and 50 mm agno3 have been prepared and labelled as a b and c respectively 2 ml of solution c was diluted with 50 ml de ionized water di h2o in a three necked round bottom flask and kept on stirring on ice bath at 4 c for 30 min under n2 after that 1 ml of each solution a and b was added dropwise with constant stirring finally a pale yellow colour solution was obtained after 30 min which indicates the formation of agnps the resultant solution was aged for few days and after that grey silver powder was collected by centrifugation and stored it in a closed vessel covered with aluminium foil 2 4 synthesis of agnps zif 8 agnps zif 8 composite was synthesized by using two methods 2 4 1 method 1 in this method agnps zif 8 sz composite was synthesized by the addition of pre synthesized zif 8 in situ synthesis of agnps scheme 1 during the synthesis of agnps as described in sub section 2 3 pre synthesized zif 8 100 mg was added in silver nitrate solution 2 ml of solution c was diluted with 50 ml di h2o and purged n2 gas for 30 min after that silver nitrate solution was reduced using trisodium citrate and sodium borohydride solution as mentioned above the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dried it at 60 c for 6 h the composite was stored in a closed vessel covered with aluminium foil 2 4 2 method 2 agnps zif 8 composite was synthesized by encapsulation of pre synthesized agnps in situ synthesis of zif 8 during the addition of metal solution 0 34 g zncl2 in 20 ml methanol into ligand solution 1 64 g 2 methylimidazole in 25 ml methanol agnps suspension 1 mg of agnps powder dispersed in 2 ml methanol was added in various amounts i e 150 μl 300 μl and 500 μl for the synthesis of agnps zif 8 composites which are abbreviated as sz1 sz2 and sz3 respectively scheme 2 2 5 adsorption and photodegradation studies for adsorption and photodegradation studies of mb and cr six sets of mb 0 5 10 5 m and cr 2 10 5 m dye solution in 50 ml ungraduated test tubes were prepared as per the details given below 20 ml of 0 5 10 5 m mb 2 10 5 m cr solution was taken as control 10 mg of sz sz1 sz2 sz3 and zif 8 was suspended in 20 ml solution of mb cr dye solution in separate test tubes all samples were sonicated for 30 min and kept under dark for 2 h meanwhile a small aliquot of solution was analyzed spectrophotometrically and the absorbance spectra were recorded at certain time interval subsequently fresh solutions of all samples were sonicated for another 30 min under dark for maintaining the adsorption desorption equilibrium later on they were exposed for 2 h for mb dye and 40 min for cr dye under uv vis irradiations emitted from a halogen lamp 500 w the absorbance spectra were recorded at certain time interval the remaining concentration of dyes were calculated at λmax 663 nm for mb and at 497 nm for cr photodegradation and adsorption capacity

zif 8 synthesis and detailed characterization of zif 8 has been reported in our earlier publications 35 36 the crystalline texture of synthesized agnps and composites sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 has been investigated by pxrd and sem the major pxrd peaks of agnps and their corresponding planes fig s1 have been indexed jcpds no 00 004 0783 further pxrd pattern of composites sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 resembles with that of zif 8 35 36 after the encapsulation of agnps fig 1 indicating that encapsulation of ag nps did not affect the crystallinity of zif 8 fe sem images in fig 2 clearly demonstrate that hexagonal morphology of zif 8 remains unaltered in sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 after encapsulation of agnps edx analysis ensured the micro environment of agnps within zif 8 frameworks fig s2 and table st1 encapsulation of spherical dots of agnps fig 3 a was also ensured and depicted in hr tem images of composites as shown in fig 3 b and c for sz2 and sz respectively and fig s3 a and b for sz1 and sz3 respectively particle size of agnps in all composites was calculated through distribution plots fig s4 a d and a depicts very large or agglomerated ag nanoparticles 96 81 30 93 nm in sz because zif 8 crystals were grown on the in situ generated ag nanoaprticles on the other hand much smaller particles were encapsulated when suspension of small amount of pre synthesized agnps in methanol 150 μl 300 μl and 500 μl suspension of agnps 1 mg in methanol 2 ml for sz1 sz2 and sz3 respectively was added during in situ synthesis of zif 8 in sz1 15 41 3 57 nm sz2 17 21 7 38 nm and sz3 19 73 4 79 nm and further the size of encapsulated agnps increases with increasing their dosing amount crystalline nature of agnps sz2 and sz composite was confirmed by sead pattern which is shown in fig 3 d f respectively the characteristic peaks of the imidazole ring at 421 996 1425 and 1584 cm 1 assigned to ν zn n δ c n ν c n and ν c n respectively in zif 8 36 38 39 are also observed in ft ir spectra of synthesized composites fig s5 a considerable shift in δ c n 955 cm 1 and ν cn 1412 cm 1 vibrations in all composites may be due to some interaction of ag and n of the imidazole ring table 2 chemical composition of all composites was analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and the characteristic peaks of all constituent elements in sz can be clearly identified in fig 4 the extended spectra of zn 2p fig 4 b exhibits two sharp and major peaks having binding energy 1044 20 and 1021 17 ev ascribed to 2p1 2 and 2p3 2 in fig 4 c two major peaks at 373 86 and 367 80 ev can be assigned to ag 3d3 2 and ag 3d5 2 fig 4 d exhibits the deconvolution of c 1s peaks at 284 81 and 283 99 ev assigned to sp2c n and sp2c c interaction 40 while n 1s peak fig 4 e appears at 398 31 ev due to nh nc bonds of the imidazole ring similar xps peaks were observed in sz1 sz2 and sz3 as shown in figs s6 s7 and s8 respectively and the corresponding binding energy are also given in table st2 for photocatalyst the optical band gap and absorbance of light is very important the band gap in all composites using tauc method 41 for direct indirect transitions fig 5 has been found 5 27 5 13 ev due to zif 8 while sz composite having a large excess of agnps exhibits a wide band at 2 16 1 62 ev due to some interactions between ag and imidazole ring table 3 porosity and sorption properties of composites explored by brunauer emmett teller bet adsorption desorption isotherms using n2 gas at 77 k indicate that the surface area of composites decreases on increasing the dosing amount from 1330 33 to 902 28 m2 g 1 except sz2 which exhibits enhanced surface area as compared to sz1 fig s9 table 4 all the four composites sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 are thermally stable up to 400 c under air and nitrogen atmosphere and then started to decompose as shown in fig s10 3 2 photocatalytic and adsorption studies the photocatalytic performance of each composite sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 was studied and compared with zif 8 for degradation of methylene blue mb and congo red cr as organic pollutants details of experimental conditions and uv vis absorbance spectra are given in the supporting file figs s11 and s12 prior to their photocatalytic performance the adsorption efficiency was also evaluated sz1 exhibits maximum adsorption efficiency which can remove 16 12 mb while sz sz2 sz3 and zif 8 can remove 10 31 4 5 10 and 8 06 mb respectively fig 6 a and table 5 further sz2 exhibits excellent photocatalytic degradation efficiency 97 25 while sz sz1 sz3 and zif 8 can degrade off 85 56 90 56 86 43 and 84 18 mb clearly indicating the significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of sz2 and greater efficiency of sz1 as compared to zif 8 in case of cr sz2 exhibits maximum adsorption efficiency which can remove 97 7 cr within 40 min while sz sz1 sz3 and zif 8 can remove 96 18 93 89 80 53 and 91 6 cr respectively fig 6 b and table 6 here the photocatalytic effect is less significant and under light within 40 min it has been observed that sz2 degrades 100 cr and while sz sz1 sz3 and zif 8 can degrade 98 09 96 18 97 7 and 95 80 cr respectively zif 8 and composites sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 exhibit maximum adsorption efficiency toward cr adsorption this may be due to the enough electrostatic attraction between dye molecules and adsorbent materials at ph 7 zif 8 and composites have positive surface charge which is ensured by zeta potential measurements fig s13 and table st3 while it is well known that cr is anionic and mb is cationic dye 42 that s why cr is adsorbed efficiently as compared to mb further the apparent rate constant kapp values for the degradation of mb and cr dye have also been calculated by using pseudo first order kinetics the linearized integrated rate law is given by following eq 3 3 ln c0 ct kapp t where c0 and ct are initial and at time t concentration of dyes while kapp is apparent rate constant obtained from the slope of the line when ln c0 ct is plotted against time t the apparent rate constant kapp value of sz2 composite was 0 0256 min 1 and 0 1836 min 1 for mb and cr dye respectively which are much higher as compared to the other composites sz sz1 and sz3 and zif 8 the detailed kinetics parameters are given in tables 5 and 6 and the plots between ln c0 ct vs time are illustrated in fig 7 in comparison to various reported ag doped decorated semiconducting photocatalysts and ag agcl zif 8 composites for degradation of dyes table 1 the studied composites in very small amount 10 mg degraded mb and cr in shorter period of time further agnps zif 8 composite has not been explored previously for degradation of mb and cr it has been observed that encapsulation of larger amount of agnps 500 μl suspension decreased the efficiency of catalyst for both the dyes and maximum photocatalytic activity has been obtained in sz2 prepared by using 300 μl suspension of agnps the composites are highly thermally stable and can be stored for several months no change in their pxrd and sem has been observed by keeping them in methanol aqueous solution for six months 3 3 mechanism mechanism for the photodegradation of mb and cr dye using agnps zif 8 composites under uv vis light irradiation is shown in fig 8 as a result of homo to lumo charge transfer in zif 8 34 e moves easily from valence band vb to conduction band cb further metallic agnps act as e scavenger facilitating the transfer of photogenerated e in the conduction band of zif 8 due to surface plasmon resonance spr 1 3 10 hence photo induced generated e and h due to synergistic effect of agnps and zif 8 can easily react with oxygenated water and it can produce reactive oxidative species ros such as h oh which are probably responsible for photocatalytic degradation of both dye molecules but in case of cr adsorption in dark is more pronounced which is supplemented by its photodegradation 100 within 35 40 min the degraded by products of mb and cr were analysed by gcms analysis the plausible degradation path of mb and cr is depicted in schemes st1 and st2 respectively and their mass spectra are also provided in figs s14 and s15 respectively 4 conclusions in nutshell controlled synthesis of agnps zif 8 composites sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 and their characterization and application as photocatalyst adsorbent for industrial pollutants such as mb and cr have been demonstrated it has been found that sz2 composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for degradation of mb 97 25 as compared to zif 8 further it can also be used as an excellent adsorbent supplemented by its photodegradation efficiency for 100 removal of cr within 40 min from the polluted water because the adsorption phenomenon plays a major role for the removal of cr

composites explored by brunauer emmett teller bet adsorption desorption isotherms using n2 gas at 77 k indicate that the surface area of composites decreases on increasing the dosing amount from 1330 33 to 902 28 m2 g 1 except sz2 which exhibits enhanced surface area as compared to sz1 fig s9 table 4 all the four composites sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 are thermally stable up to 400 c under air and nitrogen atmosphere and then started to decompose as shown in fig s10 3 2 photocatalytic and adsorption studies the photocatalytic performance of each composite sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 was studied and compared with zif 8 for degradation of methylene blue mb and congo red cr as organic pollutants details of experimental conditions and uv vis absorbance spectra are given in the supporting file figs s11 and s12 prior to their photocatalytic performance the adsorption efficiency was also evaluated sz1 exhibits maximum adsorption efficiency which can remove 16 12 mb while sz sz2 sz3 and zif 8 can remove 10 31 4 5 10 and 8 06 mb respectively fig 6 a and table 5 further sz2 exhibits excellent photocatalytic degradation efficiency 97 25 while sz sz1 sz3 and zif 8 can degrade off 85 56 90 56 86 43 and 84 18 mb clearly indicating the significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of sz2 and greater efficiency of sz1 as compared to zif 8 in case of cr sz2 exhibits maximum adsorption efficiency which can remove 97 7 cr within 40 min while sz sz1 sz3 and zif 8 can remove 96 18 93 89 80 53 and 91 6 cr respectively fig 6 b and table 6 here the photocatalytic effect is less significant and under light within 40 min it has been observed that sz2 degrades 100 cr and while sz sz1 sz3 and zif 8 can degrade 98 09 96 18 97 7 and 95 80 cr respectively zif 8 and composites sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 exhibit maximum adsorption efficiency toward cr adsorption this may be due to the enough electrostatic attraction between dye molecules and adsorbent materials at ph 7 zif 8 and composites have positive surface charge which is ensured by zeta potential measurements fig s13 and table st3 while it is well known that cr is anionic and mb is cationic dye 42 that s why cr is adsorbed efficiently as compared to mb further the apparent rate constant kapp values for the degradation of mb and cr dye have also been calculated by using pseudo first order kinetics the linearized integrated rate law is given by following eq 3 3 ln c0 ct kapp t where c0 and ct are initial and at time t concentration of dyes while kapp is apparent rate constant obtained from the slope of the line when ln c0 ct is plotted against time t the apparent rate constant kapp value of sz2 composite was 0 0256 min 1 and 0 1836 min 1 for mb and cr dye respectively which are much higher as compared to the other composites sz sz1 and sz3 and zif 8 the detailed kinetics parameters are given in tables 5 and 6 and the plots between ln c0 ct vs time are illustrated in fig 7 in comparison to various reported ag doped decorated semiconducting photocatalysts and ag agcl zif 8 composites for degradation of dyes table 1 the studied composites in very small amount 10 mg degraded mb and cr in shorter period of time further agnps zif 8 composite has not been explored previously for degradation of mb and cr it has been observed that encapsulation of larger amount of agnps 500 μl suspension decreased the efficiency of catalyst for both the dyes and maximum photocatalytic activity has been obtained in sz2 prepared by using 300 μl suspension of agnps the composites are highly thermally stable and can be stored for several months no change in their pxrd and sem has been observed by keeping them in methanol aqueous solution for six months 3 3 mechanism mechanism for the photodegradation of mb and cr dye using agnps zif 8 composites under uv vis light irradiation is shown in fig 8 as a result of homo to lumo charge transfer in zif 8 34 e moves easily from valence band vb to conduction band cb further metallic agnps act as e scavenger facilitating the transfer of photogenerated e in the conduction band of zif 8 due to surface plasmon resonance spr 1 3 10 hence photo induced generated e and h due to synergistic effect of agnps and zif 8 can easily react with oxygenated water and it can produce reactive oxidative species ros such as h oh which are probably responsible for photocatalytic degradation of both dye molecules but in case of cr adsorption in dark is more pronounced which is supplemented by its photodegradation 100 within 35 40 min the degraded by products of mb and cr were analysed by gcms analysis the plausible degradation path of mb and cr is depicted in schemes st1 and st2 respectively and their mass spectra are also provided in figs s14 and s15 respectively 4 conclusions in nutshell controlled synthesis of agnps zif 8 composites sz sz1 sz2 and sz3 and their characterization and application as photocatalyst adsorbent for industrial pollutants such as mb and cr have been demonstrated it has been found that sz2 composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for degradation of mb 97 25 as compared to zif 8 further it can also be used as an excellent adsorbent supplemented by its photodegradation efficiency for 100 removal of cr within 40 min from the polluted water because the adsorption phenomenon plays a major role for the removal of cr

13956,the focus of the study was to evaluate the effect of thiocyanate scn addition on the reformation of the aerobic granules after its disintegration along with the pollutants degradation profile and nitritation recovery in a sequencing batch reactor sbr granules were cultivated with phenol 400 mg l 1 and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 100 mg l 1 in an sbr after 75 days of stable reactor operation with volatile suspended solids granule size and extracellular polymeric substances eps of 3 67 g l 1 1202 03 487 78 μm and 78 23 mg gvss 1 respectively the granules started to deteriorate and disintegration continued up to 84th day then reformation of disintegrated granules was observed after the gradual addition of scn 10 340 mg l 1 the size of granules increased to 1819 87 43 44 μm along with higher eps 101 45 1 06 mg gvss 1 and recovery of nitritation efficiency a signification impact was observed in granule characteristics sludge volume index and granule settling velocity of 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 and 57 32 0 96 m h 1 respectively because of microbial aggregation caused by sticky eps secretion it was found that scn played an important role in the granule reformulation by provoking the secretion of eps a very high binding capacity substance keywords disintegrated granules extracellular polymeric substances nitritation recovery reformation thiocyanate 1 introduction aerobic granules possess excellent settling behavior denser compact microbial structure smaller footprint and better nutrient and pollutant removal ability as compared to conventional activated sludge 1 3 however poor granule stability is a significant issue for prolonged reactor operation which results in limited aerobic granular sludge ags application for treating toxic wastewater 4 5 therefore a promising and prolonged ags reactor operation is needed which would significantly improve the wastewater treatment process mechanism of granule disintegration is still not clear although few mechanisms have been proposed which contribute to granule instability like filamentous outgrowth anaerobic core hydrolysis and change in extracellular polymeric substances eps composition etc 6 7 however the addition of calcium magnesium zinc poly aluminum chloride pac was found to accelerate the microbial aggregation process and assisted in sustaining the stability of the aerobic granules 8 10 eps secreted by microorganisms plays a crucial part in governing the granule formation and granule s stability and is supposed to be a glue like sticky substance that helps in building a gel like structure for keeping bacteria together in the biofilms 11 14 substrate type nutrient content external conditions like the addition of metal ions or toxic substances can enhance the eps secretion 15 however the metal ions can be washed out if added directly to the solution resulting in a rise in the reactor operational cost or insufficient metal ions in the solution for stimulating the eps secretion 16 the secretion of eps is the self adaptive action of granular biomass against the exposure to the toxic substance for their existence this bacterial survival action helps in providing strength to the granules 17 furthermore the concentration of toxic substances higher than the threshold value have a lesser significant impact on eps production 15 therefore a suitable toxic substance in an adequate amount is required various toxic chemicals like phenols cyanide ammonium and thiocyanate scn found in several industrial effluents like coke processing plants and simultaneous removal is difficult because of the inhibition episode among the pollutants 18 19 the concentrations of toxic chemicals in coke processing units are ranged from 350 1200 mg l 1 for phenol 50 400 mg l 1 for ammonia nitrogen and 100 500 mg l 1 for scn 20 21 the studies reporting the effect of scn on nitrification along with phenol removal in the biological wastewater treatment process is available 18 21 22 however the literature works demonstrating the impact of scn on ags are scanty so far the focus of most of the research works is either on the improvement of the granule stability during the formation of the granules or the suitable and sustainable granular storage strategy 4 23 an approach to the aerobic granule reformulation after its disintegration is still very limited in the literature literature works are available on the reformation of anammox granular sludge by lowering the substrate concentrations 24 and granule reformation in anaerobic anoxic process 25 however for ags reformation liu et al 9 reported the aerobic granule reformation after its rupture by the addition of an inorganic polymer poly aluminum chloride therefore the present research work aims to 1 evaluate the impact of toxic scn on granule reformulation from the disintegrated granules 2 describe the change in granular characteristics after addition of scn and 3 investigate the ability of reformed aerobic granules to transform scn along with nitritation recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up this study was performed in a sequencing batch reactor sbr of 6 l working volume with working height and an inner diameter of 212 and 6 cm respectively air compressor was used to provide air by the air stones placed at the bottom of the sbr with an airflow rate of 2 0 l min 1 through the rotameter the schematic diagram of the sbr is given in fig s1 supplementary material the influent feed composition is given in table 1 the influent feed contained phenol ammonia nitrogen nh4 n as nh4cl trace metals and phosphate buffer thiocyanate scn as kscn was added to the feed from the 85th day onwards in this current work scn was opted because of its simultaneous occurrence with phenol and ammonia nitrogen in the wastewater generated from coal processing units 19 along with the documentation of eps secretion due to environmental and scn stress 17 26 the role of eps is well documented in the literature eps enhances the aggregation of microbes and maintains its stability 14 that s why taking environmental stress in the form of toxic scn addition to provoke eps secretion for microbial aggregation and simultaneous occurrence of the pollutants mentioned above into consideration scn was chosen for the current work sodium hydrogen carbonate and phosphate buffer also provided phosphorous for microbial growth were used to maintain 7 5 8 0 ph inside the reactor phosphate buffer and trace metal compositions were adopted from tomar and chakraborty 27 2 2 reactor operation the seed sludge was taken from the indian oil corporation limited iocl guwahati having the total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss of 2 05 0 07 and 1 60 0 11 g l 1 respectively along with the sludge volume index svi30 of 51 26 ml gtss 1 28 the sbr was regulated with cycle time and hydraulic retention time of 6 and 12 h respectively feeding 30 min reaction 320 min settling of granular sludge 5 min and effluent decanting from the sbr 5 min were the four stages of each 6 h cycle a 50 volume exchange ratio was maintained in the sbr the sbr was operated up to 74 days with phenol and nh4 n concentrations of 400 and 100 mg l 1 respectively the first granular appearance was observed on day 10 and mature granulation was achieved after 40 days of reactor operation detailed information can be seen in tomar and chakraborty 28 up to 74 days granules were stable after 75 days of stable sbr operation granules started to disintegrate for the next 10 days up to 84 days the sbr was operated with the same feed then from the day 85th scn concentration was gradually increased and was kept at 240 mg l 1 for 10 days days 116 126 afterward it was raised to 340 mg l 1 and the sbr was operated for the next fifteen days at 340 mg l 1 scn for steady state data table 1 2 3 analytical procedures chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n scn tss vss svi30 and nitrite were measured according to standard methods 29 nitrate analysis was done by ion chromatography 792 basic ic metrohm switzerland the colorimetric method using ferric nitrate in an acidic medium was used to determine scn 29 in this method a 50 ml clear sample was taken in a beaker and ph was adjusted to 2 by concentrated hno3 the absorbance of the sample was taken at 460 nm against blank after the addition of 2 5 ml ferric nitrate the free settling test of yu et al 30 was adopted to observe granule settling velocity gsv sludge retention time srt and granule size were determined according to tomar and chakraborty 27 though srt was not regulated in this study the laser particle size analyser lpsa mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments uk and image analysis software imagej were used to evaluate the granule size a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss sigma germany was used to determine the morphology of granules granule sample preparation for fesem analysis was done according to wang et al 31 the heat extraction procedure was used for determining eps 32 in the extraction procedure 50 ml sludge was collected from the reactor during the aeration phase the collected sample was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min followed by washing of pellet by supernatant twice after that the pellet was suspended in 0 2 nacl solution up to 50 ml followed by placing the suspension in the water bath at 60 c for 30 min then the sludge suspension was again centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant collected after the centrifugation was considered as the eps extract the major components of eps are proteins pn and polysaccharides ps pn content was determined according to lowry assay 33 whereas ps content was evaluated by the phenol sulphuric acid method 34 3 results and discussion sbr was operated at steady state for one month days 45 74 with phenol and nh4 n concentrations of 400 and 100 mg l 1 respectively sbr was stable in terms of granule size vss svi30 gsv eps cod phenol and nh4 n removal data is provided in another study tomar and chakraborty 28 on day 75 stable granule size vss svi30 gsv and eps values were 1202 03 487 78 μm 3 67 g l 1 37 34 ml gtss 1 36 85 9 73 m h 1 and 78 23 mg gvss 1 respectively whereas cod phenol and nh4 n removal efficiencies were found to be 94 57 99 96 and 99 92 respectively most of the nh4 n transformed into nitrite 93 45 mg l 1 and little amount to nitrate 13 89 mg l 1 from the 100 mg l 1 of influent nh4 n indicating the nitritation process conversion of nh4 n to no2 n after 75 days of reactor operation granules started to deteriorate possibly might be due to change in eps content and disintegration continued until the addition of scn 3 1 effect of scn on characteristics of granules granular characteristics at different scn concentrations with operation time are provided in table 2 3 1 1 granule size granule size has been considered as one of the most prominent factors responsible for granule formation 9 the day wise progress in the granule reformation from the deteriorated one is given in fig s2 supplementary material and morphology of granules before day 82 and after day 138 addition of scn is illustrated in fig s3 supplementary material form fig s2 and fig s3 visual observation it was clear that after 75 days of reactor operation granules started to degenerate day 84 at an organic and ammonia loading rates olr and nlr of 0 80 kg phenol m 3 day 1 and 0 20 kg nh4 n m 3 day 1 respectively and again regained structural integrity after the addition of scn liu et al 9 also observed granule disintegration after 86 days of reactor operation but with glucose as a carbon source the change in granule size with operational time is given in fig 1 a the granule size was around 1202 03 487 78 μm on day 75 since then a reduction was observed in granule size up to 87th day 911 19 μm indicating the dismantling of the granules introduction of scn with a concentration of 10 mg l 1 didn t cause any positive impact on the size of granules and it might be because of time taken by ags to cope up with the addition of toxic scn days 85 90 nearly a week later day 91 with the next dose of scn 25 mg l 1 an improvement in granule size was observed and it was continued up to 146 days of sbr operation granule reformulation was confirmed form the average granule size of 1819 87 43 44 μm formed after operating the reactor for 15 days days 133 146 with scn concentration of 340 mg l 1 3 1 2 vss svi and gsv vss profile of the sbr is provided in fig 1b vss concentration decreased during the days 80 91 of reactor operation from the vss value of 3 67 g l 1 day 75 because of the deterioration of the granules granule disintegration was also supported through the srt values on day 75 srt was 9 23 days whereas it was around 6 27 days on day 84 confirming the granule malfunctioning and biomass wash out a rise in vss was noticed after the addition of 75 mg l 1 of scn and at 240 mg l 1 of scn concentration days 118 126 vss reached to 3 98 0 12 g l 1 during days 118 126 srt was 9 71 days suggesting the granule reformation the scn concentration was again raised to 340 mg l 1 to observe the impact of higher concentration of scn on granular biomass and a higher average vss of 4 44 0 09 g l 1 with 9 56 days srt was observed during days 135 143 a rise in svi30 value from 37 34 day 75 to 70 42 ml gtss 1 day 91 was observed indicating poor settling behavior it might be because of the granule dismantling fig 1c as scn was increased a reduction in svi30 was noticed svi30 value decreased from 70 42 ml gtss 1 day 91 to 29 97 0 49 ml gtss 1 days 118 126 and further decreased to 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 after addition of 340 mg l 1 of scn days 135 143 fig 1c lower svi30 value confirmed the reformation of compact granular aggregate an svi value of 20 40 ml gtss 1 for the reformed granules after the addition of pac was observed with glucose 9 the current research work was similar with the work of liu et al 9 in terms of achieving svi30 value 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 for the reformulated granules after addition of toxic pollutant scn and was advantageous in terms of getting reformed granules without the addition of any auxiliary materials on the other hand initially gsv was found to decrease from 36 85 9 73 day 75 to 29 35 14 11 m h 1 day 91 later on due to the addition of scn a significant improvement was observed in the gsv value and it got stabilized to 57 32 0 96 m h 1 days 135 143 fig 1c from fig 1c it was concluded that as the scn continued to increase a significant decline in svi30 and a rise in gsv values were observed indicating the granule reformulation a week after the addition of scn the granules showed adaptability towards scn and afterward a significant impact was observed on granule characteristics fig 1 and no negative impact of scn on the characteristics of aerobic granules was observed up to a concentration of 340 mg l 1 3 2 effect of scn on eps the eps content profile along with pn and ps contents is illustrated in fig 2 initially on day 75 eps was around 78 23 mg gvss 1 and moved down to the lower value of 47 44 mg gvss 1 on day 91 pn and ps values were 59 30 and 18 93 mg gvss 1 pn ps 3 13 on day 75 whereas reduced to 32 87 and 14 57 mg gvss 1 pn ps 2 26 respectively on day 91 after that a rise in eps pn and ps contents was observed after the addition of toxic scn and it was continued throughout the study during steady state days 133 146 the average values of eps pn and ps were found to be 101 45 1 06 77 29 1 05 and 24 16 0 65 mg gvss 1 respectively during 133 146 days of reactor operation the pn ps ratio was 3 20 0 11 pn content was more eminent than ps content and was found to be main component of eps responsible for the granule formation 7 liu et al 9 also observed higher pn content during the reformation of aerobic granules pn ps ratio of 3 4 6 2 was reported in a phenol fed aerobic granular reactor 35 which is comparable to this study from the eps value it was concluded that scn was having a convincing impact on granule stability and also provoked the secretion of eps for maintaining granular structure chen et al 17 also observed the higher eps value after the addition of scn in granule based anammox process anammox granules secreted more eps under adverse condition by the addition of scn to maintain the structure and activity of anammox granules 17 eps is supposed to be a sticky substance that keeps the biofilms intact for maintaining its integrity and contains a large number of functional groups such as hydroxyl and negatively charged carboxyl groups due to the presence of these functional groups eps is to be considered as an excellent binding polymer that could bind through many interactions like protein polysaccharide hydrophobic ionic and h bonding etc 11 bacteria are negatively charged which results in electrostatic repulsion between the cells 36 this repulsion must be reduced for the aggregation of bacteria tsuneda et al 37 stated that the eps covering on the surface of cells might reduce the negative surface charge around the cell surface thus contributing to cell adhesion and also observed the lower zeta potential for the intact cells 31 6 mv as compared to washed cells when eps was removed from the cell surface 27 2 mv lee et al 6 also reported that eps altered the surface characteristics of bacterial cells like charge after being accumulated on the surface of the cells therefore more secretion of eps is desirable for the aerobic granulation in the present study aerobic granules also secreted more eps because of toxic scn addition and might have contributed to regaining the structural integrity of granules 3 3 effect of scn on reactor performance the sbr was operated with the constant olr and nlr of 0 80 kg phenol m 3 day 1 2 01 0 28 kg cod m 3 day 1 and 0 20 kg nh4 n m 3 day 1 respectively throughout the study phenol was almost completely biodegraded 99 from the influent phenol concentration of 400 mg l 1 granule disintegration did not show any impact on phenol biodegradation and biodegradation continued throughout the operation irrespective of granule deterioration and reformulation fig 3 a it might be because of the presence of suspended solids in the sbr apart from ags which was supposed to contribute to phenol biodegradation a little reduction was observed in cod removal efficiency from 94 57 day 75 to 90 61 day 92 because of the lower vss 2 36 0 30 g l 1 resulted from the granule break down in sbr during those days once the granules began to reform after the addition of scn vss started to increase fig 1b thus resulting in the 94 97 cod removal efficiency fig 3b the complete mineralization of the phenolic compound was confirmed from the higher cod removal efficiency in an aerobic environment the final product of scn biotransformation is so4 2 and the overall equation for scn biotransformation is given below eq 1 38 1 s c n 3 h 2 o 2 o 2 h c o 3 n h 4 s o 4 2 h complete biotransformation of scn was observed throughout the sbr operation fig 3c scn did not show any adverse effect on granule reformulation up to a concentration of 340 mg l 1 along with around 99 removal efficiency and excellent granular characteristics figs 3c and 1 respectively the presence of sulfate in the reactor confirmed the scn oxidation even though it was not monitored from eq 1 it was clear that scn biotransformation also contributed to the addition of nh4 n to the reactor the removal profile of nh4 n is depicted in fig 4 a nh4 n removal efficiency moved down from 99 day 75 to 67 day 86 from the influent 100 mg l 1 of nh4 n and soon after the addition of 75 mg l 1 of scn the removal efficiency again recovered to 99 95th day onwards fig 4a it means nearly 10 days was taken by nitrifying bacteria to redevelop in the sbr additional nh4 n also generated through the complete biotransformation of scn 0 24 mg of nh4 n generated from 1 mg of scn eq 1 therefore the total influent nitrogen was expressed as eq 2 2 i n f l u e n t n i t r o g e n σ i n f l u e n t n h 4 n 0 24 i n f l u e n t s c n during steady state days 133 146 the total influent nitrogen was around 180 mg l 1 out of which about 80 mg l 1 generated from the biotransformation of 340 mg l 1 of scn therefore around 180 mg l 1 of nh4 n transformed in the present study nitrification is a two step process first conversion of nh4 to no2 nitritation by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and further into no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 39 srt values are very important to achieve complete nitrification effluent no2 n and no3 n followed a different trend during the sbr operation fig 4b on day 75 concentrations of no2 n and no3 n in the effluent were 93 45 and 13 89 mg l 1 respectively from 100 mg l 1 of influent nh4 n the higher amount of effluent no2 n confirmed the nitritation process for attaining complete nitrification srt values should be in the range of 10 30 days 39 on day 75 srt was 9 23 days which was lower than the required value for achieving complete nitrification 10 30 days therefore most of the nh4 n transformed into no2 n after 75 days of sbr operation loss in nitritation efficiency was observed because of the washout of the nitrifiers from the system due to granule disintegration confirmed through the decline in vss value fig 1b resulting in reduced no2 n and no3 n concentrations up to 55 78 and 10 44 mg l 1 respectively day 84 with a shorter srt value of 6 72 days afterward as the granules started to reform after the addition of scn recovery in nitritation efficiency was observed fig 4b no2 n concentration first increased to 91 72 mg l 1 day 95 and further decreased to 59 35 mg l 1 day 104 at scn concentration of 115 mg l 1 with srt value of 10 93 days at the same time no3 n concentration was on its maximum level 71 72 mg l 1 it might be because of 10 93 days srt which was in the range of srt values required for complete nitrification 10 30 days therefore most of nh4 n converted into no3 n as the scn concentration was further increased 240 mg l 1 no2 n concentration increased whereas no3 n and srt values decreased because of the toxicity impart by higher scn 240 mg l 1 on the activity of nob 116th day onwards at 240 mg l 1 of scn days116 126 no2 n concentration was around 159 05 14 59 mg l 1 from influent nh4 n of about 156 mg l 1 calculated from eq 2 whereas no3 n was only 3 98 6 43 mg l 1 with the srt value of 9 71 days during steady state days 133 146 at scn concentration of 340 mg l 1 no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 193 58 3 13 and 1 73 0 16 mg l 1 respectively from the influent nh4 n of about 180 mg l 1 calculated from eq 2 with the srt of 9 56 days during days 133 146 effluent nh4 n was almost negligible 0 10 mg l 1 nitritation efficiency was successfully recovered and was indicated from the higher effluent of no2 n concentration 193 58 3 13 mg l 1 confirming that aob remained unaffected by the higher scn concentration 240 mg l 1 specific nitrification rate snr was also calculated before days 80 84 and after addition of scn days 133 146 scn addition also enhanced the nitrification rate before scn addition snr was 2 35 mg no2 n no3 n gvss 1 h 1 whereas after scn addition snr increased to 3 67 mg no2 n no3 n gvss 1 h 1 for steady state days 133 146 the nitrogen balance profile was observed and given by eq 3 39 the average values for influent nitrogen and effluent nh4 n were about 180 and 0 10 mg l 1 the average nitrogen used for the growth of biomass was calculated by eq 4 39 and was 27 87 mg l 1 3 t h e o r e t i c a l n i t r o g e n o x i d i z e d m g l 1 i n f l u e n t n i t r o g e n m g l 1 e f f l u e n t n h 4 n m g l 1 n i t r o g e n u s e

no3 n from the previous cycles four cycles in a day and also confirmed the absence of the denitrification process li et al 21 observed a slight inhibition on scn removal at a phenol concentration of around 420 mg l 1 in a moving bed biofilm reactor it was also observed that scn and phenol concentrations beyond 200 mg l 1 seemed to inhibit nitrification 40 in the current work no inhibition among the pollutants was observed up to a concentration of 400 180 and 340 mg l 1 for phenol nh4 n and scn respectively from the results it was concluded that not only the addition of scn induced the granule reformulation by provoking the eps secretion but also reformed the granules with better characteristics than the granules formed before disintegration the addition of scn served two purposes one was to reform the granules from the broken one along with the recovery of nitritation efficiency and second was the treatment of wastewater containing scn as well to the author s best knowledge this study is the first study in which broken granules again reformed by the addition of a toxic substance along with the recovery of the nitritation process the possible mechanism of granule reformulation after the addition of scn is illustrated in fig 5 after 75 days of reactor operation granules became unstable and started to deteriorate confirmed by lower vss and eps values of 2 07 g l 1 and 47 44 mg gvss 1 respectively on day 91 after the addition of toxic scn granules might have started to protect themselves against the toxic effect of scn by secreting a gel matrix of eps higher eps values of 101 45 1 06 mg gvss 1 at an scn concentration of 340 mg l 1 during 133 146 days due to which broken granules agglomerated again in the trapping network of eps because of the shear force caused due to the airflow rate the granules which were trapped in the eps gel network attained the regular structure because of getting agglomerated and attaining regular structure again compact and denser granules having lower svi30 and higher gsv of 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 and 57 32 0 96 m h 1 respectively were formed days 133 146 due to this vss in the effluent reduced concluded from the higher srt of 9 56 days and increased in the reactor 4 44 0 09 g l 1 because of the compact granule reformation loss of biomass reduced and aob again developed in the system resulting in the recovery of nitritation efficiency of the system thus the addition of toxic scn induced the granule reformulation process with improved granular characteristics and reactor performance 4 conclusion the impact of scn introduction on the reformulation of the granules from the disintegrated one was evaluated the addition of toxic scn showed a significant effect on the reformation of the granules by triggering the more eps secretion which was supposed to induce the granule agglomeration reformed granules also successfully regained their nitritation efficiency reformed granules were having better characteristics than the granules formed before deterioration granules with larger size 1819 87 43 44 μm better settling behavior svi30 and gsv of 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 and 57 32 0 96 m h 1 respectively and higher eps content 101 45 1 06 mg gvss 1 were reformulated up to a concentration of 340 mg l 1 scn did not show any inhibitory effect on characteristics of reformed granules phenol

13956,the focus of the study was to evaluate the effect of thiocyanate scn addition on the reformation of the aerobic granules after its disintegration along with the pollutants degradation profile and nitritation recovery in a sequencing batch reactor sbr granules were cultivated with phenol 400 mg l 1 and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 100 mg l 1 in an sbr after 75 days of stable reactor operation with volatile suspended solids granule size and extracellular polymeric substances eps of 3 67 g l 1 1202 03 487 78 μm and 78 23 mg gvss 1 respectively the granules started to deteriorate and disintegration continued up to 84th day then reformation of disintegrated granules was observed after the gradual addition of scn 10 340 mg l 1 the size of granules increased to 1819 87 43 44 μm along with higher eps 101 45 1 06 mg gvss 1 and recovery of nitritation efficiency a signification impact was observed in granule characteristics sludge volume index and granule settling velocity of 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 and 57 32 0 96 m h 1 respectively because of microbial aggregation caused by sticky eps secretion it was found that scn played an important role in the granule reformulation by provoking the secretion of eps a very high binding capacity substance keywords disintegrated granules extracellular polymeric substances nitritation recovery reformation thiocyanate 1 introduction aerobic granules possess excellent settling behavior denser compact microbial structure smaller footprint and better nutrient and pollutant removal ability as compared to conventional activated sludge 1 3 however poor granule stability is a significant issue for prolonged reactor operation which results in limited aerobic granular sludge ags application for treating toxic wastewater 4 5 therefore a promising and prolonged ags reactor operation is needed which would significantly improve the wastewater treatment process mechanism of granule disintegration is still not clear although few mechanisms have been proposed which contribute to granule instability like filamentous outgrowth anaerobic core hydrolysis and change in extracellular polymeric substances eps composition etc 6 7 however the addition of calcium magnesium zinc poly aluminum chloride pac was found to accelerate the microbial aggregation process and assisted in sustaining the stability of the aerobic granules 8 10 eps secreted by microorganisms plays a crucial part in governing the granule formation and granule s stability and is supposed to be a glue like sticky substance that helps in building a gel like structure for keeping bacteria together in the biofilms 11 14 substrate type nutrient content external conditions like the addition of metal ions or toxic substances can enhance the eps secretion 15 however the metal ions can be washed out if added directly to the solution resulting in a rise in the reactor operational cost or insufficient metal ions in the solution for stimulating the eps secretion 16 the secretion of eps is the self adaptive action of granular biomass against the exposure to the toxic substance for their existence this bacterial survival action helps in providing strength to the granules 17 furthermore the concentration of toxic substances higher than the threshold value have a lesser significant impact on eps production 15 therefore a suitable toxic substance in an adequate amount is required various toxic chemicals like phenols cyanide ammonium and thiocyanate scn found in several industrial effluents like coke processing plants and simultaneous removal is difficult because of the inhibition episode among the pollutants 18 19 the concentrations of toxic chemicals in coke processing units are ranged from 350 1200 mg l 1 for phenol 50 400 mg l 1 for ammonia nitrogen and 100 500 mg l 1 for scn 20 21 the studies reporting the effect of scn on nitrification along with phenol removal in the biological wastewater treatment process is available 18 21 22 however the literature works demonstrating the impact of scn on ags are scanty so far the focus of most of the research works is either on the improvement of the granule stability during the formation of the granules or the suitable and sustainable granular storage strategy 4 23 an approach to the aerobic granule reformulation after its disintegration is still very limited in the literature literature works are available on the reformation of anammox granular sludge by lowering the substrate concentrations 24 and granule reformation in anaerobic anoxic process 25 however for ags reformation liu et al 9 reported the aerobic granule reformation after its rupture by the addition of an inorganic polymer poly aluminum chloride therefore the present research work aims to 1 evaluate the impact of toxic scn on granule reformulation from the disintegrated granules 2 describe the change in granular characteristics after addition of scn and 3 investigate the ability of reformed aerobic granules to transform scn along with nitritation recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up this study was performed in a sequencing batch reactor sbr of 6 l working volume with working height and an inner diameter of 212 and 6 cm respectively air compressor was used to provide air by the air stones placed at the bottom of the sbr with an airflow rate of 2 0 l min 1 through the rotameter the schematic diagram of the sbr is given in fig s1 supplementary material the influent feed composition is given in table 1 the influent feed contained phenol ammonia nitrogen nh4 n as nh4cl trace metals and phosphate buffer thiocyanate scn as kscn was added to the feed from the 85th day onwards in this current work scn was opted because of its simultaneous occurrence with phenol and ammonia nitrogen in the wastewater generated from coal processing units 19 along with the documentation of eps secretion due to environmental and scn stress 17 26 the role of eps is well documented in the literature eps enhances the aggregation of microbes and maintains its stability 14 that s why taking environmental stress in the form of toxic scn addition to provoke eps secretion for microbial aggregation and simultaneous occurrence of the pollutants mentioned above into consideration scn was chosen for the current work sodium hydrogen carbonate and phosphate buffer also provided phosphorous for microbial growth were used to maintain 7 5 8 0 ph inside the reactor phosphate buffer and trace metal compositions were adopted from tomar and chakraborty 27 2 2 reactor operation the seed sludge was taken from the indian oil corporation limited iocl guwahati having the total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss of 2 05 0 07 and 1 60 0 11 g l 1 respectively along with the sludge volume index svi30 of 51 26 ml gtss 1 28 the sbr was regulated with cycle time and hydraulic retention time of 6 and 12 h respectively feeding 30 min reaction 320 min settling of granular sludge 5 min and effluent decanting from the sbr 5 min were the four stages of each 6 h cycle a 50 volume exchange ratio was maintained in the sbr the sbr was operated up to 74 days with phenol and nh4 n concentrations of 400 and 100 mg l 1 respectively the first granular appearance was observed on day 10 and mature granulation was achieved after 40 days of reactor operation detailed information can be seen in tomar and chakraborty 28 up to 74 days granules were stable after 75 days of stable sbr operation granules started to disintegrate for the next 10 days up to 84 days the sbr was operated with the same feed then from the day 85th scn concentration was gradually increased and was kept at 240 mg l 1 for 10 days days 116 126 afterward it was raised to 340 mg l 1 and the sbr was operated for the next fifteen days at 340 mg l 1 scn for steady state data table 1 2 3 analytical procedures chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n scn tss vss svi30 and nitrite were measured according to standard methods 29 nitrate analysis was done by ion chromatography 792 basic ic metrohm switzerland the colorimetric method using ferric nitrate in an acidic medium was used to determine scn 29 in this method a 50 ml clear sample was taken in a beaker and ph was adjusted to 2 by concentrated hno3 the absorbance of the sample was taken at 460 nm against blank after the addition of 2 5 ml ferric nitrate the free settling test of yu et al 30 was adopted to observe granule settling velocity gsv sludge retention time srt and granule size were determined according to tomar and chakraborty 27 though srt was not regulated in this study the laser particle size analyser lpsa mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments uk and image analysis software imagej were used to evaluate the granule size a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss sigma germany was used to determine the morphology of granules granule sample preparation for fesem analysis was done according to wang et al 31 the heat extraction procedure was used for determining eps 32 in the extraction procedure 50 ml sludge was collected from the reactor during the aeration phase the collected sample was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min followed by washing of pellet by supernatant twice after that the pellet was suspended in 0 2 nacl solution up to 50 ml followed by placing the suspension in the water bath at 60 c for 30 min then the sludge suspension was again centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant collected after the centrifugation was considered as the eps extract the major components of eps are proteins pn and polysaccharides ps pn content was determined according to lowry assay 33 whereas ps content was evaluated by the phenol sulphuric acid method 34 3 results and discussion sbr was operated at steady state for one month days 45 74 with phenol and nh4 n concentrations of 400 and 100 mg l 1 respectively sbr was stable in terms of granule size vss svi30 gsv eps cod phenol and nh4 n removal data is provided in another study tomar and chakraborty 28 on day 75 stable granule size vss svi30 gsv and eps values were 1202 03 487 78 μm 3 67 g l 1 37 34 ml gtss 1 36 85 9 73 m h 1 and 78 23 mg gvss 1 respectively whereas cod phenol and nh4 n removal efficiencies were found to be 94 57 99 96 and 99 92 respectively most of the nh4 n transformed into nitrite 93 45 mg l 1 and little amount to nitrate 13 89 mg l 1 from the 100 mg l 1 of influent nh4 n indicating the nitritation process conversion of nh4 n to no2 n after 75 days of reactor operation granules started to deteriorate possibly might be due to change in eps content and disintegration continued until the addition of scn 3 1 effect of scn on characteristics of granules granular characteristics at different scn concentrations with operation time are provided in table 2 3 1 1 granule size granule size has been considered as one of the most prominent factors responsible for granule formation 9 the day wise progress in the granule reformation from the deteriorated one is given in fig s2 supplementary material and morphology of granules before day 82 and after day 138 addition of scn is illustrated in fig s3 supplementary material form fig s2 and fig s3 visual observation it was clear that after 75 days of reactor operation granules started to degenerate day 84 at an organic and ammonia loading rates olr and nlr of 0 80 kg phenol m 3 day 1 and 0 20 kg nh4 n m 3 day 1 respectively and again regained structural integrity after the addition of scn liu et al 9 also observed granule disintegration after 86 days of reactor operation but with glucose as a carbon source the change in granule size with operational time is given in fig 1 a the granule size was around 1202 03 487 78 μm on day 75 since then a reduction was observed in granule size up to 87th day 911 19 μm indicating the dismantling of the granules introduction of scn with a concentration of 10 mg l 1 didn t cause any positive impact on the size of granules and it might be because of time taken by ags to cope up with the addition of toxic scn days 85 90 nearly a week later day 91 with the next dose of scn 25 mg l 1 an improvement in granule size was observed and it was continued up to 146 days of sbr operation granule reformulation was confirmed form the average granule size of 1819 87 43 44 μm formed after operating the reactor for 15 days days 133 146 with scn concentration of 340 mg l 1 3 1 2 vss svi and gsv vss profile of the sbr is provided in fig 1b vss concentration decreased during the days 80 91 of reactor operation from the vss value of 3 67 g l 1 day 75 because of the deterioration of the granules granule disintegration was also supported through the srt values on day 75 srt was 9 23 days whereas it was around 6 27 days on day 84 confirming the granule malfunctioning and biomass wash out a rise in vss was noticed after the addition of 75 mg l 1 of scn and at 240 mg l 1 of scn concentration days 118 126 vss reached to 3 98 0 12 g l 1 during days 118 126 srt was 9 71 days suggesting the granule reformation the scn concentration was again raised to 340 mg l 1 to observe the impact of higher concentration of scn on granular biomass and a higher average vss of 4 44 0 09 g l 1 with 9 56 days srt was observed during days 135 143 a rise in svi30 value from 37 34 day 75 to 70 42 ml gtss 1 day 91 was observed indicating poor settling behavior it might be because of the granule dismantling fig 1c as scn was increased a reduction in svi30 was noticed svi30 value decreased from 70 42 ml gtss 1 day 91 to 29 97 0 49 ml gtss 1 days 118 126 and further decreased to 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 after addition of 340 mg l 1 of scn days 135 143 fig 1c lower svi30 value confirmed the reformation of compact granular aggregate an svi value of 20 40 ml gtss 1 for the reformed granules after the addition of pac was observed with glucose 9 the current research work was similar with the work of liu et al 9 in terms of achieving svi30 value 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 for the reformulated granules after addition of toxic pollutant scn and was advantageous in terms of getting reformed granules without the addition of any auxiliary materials on the other hand initially gsv was found to decrease from 36 85 9 73 day 75 to 29 35 14 11 m h 1 day 91 later on due to the addition of scn a significant improvement was observed in the gsv value and it got stabilized to 57 32 0 96 m h 1 days 135 143 fig 1c from fig 1c it was concluded that as the scn continued to increase a significant decline in svi30 and a rise in gsv values were observed indicating the granule reformulation a week after the addition of scn the granules showed adaptability towards scn and afterward a significant impact was observed on granule characteristics fig 1 and no negative impact of scn on the characteristics of aerobic granules was observed up to a concentration of 340 mg l 1 3 2 effect of scn on eps the eps content profile along with pn and ps contents is illustrated in fig 2 initially on day 75 eps was around 78 23 mg gvss 1 and moved down to the lower value of 47 44 mg gvss 1 on day 91 pn and ps values were 59 30 and 18 93 mg gvss 1 pn ps 3 13 on day 75 whereas reduced to 32 87 and 14 57 mg gvss 1 pn ps 2 26 respectively on day 91 after that a rise in eps pn and ps contents was observed after the addition of toxic scn and it was continued throughout the study during steady state days 133 146 the average values of eps pn and ps were found to be 101 45 1 06 77 29 1 05 and 24 16 0 65 mg gvss 1 respectively during 133 146 days of reactor operation the pn ps ratio was 3 20 0 11 pn content was more eminent than ps content and was found to be main component of eps responsible for the granule formation 7 liu et al 9 also observed higher pn content during the reformation of aerobic granules pn ps ratio of 3 4 6 2 was reported in a phenol fed aerobic granular reactor 35 which is comparable to this study from the eps value it was concluded that scn was having a convincing impact on granule stability and also provoked the secretion of eps for maintaining granular structure chen et al 17 also observed the higher eps value after the addition of scn in granule based anammox process anammox granules secreted more eps under adverse condition by the addition of scn to maintain the structure and activity of anammox granules 17 eps is supposed to be a sticky substance that keeps the biofilms intact for maintaining its integrity and contains a large number of functional groups such as hydroxyl and negatively charged carboxyl groups due to the presence of these functional groups eps is to be considered as an excellent binding polymer that could bind through many interactions like protein polysaccharide hydrophobic ionic and h bonding etc 11 bacteria are negatively charged which results in electrostatic repulsion between the cells 36 this repulsion must be reduced for the aggregation of bacteria tsuneda et al 37 stated that the eps covering on the surface of cells might reduce the negative surface charge around the cell surface thus contributing to cell adhesion and also observed the lower zeta potential for the intact cells 31 6 mv as compared to washed cells when eps was removed from the cell surface 27 2 mv lee et al 6 also reported that eps altered the surface characteristics of bacterial cells like charge after being accumulated on the surface of the cells therefore more secretion of eps is desirable for the aerobic granulation in the present study aerobic granules also secreted more eps because of toxic scn addition and might have contributed to regaining the structural integrity of granules 3 3 effect of scn on reactor performance the sbr was operated with the constant olr and nlr of 0 80 kg phenol m 3 day 1 2 01 0 28 kg cod m 3 day 1 and 0 20 kg nh4 n m 3 day 1 respectively throughout the study phenol was almost completely biodegraded 99 from the influent phenol concentration of 400 mg l 1 granule disintegration did not show any impact on phenol biodegradation and biodegradation continued throughout the operation irrespective of granule deterioration and reformulation fig 3 a it might be because of the presence of suspended solids in the sbr apart from ags which was supposed to contribute to phenol biodegradation a little reduction was observed in cod removal efficiency from 94 57 day 75 to 90 61 day 92 because of the lower vss 2 36 0 30 g l 1 resulted from the granule break down in sbr during those days once the granules began to reform after the addition of scn vss started to increase fig 1b thus resulting in the 94 97 cod removal efficiency fig 3b the complete mineralization of the phenolic compound was confirmed from the higher cod removal efficiency in an aerobic environment the final product of scn biotransformation is so4 2 and the overall equation for scn biotransformation is given below eq 1 38 1 s c n 3 h 2 o 2 o 2 h c o 3 n h 4 s o 4 2 h complete biotransformation of scn was observed throughout the sbr operation fig 3c scn did not show any adverse effect on granule reformulation up to a concentration of 340 mg l 1 along with around 99 removal efficiency and excellent granular characteristics figs 3c and 1 respectively the presence of sulfate in the reactor confirmed the scn oxidation even though it was not monitored from eq 1 it was clear that scn biotransformation also contributed to the addition of nh4 n to the reactor the removal profile of nh4 n is depicted in fig 4 a nh4 n removal efficiency moved down from 99 day 75 to 67 day 86 from the influent 100 mg l 1 of nh4 n and soon after the addition of 75 mg l 1 of scn the removal efficiency again recovered to 99 95th day onwards fig 4a it means nearly 10 days was taken by nitrifying bacteria to redevelop in the sbr additional nh4 n also generated through the complete biotransformation of scn 0 24 mg of nh4 n generated from 1 mg of scn eq 1 therefore the total influent nitrogen was expressed as eq 2 2 i n f l u e n t n i t r o g e n σ i n f l u e n t n h 4 n 0 24 i n f l u e n t s c n during steady state days 133 146 the total influent nitrogen was around 180 mg l 1 out of which about 80 mg l 1 generated from the biotransformation of 340 mg l 1 of scn therefore around 180 mg l 1 of nh4 n transformed in the present study nitrification is a two step process first conversion of nh4 to no2 nitritation by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and further into no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 39 srt values are very important to achieve complete nitrification effluent no2 n and no3 n followed a different trend during the sbr operation fig 4b on day 75 concentrations of no2 n and no3 n in the effluent were 93 45 and 13 89 mg l 1 respectively from 100 mg l 1 of influent nh4 n the higher amount of effluent no2 n confirmed the nitritation process for attaining complete nitrification srt values should be in the range of 10 30 days 39 on day 75 srt was 9 23 days which was lower than the required value for achieving complete nitrification 10 30 days therefore most of the nh4 n transformed into no2 n after 75 days of sbr operation loss in nitritation efficiency was observed because of the washout of the nitrifiers from the system due to granule disintegration confirmed through the decline in vss value fig 1b resulting in reduced no2 n and no3 n concentrations up to 55 78 and 10 44 mg l 1 respectively day 84 with a shorter srt value of 6 72 days afterward as the granules started to reform after the addition of scn recovery in nitritation efficiency was observed fig 4b no2 n concentration first increased to 91 72 mg l 1 day 95 and further decreased to 59 35 mg l 1 day 104 at scn concentration of 115 mg l 1 with srt value of 10 93 days at the same time no3 n concentration was on its maximum level 71 72 mg l 1 it might be because of 10 93 days srt which was in the range of srt values required for complete nitrification 10 30 days therefore most of nh4 n converted into no3 n as the scn concentration was further increased 240 mg l 1 no2 n concentration increased whereas no3 n and srt values decreased because of the toxicity impart by higher scn 240 mg l 1 on the activity of nob 116th day onwards at 240 mg l 1 of scn days116 126 no2 n concentration was around 159 05 14 59 mg l 1 from influent nh4 n of about 156 mg l 1 calculated from eq 2 whereas no3 n was only 3 98 6 43 mg l 1 with the srt value of 9 71 days during steady state days 133 146 at scn concentration of 340 mg l 1 no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 193 58 3 13 and 1 73 0 16 mg l 1 respectively from the influent nh4 n of about 180 mg l 1 calculated from eq 2 with the srt of 9 56 days during days 133 146 effluent nh4 n was almost negligible 0 10 mg l 1 nitritation efficiency was successfully recovered and was indicated from the higher effluent of no2 n concentration 193 58 3 13 mg l 1 confirming that aob remained unaffected by the higher scn concentration 240 mg l 1 specific nitrification rate snr was also calculated before days 80 84 and after addition of scn days 133 146 scn addition also enhanced the nitrification rate before scn addition snr was 2 35 mg no2 n no3 n gvss 1 h 1 whereas after scn addition snr increased to 3 67 mg no2 n no3 n gvss 1 h 1 for steady state days 133 146 the nitrogen balance profile was observed and given by eq 3 39 the average values for influent nitrogen and effluent nh4 n were about 180 and 0 10 mg l 1 the average nitrogen used for the growth of biomass was calculated by eq 4 39 and was 27 87 mg l 1 3 t h e o r e t i c a l n i t r o g e n o x i d i z e d m g l 1 i n f l u e n t n i t r o g e n m g l 1 e f f l u e n t n h 4 n m g l 1 n i t r o g e n u s e

mg l 1 whereas average actual nitrogen oxidized was 195 31 3 10 mg l 1 σ effluent no2 n no3 n higher effluent nitrogen than the influent was because of the accumulation of oxidized nitrogen no2 n and no3 n from the previous cycles four cycles in a day and also confirmed the absence of the denitrification process li et al 21 observed a slight inhibition on scn removal at a phenol concentration of around 420 mg l 1 in a moving bed biofilm reactor it was also observed that scn and phenol concentrations beyond 200 mg l 1 seemed to inhibit nitrification 40 in the current work no inhibition among the pollutants was observed up to a concentration of 400 180 and 340 mg l 1 for phenol nh4 n and scn respectively from the results it was concluded that not only the addition of scn induced the granule reformulation by provoking the eps secretion but also reformed the granules with better characteristics than the granules formed before disintegration the addition of scn served two purposes one was to reform the granules from the broken one along with the recovery of nitritation efficiency and second was the treatment of wastewater containing scn as well to the author s best knowledge this study is the first study in which broken granules again reformed by the addition of a toxic substance along with the recovery of the nitritation process the possible mechanism of granule reformulation after the addition of scn is illustrated in fig 5 after 75 days of reactor operation granules became unstable and started to deteriorate confirmed by lower vss and eps values of 2 07 g l 1 and 47 44 mg gvss 1 respectively on day 91 after the addition of toxic scn granules might have started to protect themselves against the toxic effect of scn by secreting a gel matrix of eps higher eps values of 101 45 1 06 mg gvss 1 at an scn concentration of 340 mg l 1 during 133 146 days due to which broken granules agglomerated again in the trapping network of eps because of the shear force caused due to the airflow rate the granules which were trapped in the eps gel network attained the regular structure because of getting agglomerated and attaining regular structure again compact and denser granules having lower svi30 and higher gsv of 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 and 57 32 0 96 m h 1 respectively were formed days 133 146 due to this vss in the effluent reduced concluded from the higher srt of 9 56 days and increased in the reactor 4 44 0 09 g l 1 because of the compact granule reformation loss of biomass reduced and aob again developed in the system resulting in the recovery of nitritation efficiency of the system thus the addition of toxic scn induced the granule reformulation process with improved granular characteristics and reactor performance 4 conclusion the impact of scn introduction on the reformulation of the granules from the disintegrated one was evaluated the addition of toxic scn showed a significant effect on the reformation of the granules by triggering the more eps secretion which was supposed to induce the granule agglomeration reformed granules also successfully regained their nitritation efficiency reformed granules were having better characteristics than the granules formed before deterioration granules with larger size 1819 87 43 44 μm better settling behavior svi30 and gsv of 26 31 0 80 ml gtss 1 and 57 32 0 96 m h 1 respectively and higher eps content 101 45 1 06 mg gvss 1 were reformulated up to a concentration of 340 mg l 1 scn did not show any inhibitory effect on characteristics of reformed granules phenol

at higher biocarrier filling ratio 10 v v in scheme 3 the difference in cod removal and biodecolorization rates reflected an improvement of 0 16 and 0 30 hour 1 respectively throughout the anoxic react period however the performance changed insignificantly due to the reduction of hrt the presence of the attached growth biomass system was of great importance although the suspended growth biomass dominated more than 76 of the biomass system in sbmbbr keywords reactive orange 16 sequencing batch reactor moving bed biofilm reactor biodecolorization autoxidation 1 introduction the menace of dye containing wastewater has reached an all time high level due to the increasing trend in the world population 1 therefore considerable attention has been paid to the remediation for the discharge of effluents containing synthetic dyes synthetic dyes are widely used in industries including textile paper leather cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 2 3 amongst these industries textile industry is notorious for its voracious water consumption and large quantity of wastewater discharge has been ranked to be the primary culprit in posing such menace 4 to date the annual textile production has reached almost 800 000 tons 5 an estimation of more than 10 000 different synthetic dyes has been commercialized and applied to the textile industry 6 azo dye is the most widely adopted class of dyes that constitutes more than 70 of the textile production 7 reactive azo dye in particular possesses a broad spectrum of colors high affinity to bind with cellulosic fiber and stable color fastness is the most consumable type of azo dyes 8 9 however the presence of electrophilic vinyl sulfone groups in their molecular structure incurred them to be hydrolyzed easily resulting in weak adsorption or fixation towards the substrates 10 11 consequently an approximate 280 000 tons of textile dyes are released annually leading to a series of environmental and human health issues 12 14 albeit the fact that physicochemical treatments are effective for remediating the dye containing wastewater their implementation in the big scale textile industry still being restricted by their steep investment cost high operation and maintenance costs intensive energy consumption as well as production of hazardous by products 15 18 in contrast a biological treatment that is more environmentally and economically friendly is considered to be the most promising approach in remediating dye containing wastewater 19 20 due to the strong electron withdrawing nature of azo bonds they are easily be cleaved off under an oxygen depleted condition as a result the decolorization is concordant with the formation of aromatic amines which are then being degraded in the aerobic condition 21 therefore the striking arrangement of sequential anaerobic aerobic anoxic aerobic in combating dye containing wastewater was proposed throughout the years 22 25 owing to the ease of operation and the switchable operating layout the sequencing batch reactor sbr has been often reported as a better choice in treating dye containing wastewater 26 27 although the sbr seeded with activated sludge as system could shed light on the improvement of treatment efficiency the drawbacks of poor settling characteristics large footprint requirement limitation in scale up and maintenance unstable performance sensitivity to toxic environment and autoxidation have hindered the exploitation of this bioremediation approach 28 29 to circumvent these drawbacks the incorporation of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr technology into the existing sbr system is paramount importance and imperative moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr technology relies decisively on the biomass that attached to specially designed biocarriers to treat a wide variety of wastewater 30 32 the biocarriers can swim homogenously inside the reactor by the turbulent energy imparted from the mixer anoxic condition and aerator aerobic condition the adjustable filling ratio also safeguards the high biomass concentration and solid retention in the treatment system 33 owing to the presence of an extracellular polymeric substance eps on the biofilm mbbr technology often reflects a stable performance since it is less sensitive to the toxic environment several studies have reported that the presence of eps can reduce the diffusion speed of toxic substances into the deeper biofilm layer due to the increase in mass transfer resistance 34 35 in the light of biofilm stratification the deeper zone of the biofilm possesses an anoxic and anaerobic environment simultaneously despite the aerobic condition is executed 30 accordingly the occurrence of recolorization and autoxidation in the aerobic treatment can be mitigated leading to the complete or partial decomposition of aerobically refractory products 36 as such the features of mbbr technology can be brought to the existing sbr system offsetting the inadequacy of the sbr system while treating with dye containing wastewater 37 38 this study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor sbmbbr system in treating dye containing wastewater thus synthetic wastewater contained a typically mono azo dye i e reactive orange 16 ro16 was treated in a lab scale integrated anoxic aerobic react sbmbbr the main objectives were as follows i to evaluate the performance of sbmbbr pertaining to cod removal and biodecolorization under three experimental design schemes and ii to investigate the effects of dye concentration under stepwise and shock loads approaches i e schemes 1 and 2 respectively as well as the hydraulic retention time coupled with the increase of biocarrier filling ratio scheme 3 to the best of our knowledge this was the first time that mbbr technology was incorporated into an integrated anoxic aerobic react sbr system to treat dye containing wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals monoazo dye c i reactive orange 16 with λmax of 494 nm was procured from sigma aldrich usa and the cod contributed by 1 g of ro16 per liter was estimated as 788 7 mg l 1 unless otherwise specified all chemicals used in this study were

was as follows concentration in mg l 1 sucrose 563 bactopeptone 188 ammonium chloride 172 magnesium sulfate 49 dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 250 iron iii chloride 11 3 and sodium bicarbonate 14 7 after the acclimatization stage the bactopeptone was removed but the trace elements solution remained in the sbmbbr the carbon source i e sucrose was fixed to 500 mg l 1 in this study 2 3 setup of sbmbbr a schematic diagram of the laboratory scale sbmbbr setup is given in fig 1 the bioreactor was a 5 l borosilicate glass made schott bottle duran gls 80 wide neck glass bottle germany the 3 5 l

start up the sbmbbr was inoculated with activated sludge mixed culture that collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant owned by indah water sdn bhd in seksyen 7 40000 shah alam selangor malaysia two diverse sbmbbr elapsed time schedules including schedules a and b with their relative hydraulic retention times hrts i e 33 6 h and 16 8 h respectively were applied in the evaluation as shown in fig s1 supplementary material after two weeks of anoxic aerobic react acclimatization the cod removal efficiency showed oscillated within a range of 97 to 98 and the biocarrier was confirmed covering with biofilm consequently the dye was added to the influent based on experimental design schemes with different operating conditions the overall sbmbbr operating conditions and experimental design schemes were tabulated in table 1 the sbmbbr was operated under an air conditional room with the temperature maintained within 24 to 26 for a total operation period of approximately five months 2 5 sample collection and analytical methods 2 5 1 abiotic decolorization the activated sludge was sterilized at 121 for 20 min under a pressure of 0 0103 mpa in an autoclave hirayama hv 85 japan the autoclaved sludge was added to 250 ml of 100 mg l 1ro16 containing synthetic wastewater the mixture was stirred on a hotplate heidolph mr hei tec germany for 22 h combines the periods of fill and react with a constant mixing speed of 100 rpm under room temperature the uv vis absorption was used as the measurement of abiotic decolorization herein 2 5 2 sbmbbr treatment performance the treatment performance for the sbmbbr was evaluated in terms of effluent cod concentration effluent dye concentration sludge concentration and sludge volume index the samples were collected at the end of both anoxic and aerobic react periods cod assessment was performed according to apha 5220 c closed reflux titrimetric method 39 the remaining dye concentration from the effluents was analyzed through a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer cary 100 agilent technologies usa the value was calculated based on the calibration plots obtained from the integrated area against a series of standard solutions the suspended biomass concentration in sbmbbr was measured as mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss according to the standard method of apha 2540 d total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids apha 2540 e respectively 39 the measurement of the attached growth biomass followed the procedure described by hosseini koupaie et al 36 sludge volume index svi was used to monitor the settle ability of suspended growth biomass and it was conducted according to the procedure stated at apha 2710 d 39 2 5 3 time course profile study time course profile of biodecolorization and cod removal efficiencies from phases 2 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 under sbmbbr were monitored during the last week of evaluation periods for this the hourly samples were collected during react mode with a time interval of every 1 h throughout the react mode as well as the end of fill mode subsequently the collected samples were subjected to the analysis of cod and ro16 concentration as mentioned in section 2 5 2 2 5 4 maximum co substrate uptake the percentage of co substrate i e sucrose uptake with respect to its cod value in each phase was calculated based on the data obtained from the time course profile including the efficiencies of biodecolorization and cod removal the one with the highest percentage value throughout 21 h of react period at time t was selected as the maximum co substrate uptake for that particular phase eq 1 was used to calculate the percentage of sucrose uptake for the biomass in each phase 1 m a x i m u m c o s u b s t r a t e u

quantity of cod mg and ro16 molecules mg were removed from the sbmbbr system the obtained values were then divided by the total biomass mlvss in that particular phase they can be expressed by eqs 2

ftir spectrometer nicolet is10 thermo fisher scientific usa equipped with an attenuated total reflectance atr sampling accessory the spectra were collected at the resolution of 4 cm 1 and with average scans of 64 from 4000 to 500 cm 1 prior to this testing the refrigerant dehumidifier was turned on so as to prevent the excess absorption of moisture from the environment towards the dried biofilm 3 results and discussion the experiment pertaining to three discrete schemes including the effects of dye concentration under stepwise and shock loads approaches i e schemes 1 and 2 respectively as well as the hydraulic retention time coupled with the increase of biocarrier filling ratio scheme 3 was carried out over a period of 132 days from phase 1 10 but only the details of phases 2 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 were further taken into discussion herein since phases 1 3 and 5 were the transient periods under scheme 1 table 2 summarises the overall treatment performance regarding cod removal and ro16 biodecolorization of an integrated anoxic aerobic react sbmbbr while a time series graph regarding the end treatment performance of cod removal and ro16 biodecolorization were depicted in fig 2 the microbial strengths in removing ro16 and cod as well as the maximum co substrate i e sucrose uptake for each phase were also documented in table 3 lastly the data obtained from tables 2 and 3 were interpreted in conjunction with the time series graphs derived from fig 2 viz fig 3 cod removal and fig 4 ro16 biodecolorization as shown in sections 3 2 and 3 3 respectively laying down the foundation for the following discussion 3 1 mechanism of biodecolorization in sbmbbr the mechanism of biodecolorization in the sbmbbr system was functioned on accounts of two subsets viz abiotic adsorption biosorption and biotic biochemical reaction biodegradation in biosorption a very low ro16 biodecolorization efficiency with up to 14 was attained the results revealed a truth that biosorption was not the crucial key in mitigating the ro16 concentration herein in addition uv vis spectral scan as shown in fig s2 affirmed that the biodecolorization in this study was chiefly ascribed to biodegradation whereby the characteristic peaks of ro16 at the wavelength of 388 nm and 494 nm λ m a x were dwindled continuously along with the reaction time this observation was concomitant with the pronounced increasing peak at 264 nm indicating the breakdown of azo bonds was mainly due to enzymatic reaction 3 2 cod removal 3 2 1 scheme 1 the effect of dye concentration stepwise approach fig 3a shows the cod removal efficiency fluctuated within a range of 94 to 100 over an evaluation period of 62 days a dramatic decrease in cod removal efficiency could be seen from phases 1 3 5 and the early part first week of phases 2 4 and 6 this observation implied that the sbmbbr system was susceptible to the gradual increase of ro16 loadings which was 10 mg l 1 day 1 throughout phases 1 3 and 5 although the falling trend was prolonged to the early of the phases 2 4 and 6 it was taken off sharply in the following week this revealed that the non acclimatized activated sludge required much time for the microorganisms to recognize ro16 molecules since it is a xenobiotic compound 40 once the acclimatization of certain ro16 concentrations was accomplished the cod removal efficiency showed greater than that of transition periods table 2 unveils that more than 97 of cod removal efficiency was attained in phases 2 4 and 6 the reduction of cod was equivalent to a concentration removal mg l 1 of 644 18 668 62 and 709 16 at phases 2 4 and 6 respectively as reported in table 3 three plausible explanations for such excellent cod abatement could be recapitulated herein i the fraction of codro16 to codtotal were tiny under scheme 1 the stepwise approach provided an adequate time frame for the acclimatization of the sbmbbr system 41 this was evidenced by the improvement of the microbial strength in removing cod from 0 0677 to 0 0711 mg cod mg biomass from phase 2 to phase 6 as demonstrated in table 3 ii the involvement of 500 mg l 1 sucrose in the biodegradation providing the biomass with an accessible substrate for metabolism purpose table 3 discloses a complete consumption of co substrate under this scheme this was interrelated to the rise in the aforesaid microbial strength mg cod mg biomass solís et al 42 emphasized that the involvement of co substrate not only helps in maintaining the vitality of microorganisms but also assisting in biodecolorization the majority of cod reduction occurred during the fill period as shown in fig 5 a this was ascribed to the reason that sucrose was rapidly reduced in the fill period by serving as an electron donor and carbon source 43 iii the aromatic intermediate formed from the anoxic react period was degraded in the aerobic react period as illustrated in fig 6 a the degradation of an aromatic intermediate during the aerobic reaction period was congruent with the observations from jonstrup et al 44 and ong et al 45 3 2 2 scheme 2 the effect of dye concentration shock loads approach fig 3b portrays that the cod removal efficiency dropped sharply after the first second and third ro16 shocks i e 300 mg l 1 600 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 with the codro16 codtotal ratio of 28 44 and 56 respectively were imposed into sbmbbr system a significant decline in the cod removal efficiency was noticed during the early part first week of phases 7 8 and 9 the falling trends could be ascribed to the substrate inhibition exerted by the toxicity of ro16 molecules under the sudden ro16 shocks due to the immaturity of enzymatic system 46 48 fortunately the cod removal efficiency improved progressively and attained an average value of 50 54 48 97 and 38 69 in the following week second week of phases 7 8 and 9 respectively as shown in table 2 therefore the instability on the cod removal efficiency signified that there was a need for an adaptation period so as to the sbmbbr system could contend with the ro16 shocks 49 in comparison to phase 6 a difference of 46 83 in cod removal efficiency was heeded in the first ro16 shock this was equivalent to a disparity of 281 27 mg l 1 cod removal concentration as shown in table 3 table 3 also reveals that the microbial strength mg cod mg biomass was declined from 0 0711 to 0 0426 since there was no deterioration on the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency but amelioration of 10 was observed as reported in section 3 3 2 the decline in the microbial strength mg cod mg biomass did not pose any negative impact to the sbmbbr system this was supported by the increment of biomass concentration in phase 7 as compared to phase 6 as discussed in section 3 5 similarly fig 5b displays that the primary cod removal with more than 60 was attained at the end of fill period subsequently the anoxic react period only attributed approximately 10 of cod removal efficiency thereafter it showed decreasing during the aerobic react period furthermore the aromatic intermediate resulted from the biodegradation of ro16 was further degraded in the aerobic react period as illustrated in fig 6b the observation in phase 7 was likely associated with natural selection indeed the microbial consortia which were unable to survive under 300 mg l 1 ro16 containing wastewater were flushed out while those which were able to produce or secrete the effective working enzymes were screened out and proliferated in the sbmbbr system 50 51 consequently the effective working enzymes could be secreted adequately thereby utilizing ro16 molecules as the primary carbon and energy substrate this was also supported by an extent of 80 co substrate uptake as compared to 100 in the previous phases as documented in table 3 the loser of natural selection underwent disintegration on their structural configuration causing the occurrence of cell lysis in the system the consequence of cell lysis could result in the releasing of some macromolecules including proteins dna rna and so on those macromolecules possess a backbone of carbohydrate explaining why there was a built up of cod herein during the aerobic react period 52 in spite of the cod removal efficiency dropped to 39 26 during the first week of phase 8 as illustrated in fig 3b the corresponding cod removal concentration i e 425 27 mg l 1 was still better than that of 368 11 mg l 1 as obtained from the last day of phase 7 this improvement was stemmed from the fact that the effective microbial consortia have standing out and proliferated due to the natural selection previously therefore the environment containing a high amount of ro16 molecules could favor the growth of the biomass since they exhibited a positive capability in degrading ro16 molecules however the enzymatic system in the sbmbbr was still suppressed by the toxicity from the second ro16 shocks as a result the disturbance in microbial syntrophy was speculated whereby the enzymes for breaking down the co substrate was induced again 49 it was evidenced by the increase in the maximum co substrate uptake from 80 in phase 7 86 in phase 8 as shown in table 3 this remark was also in agreement with the rise in the microbial strength from 0 0426 to 0 0454 mg cod mg biomass as documented in table 3 consequently the effective working enzymes could work well in the sbmbbr system along with the adequate electrons donated from the breakdown of co substrate mitigating the toxicity exerted by the ro16 molecules eventually table 3 reveals that the cod removal concentration mg l 1 was improved to 530 45 from 427 88 in phase 7 likewise fig 5b illustrates that the principal cod reduction occurred in the fill period a trifling variation on cod removal efficiency was observed during the anoxic react period the concentration of resulted aromatic intermediate was abated under the aerobic react period as evidenced from fig 6c however the ability of sbmbbr in degrading the aromatic intermediate started to become slower pandey et al 53 and hosseini koupaie et al 36 reported that those aromatic intermediates were more toxic than the parent dyes therefore it could adversely affect the mineralization of aromatic intermediate in the last ro16 shock the sbmbbr system was capable of removing a cod concentration of 541 2 mg l 1 in phase 9 as compared to 530 45 mg l 1 in phase 8 despite the cod removal efficiency of the latter was higher i e 48 97 a transformation on the enzymatic system was believed to occur after the acclimatization of 1000 mg l 1 ro16 shock for one week indeed more effective microbial consortia in removing ro16 molecules were formed in phase 9 since the sbmbbr system was able to remove more ro16 molecules as evidenced in section 3 3 2 without a high consumption on co substrate table 3 unveils that the maximum co substrate uptake was only 69 in addition the microbial strength showed almost akin to the value reported in phase 8 i e 0 0452 mg cod mg biomass solís et al 42 stated that microorganisms could acclimatize under extreme conditions i e the presence of ro16 molecules herein by inducing more powerful enzymatic activity the authors also added that if the microorganisms have been acclimatized successively to dye molecules the cut down on co substrate uptake could be noticed fig 5b highlights that only 30 of cod removal efficiency was attained at the end of the fill period subsequently the integrated anoxic aerobic react did not contribute much to the cod reduction only approximately 10 of cod removal efficiency was attained throughout 21 h of reaction time no improvement in the performance of cod removal but deterioration was observed under the aerobic react period as depicted in fig 6c there were two plausible reasons which could explain this observation i it was speculated that the absorbed aromatic intermediates in the microbial cell were flushed out by a special efflux pump indeed several studies have reported that aromatic intermediates are more toxic than parent dyes 54 55 to reduce the concentration of a toxic substance in the cellular membrane a survival mechanism via the efflux pump was triggered 49 ii it was due to the occurrence of autoxidation in fact there is a propensity for the resulted aromatic intermediated to be auto oxidized under the presence of oxygen 56 consequently this will lead to a formation of more complex and aerobically recalcitrant products leading to the build up of cod 57 da silva et al 58 and mata et al 26 mentioned that the auto oxidized aromatic intermediate would form a colored oligomeric structure under an oxygen rich environment via free radical reactions the findings in section 3 3 2 have supported the statement in fact the actively metabolic system comprising a series of natural selection disturbance in syntrophy as well as the transformation of the enzymatic system under three ro16 shocks was safeguarded by the attached growth biomass system in sbmbbr in addition the attached growth biomass possessed a critical role in offsetting the incoming ro16 containing wastewater especially during the fill period since it constituted 12 to 24 of the total biomass in this study indeed the pulse feed of the incoming ro16 containing wastewater was first received and degraded by the biofilm on the biocarrier since suspended growth biomass was settled below the biocarriers accordingly it helped to alleviate the toxicity exerted from the shock ro16 molecules favoring biodegradation on the suspended growth biomass system bassin et al 59 reported that suspended growth biomass is sometimes susceptible to high organic loading in contrast attached growth biomass system contained a dense protective layer i e extracellular polymeric substance eps which has been reported to be capable of resisting inhibitory or noxious effects from the toxic compounds such as ro16 molecules herein 35 60 venkata mohan et al 61 pointed out that the attached growth biomass system could act as a buffer to reduce the concentration of toxic and recalcitrant chemicals thereby alleviating the stress suffered by the suspended growth biomass system as a result the attached growth biomass system did shed some light on ro16 biodegradation especially under scheme 2 3 2 3 scheme 3 the effect of hydraulic retention time coupled with the increase of biocarrier filling ratio fig 3c displays a slight exacerbation on the cod removal efficiency after the hrt was reduced to 16 8 h although the biocarrier filling ratio was increased to 10 v v however it was believed that the rising trend observed in the last week of phase 10 was attributed to the biomass augmentation from the extra 5 biocarrier the growth of biofilm required much time especially in a short hrt system 62 as shown in table 2 the cod removal efficiency became worse and showed 36 27 as compared to 38 69 in phase 9 several studies have been reported that a low cod removal efficiency was always accompanied by a reduction in hrt 44 63 64 this could be due to the inadequate time for the microorganisms to degrade more organic substances such as both ro16 molecules and co substrate herein 43 subsequently the microbial strength in removing cod in terms of mg cod mg biomass in phase 10 dropped to 0 036 as compared to 0 0452 at phase 9 as tabulated in table 3 in the aspect of time course profile especially during the anoxic react period the cod removal rate hour 1 in phase 10 was higher i e 0 565 than that of 0 408 from phase 9 as shown in fig 5c this was equivalent to a difference of 0 16 hour 1 a remarkable inefficiency on the cod removal was noticed during the aerobic react period suggesting the occurrence of cell lysis was reencountered in phase 10 owing to the reduction in the anoxic react period most of the microorganisms in the sbmbbr system were speculated could not acclimatize to the shorter hrt leading to the disintegration of the microbial structure this explained why there was a built up of cod fig 6d shows that the aromatic intermediate formed from the breakdown of azo linkages during the anoxic react period was slightly removed in the subsequent aerobic react period indicating partial mineralization was achieved herein 3 3 ro16 biodecolorization 3 3 1 scheme 1 the effect of dye concentration stepwise approach the performance of ro16 biodecolorization was irresistibly excellent i e 100 removal efficiency was achieved over 62 days stepwise ro16 loading regardless of any initial concentration values as shown in fig 4a and table 2 yu et al 65 mentioned that a start up period of 3 7 months is necessary for the acclimatization to decolorize azo containing wastewater completely instead this study showed that a complete biodecolorization with ro16 concentration of 150 mg l 1 was achieved in a shorter acclimatization period i e 50 days with the biofilm attachment on the biocarrier a high metabolic potential could be induced 61 in turn it shortened the acclimatization period the complete removal of ro16 molecules was in accordance with the improvement of the microbial strength in removing ro16 molecules from 0 005 to 0 015 mg ro16 mg biomass as shown in table 3 the excellent biodecolorization herein had outcompeted those reported from the current bioreactor configurations 44 66 67 the outstanding biodecolorization herein could be ascribed to i the mixed culture involved ii the presence of co substrate iii the experimental design and iv the ro16 molecular structure in comparison with pure culture a mixed culture is capable of achieving a higher degree of biodegradation and mineralization as it involves a wide spectrum of microbial consortia while exposing to a new environment synergistic metabolic activities speed up the communication between each microbial consortium 68 the presence of co substrate i e sucrose was essential for the reductive cleavage of azo linkages on the ro16 molecules with the assistance of certain enzymes indeed the cleavage of azo linkages is associated with the transfer of four electrons reducing equivalents in which two pairs of electrons from the metabolism of co substrate electron donor are transferred to azo dye molecule electron acceptor each stage resulting in the breakdown of azo linkages and hence colorless aromatic intermediates were formed 69 karim et al 8 stated the involvement of co substrate in microbial degradation of dyes not only boosts up the ability of dye degradation but also shortens the reaction time besides the stepwise increment of ro16 concentration also played a pivotal role in giving excellent biodecolorization singh et al 70 and dafale et al 71 declared that an adequate adaption is needed for the microbial community under the exposure of toxic or recalcitrant compounds it could provide a sufficient transient period for the improvement of the biodecolorization rate besides the decolorization efficiency is directly proportional to the number of azo bonds present in the dye molecule 72 73 a mono azo dye i e ro16 which consists of only one azo bond on its molecular structure therefore exhibited high biodegradability with the presence of sulfonated group at para position of an azo bond as well as hydroxyl group at the 2 position of its naphthol ring the efficiency of ro16 biodecolorization was further reinforced to a higher degree 24 the time course profile from fig 7 a unveiled that a ro16 concentration of 50 mg l 1 could be fully decolorized within an anoxic react period of 7 h in phase 2 while the time required to attain a complete biodecolorization of ro16 was further prolonged to aerobic react period viz 19th and 18th hour in phases 4 and 6 respectively a noticeable extent of ro16 biodecolorization with approximate 10 occurred under the aerobic phase in both phases 4 and 6 the anoxic and anaerobic zone within the inner biofilm stratification under the aerobic react period could be a putative reason in contributing the biodecolorization herein 67 74 3 3 2 scheme 2 the effect of dye concentration shock loads approach a complete biodecolorization was undermined after successive ro16 shocks viz 300 mg l 1 in phase 7 600 mg l 1 in phase 8 and 1000 mg l 1 in phase 10 were imposed on the sbmbbr system as shown in fig 4b the efficiency of ro16 biodecolorization shown inferior to that of reflected from the previous ro16 shock along with the evaluation of scheme 2 in the first ro16 shock there was a marginal decrease in ro16 biodecolorization efficiency dropping from 100 phase 6 to 89 44 phase 7 with a difference of approximately 10 as reported in table 2 subsequently the performance of ro16 biodecolorization was severely affected by the second and last ro16 shocks resulting in an average biodecolorization efficiency of 58 04 and 36 33 respectively as documented in table 2 it was evident that the descending trend in the first evaluation week of phases 7 8 and 9 was replaced by an ascending trend in the following week as shown in fig 4b the decline in the first evaluation week was likely caused by the substrate inhibition exerted by the substantial amount of ro16 molecules which was suddenly introduced into the sbmbbr system without adequate acclimatization el bouraie and el din 2016 48 eventually the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency in phases 7 8 and 9 corresponded to a ro16 concentration removal of 268 32 348 24 and 363 30 mg l 1 respectively in the first ro16 shock the microbial strength in removing ro16 molecules was ameliorated to 0 0261 as compared to 0 015 mg ro16 mg biomass in phase 6 as unveiled in table 3 accordingly an approximate 670 8 mg of ro16 molecules were able to be decolorized in phase 7 moreover the maximum co substrate uptake was diminished to 80 as compared to 100 in the previous phases the findings affirmed that the sbmbbr system was accredited to possess the positive ability in withstanding the first ro16 concentration shock of 300 mg l 1 indeed the prevailing enzymatic system demonstrated that the effective working enzymes in confronting the ro16 molecules had been produced or secreted effectively as a result of the natural selection and proliferation of microbial consortia throughout the acclimatization as described in section 3 2 2 it was evidenced by the time course profile as shown in fig 7b in which the sbmbbr system was capable of removing half of the inlet ro16 concentration i e approximately 55 at the end of the fill period while it was only 45 at the end of fill period under phase 6 while comparing the biodecolorization between anoxic and aerobic periods not much difference was observed this finding was in agreement with previous works whereby no much change on the biodecolorization efficiency in the aerobic period 43 75 the instability of performance in phase 8 heralded the possible disturbance in syntrophy in the sbmbbr system 49 there were two groups of microbial consortia living in the system viz ro16 degrading and co substrate degrading microbial consortia owing to the inhibition effect exerted from the 600 mg l 1 ro16 shock the microbial consortia in degrading the ro16 molecules required many electrons from the electron donor i e sucrose to break down the azo linkage possessed by ro16 molecules therefore the enzymes for breaking down the co substrate were induced again herein as described in section 3 2 2 in comparison to phase 7 the microbial strength was improved to 0 0298 from 0 0267 mg ro16 mg biomass which indicated an extra 200 mg of ro16 molecules was able to be decolorized as shown in table 3 in the aspect of time course profile the anoxic and aerobic react periods showed an approximate 40 in biodecolorization while only around 20 biodecolorization efficiency was achieved during the fill period as illustrated in fig 7b again biodecolorization efficiency between anoxic and aerobic periods shown not much improvement in the course of last ro16 shock the microbial strength in decolorizing ro16 molecules was improved slightly to 0 0304 from 0 0298 mg ro16 mg biomass as compared to phase 8 as shown in table 3 this improvement was concomitant with an extra biodecolorization of 10 71 mg ro16 molecules moreover the maximum co substrate uptake was reduced to 69 in phase 9 this was inferred that a new enzymatic system had been evolved i e co substrate independent enzymatic system during phase 9 as mentioned in section 3 2 2 fig 7b illustrates that biodecolorization mainly happened in the fill and anoxic react periods a noticeable decline was observed during the aerobic react period suggesting a thorny problem i e autoxidation was suspected to be encountered in this phase jonstrup et al 44 stated that recolorization is a rapid process and it has resulted from the autoxidation they added that the products spontaneously cross react with each other forming polymeric structures which are more recalcitrant in undergoing degradation aerobically the decrement on biodecolorization under the aerobic react period could also be explained by the consequence of the efflux pump 49 these observations verified the occurrence of autoxidation and the surviving mechanism of the efflux pump as described in section 3 2 2 3 the ro16 shocks were not found to be exacerbated to the enzymatic system in the purposed sbmbbr system henceforth it could be concluded that the purposed sbmbbr system was capable of contending high ro16 shocks the attached growth biomass system was believed to be paramount importance and eligible in remediating the refractory pollutants and organic shock loads 52 76 77 furthermore the biofilm attachment on the biocarrier was able to transform an organic or toxic pollutant much faster as compared to suspended flocs 78 naresh kumar et al 79 compared the biodecolorization between biofilm and activated sludge systems under a successive of acid black 10b shocks they discovered that the biodecolorization in biofilm system was better than that of reflected from the conventional activated sludge system they also pointed out that such the high stability and biodecolorization in biofilm system was due to the high metabolic potential of biofilm operation as a result of high biomass retention capability thus the protruding difference between two distinct biomass systems providing support for the contribution of the attached growth biomass system herein koçyiğit and ugurlu 80 mentioned that no adverse effect but an improvement was observed in color removal at varying shock loads despite the cod removal efficiency become lower again this could be attributed to the presence of the attached growth biomass system in the sbmbbr the detailed was also elucidated in section 3 2 2 3 3 3 scheme 3 the effect of hydraulic retention time coupled with the increase of biocarrier filling ratio the performance of ro16 reduction showed fluctuating after the hrt was reduced to 16 8 h as plotted in fig 4c the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency reflected a declining trend during the last week of the evaluation period indicating the inability of the sbmbbr system in degrading a total mass of 5000 mg two cyclic loadings of ro16 molecules per day table 2 reports the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency dropped to 26 82 accounting for 670 5 mg of ro16 molecules was decolorized at the end of a cyclic treatment a deterioration of approximately 10 was accounted in phase 10 in comparison to phase 9 despite the inlet ro16 concentration was the same in short hrt the biomass systems had insufficient time to expose to the ro16 molecules and therefore the probability of decomposition decreased 81 accordingly the microbial strength decreased to 0 0191 from 0 0304 mg ro16 mg biomass at phase 9 as shown in table 3 fig 7c manifests that the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency in phase 10 showed higher than that of phase 9 within the first 10 h as a result of a faster biodecolorization rate indeed an hourly removal percentage hour 1 difference of 0 3 was calculated based on the values obtained from phases 9 and 10 i e 1 249 and 1 551 respectively during the anoxic react period this could be concluded that the 10 biocarrier filling ratio did shed light on the ro16 reduction with the incorporation of an extra 5 v v biocarrier filling ratio the amount of biofilm attachment was augmented since the attached growth biomass was responsible for the ro16 molecules reduction therefore the treatment efficiency was promoted 59 however the reduction of hrt was the main factor causing the deterioration herein al amrani et al 24 studied the effect of time ratio of operating periods in a cycle towards decolorization they concluded that longer anoxic time is preferable for the biodecolorization whereby the decolorization of acid orange7 could attain 80 when an extra 10 h was added to the anoxic reaction time koçyiğit and ugurlu 80 mentioned that a longer anaerobic contact time could improve dye removal efficiency 3 4 uv vis spectral analysis the uv vis spectra from the beginning and the end of each scheme were depicted in fig 8 b f in comparison to the control ro16 spectrum in fig 8a two of the ro16 characteristic peaks in the visible region i e λmax at 492 nm and 388 nm under scheme 1 diminished significantly with respect to time whilst one of the new peak intermediate peak kept accumulating nearby the ro16 characteristic peak of 250 nm i e benzene ring in the uv region as portrayed in fig 8b and c the intermediate peak in the uv region was further cut down during the aerobic treatment the disappearance of absorbance peaks in visible region signified a complete cleavage of the azo bond was attained 82 notably the ro16 biodecolorization showed a certain extent of improvement under the aerobic react period as evidenced by fig 8b and c besides the structure of the naphthalene ring i e λmax at 290 nm was removed entirely in scheme 1 in scheme 2 the uv spectrum obtained from fig 8d also demonstrated a significant decrease in the absorbance peaks under visible region but not complete removal fig 8d also illustrates that the intermediate peak in the uv region received destruction during the aerobic treatment the blunt shape in the uv region of fig 8d was because of non diluted samples were used however the decrement of the absorbance peaks in fig 8e showed insignificantly moreover a contrasting trend was observed in which the aerobic spectrum showed a reappearance of naphthalene ring structure at the peak of 290 nm meanwhile the peak at 492 nm increased to a certain extent higher than that of the anoxic spectrum the remarkable phenomenon could be due to the occurrence of autoxidation the observation herein has been confirmed in sections 3 2 2 and 3 3 2 in scheme 2 the end products shown possessing the characteristic peaks of 260 nm this peak was found associated with the presence of oxidized aromatic compounds in particular a phenolic compound i e diketones 83 in scheme 3 there is no much difference between the anoxic and aerobic spectra as shown in fig 8e the problem of autoxidation has been mitigated in this phase henceforth the initial stage of the ro16 biodegradation was deemed to be the breakdown of azo dye chromophore structures as evidenced by the diminishment of ro16 maximum absorption in visible wavelength region this was concomitant with the reflection of a lighter orange or colorless appearance subsequently the resulted intermediate underwent mineralization in the aerobic treatment this was tallied with the reduction on the intermediate peak while comparing anoxic and aerobic spectra however partial mineralization was attained throughout this study 3 5 biomass distribution weight and sludge volume index svi fig 9 demonstrates that the suspended growth biomass overtopped the attached growth biomass utterly in the sbmbbr indeed the suspended growth biomass dominated more than 76 of the total biomass throughout the evaluation conversely gu et al 35 revealed that attached growth biomass was the dominant biomass system in treating coking wastewater under the application of mbbr technology the less dominance of attached growth biomass herein could be attributed to i 1 l of activated sludge was inoculated into sbmbbr ii the suspended biomass possesses more porous floc structure than attached biofilm which might uptake much of the co substrate and ro16 molecules along with the reducing agents required for the breakdown of azo bonds 84 iii a more effective microbial consortia in degrading ro16 molecules and intermediates are abundant in suspended growth system iv the stepwise increment approach in scheme 1 provided suspended growth biomass an adequate acclimatization in withstanding the severe dye containing environment 41 fig 9 depicts the trend of the total biomass showed falling in the early of scheme 1 and then steadily ascending to approximate 25 g in phases 6 and 7 29 g in phases 8 and 9 and eventually 35 19 g in phase 10 a similar trend was observed on the suspended biomass system since it accounted for more than 76 of the total biomass in the sbmbbr in addition it decreased to 18 19 g at phase 4 from 21 7 g at acclimatization after the ro16 molecules were introduced into the sbmbbr however this descending trend was replaced by an increasing trend since phase 6 onwards till phase 10 this was equivalent to an increment of 5 83 g of suspended growth biomass on the other hand the attached growth biomass showed slightly fluctuated over the evaluation periods with the incorporation of 5 v v biocarrier filling ratio the attached growth biomass from schemes 1 and 2 showed fluctuating within 2 9 g 4 90 g but it was increased to more than 1 8 folds i e 8 61 g in scheme 3 after the quantity of extra 5 v v biocarrier were added into sbmbbr in scheme 1 the loss of biomass in two biomass systems was probably ascribed to substrate inhibition since the microorganisms were not fully acclimatized to 100 mg l 1 ro16 molecules under phase 4 46 48 in the light of a stepwise feeding strategy adopted in scheme 1 the suspended growth biomass system displayed a positive increment throughout scheme 2 this could be attributed to the high substrate concentration involved in sbmbbr as well as an adapted enzymatic system had been evolved indeed high substrate concentration could enhance the metabolism of microorganisms if enzymatic system reflects a positive ability in degrading ro16 molecules and the relative intermediate in turn microorganisms could proliferate faster resulting in high total biomass concentration in this study suspended growth biomass reflected a good settle ability since the svi values from 3 experimental design schemes were found within a preferable range of 120 ml g 1 as shown in fig 9 therefore high biomass retention in the sbmbbr was ensured this explained why the suspended growth biomass increased significantly under the sbmbbr 85 the highest svi value was attained during the acclimatization i e 107 69 ml g 1 however the svi values dropped gradually from 105 8 46 39 ml g 1 during the evaluation of scheme 1 and scheme 2 subsequently a slight increment on svi value was noticed in scheme 3 indeed the excellent settle ability herein was inferred due to the increase of sludge compactness as a result of microbial acclimatization 86 however the presence of pinpoint floc was speculated to be involved in scheme 2 and scheme 3 since the svi values were less than 75 ml g 1 consequently a cloudy appearance was observed in the supernatant above the settled blanket 52 87 the formation of pinpoint floc could be caused by i the toxicity exerted by ro16 molecules and their intermediates during the course of shock loads ii the floc disintegration as a result of natural selection and starvation of microorganisms iii the reduction in hrt in scheme 3 88 notably the sudden rise in svi value in sbmbbr was caused by the increase in the total biomass concentration as a result of two operating cycles applied per day 89 apart from this reason the increase in the shear stress due to the 10 v v biocarrier filling ratio delayed the formation of compressed and settleable sludge flocs causing the increase in svi value 36 3 6 extracellular polymeric substance eps fig 10 shows the presence of several intense frequency peaks on the five segregated regions ranging from i to v which were found to be related to the stretching and bending vibrations possessed by eps macromolecules comprising polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids 90 thus this observation substantiated the existence of eps under the entire sbmbbr evaluation period the spectral region v showed a relatively more intense peak 1021 cm 1 1023 cm 1 in the spectrum indicating the characteristics of polysaccharides c h trans which is the carbohydrate like backbone for the eps 91 the observation was in line with the composition of polysaccharides reported in the eps constitution interrelatedly the broader peak appeared at 3269 cm 1 to 3272 cm 1 on the spectral region i was ascribed to the stretching vibration of the o h bond this evidenced that the abundance of hydroxyl groups presented in the carbohydrate backbone of eps as well as the possibility of residual moisture content in the sample 92 93 furthermore the two peaks displayed in spectral region iii which were ascribed to c o stretching vibration of amine i 1628 cm 1 to 1636 cm 1 and n h bending vibration of amine ii 1534 cm 1 to 1541 cm 1 respectively these two peaks are unique and they are an essential testimony of protein secondary structure in eps 94 95 the bands of 2852 cm 1 and 2953 cm 1 in spectral region ii correspond to c h stretching vibrations of lipids in the eps as it was allocated within the domain 2850 cm 1 to 2970 cm 1 92 96 lastly the less intense peak of 1238 cm 1 to 1254 cm 1 in spectral region iv was due to the presence of nucleic acid in the eps 91 4 conclusions mbbr technology was hitherto incorporated into an integrated anoxic aerobic react sbr system which had paved a new way for the treatment of dye containing wastewater the primary outcome derived from three experimental design schemes can be summarized into scheme 1 in the early acclimatization the dependence of co substrate was inevitable for ro16 biodegradation since it functioned as an electron donor for the whole process more than 97 cod removal efficiency and a complete biodecolorization were attained under this scheme a threefold improvement of microbial strength in removing ro16 molecules was noticed i e from 0 005 to 0 015 mg ro16 mg biomass this was congruent with the improvement of microbial strength in terms of mg cod mg biomass i e from 0 0677 to 0 0711 no autoxidation was encountered scheme 2 a discernible decline in cod and ro16 removal efficiencies i e both cod and ro16 removals were deteriorated to approximate 40 at the end of this scheme the decrease in cod removal was in agreement with the decline in microbial strength mg cod mg biomass from 0 071 in phase 6 to 0 0452 in phase 9 as a result of the reduction on maximum co substrate uptake from 100 to 69 however the microbial strength in removing ro16 molecules was doubled up to 0 0304 mg ro16 mg biomass as compared to 0 015 in phase 6 the presence of the eps on the biofilm shielded the attached growth biomass system from the toxicity exerted by ro16 shocks henceforth the attached growth biomass system provided advantages for the suspended growth biomass systems and safeguarded the actively metabolic potential under this scheme a labile extent of autoxidation was encountered in phase 9 scheme 3 the treatment performance on cod and ro16 removals were further undermined to approximate 36 and 27 respectively under this scheme the falls on both cod and ro16 removal efficiencies were concomitant with the impairment of microbial strength in removing cod and ro16 molecules in which it dropped from 0 0452 to 0 036 mg cod mg biomass and 0 0304 to 0 0191 mg ro16 mg biomass respectively the short hrt was the main reason for the deterioration herein despite the 10 v v biocarrier filling ratio did show amelioration on treatment efficiencies nonetheless the previous autoxidation was eliminated in phase 10 the results of the study demonstrate that the integrated anoxic aerobic react sbmbbr system is suitable for the treatment of ro16 containing wastewater with up to 300 mg l 1 the sbmbbr system was also proven to be capable of contending ro16 shocks however a higher biocarrier filling ratio longer cyclic reaction time and post treatment are required in order to achieve better performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

13957,this study dealt with the biodegradation of reactive orange 16 ro16 containing wastewater via a novel integrated anoxic aerobic react sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor sbmbbr the chemical oxygen demand cod removal and biodecolorization from three design schemes pertinent to the effects of i dye concentration under stepwise approach scheme 1 ii dye concentration under shock load approach scheme 2 and iii hydraulic retention time hrt coupled with the increase of biocarrier filling ratio scheme 3 were evaluated orderly along the evaluation a complete biodecolorization and over 97 of cod removal were attained in scheme 1 although both cod removal and biodecolorization in scheme 2 was deteriorated to approximate 40 by successive ro16 shocks the microbial strength in removing ro16 molecules mg ro16 mg biomass reflected a two fold amelioration from 0 015 to 0 0304 as the result of actively metabolic system the maximum co substrate uptake also reduced from 100 to 69 at higher biocarrier filling ratio 10 v v in scheme 3 the difference in cod removal and biodecolorization rates reflected an improvement of 0 16 and 0 30 hour 1 respectively throughout the anoxic react period however the performance changed insignificantly due to the reduction of hrt the presence of the attached growth biomass system was of great importance although the suspended growth biomass dominated more than 76 of the biomass system in sbmbbr keywords reactive orange 16 sequencing batch reactor moving bed biofilm reactor biodecolorization autoxidation 1 introduction the menace of dye containing wastewater has reached an all time high level due to the increasing trend in the world population 1 therefore considerable attention has been paid to the remediation for the discharge of effluents containing synthetic dyes synthetic dyes are widely used in industries including textile paper leather cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 2 3 amongst these industries textile industry is notorious for its voracious water consumption and large quantity of wastewater discharge has been ranked to be the primary culprit in posing such menace 4 to date the annual textile production has reached almost 800 000 tons 5 an estimation of more than 10 000 different synthetic dyes has been commercialized and applied to the textile industry 6 azo dye is the most widely adopted class of dyes that constitutes more than 70 of the textile production 7 reactive azo dye in particular possesses a broad spectrum of colors high affinity to bind with cellulosic fiber and stable color fastness is the most consumable type of azo dyes 8 9 however the presence of electrophilic vinyl sulfone groups in their molecular structure incurred them to be hydrolyzed easily resulting in weak adsorption or fixation towards the substrates 10 11 consequently an approximate 280 000 tons of textile dyes are released annually leading to a series of environmental and human health issues 12 14 albeit the fact that physicochemical treatments are effective for remediating the dye containing wastewater their implementation in the big scale textile industry still being restricted by their steep investment cost high operation and maintenance costs intensive energy consumption as well as production of hazardous by products 15 18 in contrast a biological treatment that is more environmentally and economically friendly is considered to be the most promising approach in remediating dye containing wastewater 19 20 due to the strong electron withdrawing nature of azo bonds they are easily be cleaved off under an oxygen depleted condition as a result the decolorization is concordant with the formation of aromatic amines which are then being degraded in the aerobic condition 21 therefore the striking arrangement of sequential anaerobic aerobic anoxic aerobic in combating dye containing wastewater was proposed throughout the years 22 25 owing to the ease of operation and the switchable operating layout the sequencing batch reactor sbr has been often reported as a better choice in treating dye containing wastewater 26 27 although the sbr seeded with activated sludge as system could shed light on the improvement of treatment efficiency the drawbacks of poor settling characteristics large footprint requirement limitation in scale up and maintenance unstable performance sensitivity to toxic environment and autoxidation have hindered the exploitation of this bioremediation approach 28 29 to circumvent these drawbacks the incorporation of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr technology into the existing sbr system is paramount importance and imperative moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr technology relies decisively on the biomass that attached to specially designed biocarriers to treat a wide variety of wastewater 30 32 the biocarriers can swim homogenously inside the reactor by the turbulent energy imparted from the mixer anoxic condition and aerator aerobic condition the adjustable filling ratio also safeguards the high biomass concentration and solid retention in the treatment system 33 owing to the presence of an extracellular polymeric substance eps on the biofilm mbbr technology often reflects a stable performance since it is less sensitive to the toxic environment several studies have reported that the presence of eps can reduce the diffusion speed of toxic substances into the deeper biofilm layer due to the increase in mass transfer resistance 34 35 in the light of biofilm stratification the deeper zone of the biofilm possesses an anoxic and anaerobic environment simultaneously despite the aerobic condition is executed 30 accordingly the occurrence of recolorization and autoxidation in the aerobic treatment can be mitigated leading to the complete or partial decomposition of aerobically refractory products 36 as such the features of mbbr technology can be brought to the existing sbr system offsetting the inadequacy of the sbr system while treating with dye containing wastewater 37 38 this study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor sbmbbr system in treating dye containing wastewater thus synthetic wastewater contained a typically mono azo dye i e reactive orange 16 ro16 was treated in a lab scale integrated anoxic aerobic react sbmbbr the main objectives were as follows i to evaluate the performance of sbmbbr pertaining to cod removal and biodecolorization under three experimental design schemes and ii to investigate the effects of dye concentration under stepwise and shock loads approaches i e schemes 1 and 2 respectively as well as the hydraulic retention time coupled with the increase of biocarrier filling ratio scheme 3 to the best of our knowledge this was the first time that mbbr technology was incorporated into an integrated anoxic aerobic react sbr system to treat dye containing wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals monoazo dye c i reactive orange 16 with λmax of 494 nm was procured from sigma aldrich usa and the cod contributed by 1 g of ro16 per liter was estimated as 788 7 mg l 1 unless otherwise specified all chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and used as received 2 2 synthetic dye containing wastewater an aqueous stock solution of ro16 was prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of dye powder into reagent grade water during the anoxic aerobic react acclimatization step the synthetic wastewater consisted of organic carbon organic nitrogen and trace elements solution the composition of the synthetic wastewater was as follows concentration in mg l 1 sucrose 563 bactopeptone 188 ammonium chloride 172 magnesium sulfate 49 dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 250 iron iii chloride 11 3 and sodium bicarbonate 14 7 after the acclimatization stage the bactopeptone was removed but the trace elements solution remained in the sbmbbr the carbon source i e sucrose was fixed to 500 mg l 1 in this study 2 3 setup of sbmbbr a schematic diagram of the laboratory scale sbmbbr setup is given in fig 1 the bioreactor was a 5 l borosilicate glass made schott bottle duran gls 80 wide neck glass bottle germany the 3 5 l

biocarrier k1 based on the process design schemes the reactor contained two reaction systems i e anoxic and aerobic systems for the anoxic system a magnetic stirrer heidolph mr hei tec germany equipped with a triangular shape of the magnetic stirrer bar provides turbulent energy for the movement of biocarrier and suspension of sludge on the other hand two cylindrical air stones with a base diameter of 15 mm and a height of 35 mm which were connected to an aquarium air pump sobo sb348 china representing the aerobic system for oxygen supply the influent and effluent of the sbmbbr system were pulse fed and pulse discharged via two independent peristaltic pumps cp p 07557 10 drive masterflex l s cole parmer usa 2 4 inoculation and operation of sbmbbr system prior to the experimental start up the sbmbbr was inoculated with activated sludge mixed culture that collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant owned by indah water sdn bhd in seksyen 7 40000 shah alam selangor malaysia two diverse sbmbbr elapsed time schedules including schedules a and b with their relative hydraulic retention times hrts i e 33 6 h and 16 8 h respectively were applied in the evaluation as shown in fig s1 supplementary material after two weeks of anoxic aerobic react acclimatization the cod removal efficiency showed oscillated within a range of 97 to 98 and the biocarrier was confirmed covering with biofilm consequently the dye was added to the influent based on experimental design schemes with different operating conditions the overall sbmbbr operating conditions and experimental design schemes were tabulated in table 1 the sbmbbr was operated under an air conditional room with the temperature maintained within 24 to 26 for a total operation period of approximately five months 2 5 sample collection and analytical methods 2 5 1 abiotic decolorization the activated sludge was sterilized at 121 for 20 min under a pressure of 0 0103 mpa in an autoclave hirayama hv 85 japan the autoclaved sludge was added to 250 ml of 100 mg l 1ro16 containing synthetic wastewater the mixture was stirred on a hotplate heidolph mr hei tec germany for 22 h combines the periods of fill and react with a constant mixing speed of 100 rpm under room temperature the uv vis absorption was used as the measurement of abiotic decolorization herein 2 5 2 sbmbbr treatment performance the treatment performance for the sbmbbr was evaluated in terms of effluent cod concentration effluent dye concentration sludge concentration and sludge volume index the samples were collected at the end of both anoxic and aerobic react periods cod assessment was performed according to apha 5220 c closed reflux titrimetric method 39 the remaining dye concentration from the effluents was analyzed through a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer cary 100 agilent technologies usa the value was calculated based on the calibration plots obtained from the integrated area against a series of standard solutions the suspended biomass concentration in sbmbbr was measured as mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss according to the standard method of apha 2540 d total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids apha 2540 e respectively 39 the measurement of the attached growth biomass followed the procedure described by hosseini koupaie et al 36 sludge volume index svi was used to monitor the settle ability of suspended growth biomass and it was conducted according to the procedure stated at apha 2710 d 39 2 5 3 time course profile study time course profile of biodecolorization and cod removal efficiencies from phases 2 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 under sbmbbr were monitored during the last week of evaluation periods for this the hourly samples were collected during react mode with a time interval of every 1 h throughout the react mode as well as the end of fill mode subsequently the collected samples were subjected to the analysis of cod and ro16 concentration as mentioned in section 2 5 2 2 5 4 maximum co substrate uptake the percentage of co substrate i e sucrose uptake with respect to its cod value in each phase was calculated based on the data obtained from the time course profile including the efficiencies of biodecolorization and cod removal the one with the highest percentage value throughout 21 h of react period at time t was selected as the maximum co substrate uptake for that particular phase eq 1 was used to calculate the percentage of sucrose uptake for the biomass in each phase 1 m a x i m u m c o s u b s t r a t e u

quantity of cod mg and ro16 molecules mg were removed from the sbmbbr system the obtained values were then divided by the total biomass mlvss in that particular phase they can be expressed by eqs 2

scans of 64 from 4000 to 500 cm 1 prior to this testing the refrigerant dehumidifier was turned on so as to prevent the excess absorption of moisture from the environment towards the dried biofilm 3 results and discussion the experiment pertaining to three discrete schemes including the effects of dye concentration under stepwise and shock loads approaches i e schemes 1 and 2 respectively as well as the hydraulic retention time coupled with the increase of biocarrier filling ratio scheme 3 was carried out over a period of 132 days from phase 1 10 but only the details of phases 2 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 were further taken into discussion herein since phases 1 3 and 5 were the transient periods under scheme 1 table 2 summarises the overall treatment performance regarding cod removal and ro16 biodecolorization of an integrated anoxic aerobic react sbmbbr while a time series graph regarding the end treatment performance of cod removal and ro16 biodecolorization were depicted in fig 2 the microbial strengths in removing ro16 and cod as well as the maximum co substrate i e sucrose uptake for each phase were also documented in table 3 lastly the data obtained from tables 2 and 3 were interpreted in conjunction with the time series graphs derived from fig 2 viz fig 3 cod removal and fig 4 ro16 biodecolorization as shown in sections 3 2 and 3 3 respectively laying down the foundation for the following discussion 3 1 mechanism of biodecolorization in sbmbbr the mechanism of biodecolorization in the sbmbbr system was functioned on accounts of two subsets viz abiotic adsorption biosorption and biotic biochemical reaction biodegradation in biosorption a very low ro16 biodecolorization efficiency with up to 14 was attained the results revealed a truth that biosorption was not the crucial key in mitigating the ro16 concentration herein in addition uv vis spectral scan as shown in fig s2 affirmed that the biodecolorization in this study was chiefly ascribed to biodegradation whereby the characteristic peaks of ro16 at the wavelength of 388 nm and 494 nm λ m a x were dwindled continuously along with the reaction time this observation was concomitant with the pronounced increasing peak at 264 nm indicating the breakdown of azo bonds was mainly due to enzymatic reaction 3 2 cod removal 3 2 1 scheme 1 the effect of dye concentration stepwise approach fig 3a shows the cod removal efficiency fluctuated within a range of 94 to 100 over an evaluation period of 62 days a dramatic decrease in cod removal efficiency could be seen from phases 1 3 5 and the early part first week of phases 2 4 and 6 this observation implied that the sbmbbr system was susceptible to the gradual increase of ro16 loadings which was 10 mg l 1 day 1 throughout phases 1 3 and 5 although the falling trend was prolonged to the early of the phases 2 4 and 6 it was taken off sharply in the following week this revealed that the non acclimatized activated sludge required much time for the microorganisms to recognize ro16 molecules since it is a xenobiotic compound 40 once the acclimatization of certain ro16 concentrations was accomplished the cod removal efficiency showed greater than that of transition periods table 2 unveils that more than 97 of cod removal efficiency was attained in phases 2 4 and 6 the reduction of cod was equivalent to a concentration removal mg l 1 of 644 18 668 62 and 709 16 at phases 2 4 and 6 respectively as reported in table 3 three plausible explanations for such excellent cod abatement could be recapitulated herein i the fraction of codro16 to codtotal were tiny under scheme 1 the stepwise approach provided an adequate time frame for the acclimatization of the sbmbbr system 41 this was evidenced by the improvement of the microbial strength in removing cod from 0 0677 to 0 0711 mg cod mg biomass from phase 2 to phase 6 as demonstrated in table 3 ii the involvement of 500 mg l 1 sucrose in the biodegradation providing the biomass with an accessible substrate for metabolism purpose table 3 discloses a complete consumption of co substrate under this scheme this was interrelated to the rise in the aforesaid microbial strength mg cod mg biomass solís et al 42 emphasized that the involvement of co substrate not only helps in maintaining the vitality of microorganisms but also assisting in biodecolorization the majority of cod reduction occurred during the fill period as shown in fig 5 a this was ascribed to the reason that sucrose was rapidly reduced in the fill period by serving as an electron donor and carbon source 43 iii the aromatic intermediate formed from the anoxic react period was degraded in the aerobic react period as illustrated in fig 6 a the degradation of an aromatic intermediate during the aerobic reaction period was congruent with the observations from jonstrup et al 44 and ong et al 45 3 2 2 scheme 2 the effect of dye concentration shock loads approach fig 3b portrays that the cod removal efficiency dropped sharply after the first second and third ro16 shocks i e 300 mg l 1 600 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 with the codro16 codtotal ratio of 28 44 and 56 respectively were imposed into sbmbbr system a significant decline in the cod removal efficiency was noticed during the early part first week of phases 7 8 and 9 the falling trends could be ascribed to the substrate inhibition exerted by the toxicity of ro16 molecules under the sudden ro16 shocks due to the immaturity of enzymatic system 46 48 fortunately the cod removal efficiency improved progressively and attained an average value of 50 54 48 97 and 38 69 in the following week second week of phases 7 8 and 9 respectively as shown in table 2 therefore the instability on the cod removal efficiency signified that there was a need for an adaptation period so as to the sbmbbr system could contend with the ro16 shocks 49 in comparison to phase 6 a difference of 46 83 in cod removal efficiency was heeded in the first ro16 shock this was equivalent to a disparity of 281 27 mg l 1 cod removal concentration as shown in table 3 table 3 also reveals that the microbial strength mg cod mg biomass was declined from 0 0711 to 0 0426 since there was no deterioration on the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency but amelioration of 10 was observed as reported in section 3 3 2 the decline in the microbial strength mg cod mg biomass did not pose any negative impact to the sbmbbr system this was supported by the increment of biomass concentration in phase 7 as compared to phase 6 as discussed in section 3 5 similarly fig 5b displays that the primary cod removal with more than 60 was attained at the end of fill period subsequently the anoxic react period only attributed approximately 10 of cod removal efficiency thereafter it showed decreasing during the aerobic react period furthermore the aromatic intermediate resulted from the biodegradation of ro16 was further degraded in the aerobic react period as illustrated in fig 6b the observation in phase 7 was likely associated with natural selection indeed the microbial consortia which were unable to survive under 300 mg l 1 ro16 containing wastewater were flushed out while those which were able to produce or secrete the effective working enzymes were screened out and proliferated in the sbmbbr system 50 51 consequently the effective working enzymes could be secreted adequately thereby utilizing ro16 molecules as the primary carbon and energy substrate this was also supported by an extent of 80 co substrate uptake as compared to 100 in the previous phases as documented in table 3 the loser of natural selection underwent disintegration on their structural configuration causing the occurrence of cell lysis in the system the consequence of cell lysis could result in the releasing of some macromolecules including proteins dna rna and so on those macromolecules possess a backbone of carbohydrate explaining why there was a built up of cod herein during the aerobic react period 52 in spite of the cod removal efficiency dropped to 39 26 during the first week of phase 8 as illustrated in fig 3b the corresponding cod removal concentration i e 425 27 mg l 1 was still better than that of 368 11 mg l 1 as obtained from the last day of phase 7 this improvement was stemmed from the fact that the effective microbial consortia have standing out and proliferated due to the natural selection previously therefore the environment containing a high amount of ro16 molecules could favor the growth of the biomass since they exhibited a positive capability in degrading ro16 molecules however the enzymatic system in the sbmbbr was still suppressed by the toxicity from the second ro16 shocks as a result the disturbance in microbial syntrophy was speculated whereby the enzymes for breaking down the co substrate was induced again 49 it was evidenced by the increase in the maximum co substrate uptake from 80 in phase 7 86 in phase 8 as shown in table 3 this remark was also in agreement with the rise in the microbial strength from 0 0426 to 0 0454 mg cod mg biomass as documented in table 3 consequently the effective working enzymes could work well in the sbmbbr system along with the adequate electrons donated from the breakdown of co substrate mitigating the toxicity exerted by the ro16 molecules eventually table 3 reveals that the cod removal concentration mg l 1 was improved to 530 45 from 427 88 in phase 7 likewise fig 5b illustrates that the principal cod reduction occurred in the fill period a trifling variation on cod removal efficiency was observed during the anoxic react period the concentration of resulted aromatic intermediate was abated under the aerobic react period as evidenced from fig 6c however the ability of sbmbbr in degrading the aromatic intermediate started to become slower pandey et al 53 and hosseini koupaie et al 36 reported that those aromatic intermediates were more toxic than the parent dyes therefore it could adversely affect the mineralization of aromatic intermediate in the last ro16 shock the sbmbbr system was capable of removing a cod concentration of 541 2 mg l 1 in phase 9 as compared to 530 45 mg l 1 in phase 8 despite the cod removal efficiency of the latter was higher i e 48 97 a transformation on the enzymatic system was believed to occur after the acclimatization of 1000 mg l 1 ro16 shock for one week indeed more effective microbial consortia in removing ro16 molecules were formed in phase 9 since the sbmbbr system was able to remove more ro16 molecules as evidenced in section 3 3 2 without a high consumption on co substrate table 3 unveils that the maximum co substrate uptake was only 69 in addition the microbial strength showed almost akin to the value reported in phase 8 i e 0 0452 mg cod mg biomass solís et al 42 stated that microorganisms could acclimatize under extreme conditions i e the presence of ro16 molecules herein by inducing more powerful enzymatic activity the authors also added that if the microorganisms have been acclimatized successively to dye molecules the cut down on co substrate uptake could be noticed fig 5b highlights that only 30 of cod removal efficiency was attained at the end of the fill period subsequently the integrated anoxic aerobic react did not contribute much to the cod reduction only approximately 10 of cod removal efficiency was attained throughout 21 h of reaction time no improvement in the performance of cod removal but deterioration was observed under the aerobic react period as depicted in fig 6c there were two plausible reasons which could explain this observation i it was speculated that the absorbed aromatic intermediates in the microbial cell were flushed out by a special efflux pump indeed several studies have reported that aromatic intermediates are more toxic than parent dyes 54 55 to reduce the concentration of a toxic substance in the cellular membrane a survival mechanism via the efflux pump was triggered 49 ii it was due to the occurrence of autoxidation in fact there is a propensity for the resulted aromatic intermediated to be auto oxidized under the presence of oxygen 56 consequently this will lead to a formation of more complex and aerobically recalcitrant products leading to the build up of cod 57 da silva et al 58 and mata et al 26 mentioned that the auto oxidized aromatic intermediate would form a colored oligomeric structure under an oxygen rich environment via free radical reactions the findings in section 3 3 2 have supported the statement in fact the actively metabolic system comprising a series of natural selection disturbance in syntrophy as well as the transformation of the enzymatic system under three ro16 shocks was safeguarded by the attached growth biomass system in sbmbbr in addition the attached growth biomass possessed a critical role in offsetting the incoming ro16 containing wastewater especially during the fill period since it constituted 12 to 24 of the total biomass in this study indeed the pulse feed of the incoming ro16 containing wastewater was first received and degraded by the biofilm on the biocarrier since suspended growth biomass was settled below the biocarriers accordingly it helped to alleviate the toxicity exerted from the shock ro16 molecules favoring biodegradation on the suspended growth biomass system bassin et al 59 reported that suspended growth biomass is sometimes susceptible to high organic loading in contrast attached growth biomass system contained a dense protective layer i e extracellular polymeric substance eps which has been reported to be capable of resisting inhibitory or noxious effects from the toxic compounds such as ro16 molecules herein 35 60 venkata mohan et al 61 pointed out that the attached growth biomass system could act as a buffer to reduce the concentration of toxic and recalcitrant chemicals thereby alleviating the stress suffered by the suspended growth biomass system as a result the attached growth biomass system did shed some light on ro16 biodegradation especially under scheme 2 3 2 3 scheme 3 the effect of hydraulic retention time coupled with the increase of biocarrier filling ratio fig 3c displays a slight exacerbation on the cod removal efficiency after the hrt was reduced to 16 8 h although the biocarrier filling ratio was increased to 10 v v however it was believed that the rising trend observed in the last week of phase 10 was attributed to the biomass augmentation from the extra 5 biocarrier the growth of biofilm required much time especially in a short hrt system 62 as shown in table 2 the cod removal efficiency became worse and showed 36 27 as compared to 38 69 in phase 9 several studies have been reported that a low cod removal efficiency was always accompanied by a reduction in hrt 44 63 64 this could be due to the inadequate time for the microorganisms to degrade more organic substances such as both ro16 molecules and co substrate herein 43 subsequently the microbial strength in removing cod in terms of mg cod mg biomass in phase 10 dropped to 0 036 as compared to 0 0452 at phase 9 as tabulated in table 3 in the aspect of time course profile especially during the anoxic react period the cod removal rate hour 1 in phase 10 was higher i e 0 565 than that of 0 408 from phase 9 as shown in fig 5c this was equivalent to a difference of 0 16 hour 1 a remarkable inefficiency on the cod removal was noticed during the aerobic react period suggesting the occurrence of cell lysis was reencountered in phase 10 owing to the reduction in the anoxic react period most of the microorganisms in the sbmbbr system were speculated could not acclimatize to the shorter hrt leading to the disintegration of the microbial structure this explained why there was a built up of cod fig 6d shows that the aromatic intermediate formed from the breakdown of azo linkages during the anoxic react period was slightly removed in the subsequent aerobic react period indicating partial mineralization was achieved herein 3 3 ro16 biodecolorization 3 3 1 scheme 1 the effect of dye concentration stepwise approach the performance of ro16 biodecolorization was irresistibly excellent i e 100 removal efficiency was achieved over 62 days stepwise ro16 loading regardless of any initial concentration values as shown in fig 4a and table 2 yu et al 65 mentioned that a start up period of 3 7 months is necessary for the acclimatization to decolorize azo containing wastewater completely instead this study showed that a complete biodecolorization with ro16 concentration of 150 mg l 1 was achieved in a shorter acclimatization period i e 50 days with the biofilm attachment on the biocarrier a high metabolic potential could be induced 61 in turn it shortened the acclimatization period the complete removal of ro16 molecules was in accordance with the improvement of the microbial strength in removing ro16 molecules from 0 005 to 0 015 mg ro16 mg biomass as shown in table 3 the excellent biodecolorization herein had outcompeted those reported from the current bioreactor configurations 44 66 67 the outstanding biodecolorization herein could be ascribed to i the mixed culture involved ii the presence of co substrate iii the experimental design and iv the ro16 molecular structure in comparison with pure culture a mixed culture is capable of achieving a higher degree of biodegradation and mineralization as it involves a wide spectrum of microbial consortia while exposing to a new environment synergistic metabolic activities speed up the communication between each microbial consortium 68 the presence of co substrate i e sucrose was essential for the reductive cleavage of azo linkages on the ro16 molecules with the assistance of certain enzymes indeed the cleavage of azo linkages is associated with the transfer of four electrons reducing equivalents in which two pairs of electrons from the metabolism of co substrate electron donor are transferred to azo dye molecule electron acceptor each stage resulting in the breakdown of azo linkages and hence colorless aromatic intermediates were formed 69 karim et al 8 stated the involvement of co substrate in microbial degradation of dyes not only boosts up the ability of dye degradation but also shortens the reaction time besides the stepwise increment of ro16 concentration also played a pivotal role in giving excellent biodecolorization singh et al 70 and dafale et al 71 declared that an adequate adaption is needed for the microbial community under the exposure of toxic or recalcitrant compounds it could provide a sufficient transient period for the improvement of the biodecolorization rate besides the decolorization efficiency is directly proportional to the number of azo bonds present in the dye molecule 72 73 a mono azo dye i e ro16 which consists of only one azo bond on its molecular structure therefore exhibited high biodegradability with the presence of sulfonated group at para position of an azo bond as well as hydroxyl group at the 2 position of its naphthol ring the efficiency of ro16 biodecolorization was further reinforced to a higher degree 24 the time course profile from fig 7 a unveiled that a ro16 concentration of 50 mg l 1 could be fully decolorized within an anoxic react period of 7 h in phase 2 while the time required to attain a complete biodecolorization of ro16 was further prolonged to aerobic react period viz 19th and 18th hour in phases 4 and 6 respectively a noticeable extent of ro16 biodecolorization with approximate 10 occurred under the aerobic phase in both phases 4 and 6 the anoxic and anaerobic zone within the inner biofilm stratification under the aerobic react period could be a putative reason in contributing the biodecolorization herein 67 74 3 3 2 scheme 2 the effect of dye concentration shock loads approach a complete biodecolorization was undermined after successive ro16 shocks viz 300 mg l 1 in phase 7 600 mg l 1 in phase 8 and 1000 mg l 1 in phase 10 were imposed on the sbmbbr system as shown in fig 4b the efficiency of ro16 biodecolorization shown inferior to that of reflected from the previous ro16 shock along with the evaluation of scheme 2 in the first ro16 shock there was a marginal decrease in ro16 biodecolorization efficiency dropping from 100 phase 6 to 89 44 phase 7 with a difference of approximately 10 as reported in table 2 subsequently the performance of ro16 biodecolorization was severely affected by the second and last ro16 shocks resulting in an average biodecolorization efficiency of 58 04 and 36 33 respectively as documented in table 2 it was evident that the descending trend in the first evaluation week of phases 7 8 and 9 was replaced by an ascending trend in the following week as shown in fig 4b the decline in the first evaluation week was likely caused by the substrate inhibition exerted by the substantial amount of ro16 molecules which was suddenly introduced into the sbmbbr system without adequate acclimatization el bouraie and el din 2016 48 eventually the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency in phases 7 8 and 9 corresponded to a ro16 concentration removal of 268 32 348 24 and 363 30 mg l 1 respectively in the first ro16 shock the microbial strength in removing ro16 molecules was ameliorated to 0 0261 as compared to 0 015 mg ro16 mg biomass in phase 6 as unveiled in table 3 accordingly an approximate 670 8 mg of ro16 molecules were able to be decolorized in phase 7 moreover the maximum co substrate uptake was diminished to 80 as compared to 100 in the previous phases the findings affirmed that the sbmbbr system was accredited to possess the positive ability in withstanding the first ro16 concentration shock of 300 mg l 1 indeed the prevailing enzymatic system demonstrated that the effective working enzymes in confronting the ro16 molecules had been produced or secreted effectively as a result of the natural selection and proliferation of microbial consortia throughout the acclimatization as described in section 3 2 2 it was evidenced by the time course profile as shown in fig 7b in which the sbmbbr system was capable of removing half of the inlet ro16 concentration i e approximately 55 at the end of the fill period while it was only 45 at the end of fill period under phase 6 while comparing the biodecolorization between anoxic and aerobic periods not much difference was observed this finding was in agreement with previous works whereby no much change on the biodecolorization efficiency in the aerobic period 43 75 the instability of performance in phase 8 heralded the possible disturbance in syntrophy in the sbmbbr system 49 there were two groups of microbial consortia living in the system viz ro16 degrading and co substrate degrading microbial consortia owing to the inhibition effect exerted from the 600 mg l 1 ro16 shock the microbial consortia in degrading the ro16 molecules required many electrons from the electron donor i e sucrose to break down the azo linkage possessed by ro16 molecules therefore the enzymes for breaking down the co substrate were induced again herein as described in section 3 2 2 in comparison to phase 7 the microbial strength was improved to 0 0298 from 0 0267 mg ro16 mg biomass which indicated an extra 200 mg of ro16 molecules was able to be decolorized as shown in table 3 in the aspect of time course profile the anoxic and aerobic react periods showed an approximate 40 in biodecolorization while only around 20 biodecolorization efficiency was achieved during the fill period as illustrated in fig 7b again biodecolorization efficiency between anoxic and aerobic periods shown not much improvement in the course of last ro16 shock the microbial strength in decolorizing ro16 molecules was improved slightly to 0 0304 from 0 0298 mg ro16 mg biomass as compared to phase 8 as shown in table 3 this improvement was concomitant with an extra biodecolorization of 10 71 mg ro16 molecules moreover the maximum co substrate uptake was reduced to 69 in phase 9 this was inferred that a new enzymatic system had been evolved i e co substrate independent enzymatic system during phase 9 as mentioned in section 3 2 2 fig 7b illustrates that biodecolorization mainly happened in the fill and anoxic react periods a noticeable decline was observed during the aerobic react period suggesting a thorny problem i e autoxidation was suspected to be encountered in this phase jonstrup et al 44 stated that recolorization is a rapid process and it has resulted from the autoxidation they added that the products spontaneously cross react with each other forming polymeric structures which are more recalcitrant in undergoing degradation aerobically the decrement on biodecolorization under the aerobic react period could also be explained by the consequence of the efflux pump 49 these observations verified the occurrence of autoxidation and the surviving mechanism of the efflux pump as described in section 3 2 2 3 the ro16 shocks were not found to be exacerbated to the enzymatic system in the purposed sbmbbr system henceforth it could be concluded that the purposed sbmbbr system was capable of contending high ro16 shocks the attached growth biomass system was believed to be paramount importance and eligible in remediating the refractory pollutants and organic shock loads 52 76 77 furthermore the biofilm attachment on the biocarrier was able to transform an organic or toxic pollutant much faster as compared to suspended flocs 78 naresh kumar et al 79 compared the biodecolorization between biofilm and activated sludge systems under a successive of acid black 10b shocks they discovered that the biodecolorization in biofilm system was better than that of reflected from the conventional activated sludge system they also pointed out that such the high stability and biodecolorization in biofilm system was due to the high metabolic potential of biofilm operation as a result of high biomass retention capability thus the protruding difference between two distinct biomass systems providing support for the contribution of the attached growth biomass system herein koçyiğit and ugurlu 80 mentioned that no adverse effect but an improvement was observed in color removal at varying shock loads despite the cod removal efficiency become lower again this could be attributed to the presence of the attached growth biomass system in the sbmbbr the detailed was also elucidated in section 3 2 2 3 3 3 scheme 3 the effect of hydraulic retention time coupled with the increase of biocarrier filling ratio the performance of ro16 reduction showed fluctuating after the hrt was reduced to 16 8 h as plotted in fig 4c the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency reflected a declining trend during the last week of the evaluation period indicating the inability of the sbmbbr system in degrading a total mass of 5000 mg two cyclic loadings of ro16 molecules per day table 2 reports the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency dropped to 26 82 accounting for 670 5 mg of ro16 molecules was decolorized at the end of a cyclic treatment a deterioration of approximately 10 was accounted in phase 10 in comparison to phase 9 despite the inlet ro16 concentration was the same in short hrt the biomass systems had insufficient time to expose to the ro16 molecules and therefore the probability of decomposition decreased 81 accordingly the microbial strength decreased to 0 0191 from 0 0304 mg ro16 mg biomass at phase 9 as shown in table 3 fig 7c manifests that the ro16 biodecolorization efficiency in phase 10 showed higher than that of phase 9 within the first 10 h as a result of a faster biodecolorization rate indeed an hourly removal percentage hour 1 difference of 0 3 was calculated based on the values obtained from phases 9 and 10 i e 1 249 and 1 551 respectively during the anoxic react period this could be concluded that the 10 biocarrier filling ratio did shed light on the ro16 reduction with the incorporation of an extra 5 v v biocarrier filling ratio the amount of biofilm attachment was augmented since the attached growth biomass was responsible for the ro16 molecules reduction therefore the treatment efficiency was promoted 59 however the reduction of hrt was the main factor causing the deterioration herein al amrani et al 24 studied the effect of time ratio of operating periods in a cycle towards decolorization they concluded that longer anoxic time is preferable for the biodecolorization whereby the decolorization of acid orange7 could attain 80 when an extra 10 h was added to the anoxic reaction time koçyiğit and ugurlu 80 mentioned that a longer anaerobic contact time could improve dye removal efficiency 3 4 uv vis spectral analysis the uv vis spectra from the beginning and the end of each scheme were depicted in fig 8 b f in comparison to the control ro16 spectrum in fig 8a two of the ro16 characteristic peaks in the visible region i e λmax at 492 nm and 388 nm under scheme 1 diminished significantly with respect to time whilst one of the new peak intermediate peak kept accumulating nearby the ro16 characteristic peak of 250 nm i e benzene ring in the uv region as portrayed in fig 8b and c the intermediate peak in the uv region was further cut down during the aerobic treatment the disappearance of absorbance peaks in visible region signified a complete cleavage of the azo bond was attained 82 notably the ro16 biodecolorization showed a certain extent of improvement under the aerobic react period as evidenced by fig 8b and c besides the structure of the naphthalene ring i e λmax at 290 nm was removed entirely in scheme 1 in scheme 2 the uv spectrum obtained from fig 8d also demonstrated a significant decrease in the absorbance peaks under visible region but not complete removal fig 8d also illustrates that the intermediate peak in the uv region received destruction during the aerobic treatment the blunt shape in the uv region of fig 8d was because of non diluted samples were used however the decrement of the absorbance peaks in fig 8e showed insignificantly moreover a contrasting trend was observed in which the aerobic spectrum showed a reappearance of naphthalene ring structure at the peak of 290 nm meanwhile the peak at 492 nm increased to a certain extent higher than that of the anoxic spectrum the remarkable phenomenon could be due to the occurrence of autoxidation the observation herein has been confirmed in sections 3 2 2 and 3 3 2 in scheme 2 the end products shown possessing the characteristic peaks of 260 nm this peak was found associated with the presence of oxidized aromatic compounds in particular a phenolic compound i e diketones 83 in scheme 3 there is no much difference between the anoxic and aerobic spectra as shown in fig 8e the problem of autoxidation has been mitigated in this phase henceforth the initial stage of the ro16 biodegradation was deemed to be the breakdown of azo dye chromophore structures as evidenced by the diminishment of ro16 maximum absorption in visible wavelength region this was concomitant with the reflection of a lighter orange or colorless appearance subsequently the resulted intermediate underwent mineralization in the aerobic treatment this was tallied with the reduction on the intermediate peak while comparing anoxic and aerobic spectra however partial mineralization was attained throughout this study 3 5 biomass distribution weight and sludge volume index svi fig 9 demonstrates that the suspended growth biomass overtopped the attached growth biomass utterly in the sbmbbr indeed the suspended growth biomass dominated more than 76 of the total biomass throughout the evaluation conversely gu et al 35 revealed that attached growth biomass was the dominant biomass system in treating coking wastewater under the application of mbbr technology the less dominance of attached growth biomass herein could be attributed to i 1 l of activated sludge was inoculated into sbmbbr ii the suspended biomass possesses more porous floc structure than attached biofilm which might uptake much of the co substrate and ro16 molecules along with the reducing agents required for the breakdown of azo bonds 84 iii a more effective microbial consortia in degrading ro16 molecules and intermediates are abundant in suspended growth system iv the stepwise increment approach in scheme 1 provided suspended growth biomass an adequate acclimatization in withstanding the severe dye containing environment 41 fig 9 depicts the trend of the total biomass showed falling in the early of scheme 1 and then steadily ascending to approximate 25 g in phases 6 and 7 29 g in phases 8 and 9 and eventually 35 19 g in phase 10 a similar trend was observed on the suspended biomass system since it accounted for more than 76 of the total biomass in the sbmbbr in addition it decreased to 18 19 g at phase 4 from 21 7 g at acclimatization after the ro16 molecules were introduced into the sbmbbr however this descending trend was replaced by an increasing trend since phase 6 onwards till phase 10 this was equivalent to an increment of 5 83 g of suspended growth biomass on the other hand the attached growth biomass showed slightly fluctuated over the evaluation periods with the incorporation of 5 v v biocarrier filling ratio the attached growth biomass from schemes 1 and 2 showed fluctuating within 2 9 g 4 90 g but it was increased to more than 1 8 folds i e 8 61 g in scheme 3 after the quantity of extra 5 v v biocarrier were added into sbmbbr in scheme 1 the loss of biomass in two biomass systems was probably ascribed to substrate inhibition since the microorganisms were not fully acclimatized to 100 mg l 1 ro16 molecules under phase 4 46 48 in the light of a stepwise feeding strategy adopted in scheme 1 the suspended growth biomass system displayed a positive increment throughout scheme 2 this could be attributed to the high substrate concentration involved in sbmbbr as well as an adapted enzymatic system had been evolved indeed high substrate concentration could enhance the metabolism of microorganisms if enzymatic system reflects a positive ability in degrading ro16 molecules and the relative intermediate in turn microorganisms could proliferate faster resulting in high total biomass concentration in this study suspended growth biomass reflected a good settle ability since the svi values from 3 experimental design schemes were found within a preferable range of 120 ml g 1 as shown in fig 9 therefore high biomass retention in the sbmbbr was ensured this explained why the suspended growth biomass increased significantly under the sbmbbr 85 the highest svi value was attained during the acclimatization i e 107 69 ml g 1 however the svi values dropped gradually from 105 8 46 39 ml g 1 during the evaluation of scheme 1 and scheme 2 subsequently a slight increment on svi value was noticed in scheme 3 indeed the excellent settle ability herein was inferred due to the increase of sludge compactness as a result of microbial acclimatization 86 however the presence of pinpoint floc was speculated to be involved in scheme 2 and scheme 3 since the svi values were less than 75 ml g 1 consequently a cloudy appearance was observed in the supernatant above the settled blanket 52 87 the formation of pinpoint floc could be caused by i the toxicity exerted by ro16 molecules and their intermediates during the course of shock loads ii the floc disintegration as a result of natural selection and starvation of microorganisms iii the reduction in hrt in scheme 3 88 notably the sudden rise in svi value in sbmbbr was caused by the increase in the total biomass concentration as a result of two operating cycles applied per day 89 apart from this reason the increase in the shear stress due to the 10 v v biocarrier filling ratio delayed the formation of compressed and settleable sludge flocs causing the increase in svi value 36 3 6 extracellular polymeric substance eps fig 10 shows the presence of several intense frequency peaks on the five segregated regions ranging from i to v which were found to be related to the stretching and bending vibrations possessed by eps macromolecules comprising polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids 90 thus this observation substantiated the existence of eps under the entire sbmbbr evaluation period the spectral region v showed a relatively more intense peak 1021 cm 1 1023 cm 1 in the spectrum indicating the characteristics of polysaccharides c h trans which is the carbohydrate like backbone for the eps 91 the observation was in line with the composition of polysaccharides reported in the eps constitution interrelatedly the broader peak appeared at 3269 cm 1 to 3272 cm 1 on the spectral region i was ascribed to the stretching vibration of the o h bond this evidenced that the abundance of hydroxyl groups presented in the carbohydrate backbone of eps as well as the possibility of residual moisture content in the sample 92 93 furthermore the two peaks displayed in spectral region iii which were ascribed to c o stretching vibration of amine i 1628 cm 1 to 1636 cm 1 and n h bending vibration of amine ii 1534 cm 1 to 1541 cm 1 respectively these two peaks are unique and they are an essential testimony of protein secondary structure in eps 94 95 the bands of 2852 cm 1 and 2953 cm 1 in spectral region ii correspond to c h stretching vibrations of lipids in the eps as it was allocated within the domain 2850 cm 1 to 2970 cm 1 92 96 lastly the less intense peak of 1238 cm 1 to 1254 cm 1 in spectral region iv was due to the presence of nucleic acid in the eps 91 4 conclusions mbbr technology was hitherto incorporated into an integrated anoxic aerobic react sbr system which had paved a new way for the treatment of dye containing wastewater the primary outcome derived from three experimental design schemes can be summarized into scheme 1 in the early acclimatization the dependence of co substrate was inevitable for ro16 biodegradation since it functioned as an electron donor for the whole process more than 97 cod removal efficiency and a complete biodecolorization were attained under this scheme a threefold improvement of microbial strength in removing ro16 molecules was noticed i e from 0 005 to 0 015 mg ro16 mg biomass this was congruent with the improvement of microbial strength in terms of mg cod mg biomass i e from 0 0677 to 0 0711 no autoxidation was encountered scheme 2 a discernible decline in cod and ro16 removal efficiencies i e both cod and ro16 removals were deteriorated to approximate 40 at the end of this scheme the decrease in cod removal was in agreement with the decline in microbial strength mg cod mg biomass from 0 071 in phase 6 to 0 0452 in phase 9 as a result of the reduction on maximum co substrate uptake from 100 to 69 however the microbial strength in removing ro16 molecules was doubled up to 0 0304 mg ro16 mg biomass as compared to 0 015 in phase 6 the presence of the eps on the biofilm shielded the attached growth biomass system from the toxicity exerted by ro16 shocks henceforth the attached growth biomass system provided advantages for the suspended growth biomass systems and safeguarded the actively metabolic potential under this scheme a labile extent of autoxidation was encountered in phase 9 scheme 3 the treatment performance on cod and ro16 removals were further undermined to approximate 36 and 27 respectively under this scheme the falls on both cod and ro16 removal efficiencies were concomitant with the impairment of microbial strength in removing cod and ro16 molecules in which it dropped from 0 0452 to 0 036 mg cod mg biomass and 0 0304 to 0 0191 mg ro16 mg biomass respectively the short hrt was the main reason for the deterioration herein despite the 10 v v biocarrier filling ratio did show amelioration on treatment efficiencies nonetheless the previous autoxidation was eliminated in phase 10 the results of the study demonstrate that the integrated anoxic aerobic react sbmbbr system is suitable for the treatment of ro16 containing wastewater with up to 300 mg l 1 the sbmbbr system was also proven to be capable of contending ro16 shocks however a higher biocarrier filling ratio longer cyclic reaction time and

13958,electrochemical technologies have proven to be plausible technology for the treatment of oily wastewater this study aimed to evaluate the performance of electrocoagulation ec process with and without aeration for the treatment of oily wastewater scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds techniques were used to analyze the sludge and the electrodes the maximum removal of the chemical oxygen demand cod was higher with the aerated cells 93 3 than with the non aerated cells 84 at 120 a m 2 current density but at the expense of higher specific energy consumption electrophoresis and electrodeposition of oil were observed on both electrodes with higher intensity on the anodes the sludge of the aerated cell was of a gel like structure compared to the foamy and grainy sludge obtained from the non aerated cell anodes in the ec aerated cells were consumed more homogeneously having more depositions of oil on their surfaces aeration helped to improve the performance of the process highlighting the great potential of electrocoagulation processes for the treatment of oily wastewater keywords electrocoagulation oily wastewater aeration treatment removal mechanisms 1 introduction oily wastewater is occurring frequently in many of the current industrial practices which involve the utilization presence of oil and its constituents 1 oilfields refineries metal processing slaughterhouses textile industries and food industries produce huge volumes of oily wastewater with varying composition and characteristics 2 if not treated oily wastewater can cause serious issues in the environment and the ecosystem oil can coalescence and form layers that float on water surfaces causing the blockage of sunlight and disruption of aquatic life with the presence of other contaminants in water oil content can react to form carcinogenic compounds which may eventually reach potable water resources 3 proper treatment of oily wastewater before its discharge is required to abide by the environmental regulations with a better option of reutilizing the treated oily wastewater in relevant applications various treatments have been implemented and tested for oily wastewater from different sources such as membrane filtration adsorption dissolved air flotation chemical coagulation and advanced oxidation processes aops 1 however these processes suffer from several drawbacks e g low efficiency 4 and membrane fouling 5 when treating stable and small sized few micrometers oil in water emulsions electrochemical processes including electroflotation ef electrocoagulation ec and electrooxidation eo proved efficient in the destabilization of such emulsions these chemical free processes outperform other technologies with greater efficiencies while producing minimal waste and consuming less energy more environmentally friendly remediation 3 ef is characterized by the production of oxygen and hydrogen gases at the anode and cathode respectively in which small bubbles are formed and conveyed upwards while rising the bubbles encounter and attach to oil droplets sweeping them to the top the mechanism of such interaction was suggested to occur in four steps collision and attachment to the oil emulsion formation of agglomerates entrapment of more bubbles and lastly sweeping up the floc i e flotation 6 higher current density results in the production of smaller bubble sizes and hence the removal of smaller suspended pollutants 7 on the other hand ec occurs when a sacrificial electrode is used in the electrochemical cell where the anode dissolves into the solution producing metal ions which in turn get hydrolyzed to form monomeric and polymeric hydroxides for example when aluminum anodes are used al oh 3 forms eventually constituting the in situ produced coagulants which destabilizes the relatively high zeta potential oil emulsions and neutralizes its charge 8 hydrogen gas is also produced at the cathode while minimal to no oxygen gas production at the anode depending on the applied potential and ph of the solution the following are known to be the reactions taking place at the different electrodes of an electrochemical cell with a sacrificial anode at the anode 8 1 m s m a q n n e 2 2 h 2 o l 4 h a q o 2 g 4 e at the cathode 8 3 m a q n n e m s 4 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 o h a q in the solution after complex reactions 9 5 m a q 3 3 h 2 o l m o h 3 s 3 h a q the formed metal hydroxides form a gel like structure characterized by high adsorption capacity which enmeshes the dispersed oil emulsions 10 11 many studies have shown the efficiency of ec in treating oily wastewater from different sources varying different parameters 2 however few studies investigated the effect of aeration on the performance of the electrochemical cell moussavi et al 12 have conducted a study on the treatment of contaminated groundwater by electrocoagulation using fe electrodes the performance of the process was evaluated by the removal of total petroleum hydrocarbon tph which was increased from 73 to 95 after the introduction of aeration it was concluded that aeration increased the formation of fe oh 3 flocs by forming more fe3 ions due to increased oxygen in the solution similar studies 13 14 have conducted ec using fe electrodes and observed cod removal enhancement with aeration which was attributed to the performance enhancement to the increased conversion of ferrous into ferric ions in the presence of aeration higher dissolved oxygen also the continuous aeration served in enhancing mixing and collisions of pollutants and electrocoagulants 14 priya and jeyanthi 15 performed ec using cu anodes and concluded that aeration has boosted the anodic reactions resulting in more coagulant forming ions cu2 to the solution to the best of the authors knowledge the present work is the first attempt to understand the ec process with and without aeration using aluminum anodes through in depth analysis supported by characterization aluminum anodes were chosen because of their superior performance for the treatment of oily wastewater over iron as reported in previous studies 16 the electrochemical cells used in this study are described as non aerated and aerated also scum and foam are interchangeably used for the surface suspensions while sludge is mostly used to describe the sediments we believe that this study will contribute to knowledge development through a better understanding of the removal mechanisms and the fate of oil in the aerated electrochemical processes used for oil water separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of synthetic oily wastewater a 0 5 l synthetic oily wastewater sample was prepared for each experiment by mixing deionized water and 200 mg l 1 164 2 2 1 mg l 1 cod of commercial vegetable oil pure corn oil using ika t25 ultra turrax homogenizer 23 000 rpm for 30 min a sample was kept to check the homogenous single phase shelf life which lasted for at least 5 days nacl was used as a supporting electrolyte yielding a conductivity of 1780 11 μs cm 1 the initial ph of the sample is 3 8 2 2 analytical methods samples taken from the experiments were all filtered using a 1 0 μm glass microfiber disc hach cod values were measured using the hach detection cuvette lck 514 and lci 500 for the feed and the treated samples respectively the hach cuvettes were analyzed using hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer with radio frequency identification rfid technology conductivity measurements on all samples were carried out using a hach hq40d probe the ph measurements were conducted using a wtw ph ion 7320 probe the sludge and or scum were dried in the memmert uf55 oven and collected for further analyses quanta250 scanning electron microscope sem was used for both the dried sludge scum and the electrodes surface morphology analyses at hv 10 kv and spot 1 0 the dried sludge scum was coated with palladium and gold via a sputtering machine before sem imaging quanta 3d feg energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was used to characterize the elements in both the sludge scum and electrodes deposits 2 3 experimental set up all experiments were conducted in a batch mode in a 12 12 16 cm lxwxh container with 0 5 l of synthetic oily wastewater sample for each experiment fig 1 aluminum al circularly perforated sheet 15 10 cm as an anode for enhanced mixing of water and aeration around the surface of the electrodes 17 stainless steel ss mesh 15 10 cm was used as the cathode the active surface area of the anode was 22 5 cm2 the al ss pair of electrodes were installed vertically in each container with a 4 cm gap in between and a 3 cm immersed height electrodes were connected to extech 0 36 v 0 5 a dc power supply aeration for ef cells was provided via xilong ap 005 air pump connected to a ring shaped air stone 5 and 7 5 cm for inner and outer diameter respectively placed at the bottom of the reactor aerated and non aerated experiments were conducted at four current densities 30 60 90 and 120 a m 2 where new sacrificial anode was used for each current density samples were taken at 30 60 and 90 min in aerated experiments aeration at 1 5 l min 1 was applied the cod removals are expressed as time mean values with their corresponding standard deviations fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental set up 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of current density and aeration on cod removal increasing the current density resulted in an apparent increase in cod removal percentage for all experiments which was in line with the previous studies 18 introducing aeration at the base of the reactor enhanced cod removal at all applied current densities fig 2 illustrates a comparison between the cells cod removal in aerated and non aerated cells at 30 a m 2 the non aerated cell achieved 78 2 3 0 cod removal compared to 86 8 2 6 for the aerated cell at the same current density aeration yielded an increase in cod removal of 12 1 on average aeration at the bottom of the reactor enhances mixing of the solution and creates turbulence around the electrodes thus allowing the evasion of the reactive species from the anode i e electrochemically produced coagulants reach the bulk liquid promoting their collision with the oil emulsions and thus creating more and bigger flocs 19 these effects promote more adsorption of oil emulsions to the flocs and their entrapment by the electrocoagulants constituting two main mechanisms of oil removal in the ec process 16 with visual observation as shown in fig 5 in all non aerated cells foam covered mostly the whole water surface with higher intensity around the electrodes where most of the electro produced gases ascend on the contrary foam formation at the electrodes was not observed in aerated cells in the duration of the reaction as ef is promoted by the production of o2 and h2 gases at the anode and cathode respectively the absence of air bubbles and mixing in the vicinity around the electrodes allows the electrochemically produced gases to rise uninterruptedly and attach to micro emulsions and ultimately float on the surface in a foam like scum this difference is expected as ef and ec coincide when a sacrificial anode is utilized 11 this also explains the subtle difference observed for non aerated cells from 30 a m 2 to 60 a m 2 both ef and ec processes are promoted via an increase in the current density for ef a higher current density results in smaller and greater amounts of o2 and h2 gas bubbles at the anode and cathode respectively 7 aluminum dissolution also increases with current density according to faraday s law and that promotes more flocs formation and improvement to ec increasing current density in the absence of aeration would enhance ef and ec with greater extent to ef since ec is more efficient with aeration hence the small increase in cod removal from 30 a m 2 to 60 a m 2 can be attributed to a relatively small enhancement of ef as a result of increasing the number and decreasing the size of the electrogenerated gas bubbles 3 2 effect of aeration on the ph of the solution after 90 min of reaction time at an initial ph of 3 8 it was observed that the ph of non aerated solutions increased to ph 3 9 4 9 at 30 120 a m 2 of applied current densities fig 3 aerated solutions exhibited a neutral ph ranging from 6 9 to 7 6 at termination which is considered as a main advantage of ec processes the ph is an important factor affecting the charge of the particles and therefore the overall process performance many studies have investigated the effect of initial ph on the performance of ef 18 20 and ec 21 the main reason for the neutralization in ec solutions is the production of oh ions at the cathode which raises the ph of the solution 11 also oxygen reduction can take place at the cathode by consuming h with excess oxygen due to aeration more hydrogen ions are consumed in which may additionally contribute to higher ph as compared to the non aerated tank 22 aeration might also enable a higher active area by scouring the cathode and hence accelerating cathode reactions the enhanced cod removal can be attributed to aluminum hydrolysis species that strongly depends on the ph of the solution 23 at ph 5 al starts to form long polymeric hydrolysis species due to complexation with water molecules in which al acts as a metal center to water ligands at ph 6 al complexes break down favoring the formation of al oh 3 which is the main electrocoagulant of the al based ec process 23 24 considering the effect of aeration in increasing the ph of the solution stronger coagulants are being formed polymeric and al oh 3 flocs in aerated experiments due to the different range of ph established in these solutions non aerated experiments did not reach ph 5 at any of the current densities and hence only formed dimeric and trimeric al species 23 al3 which can form complexes with negatively charged oil emulsions is abundant at ph 4 25 however h is readily available at such acidic conditions occupying any free binding sites in organic ligands oil emulsions and thus resulting in low formation of al oil complexes and lower removal of oil 26 consequently oil emulsions are mostly removed physically by adsorption to al water complexes and less by chemical binding to al trivalent ions during an ec process 3 3 sludge scum characterization 3 3 1 visual observation in non aerated experiments light scum was observed at the surface at lower current densities and became denser at 90 and 120 a m 2 denser scum foam was produced in non aerated experiments with the highest volume attributed to the highest current density i e at 120 a m 2 and vice versa this is expected as higher current densities produce more o2 and h2 gases and hence more flotation of oil emulsions transported upwards contributing to the overall removal of oil along with oil emulsions electro coagulated species were also present due to the use of the sacrificial anode aluminum after the completion of the non aerated experiments the cells were kept intact at least one day and most of the scum settled to the bottom with some remains still floating due to buoyancy as shown in fig 4 furthermore aerated experiments did not exhibit similar behavior of the foam formation due to the presence of the continuous stream of air bubbles mixing the solution instead an elusive and loose gel like agglomerate was observed to form in the vicinity of the electrodes which intensified with an increase in duration higher intensity of agglomerate formation was observed at higher current densities which could be attributed to the surplus aluminum dissolution products contributing to the formation of coagulants when kept to settle the supernatant was very clear and the gel like agglomerates densified at the bottom of the reactor fig 5 such observation was also confirmed in previous studies 10 24 when the sludge and or scum of all experiments were dried non aerated scums yielded variable size grains per the different current densities as depicted in the sem images fig 6 aerated gel like sludge produced an oily fragile layer after drying which was relatively high in volume amount and less settable the whole volume of sludge descended but in a decompressed form thickened layer on the contrary most of the sludge of a non aerated cell settled within the first 24 h except for minor amounts that kept floating on the surface 3 3 2 surface morphology of dried sludge scum sem and eds analyses dried sludge and or scum were subjected to sem and eds analyses for characterization fig 6 presents sem images for non aerated sludge grain sizes the size of the grains follows a clear trend with larger grains formed at the higher the current density that can be attributed to the same reason for increasing scum intensity with current density extra electro coagulants and the higher probability of forming monomeric aluminum hydroxide complexes 10 based on the eds analysis of non aerated sludge shown in fig 7 superficial agglomerations of crystals of nacl are observed on the grains with more intensity on the smaller sludge flocs formed at 30 a m 2 which are embedded into aluminum oxide complexes with trapped oil two possible scenarios are proposed first and least foreseen a desalination effect could occur due to the presence of an electric field resulting in the movement of salt ions and charged oil droplets to the respective opposing electrode charge in such movement localized entanglements can occur between the oil emulsions and salt ions producing complex ions or perhaps weak intermolecular forces between polar branches functional groups in the oil emulsions and salt ions second and most plausible the drying of the sludge inevitably leaves behind salt crystals which in turn resided on the surface of the grains eds analyses along with sem images for non aerated and aerated dried sludge are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively all sludge analyses yielded sharp peaks for al and o which is expected due to the formation of electrocoagulants in situ this was also observed in previous studies 27 comparing al peaks from different eds graphs can be risky especially that each sample is different in morphology which can affect the absolute values of eds spectrums hence only the relative amounts of al and o were discussed and compared the relative amounts of al to o in non aerated are lower than those of aerated sludge in non aerated cells electrogenerated gases are rising uninterruptedly due to the absence of aeration that allows more o particles to reside in the foam scum when compared to aerated cells also the formation of different coagulants in both types of experiments can affect this ratio non aerated experiments are expected to accommodate the release of monomeric aluminum hydroxide coagulants in the solution given that the proportion of o is relatively higher than al in contrast with relatively higher al to o content aerated cells are more likely to produce long polymeric coagulants possibly the keggin cation al13o4 oh 24 7 11 that can be confirmed with the structure of the samples in which non aerated samples are grains amassed of smaller agglomerates sem images of aerated samples showed a layered structure indicating a long building block i e polymeric chains however the structure in aerated samples differ notably among themselves at different current densities the higher the current density the grainier the surface layer an explanation for this is that al trivalent ions are consumed readily at the first couple of seconds in the reactor 28 and with continuous mixing al hydroxide complexes grow in size and produce long polymeric chains however al is known to have a stable passivation film formed by al2o3 in a ph range of 4 8 3 at room temperature 25 c as can be seen from the pourbiax diagram 22 this film protects the anode from dissolving more al ions into the solution at this point with the presence of cl ions in the solution pitting effect may take place resulting in the release of more al ions in the solution in a delayed effect 29 fig 9 and hence the formation of monomeric grainy flocs on top of the layered polymeric coagulants all of this is presumed to be promoted accelerated with increasing current density 3 4 electrodes characterization 3 4 1 anodes fig 9 shows the sem images for the anodes of all experiments as expected it is observed that at higher current densities for all experiments higher amounts and deeper pits and scratches were found at the surface of the anode that resembles the loss of the sacrificial metal into the solution when the current is initiated however the formation of the deep pits supports the aforementioned hypothesis of vigorous action by the cl ions on the passivation film of the al anode both aerated and non aerated cells experienced anodic electrodeposition which is expected due to the dominance of negatively charged surfaces of the suspended oil droplets however this observed electrophoresis of oil droplets is dependent on the ph concerning the isoelectric point of the solution oil droplets in water exhibit a negative surface charge and they also attract hydronium ions at the interface being a hydrophobic surface 30 at a ph above the isoelectric point of the solution around 2 5 for oil droplets the resultant charge of the surface would yield a negative total surface charge as the amount of absorbed h3o does not overcome the negative surface charge of the oil droplet consequently oil droplets exhibit electrophoresis towards the anode migrating towards the oppositely charged electrode 30 eds analyses of different samples cannot lead to quantitative comparison unless calibrated instead of calibration ratios of elements in a sample were compared to others and by that guaranteeing the abatement of any outstanding variances noise in the graphs using intensities of elements from the eds analyses o al and c o ratios were obtained for comparison non aerated anodes have shown a declining o al ratio with increasing current density while aerated anodes exhibited an opposite trend without aeration in the cell increasing current density imposes more dissolution of al trivalent ions into the solution and with the presence of cl ions in the vicinity the rate of maintaining the passivation film is much slower than its deterioration and therefore lower o al ratio the opposite trend observed in aerated cells is linked to more oxygen provided to the reactor volume allowing for readily available oxygen in the proximity of the anode s surface deterioration of the passivation film still occurs in aerated cells however more deposition on the electrode has resulted in an overall increase in o al ratio as shown in fig 10 at 30 a m 2 current density the non aerated cell yielded a higher o al ratio than the aerated cell the two factors affecting this ratio namely passivation film formation and floc deposition on the electrode might not have a paramount effect at a low current density to favor a higher ratio for the aerated cell moreover carbon to oxygen ratios i e c o ratios were considered for all anodes the carbon which resembles oil deposition at the anodes was anchored to oxygen in this ratio instead of aluminum as both c and o are superficial and are not part of the bulk composition of the anode as opposed to al all non aerated cells had shown a higher c o ratio compared to their aerated counterparts for anodes fig 11 this may be explained by the destabilization of the electrostatic interactions near the surface of the electrodes due to vigorous aeration or scouring albeit the apparent higher deposition c o ratio of non aerated cells it failed to surpass aerated cells in the overall removal of cod indicating that electrophoresis of oil is a minor phenomenon taking place in such an electrochemical cell for the trend across different current densities the higher current would increase the flow of al ions from the anode and more resistance to the opposite motion of depositions towards the surface of the anode this explains the drop of c o ratio from 30 a m 2 to 60 a m 2 the discrepancy in the trend afterward might reflect other perturbations taking place at the vicinity of the anode s surface resulting in the ratio staying more or less the same for both sets of experiments remarkably at 120 a m 2 of an aerated cell the eds graph shows mostly equal spikes for na and cl indicating the presence of salt on the surface of the anode that can be attributed to the trapped salt ions within the coagulant complexes which is a probable incidence giving the presence of na and cl together if one of the ions cl spiked profoundly in the absence of na it could then be attributed to an electrophoresis effect of salt ions where ion migrates to its opposing charged electrode revisiting the presence of salt on the dried sludge the scenario of a desalination effect can be reinforced with the eds graph of the 120 a m 2 aerated experiment fig 12 d however these infinitesimal salt removals are to be conformal with subtle salinity fluctuations during experiments 3 4 2 cathodes unexpectedly sem images for the cathodes shown in fig 13 revealed minimal depositions on the surface of the cathodes especially for high current densities the abundance of na ions in the solution might have resulted in attaching to the negatively charged surfaces of oil droplets resulting in an overall positive charge hence positive electrophoresis towards the cathode eds analysis for the cathodes fig 14 revealed the presence of na thus supporting the premise above also a portion of the cumulative c spikes in the cathodes eds can be attributed to the depositions in which the rest is part of the pristine stainless steel composition the main hindrance in quantifying oil deposition on the cathodes using eds is the heterogeneous nature of the stainless steel hence only cautious qualitative analysis is feasible 3 5 energy consumption analysis specific energy consumption sec was calculated for both sets of experiments using eq 7 7 s e c k w h k g o f c o d r e m o v e d t 0 h t 1 5 h v i t p a i r t t o t a l δ c o d v 1000 where v is the voltage v i is the current a t is the electrolysis time h p a i r is the power of the aeration pump t t o t a l is the total aeration time h δ c o d is the amount of cod removed mg l 1 and v is the effective reactor volume l the summation part of eq 7 resembles the energy consumption by the direct current while the second part accounts for the aeration energy consumption fig 15 a depicts the sec with cd covering both aerated and non aerated experiments electrical energy by order eeo was also calculated to quantify the effect imposed by aeration only on the power consumed by the ec cell it specifically reflects the power required kwh to reduce the concentration of a contaminant cod in this case by one order of magnitude per 1 m3 of water sample 31 eeo was calculated using eq 8 8 e e o k w h m 3 o r d e r t 0 h t 1 5 h v i t v log c o d i c o d t where v is the voltage v i is the current a t is the electrolysis time h v is the effective reactor volume l c o d i and c o d t are the initial and final cod concentrations mg l 1 respectively fig 15b shows eeo values for both aerated and non aerated experiments at different current densities the sec for non aerated experiments has ranged from 5 73 to 61 23 kw h kg 1 of cod removed from 30 to 120 a m 2 respectively saeedi et al 32 have achieved comparable results of an ec process using aluminum electrodes obtaining 11 66 and 19 38 kw h kg 1 of cod removal for 250 and 400 a m 2 respectively prakash et al 33 have achieved an optimized sec of 1 32 kw h kg 1 of cod removed at 123 46 a m 2 in the treatment of synthetic dairy wastewater using aluminum electrodes however both the above works were conducted without aeration non aerated experiments have shown much less specific energy consumption compared to aerated especially for low current densities fig 15a that is primarily attributed to the extra watts 5 w required for the aeration also the total cell potential in aerated cells were observed to be a bit higher than non aerated cells which might be caused by the presence of air imposing a higher inter electrode ohmic drop due to the resistance of air in water and or the higher deposition of oil emulsions on the surface of the aerated anodes that difference in cell potential is translated to an sec increase of 1 58 and 9 87 kw h kg 1 of cod removed for 30 and 120 a m 2 experiments respectively however eeo values fig 15b show a drastic difference between aerated and non aerated cells inferring that the apparent voltage increase in aerated cells does not reflect an increase in energy consumption on the contrary the utilization of power in an aerated cell was far more efficient than a non aerated cell in removing cod for a unit volume accordingly aeration has intrinsically improved the ec process and made it less power exhaustive sec can be considered as a bigger scale measure of the economics of the process incorporating all sorts of energy used while eeo reflects the basic economics of the process devoid of auxiliaries with the current design of the electrochemical cell the introduction of aeration has shown an increased cod removal percentage and reduced electrical energy consumption however it is not economically justified as per sec values a better design of the reactor with optimization on the geometry would yield an enhanced performance overall and minimize any dead zones in the reactor this can be achieved by optimizing the inter electrode gap and air flowrates hence less aeration can be used to increase the efficiency of the cell for cod removal which allows operating at low currents extending the life time of the electrodes operating the aerated cell at 30 a m 2 results in similar cod removal as 120 a m 2 without aeration at higher energy consumption but with four times less consumption of the electrodes that is the case as the amount of metal dissolution is directly proportional to the applied current according to faraday s law of electrolysis 4 conclusion ec aerated and non aerated process in treating a synthetic oily wastewater sample using an al sacrificial anode was analyzed from a macro and micro scale results have shown an increased removal efficiency for aerated compared to non aerated cells around 12 enhancement different mechanisms were deduced to contribute to the overall removal of oil which are mainly adsorption and entrapment of oil emulsions to the al water insoluble complexes electrophoresis and electrodeposition of oil emulsions were present but with minimal contribution to the removal of cod aeration induced different effects on the surface of the electrodes and the form of produced sludge visual observation and sem images revealed increased electrocoagulation activity due to the increased mixing in the reactor the sludge of the aerated cell formed a gel like structure covering greater volume than the foamy and grainy sludge of the non aerated cell anodes in aerated cells were consumed more homogenously and received more depositions of oil on their surfaces albeit the superior performance of aerated over the non aerated it consumed multiple folds of energy due to aeration and or higher deposition on the anodes a full fetched optimization of the reactor especially the geometry would enhance the overall performance and possibly reduce the huge discrepancy in energy consumption between aerated and non aerated cells also investigating a broader spectrum of airflow and different patterns designs of air stones can significantly boost the efficacy of ec process while decreasing their specific energy consumption observing different electrochemical effects in situ using advanced set ups see ross 34 can refine the proposed mechanisms for different processes and correlate to the accuracy of predictive models declaration of competing interest none of the authors has conflicting interests

discharge is required to abide by the environmental regulations with a better option of reutilizing the treated oily wastewater in relevant applications various treatments have been implemented and tested for oily wastewater from different sources such as membrane filtration adsorption dissolved air flotation chemical coagulation and advanced oxidation processes aops 1 however these processes suffer from several drawbacks e g low efficiency 4 and membrane fouling 5 when treating stable and small sized few micrometers oil in water emulsions electrochemical processes including electroflotation ef electrocoagulation ec and electrooxidation eo proved efficient in the destabilization of such emulsions these chemical free processes outperform other technologies with greater efficiencies while producing minimal waste and consuming less energy more environmentally friendly remediation 3 ef is characterized by the production of oxygen and hydrogen gases at the anode and cathode respectively in which small bubbles are formed and conveyed upwards while rising the bubbles encounter and attach to oil droplets sweeping them to the top the mechanism of such interaction was suggested to occur in four steps collision and attachment to the oil emulsion formation of agglomerates entrapment of more bubbles and lastly sweeping up the floc i e flotation 6 higher current density results in the production of smaller bubble sizes and hence the removal of smaller suspended pollutants 7 on the other hand ec occurs when a sacrificial electrode is used in the electrochemical cell where the anode dissolves into the solution producing metal ions which in turn get hydrolyzed to form monomeric and polymeric hydroxides for example when aluminum anodes are used al oh 3 forms eventually constituting the in situ produced coagulants which destabilizes the relatively high zeta potential oil emulsions and neutralizes its charge 8 hydrogen gas is also produced at the cathode while minimal to no oxygen gas production at the anode depending on the applied potential and ph of the solution the following are known to be the reactions taking place at the different electrodes of an electrochemical cell with a sacrificial anode at the anode 8 1 m s m a q n n e 2 2 h 2 o l 4 h a q o 2 g 4 e at the cathode 8 3 m a q n n e m s 4 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 o h a q in the solution after complex reactions 9 5 m a q 3 3 h 2 o l m o h 3 s 3 h a q the formed metal hydroxides form a gel like structure characterized by high adsorption capacity which enmeshes the dispersed oil emulsions 10 11 many studies have shown the efficiency of ec in treating oily wastewater from different sources varying different parameters 2 however few studies investigated the effect of aeration on the performance of the electrochemical cell moussavi et al 12 have conducted a study on the treatment of contaminated groundwater by electrocoagulation using fe electrodes the performance of the process was evaluated by the removal of total petroleum hydrocarbon tph which was increased from 73 to 95 after the introduction of aeration it was concluded that aeration increased the formation of fe oh 3 flocs by forming more fe3 ions due to increased oxygen in the solution similar studies 13 14 have conducted ec using fe electrodes and observed cod removal enhancement with aeration which was attributed to the performance enhancement to the increased conversion of ferrous into ferric ions in the presence of aeration higher dissolved oxygen also the continuous aeration served in enhancing mixing and collisions of pollutants and electrocoagulants 14 priya and jeyanthi 15 performed ec using cu anodes and concluded that aeration has boosted the anodic reactions resulting in more coagulant forming ions cu2 to the solution to the best of the authors knowledge the present work is the first attempt to understand the ec process with and without aeration using aluminum anodes through in depth analysis supported by characterization aluminum anodes were chosen because of their superior performance for the treatment of oily wastewater over iron as reported in previous studies 16 the electrochemical cells used in this study are described as non aerated and aerated also scum and foam are interchangeably used for the surface suspensions while sludge is mostly used to describe the sediments we believe that this study will contribute to knowledge development through a better understanding of the removal mechanisms and the fate of oil in the aerated electrochemical processes used for oil water separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of synthetic oily wastewater a 0 5 l synthetic oily wastewater sample was prepared for each experiment by mixing deionized water and 200 mg l 1 164 2 2 1 mg l 1 cod of commercial vegetable oil pure corn oil using ika t25 ultra turrax homogenizer 23 000 rpm for 30 min a sample was kept to check the homogenous single phase shelf life which lasted for at least 5 days nacl was used as a supporting electrolyte yielding a conductivity of 1780 11 μs cm 1 the initial ph of the sample is 3 8 2 2 analytical methods samples taken from the experiments were all filtered using a 1 0 μm glass microfiber disc hach cod values were measured using the hach detection cuvette lck 514 and lci 500 for the feed and the treated samples respectively the hach cuvettes were analyzed using hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer with radio frequency identification rfid technology conductivity measurements on all samples were carried out using a hach hq40d probe the ph measurements were conducted using a wtw ph ion 7320 probe the sludge and or scum were dried in the memmert uf55 oven and collected for further analyses quanta250 scanning electron microscope sem was used for both the dried sludge scum and the electrodes surface morphology analyses at hv 10 kv and spot 1 0 the dried sludge scum was coated with palladium and gold via a sputtering machine before sem imaging quanta 3d feg energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was used to characterize the elements in both the sludge scum and electrodes deposits 2 3 experimental set up all experiments were conducted in a batch mode in a 12 12 16 cm lxwxh container with 0 5 l of synthetic oily wastewater sample for each experiment fig 1 aluminum al circularly perforated sheet 15 10 cm as an anode for enhanced mixing of water and aeration around the surface of the electrodes 17 stainless steel ss mesh 15 10 cm was used as the cathode the active surface area of the anode was 22 5 cm2 the al ss pair of electrodes were installed vertically in each container with a 4 cm gap in between and a 3 cm immersed height electrodes were connected to extech 0 36 v 0 5 a dc power supply aeration for ef cells was provided via xilong ap 005 air pump connected to a ring shaped air stone 5 and 7 5 cm for inner and outer diameter respectively placed at the bottom of the reactor aerated and non aerated experiments were conducted at four current densities 30 60 90 and 120 a m 2 where new sacrificial anode was used for each current density samples were taken at 30 60 and 90 min in aerated experiments aeration at 1 5 l min 1 was applied the cod removals are expressed as time mean values with their corresponding standard deviations fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental set up 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of current density and aeration on cod removal increasing the current density resulted in an apparent increase in cod removal percentage for all experiments which was in line with the previous studies 18 introducing aeration at the base of the reactor enhanced cod removal at all applied current densities fig 2 illustrates a comparison between the cells cod removal in aerated and non aerated cells at 30 a m 2 the non aerated cell achieved 78 2 3 0 cod removal compared to 86 8 2 6 for the aerated cell at the same current density aeration yielded an increase in cod removal of 12 1 on average aeration at the bottom of the reactor enhances mixing of the solution and creates turbulence around the electrodes thus allowing the evasion of the reactive species from the anode i e electrochemically produced coagulants reach the bulk liquid promoting their collision with the oil emulsions and thus creating more and bigger flocs 19 these effects promote more adsorption of oil emulsions to the flocs and their entrapment by the electrocoagulants constituting two main mechanisms of oil removal in the ec process 16 with visual observation as shown in fig 5 in all non aerated cells foam covered mostly the whole water surface with higher intensity around the electrodes where most of the electro produced gases ascend on the contrary foam formation at the electrodes was not observed in aerated cells in the duration of the reaction as ef is promoted by the production of o2 and h2 gases at the anode and cathode respectively the absence of air bubbles and mixing in the vicinity around the electrodes allows the electrochemically produced gases to rise uninterruptedly and attach to micro emulsions and ultimately float on the surface in a foam like scum this difference is expected as ef and ec coincide when a sacrificial anode is utilized 11 this also explains the subtle difference observed for non aerated cells from 30 a m 2 to 60 a m 2 both ef and ec processes are promoted via an increase in the current density for ef a higher current density results in smaller and greater amounts of o2 and h2 gas bubbles at the anode and cathode respectively 7 aluminum dissolution also increases with current density according to faraday s law and that promotes more flocs formation and improvement to ec increasing current density in the absence of aeration would enhance ef and ec with greater extent to ef since ec is more efficient with aeration hence the small increase in cod removal from 30 a m 2 to 60 a m 2 can be attributed to a relatively small enhancement of ef as a result of increasing the number and decreasing the size of the electrogenerated gas bubbles 3 2 effect of aeration on the ph of the solution after 90 min of reaction time at an initial ph of 3 8 it was observed that the ph of non aerated solutions increased to ph 3 9 4 9 at 30 120 a m 2 of applied current densities fig 3 aerated solutions exhibited a neutral ph ranging from 6 9 to 7 6 at termination which is considered as a main advantage of ec processes the ph is an important factor affecting the charge of the particles and therefore the overall process performance many studies have investigated the effect of initial ph on the performance of ef 18 20 and ec 21 the main reason for the neutralization in ec solutions is the production of oh ions at the cathode which raises the ph of the solution 11 also oxygen reduction can take place at the cathode by consuming h with excess oxygen due to aeration more hydrogen ions are consumed in which may additionally contribute to higher ph as compared to the non aerated tank 22 aeration might also enable a higher active area by scouring the cathode and hence accelerating cathode reactions the enhanced cod removal can be attributed to aluminum hydrolysis species that strongly depends on the ph of the solution 23 at ph 5 al starts to form long polymeric hydrolysis species due to complexation with water molecules in which al acts as a metal center to water ligands at ph 6 al complexes break down favoring the formation of al oh 3 which is the main electrocoagulant of the al based ec process 23 24 considering the effect of aeration in increasing the ph of the solution stronger coagulants are being formed polymeric and al oh 3 flocs in aerated experiments due to the different range of ph established in these solutions non aerated experiments did not reach ph 5 at any of the current densities and hence only formed dimeric and trimeric al species 23 al3 which can form complexes with negatively charged oil emulsions is abundant at ph 4 25 however h is readily available at such acidic conditions occupying any free binding sites in organic ligands oil emulsions and thus resulting in low formation of al oil complexes and lower removal of oil 26 consequently oil emulsions are mostly removed physically by adsorption to al water complexes and less by chemical binding to al trivalent ions during an ec process 3 3 sludge scum characterization 3 3 1 visual observation in non aerated experiments light scum was observed at the surface at lower current densities and became denser at 90 and 120 a m 2 denser scum foam was produced in non aerated experiments with the highest volume attributed to the highest current density i e at 120 a m 2 and vice versa this is expected as higher current densities produce more o2 and h2 gases and hence more flotation of oil emulsions transported upwards contributing to the overall removal of oil along with oil emulsions electro coagulated species were also present due to the use of the sacrificial anode aluminum after the completion of the non aerated experiments the cells were kept intact at least one day and most of the scum settled to the bottom with some remains still floating due to buoyancy as shown in fig 4 furthermore aerated experiments did not exhibit similar behavior of the foam formation due to the presence of the continuous stream of air bubbles mixing the solution instead an elusive and loose gel like agglomerate was observed to form in the vicinity of the electrodes which intensified with an increase in duration higher intensity of agglomerate formation was observed at higher current densities which could be attributed to the surplus aluminum dissolution products contributing to the formation of coagulants when kept to settle the supernatant was very clear and the gel like agglomerates densified at the bottom of the reactor fig 5 such observation was also confirmed in previous studies 10 24 when the sludge and or scum of all experiments were dried non aerated scums yielded variable size grains per the different current densities as depicted in the sem images fig 6 aerated gel like sludge produced an oily fragile layer after drying which was relatively high in volume amount and less settable the whole volume of sludge descended but in a decompressed form thickened layer on the contrary most of the sludge of a non aerated cell settled within the first 24 h except for minor amounts that kept floating on the surface 3 3 2 surface morphology of dried sludge scum sem and eds analyses dried sludge and or scum were subjected to sem and eds analyses for characterization fig 6 presents sem images for non aerated sludge grain sizes the size of the grains follows a clear trend with larger grains formed at the higher the current density that can be attributed to the same reason for increasing scum intensity with current density extra electro coagulants and the higher probability of forming monomeric aluminum hydroxide complexes 10 based on the eds analysis of non aerated sludge shown in fig 7 superficial agglomerations of crystals of nacl are observed on the grains with more intensity on the smaller sludge flocs formed at 30 a m 2 which are embedded into aluminum oxide complexes with trapped oil two possible scenarios are proposed first and least foreseen a desalination effect could occur due to the presence of an electric field resulting in the movement of salt ions and charged oil droplets to the respective opposing electrode charge in such movement localized entanglements can occur between the oil emulsions and salt ions producing complex ions or perhaps weak intermolecular forces between polar branches functional groups in the oil emulsions and salt ions second and most plausible the drying of the sludge inevitably leaves behind salt crystals which in turn resided on the surface of the grains eds analyses along with sem images for non aerated and aerated dried sludge are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively all sludge analyses yielded sharp peaks for al and o which is expected due to the formation of electrocoagulants in situ this was also observed in previous studies 27 comparing al peaks from different eds graphs can be risky especially that each sample is different in morphology which can affect the absolute values of eds spectrums hence only the relative amounts of al and o were discussed and compared the relative amounts of al to o in non aerated are lower than those of aerated sludge in non aerated cells electrogenerated gases are rising uninterruptedly due to the absence of aeration that allows more o particles to reside in the foam scum when compared to aerated cells also the formation of different coagulants in both types of experiments can affect this ratio non aerated experiments are expected to accommodate the release of monomeric aluminum hydroxide coagulants in the solution given that the proportion of o is relatively higher than al in contrast with relatively higher al to o content aerated cells are more likely to produce long polymeric coagulants possibly the keggin cation al13o4 oh 24 7 11 that can be confirmed with the structure of the samples in which non aerated samples are grains amassed of smaller agglomerates sem images of aerated samples showed a layered structure indicating a long building block i e polymeric chains however the structure in aerated samples differ notably among themselves at different current densities the higher the current density the grainier the surface layer an explanation for this is that al trivalent ions are consumed readily at the first couple of seconds in the reactor 28 and with continuous mixing al hydroxide complexes grow in size and produce long polymeric chains however al is known to have a stable passivation film formed by al2o3 in a ph range of 4 8 3 at room temperature 25 c as can be seen from the pourbiax diagram 22 this film protects the anode from dissolving more al ions into the solution at this point with the presence of cl ions in the solution pitting effect may take place resulting in the release of more al ions in the solution in a delayed effect 29 fig 9 and hence the formation of monomeric grainy flocs on top of the layered polymeric coagulants all of this is presumed to be promoted accelerated with increasing current density 3 4 electrodes characterization 3 4 1 anodes fig 9 shows the sem images for the anodes of all experiments as expected it is observed that at higher current densities for all experiments higher amounts and deeper pits and scratches were found at the surface of the anode that resembles the loss of the sacrificial metal into the solution when the current is initiated however the formation of the deep pits supports the aforementioned hypothesis of vigorous action by the cl ions on the passivation film of the al anode both aerated and non aerated cells experienced anodic electrodeposition which is expected due to the dominance of negatively charged surfaces of the suspended oil droplets however this observed electrophoresis of oil droplets is dependent on the ph concerning the isoelectric point of the solution oil droplets in water exhibit a negative surface charge and they also attract hydronium ions at the interface being a hydrophobic surface 30 at a ph above the isoelectric point of the solution around 2 5 for oil droplets the resultant charge of the surface would yield a negative total surface charge as the amount of absorbed h3o does not overcome the negative surface charge of the oil droplet consequently oil droplets exhibit electrophoresis towards the anode migrating towards the oppositely charged electrode 30 eds analyses of different samples cannot lead to quantitative comparison unless calibrated instead of calibration ratios of elements in a sample were compared to others and by that guaranteeing the abatement of any outstanding variances noise in the graphs using intensities of elements from the eds analyses o al and c o ratios were obtained for comparison non aerated anodes have shown a declining o al ratio with increasing current density while aerated anodes exhibited an opposite trend without aeration in the cell increasing current density imposes more dissolution of al trivalent ions into the solution and with the presence of cl ions in the vicinity the rate of maintaining the passivation film is much slower than its deterioration and therefore lower o al ratio the opposite trend observed in aerated cells is linked to more oxygen provided to the reactor volume allowing for readily available oxygen in the proximity of the anode s surface deterioration of the passivation film still occurs in aerated cells however more deposition on the electrode has resulted in an overall increase in o al ratio as shown in fig 10 at 30 a m 2 current density the non aerated cell yielded a higher o al ratio than the aerated cell the two factors affecting this ratio namely passivation film formation and floc deposition on the electrode might not have a paramount effect at a low current density to favor a higher ratio for the aerated cell moreover carbon to oxygen ratios i e c o ratios were considered for all anodes the carbon which resembles oil deposition at the anodes was anchored to oxygen in this ratio instead of aluminum as both c and o are superficial and are not part of the bulk composition of the anode as opposed to al all non aerated cells had shown a higher c o ratio compared to their aerated counterparts for anodes fig 11 this may be explained by the destabilization of the electrostatic interactions near the surface of the electrodes due to vigorous aeration or scouring albeit the apparent higher deposition c o ratio of non aerated cells it failed to surpass aerated cells in the overall removal of cod indicating that electrophoresis of oil is a minor phenomenon taking place in such an electrochemical cell for the trend across different current densities the higher current would increase the flow of al ions from the anode and more resistance to the opposite motion of depositions towards the surface of the anode this explains the drop of c o ratio from 30 a m 2 to 60 a m 2 the discrepancy in the trend afterward might reflect other perturbations taking place at the vicinity of the anode s surface resulting in the ratio staying more or less the same for both sets of experiments remarkably at 120 a m 2 of an aerated cell the eds graph shows mostly equal spikes for na and cl indicating the presence of salt on the surface of the anode that can be attributed to the trapped salt ions within the coagulant complexes which is a probable incidence giving the presence of na and cl together if one of the ions cl spiked profoundly in the absence of na it could then be attributed to an electrophoresis effect of salt ions where ion migrates to its opposing charged electrode revisiting the presence of salt on the dried sludge the scenario of a desalination effect can be reinforced with the eds graph of the 120 a m 2 aerated experiment fig 12 d however these infinitesimal salt removals are to be conformal with subtle salinity fluctuations during experiments 3 4 2 cathodes unexpectedly sem images for the cathodes shown in fig 13 revealed minimal depositions on the surface of the cathodes especially for high current densities the abundance of na ions in the solution might have resulted in attaching to the negatively charged surfaces of oil droplets resulting in an overall positive charge hence positive electrophoresis towards the cathode eds analysis for the cathodes fig 14 revealed the presence of na thus supporting the premise above also a portion of the cumulative c spikes in the cathodes eds can be attributed to the depositions in which the rest is part of the pristine stainless steel composition the main hindrance in quantifying oil deposition on the cathodes using eds is the heterogeneous nature of the stainless steel hence only cautious qualitative analysis is feasible 3 5 energy consumption analysis specific energy consumption sec was calculated for both sets of experiments using eq 7 7 s e c k w h k g o f c o d r e m o v e d t 0 h t 1 5 h v i t p a i r t t o t a l δ c o d v 1000 where v is the voltage v i is the current a t is the electrolysis time h p a i r is the power of the aeration pump t t o t a l is the total aeration time h δ c o d is the amount of cod removed mg l 1 and v is the effective reactor volume l the summation part of eq 7 resembles the energy consumption by the direct current while the second part accounts for the aeration energy consumption fig 15 a depicts the sec with cd covering both aerated and non aerated experiments electrical energy by order eeo was also calculated to quantify the effect imposed by aeration only on the power consumed by the ec cell it specifically reflects the power required kwh to reduce the concentration of a contaminant cod in this case by one order of magnitude per 1 m3 of water sample 31 eeo was calculated using eq 8 8 e e o k w h m 3 o r d e r t 0 h t 1 5 h v i t v log c o d i c o d t where v is the voltage v i is the current a t is the electrolysis time h v is the effective reactor volume l c o d i and c o d t are the initial and final cod concentrations mg l 1 respectively fig 15b shows eeo values for both aerated and non aerated experiments at different current densities the sec for non aerated experiments has ranged from 5 73 to 61 23 kw h kg 1 of cod removed from 30 to 120 a m 2 respectively saeedi et al 32 have achieved comparable results of an ec process using aluminum electrodes obtaining 11 66 and 19 38 kw h kg 1 of cod removal for 250 and 400 a m 2 respectively prakash et al 33 have achieved an optimized sec of 1 32 kw h kg 1 of cod removed at 123 46 a m 2 in the treatment of synthetic dairy wastewater using aluminum electrodes however both the above works were conducted without aeration non aerated experiments have shown much less specific energy consumption compared to aerated especially for low current densities fig 15a that is primarily attributed to the extra watts 5 w required for the aeration also the total cell potential in aerated cells were observed to be a bit higher than non aerated cells which might be caused by the presence of air imposing a higher inter electrode ohmic drop due to the resistance of air in water and or the higher deposition of oil emulsions on the surface of the aerated anodes that difference in cell potential is translated to an sec increase of 1 58 and 9 87 kw h kg 1 of cod removed for 30 and 120 a m 2 experiments respectively however eeo values fig 15b show a drastic difference between aerated and non aerated cells inferring that the apparent voltage increase in aerated cells does not reflect an increase in energy consumption on the contrary the utilization of power in an aerated cell was far more efficient than a non aerated cell in removing cod for a unit volume accordingly aeration has intrinsically improved the ec process and made it less power exhaustive sec can be considered as a bigger scale measure of the economics of the process incorporating all sorts of energy used while eeo reflects the basic economics of the process devoid of auxiliaries with the current design of the electrochemical cell the introduction of aeration has shown an increased cod removal percentage and reduced electrical energy consumption however it is not economically justified as per sec values a better design of the reactor with optimization on the geometry would yield an enhanced performance overall and minimize any dead zones in the reactor this can be achieved by optimizing the inter electrode gap and air flowrates hence less aeration can be used to increase the efficiency of the cell for cod removal which allows operating at low currents extending the life time of the electrodes operating the aerated cell at 30 a m 2 results in similar cod removal as 120 a m 2 without aeration at higher energy consumption but with four times less consumption of the electrodes that is the case as the amount of metal dissolution is directly proportional to the applied current according to faraday s law of electrolysis 4 conclusion ec aerated and non aerated process in treating a synthetic oily wastewater sample using an al sacrificial anode was analyzed from a macro and micro scale results have shown an increased removal efficiency for aerated compared to non aerated cells around 12 enhancement different mechanisms were deduced to contribute to the overall removal of oil which are mainly adsorption and entrapment of oil emulsions to the al water insoluble complexes electrophoresis and electrodeposition of oil emulsions were present but with minimal contribution to the removal of cod aeration induced different effects on the surface of the electrodes and the form of produced sludge visual observation and sem images revealed increased electrocoagulation activity due to the increased mixing in the reactor the sludge of the aerated cell formed a gel like structure covering greater volume than the foamy and grainy sludge of the non aerated cell anodes in aerated cells were consumed more homogenously and received more depositions of oil on their surfaces albeit the superior performance of aerated over the non aerated it consumed multiple folds of energy due to aeration and or higher deposition on the anodes a full fetched optimization of the reactor especially the geometry would enhance the overall performance and possibly reduce the huge discrepancy in energy consumption between aerated and non aerated cells also investigating a broader spectrum of airflow and different patterns designs of air stones can significantly boost the efficacy of ec process while decreasing their specific energy consumption observing different electrochemical effects in situ using advanced set ups see ross 34 can refine the proposed mechanisms for different processes and correlate to the accuracy of predictive models declaration of competing interest none of the authors has conflicting interests

13959,in this study two kind of flocculants with high performance poly silicate ferrum psf and poly silicate titanium ferrum pstf were prepared by using an industrial pickling waste liquid rich in titanium and iron as the main raw materials the prepared psf and pstf were used to treat synthetic water at different ph values in order to explore the optimal ph range required for turbidity removal the sem and ir results of polymeric silicic acid indicate that the ti and si ratio can influence the morphology and bonding form of the flocculant the characteristics of floc particle size floc particle stability and settling time of the flocculant in the process of water treatment were studied in situ by laser particle size analyzer the results show that the turbidity of synthetic water treated with psf and pstf can be decreased by above 99 86 under the optimum using conditions the initial turbidity of the synthetic water is 700 ntu keywords pickling waste liquor flocculant poly silicate ferrum psf poly silicate titanium ferrum pstf in situ laser particle size measurement 1 introduction flocculation is commonly used in purification of polluted water j r baylis 1 first found that activated silicic acid had a better flocculation effect in 1937 which has been subsequently attracted extensive attentions from scholars with the development of inorganic flocculants some scholars have considered introducing metal ions to enhance the degree of polymerization through the chemical bonds of metal ions and silicic acid then further expanded the molecular structure of the flocculant at present the flocculation process mainly involves three mechanisms namely the adsorption and charge neutralization mechanism the adsorption bridging mechanism and the capture mechanism 2 5 aluminum and iron are first introduced into the activated silicic acid to prepare polysilicate based flocculant containing single metal which are named as poly silicate aluminium psa and poly silicate ferrum psf psa has shown a good flocculation effect since its invention and has been relatively widely used for a long time compared with aluminum salt psa has the advantages of reducing water acidity and less sludge after flocculation z l yang explored the relationship between the flocculation performance and residual al the flocculant with oh al3 2 00 si al 0 0500 and addition of flocculant at dosages of 12 0 15 0 mg l had a favorable flocculation performance 6 y x zhao compared the flocculation size of fe based flocculant and al based flocculant in water which has an important influence on flocculation effect the order of floc size during the flocculation was fecl3 603 9 μm pfs 513 4 μm al2 so4 3 404 8 μm pacl 331 9 μm 7 b y gao prepared psa from poly sodium silicate and alcl3 to the purification of yellow river water yellow river initial turbidity of the tested water 528 ntu the experimental results showed that under the optimal using conditions the removal rate of turbidity was between 72 and 90 8 w p cheng studied the effect of hydrophilic salicylic acid on the flocculation process the best use conditions could get the highest turbidity removal rate of more than 90 9 j y guo researched the combined effect of coagulants and flocculants the results show that after using the prepared psa flocculant the water content and sedimentation of the sludge were reduced from 98 5 and 96 1 of the original value to 62 3 and 49 2 respectively 10 however with the development of the research on psa the researchers found that the water treated by psa will retain a certain amount of aluminium ions the residue aluminium ion will lead to a brain damage with long term drinking of water purified by aluminium salt resulting in severe memory loss and alzheimer s disease 11 besides excessive aluminium ion in the bone can cause the osteoporosis and deformation compared with psa psf has the advantages of harmlessness fast flocculation speed and high removal rate of impurities due to the potential toxicity of aluminum based flocculants 12 the demand for iron based flocculants is increasing j shi prepared psf from poly sodium silicate and fecl3 the experimental results showed that under the optimal using conditions doc could be removed easily removed with a maximum removal of 62 7 13 x xu studied the retardation of acetic acid to the benefit of structural stability and flocculation performance of psf the good flocculation efficiencies of psf at 0 21 mmol fe l were 92 4 for uv 254 removal 98 5 for turbidity removal and 73 5 for cod mn removal 14 aomi suda used psf to stabilize arsenic in flooded soils the results showed that the arsenic concentration in the straw grown in the soil was reduced from 41 6 to 20 1 the arsenic concentration in rice husks was reduced from 31 7 to 19 8 and the arsenic concentration in grain was reduced from 21 0 to 18 6 15 s y duan carried out the treatment of landfill leachate by psf by setting the best working parameters the highest cod removal rate was 71 09 16 psf prepared by p a moussas was used to remove p and turbidity and the removal rates of p and turbidity could reach 98 and 90 respectively 17 however the residual colour of fe3 has been restricting its wide application in addition psa and psf are incapable for treating acidic polluted water because of their narrow application ph range 6 8 5 at the beginning of this century some researchers have used titanium tetrachloride 7 18 19 and titanium oxysulfate 20 as flocculants to treat sewage however there are two limitations for their wide application first the cost of titanium salt is too high it is difficult to commercialize in the market second its molecular weight is low which will induce the weak sweeping nets and adsorption bridging resulting in a worse flocculation performance shon 21 prepared titanium tetrachloride as a flocculant to treat water and solved the sludge treatment problem through the recovery of titanium containing sludge although the previous methods have recovered titanium resources to a certain extent the flocculation effect of flocculants with single metal elements is still limited with the further research bimetallic ions are introduced into polysilicate the multi metal ion flocculant can take into account the characteristics of the original single metal flocculant while complementing the advantages of different flocculants to achieve better treatment results 9 22 because psf have the characteristics of rapid settling and psa can produce larger flocs poly silicate aluminium ferric 23 25 has been studied extensively and deeply in the field of bimetallic flocculants ni 24 prepared poly silicate aluminium ferric as a bimetallic composite flocculant which had a larger floc volume than the traditional psf and psa under the optimum using conditions it has a good result on cod and vestige colour in wastewater treatment wei 26 reported the optimum turbidity removal rate could reach 93 42 with the poly silicate ferric zinc flocculant dosage of 12 mg l at the optimum ph value chen 27 prepared polyferric magnesium silicate pfmsi as a flocculant which was mainly used for the treatment of low turbidity water the optimum turbidity removal rate was about 98 at the same time a small number of researchers have studied titanium containing double ionic flocculants such as polyaluminum titanium silicate chloride patc prepared by zhang 19 but the effect was not ideal in treating polluted water with low turbidity table 1 shows a comparison of the effects of flocculants on wastewater as reported in the previous literature in this paper we used the pickling waste liquor of metal plate to prepare macromolecule polymers which have many advantages 1 titanium is biophilic

ch3cooh were dissolved in 600 ml purified water under constant stirring in the meantime 150 g na2sio3 9h2o was dissolved in 600 ml of deionized water and the dissolved sodium silicate solution was slowly dropped into 10 ml min a mixed solution of h2so4 and ch3cooh flocculants are continuously stirred in a 2 l jar to promote mixing in which the mass fraction of sio2 was 2 14 moreover the presence of ch3cooh can effectively slow down the growth rate of polysilicate particles in the poly sodium silicate solution so as to avoid rapid solidification of polysilicic and prolong the storage time of poly sodium silicate solution 2 preparation of poly silicate ferrum psf the prepared 200 ml poly sodium silicate solution and the treated iron waste liquid fe2 has been oxidized to fe3 were mixed at different molar ratios si fe was 3 3 3 1 5 and 3 1 respectively at room temperature with a stirring speed of 400 r min for 0 5 h 3 preparation of poly silicate titanium ferrum pstf the prepared 200 ml poly sodium silicate solution the treated iron waste liquid fe2 has been oxidized to fe3 and titanium waste liquor were mixed respectively according to different molar ratios si fe ti was 3 3 3 1 5 and 3 1 and fe ti was 1 1 at room temperature with a stirring speed of 400 r min for 0 5 h psf and pstf flocculants were prepared by using n si n fe and n si n metal in a molar ratio of 3 3 3 1 5 and 3 1 named as ps3f3 ps3f1 5 ps3f1 and ps3t1 5f1 5 ps3t0 75f0 75 ps3t0 5f0 5 respectively 2 2 flocculation experiment the synthetic water was prepared with sodium humate and kaolin 1 g kaolin and 10 mg sodium humate were dissolved in 1 l ultrapure water with continuous stirring for 30 min 400 r min the initial turbidity of the synthetic water after the above treatment was about 700 ntu and the initial ph of the suspension was about 6 8 the particle size and particle size distribution of kaolin is shown in the table 3 50 ml of synthetic water with a turbidity of 700 ntu was took in a beaker 0 1 ml psf or pstf was added with adjusting the ph value of the solution by using 0 1 mol l sodium hydroxide solution or 0 1 mol l hydrochloric acid solution after 5 min of quickly stirring stirring speed was 200 r min followed 10 min of slow stirring stirring speed was 40 r min the final sample was obtained after standing still for 30 min measurement of turbidity ntu was tested by using a water quality analyzer changchun little swan gdys 201m observation of flocculant morphology was operated on the scanning electron microscopy sem the molecular structure of the flocculant was analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrometer the dynamic change of the floc size of the flocculant was measured in situ by using a massisiz 3000 laser particle sizer malvern panalytical uk 3 results and discussion the prepared flocculants were stirred and then freeze dried for sem tests and the sem images are showed in fig 1 as it is well known poly silicate flocculant is an inorganic polymer flocculants which plays a role of bridging and net trapping in the treatment of water contaminants while the hydrolyzed products of metal cations in water mainly act as the neutralization of adsorption charge therefore the molar ratio of si fe and ti directly affects the proportion of elements and the number of chemical bonds in the psf and pstf the uniformity of the element distribution in the flocculant will lead to a better flocculation in the water the uneven distribution of elements will seriously affect the growth of flocs in water and then affect the overall morphology of psf and pstf the morphology and structure of the flocculant can be observed by sem and the growth mode of the flocculant and its ability to capture pollutants can be inferred the use of eds can detect the presence of element segregation in flocculants as shown in fig 1 a the psf is mainly composed of massive aggregates with sharp edges and corners and the si fe molar ratio is 3 3 from the results of eds analysis it can be seen that the distribution of fe in the flocculant is uniform but the component segregation of silicon does occur as shown in fig 1 b when the molar ratio of si fe becomes 3 1 5 flocculated substances appear on the surface of the original particles as fe decreases the segregation of silicon in the flocculant structure decreases when the si fe molar ratio is greater than 3 1 as fe decreases further the surface of the psf particles is covered with a large number of needles and si is more easily distributed uniform as shown in fig 1 c in general when n si n fe is low the main morphology of psf is in an amorphous agglomerated structure when n si n fe is high the psf is an amorphous agglomerated structure wrapped by one dimensional materials the morphology of the flocculant has altered again after the addition of the titanium source it can be seen from fig 1 a c that the change in fe content has a little effect on the morphology of the material but for pstf the change in ti content is the main reason for the large change in morphology ps3t1 5f1 5 is in block like shape and the surface is a large number of small particles depositing on the surface it can be clearly seen from eds that three elements of si ti and fe are evenly distributed in the material as shown in fig 1 d as to ps3t0 75f0 75 there is a little needle like particles on the surface and the three elements of si ti and fe are evenly distributed in the material the silicon does not appear to have the composition segregation as shown in fig 1 e for ps3t0 5f0 5 there is a large amount of needle like substances grown on the surface and the si in the material shows a slight composition segregation according to fig 1 f the pstf forms a relatively complete and clear needle like or branch like structure the main reason for this phenomenon is the presence of siosi in the colloidal particles of the sodium polysilicate solution when ti is added to the sodium polysilicate solution ti4 can be hydrolyzed to tio under acidic conditions and a polycondensation reaction can occur between ti4 and siosi during sample preparation as the solvent evaporates a local saturation point will appear resulting in a concentration gradient and a surface tension gradient as a result the condensed particles continue to grow in an outwardly extending form with the decrease of ti content the block structure gradually changed into needle like or branch like structure and the overall change trend is block like or layered structure layered structure needle like or branched structure 30 31 moreover ftir is used for functional group determination fig 2 is ir spectra of the prepared psf and pstf it can be seen that psf has a stretching vibration peak of oh functional group around 3438 cm 1 the absorption peak originates from the tensile vibration of the oh functional group adjacent to the metal ion this indicates that fe reacts with the sodium polysilicate solution the angular vibration peak of water molecule is at 1627 cm 1 the absorption peaks belongs to the absorbed water coordinated water and crystal water 14 the partial hydrolysis of poly silicate was due to the inability of the polymeric silicate to completely bond with the iron 32 33 therefore the ratio of n si n fe has an important influence on the structure of psf similar to psf pstf has a stretching vibration peak of oh functional group around 3438 cm 1 this absorption peak is caused by the reaction of oh with ti and fe the angular vibration peak of water molecule at 1627 cm 1 stretching vibration peaks of siofe functional group around 470 cm 1 and the out of plane bending vibration near 600 cm 1 compared with psf pstf has a broad antisymmetric tensile vibrational absorption peak at 1168 cm 1 and tiosi functional group bending vibration peaks at 1058 cm 1 and 960 cm 1 the tensile vibration peak of tioti functional group is at 745 cm 1 and its characteristic group comes from the tetravalent complex produced by the hydrolysis of ti ions 34 overall fig 2 b partially suggests that the vibration peak of tiosi functional group increases obviously with the increase of titanium content which enhances the degree of polymerization as a result meanwhile the siosi functional group of poly silicate is weakened obviously which indicates that the introduction of ti4 can effectively inhibit the hydrolysis of poly silicate however a significant tioti functional group stretching vibration peak appeared with the ti4 content increasing to a certain extent which indicates that the titanium content is too high at this time to lead to the failure of poly silicate to fully combine with titanium causes a large number of hydrolysis of ti4 occur and result in a huge waste of titanium elements because the two flocculants prepared in this experiment are based on poly sodium silicate solution the flocculants will show different purification effects at different ph values in water it stems from two main reasons 1 only when the poly sodium silicate itself is activated at a suitable ph conditions it can be dispersed in water to form uniformly distributed and appropriately sized colloidal particles which will induce the capture and adsorption bridging resulting in a stronger flocculation performance 2 different ph will lead to different hydrolysis effect of metal ions in flocculant therefore silicic acid based flocculants can fully construct large particle size flocs only in water with a certain ph and finally produce a better flocculation effect fig 3 a shows the turbidity removal rate of psf on treating synthetic water as indicated in figure the psf with different molar ratios exhibits different flocculation and sedimentation effects under the acidic conditions among them ps3f3 shows a good flocculation effect between ph 2 4 and the turbidity removal rate is above 91 with the decrease of iron content in the flocculant the turbidity removal rate of suspended substances is increasing among them ps3f1 5 has the best turbidity removal effect at ph 2 with the turbidity removal rate is as high as 99 43 while ps3f1 5 also has a good turbidity removal rate turbidity removal rate is higher than 85 in a wide range of ph ph 2 5 with the further reduction of iron content the turbidity removal rate of ps3f1 sample decreases slightly at the most suitable ph value but at the same time the applicable ph range of flocculant is further extended to ph 2 7 the turbidity removal rate can be higher than 85 although the turbidity removal effect of ps3f1 has been slightly decreased it has obtained a broader range of ph application the turbidity removal rate of pstf for treating synthetic water is shown in fig 3 b in comparation of the turbidity removal rates of psf and pstf the optimum ph value of turbidity removal is shifted from ph 2 3 to ph 4 5 after adding titanium ions into psf and pstf has a more excellent turbidity removal effect than that of psf with a turbidity removal rate of 99 86 for pstf as to the ph optimum range for application pstf has a high turbidity removal rate in a wider range of ph 2 6 in conclusion with the increase of metal content the turbidity removal performance of the flocculant increase at optimum ph application range is widened compared with all the prepared flocculants ps3t1 5f1 5 shows the best comprehensive performance with the excellent turbidity removal rate the critical parameters for the purification of water by psf and pstf are summarized in tables 4 and 5 in order to study the growth and fragmentation mechanism of psf and pstf in flocculation process an in situ particle size analysis evaluation test is designed the floc growth of flocculants with different ratios after flocculation for 55 min at different ph values were also studied in detail the mean size d50 is used to denote the floc size and the result can be shown in fig 4 generally speaking psf and pstf both have experienced three stages the particle size increases rapidly then decreases and finally stabilizes these three processes correspond to the stages of growth breakage and recovery of flocs respectively 35 39 as can be seen from fig 4 floc growth and breakage are in a dynamic state in the rapid increase process of particle size the growth rate of flocs is faster than that of breakage rate when the floc reaches its maximum value there is a short process of rapid particle reduction which indicates the floc volume decreases and the floc breaking rate is faster than the floc growing rate then there is a long time equilibrium of breaking and growing in size finally it can be seen from the fig 4 that the floc particle size close to a stable value this phenomenon not only means that the breakage of the floc decreases with time but also indicates the flocculation and regeneration are in a state of dynamic equilibrium this special phenomenon has also been reported by gao 7 40 and zouboulis 17 fig 4 a c shows the different proportions of psf the particle size of psf increases with the decrease of iron content in psf ps3f1 ps3f1 5 ps3f3 this is consistent with the turbidity removal effect have been analyzed above fig 4 d f shows the different proportions of pstf as the metal ion content decreases the particle size of pstf decreases accordingly ps3t1 5f1 5 ps3t0 75f0 75 ps3t0 5f0 5 this is consistent with the previous analysis of turbidity removal effect as above and the average particle size is larger than that of psf by comprehensively analyzing the above results it can be concluded that the larger the floc size the better the flocculation settlement effect can be obtained the comparison on the reaction time and stability of psf and pstf are shown in tables 6 and 7 different from the low speed test method 40 rmp 200 rmp used by previous researchers in particle size measurement the high speed test method 500 rmp was used to obtain the relationship between the reaction speed and stability of psf and pstf under a large shear force in comparation ps3f1 can be formed as the largest floc size with the longest reaction time on the contrary ps3f3 has the shortest reaction time with the smallest floc size in terms of stability ps3f1 has the larger dmax value of flocs with a larger dδt value and a higher breaking rate in terms of the time for floc reaching the maximum particle size ps3t0 5f0 5 takes the least time and ps3t1 5f1 5 takes the most time generally the dδt value of pstf is on average higher than the dδt value of psf this means that compared with only one kind of fe3 ion the pstf containing ti4 and fe3 ion possesses a higher stability similarly the δd value can also confirm that the stability of pstf is higher than that of psf as to the reaction time compared with psf pstf reacts more quickly finally in terms of the breakage rate δd δt2 pstf is also better than that of psf 4 conclusion we have comprehensively studied the flocculation performance of two flocculants of psf and pstf based on the treatment effect of the synthetic water the relationship between the morphology growth fragmentation and reaction time of these two flocculants are explored in detail the conclusions can be drawn as follow 1 sem and infrared spectroscopy shows the morphology and structure infromation of the prepared psf and pstf are effected greatly by the ratio of si and metal fe ti in particular psf has a strong bonding reaction with polysilicic acid after the addition of ti4 which weakens the hydrolysis of silicic acid and enhances the role of polysilicic acid as the main framework of flocculant 2 in this work psf and pstf have improved turbidity removal effect under certain conditions the comparison between psf and pstf shows that the comprehensive performance of pstf is better than that of psf the turbidity removal rate of pstf is greater than 95 at ph 2 9 the final turbidity can reach as 1 ntu from the initial 700 ntu at the optimum ph sometimes the removal rate is nearly 99 86 more importantly with the increase of metal ions ti fe content in pstf or the decrease of iron content in psf the optimal ph range of flocculants application has been greatly widened which provides a guiding role for future use in practice 3 the dynamic particle size results shows with the decrease of metal content the floc size of psf increases ps3f 425 μm ps3f1 5 334 μm ps3f3 333 μm on the contrary the floc size of pstf decreases with the decreases of the metal content ps3t1 5f1 5 365 μm ps3t0 75f0 75 310 μm ps3t0 5f0 5 236 μm 4 the breaking rate and reaction time of the flocs indicates the average particle size of pstf is larger than that of psf while in terms of reaction time the pstf reacts more rapidly than that of psf at the optimal using condition in addition the performance of pstf is also better than that of psf in terms of the breakage rate δd δt2 a conclusion can be made with the above four points compared with psf the introduction of ti4 ions can significantly improve the turbidity removal performance of flocculant this further indicates that the incorporation of bimetallic ions in the polysilicic flocculant can significantly improve the comprehensive performance of flocculant declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents

13959,in this study two kind of flocculants with high performance poly silicate ferrum psf and poly silicate titanium ferrum pstf were prepared by using an industrial pickling waste liquid rich in titanium and iron as the main raw materials the prepared psf and pstf were used to treat synthetic water at different ph values in order to explore the optimal ph range required for turbidity removal the sem and ir results of polymeric silicic acid indicate that the ti and si ratio can influence the morphology and bonding form of the flocculant the characteristics of floc particle size floc particle stability and settling time of the flocculant in the process of water treatment were studied in situ by laser particle size analyzer the results show that the turbidity of synthetic water treated with psf and pstf can be decreased by above 99 86 under the optimum using conditions the initial turbidity of the synthetic water is 700 ntu keywords pickling waste liquor flocculant poly silicate ferrum psf poly silicate titanium ferrum pstf in situ laser particle size measurement 1 introduction flocculation is commonly used in purification of polluted water j r baylis 1 first found that activated silicic acid had a better flocculation effect in 1937 which has been subsequently attracted extensive attentions from scholars with the development of inorganic flocculants some scholars have considered introducing metal ions to enhance the degree of polymerization through the chemical bonds of metal ions and silicic acid then further expanded the molecular structure of the flocculant at present the flocculation process mainly involves three mechanisms namely the adsorption and charge neutralization mechanism the adsorption bridging mechanism and the capture mechanism 2 5 aluminum and iron are first introduced into the activated silicic acid to prepare polysilicate based flocculant containing single metal which are named as poly silicate aluminium psa and poly silicate ferrum psf psa has shown a good flocculation effect since its invention and has been relatively widely used for a long time compared with aluminum salt psa has the advantages of reducing water acidity and less sludge after flocculation z l yang explored the relationship between the flocculation performance and residual al the flocculant with oh al3 2 00 si al 0 0500 and addition of flocculant at dosages of 12 0 15 0 mg l had a favorable flocculation performance 6 y x zhao compared the flocculation size of fe based flocculant and al based flocculant in water which has an important influence on flocculation effect the order of floc size during the flocculation was fecl3 603 9 μm pfs 513 4 μm al2 so4 3 404 8 μm pacl 331 9 μm 7 b y gao prepared psa from poly sodium silicate and alcl3 to the purification of yellow river water yellow river initial turbidity of the tested water 528 ntu the experimental results showed that under the optimal using conditions the removal rate of turbidity was between 72 and 90 8 w p cheng studied the effect of hydrophilic salicylic acid on the flocculation process the best use conditions could get the highest turbidity removal rate of more than 90 9 j y guo researched the combined effect of coagulants and flocculants the results show that after using the prepared psa flocculant the water content and sedimentation of the sludge were reduced from 98 5 and 96 1 of the original value to 62 3 and 49 2 respectively 10 however with the development of the research on psa the researchers found that the water treated by psa will retain a certain amount of aluminium ions the residue aluminium ion will lead to a brain damage with long term drinking of water purified by aluminium salt resulting in severe memory loss and alzheimer s disease 11 besides excessive aluminium ion in the bone can cause the osteoporosis and deformation compared with psa psf has the advantages of harmlessness fast flocculation speed and high removal rate of impurities due to the potential toxicity of aluminum based flocculants 12 the demand for iron based flocculants is increasing j shi prepared psf from poly sodium silicate and fecl3 the experimental results showed that under the optimal using conditions doc could be removed easily removed with a maximum removal of 62 7 13 x xu studied the retardation of acetic acid to the benefit of structural stability and flocculation performance of psf the good flocculation efficiencies of psf at 0 21 mmol fe l were 92 4 for uv 254 removal 98 5 for turbidity removal and 73 5 for cod mn removal 14 aomi suda used psf to stabilize arsenic in flooded soils the results showed that the arsenic concentration in the straw grown in the soil was reduced from 41 6 to 20 1 the arsenic concentration in rice husks was reduced from 31 7 to 19 8 and the arsenic concentration in grain was reduced from 21 0 to 18 6 15 s y duan carried out the treatment of landfill leachate by psf by setting the best working parameters the highest cod removal rate was 71 09 16 psf prepared by p a moussas was used to remove p and turbidity and the removal rates of p and turbidity could reach 98 and 90 respectively 17 however the residual colour of fe3 has been restricting its wide application in addition psa and psf are incapable for treating acidic polluted water because of their narrow application ph range 6 8 5 at the beginning of this century some researchers have used titanium tetrachloride 7 18 19 and titanium oxysulfate 20 as flocculants to treat sewage however there are two limitations for their wide application first the cost of titanium salt is too high it is difficult to commercialize in the market second its molecular weight is low which will induce the weak sweeping nets and adsorption bridging resulting in a worse flocculation performance shon 21 prepared titanium tetrachloride as a flocculant to treat water and solved the sludge treatment problem through the recovery of titanium containing sludge although the previous methods have recovered titanium resources to a certain extent the flocculation effect of flocculants with single metal elements is still limited with the further research bimetallic ions are introduced into polysilicate the multi metal ion flocculant can take into account the characteristics of the original single metal flocculant while complementing the advantages of different flocculants to achieve better treatment results 9 22 because psf have the characteristics of rapid settling and psa can produce larger flocs poly silicate aluminium ferric 23 25 has been studied extensively and deeply in the field of bimetallic flocculants ni 24 prepared poly silicate aluminium ferric as a bimetallic composite flocculant which had a larger floc volume than the traditional psf and psa under the optimum using conditions it has a good result on cod and vestige colour in wastewater treatment wei 26 reported the optimum turbidity removal rate could reach 93 42 with the poly silicate ferric zinc flocculant dosage of 12 mg l at the optimum ph value chen 27 prepared polyferric magnesium silicate pfmsi as a flocculant which was mainly used for the treatment of low turbidity water the optimum turbidity removal rate was about 98 at the same time a small number of researchers have studied titanium containing double ionic flocculants such as polyaluminum titanium silicate chloride patc prepared by zhang 19 but the effect was not ideal in treating polluted water with low turbidity table 1 shows a comparison of the effects of flocculants on wastewater as reported in the previous literature in this paper we used the pickling waste liquor of metal plate to prepare macromolecule polymers which have many advantages 1 titanium is biophilic metals and has harmless elements to biology and ecology 2 during the treatment of contaminated water titanium exists in the form of tio2 which can be hydrolyzed at lower ph to produce the coagulation hydrated titanium dioxide precipitation therefore the prepared flocculant has a wide range of application of ph value 3 polysilicate ferrite flocculant has a fast flocculation effect therefore the introduction of iron ions can comprehensively improve the performance of bimetallic flocculants 4 the flocculant was prepared by using pickling waste liquor it can make up for the disadvantage of expensive titanium salts in the market 5 the dynamic changes of flocculant flocs was measured in situ by using a laser particle sizer through this experiment we can further understand the mechanism of flocculant to removal pollutants besides this also helps us to quickly evaluate the flocculant effect in a word this work is devoted to the preparation of poly silicate ferrum and poly silicate ferrum

functional group around 3438 cm 1 the absorption peak originates from the tensile vibration of the oh functional group adjacent to the metal ion this indicates that fe reacts with the sodium polysilicate solution the angular vibration peak of water molecule is at 1627 cm 1 the absorption peaks belongs to the absorbed water coordinated water and crystal water 14 the partial hydrolysis of poly silicate was due to the inability of the polymeric silicate to completely bond with the iron 32 33 therefore the ratio of n si n fe has an important influence on the structure of psf similar to psf pstf has a stretching vibration peak of oh functional group around 3438 cm 1 this absorption peak is caused by the reaction of oh with ti and fe the angular vibration peak of water molecule at 1627 cm 1 stretching vibration peaks of siofe functional group around 470 cm 1 and the out of plane bending vibration near 600 cm 1 compared with psf pstf has a broad antisymmetric tensile vibrational absorption peak at 1168 cm 1 and tiosi functional group bending vibration peaks at 1058 cm 1 and 960 cm 1 the tensile vibration peak of tioti functional group is at 745 cm 1 and its characteristic group comes from the tetravalent complex produced by the hydrolysis of ti ions 34 overall fig 2 b partially suggests that the vibration peak of tiosi functional group increases obviously with the increase of titanium content which enhances the degree of polymerization as a result meanwhile the siosi functional group of poly silicate is weakened obviously which indicates that the introduction of ti4 can effectively inhibit the hydrolysis of poly silicate however a significant tioti functional group stretching vibration peak appeared with the ti4 content increasing to a certain extent which indicates that the titanium content is too high at this time to lead to the failure of poly silicate to fully combine with titanium causes a large number of hydrolysis of ti4 occur and result in a huge waste of titanium elements because the two flocculants prepared in this experiment are based on poly sodium silicate solution the flocculants will show different purification effects at different ph values in water it stems from two main reasons 1 only when the poly sodium silicate itself is activated at a suitable ph conditions it can be dispersed in water to form uniformly distributed and appropriately sized colloidal particles which will induce the capture and adsorption bridging resulting in a stronger flocculation performance 2 different ph will lead to different hydrolysis effect of metal ions in flocculant therefore silicic acid based flocculants can fully construct large particle size flocs only in water with a certain ph and finally produce a better flocculation effect fig 3 a shows the turbidity removal rate of psf on treating synthetic water as indicated in figure the psf with different molar ratios exhibits different flocculation and sedimentation effects under the acidic conditions among them ps3f3 shows a good flocculation effect between ph 2 4 and the turbidity removal rate is above 91 with the decrease of iron content in the flocculant the turbidity removal rate of suspended substances is increasing among them ps3f1 5 has the best turbidity removal effect at ph 2 with the turbidity removal rate is as high as 99 43 while ps3f1 5 also has a good turbidity removal rate turbidity removal rate is higher than 85 in a wide range of ph ph 2 5 with the further reduction of iron content the turbidity removal rate of ps3f1 sample decreases slightly at the most suitable ph value but at the same time the applicable ph range of flocculant is further extended to ph 2 7 the turbidity removal rate can be higher than 85 although the turbidity removal effect of ps3f1 has been slightly decreased it has obtained a broader range of ph application the turbidity removal rate of pstf for treating synthetic water is shown in fig 3 b in comparation of the turbidity removal rates of psf and pstf the optimum ph value of turbidity removal is shifted from ph 2 3 to ph 4 5 after adding titanium ions into psf and pstf has a more excellent turbidity removal effect than that of psf with a turbidity removal rate of 99 86 for pstf as to the ph optimum range for application pstf has a high turbidity removal rate in a wider range of ph 2 6 in conclusion with the increase of metal content the turbidity removal performance of the flocculant increase at optimum ph application range is widened compared with all the prepared flocculants ps3t1 5f1 5 shows the best comprehensive performance with the excellent turbidity removal rate the critical parameters for the purification of water by psf and pstf are summarized in tables 4 and 5 in order to study the growth and fragmentation mechanism of psf and pstf in flocculation process an in situ particle size analysis evaluation test is designed the floc growth of flocculants with different ratios after flocculation for 55 min at different ph values were also studied in detail the mean size d50 is used to denote the floc size and the result can be shown in fig 4 generally speaking psf and pstf both have experienced three stages the particle size increases rapidly then decreases and finally stabilizes these three processes correspond to the stages of growth breakage and recovery of flocs respectively 35 39 as can be seen from fig 4 floc growth and breakage are in a dynamic state in the rapid increase process of particle size the growth rate of flocs is faster than that of breakage rate when the floc reaches its maximum value there is a short process of rapid particle reduction which indicates the floc volume decreases and the floc breaking rate is faster than the floc growing rate then there is a long time equilibrium of breaking and growing in size finally it can be seen from the fig 4 that the floc particle size close to a stable value this phenomenon not only means that the breakage of the floc decreases with time but also indicates the flocculation and regeneration are in a state of dynamic equilibrium this special phenomenon has also been reported by gao 7 40 and zouboulis 17 fig 4 a c shows the different proportions of psf the particle size of psf increases with the decrease of iron content in psf ps3f1 ps3f1 5 ps3f3 this is consistent with the turbidity removal effect have been analyzed above fig 4 d f shows the different proportions of pstf as the metal ion content decreases the particle size of pstf decreases accordingly ps3t1 5f1 5 ps3t0 75f0 75 ps3t0 5f0 5 this is consistent with the previous analysis of turbidity removal effect as above and the average particle size is larger than that of psf by comprehensively analyzing the above results it can be concluded that the larger the floc size the better the flocculation settlement effect can be obtained the comparison on the reaction time and stability of psf and pstf are shown in tables 6 and 7 different from the low speed test method 40 rmp 200 rmp used by previous researchers in particle size measurement the high speed test method 500 rmp was used to obtain the relationship between the reaction speed and stability of psf and pstf under a large shear force in comparation ps3f1 can be formed as the largest floc size with the longest reaction time on the contrary ps3f3 has the shortest reaction time with the smallest floc size in terms of stability ps3f1 has the larger dmax value of flocs with a larger dδt value and a higher breaking rate in terms of the time for floc reaching the maximum particle size ps3t0 5f0 5 takes the least time and ps3t1 5f1 5 takes the most time generally the dδt value of pstf is on average higher than the dδt value of psf this means that compared with only one kind of fe3 ion the pstf containing ti4 and fe3 ion possesses a higher stability similarly the δd value can also confirm that the stability of pstf is higher than that of psf as to the reaction time compared with psf pstf reacts more quickly finally in terms of the breakage rate δd δt2 pstf is also better than that of psf 4 conclusion we have comprehensively studied the flocculation performance of two flocculants of psf and pstf based on the treatment effect of the synthetic water the relationship between the morphology growth fragmentation and reaction time of these two flocculants are explored in detail the conclusions can be drawn as follow 1 sem and infrared spectroscopy shows the morphology and structure infromation of the prepared psf and pstf are effected greatly by the ratio of si and metal fe ti in particular psf has a strong bonding reaction with polysilicic acid after the addition of ti4 which weakens the hydrolysis of silicic acid and enhances the role of polysilicic acid as the main framework of flocculant 2 in this work psf and pstf have improved turbidity removal effect under certain conditions the comparison between psf and pstf shows that the comprehensive performance of pstf is better than that of psf the turbidity removal rate of pstf is greater than 95 at ph 2 9 the final turbidity can reach as 1 ntu from the initial 700 ntu at the optimum ph sometimes the removal rate is nearly 99 86 more importantly with the increase of metal ions ti fe content in pstf or the decrease of iron content in psf the optimal ph range of flocculants application has been greatly widened which provides a guiding role for future use in practice 3 the dynamic particle size results shows with the decrease of metal content the floc size of psf increases ps3f 425 μm ps3f1 5 334 μm ps3f3 333 μm on the contrary the floc size of pstf decreases with the decreases of the metal content ps3t1 5f1 5 365 μm ps3t0 75f0 75 310 μm ps3t0 5f0 5 236 μm 4 the breaking rate and reaction time of the flocs indicates the average particle size of pstf is larger than that of psf while in terms of reaction time the pstf reacts more rapidly than that of psf at the optimal using condition in addition the performance of pstf is also better than that of psf in terms of the breakage rate δd δt2 a conclusion can be made with the above four points compared with psf the introduction of ti4 ions can significantly improve the turbidity removal performance of flocculant this further indicates that the incorporation of bimetallic ions in the polysilicic flocculant can significantly improve the comprehensive performance of flocculant declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents
