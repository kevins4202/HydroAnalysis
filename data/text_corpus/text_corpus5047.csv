25235,evaluating stochastic abiotic factors and their combined effects on fish and wildlife populations have been challenging in environmental sciences contributing to this challenge is the paucity of data describing how observations made on individuals related to exposure to chemical compounds ultimately effect population vital rates and how this exposure interacts with other abiotic drivers using three smallmouth bass populations in pennsylvania as a case study we explored both single factor and combined effects of water temperature flow velocity and chemical exposure on populations through a model simulation although there are many pathways through which chemicals can affect population vital rates we focused on one where chemical exposure leads to reduced reproduction among the three populations considered two the juniata and susquehanna populations have experienced adverse health including the potential adverse effects of environmental stress and chemical contamination that may cause disease and mortality of young of year yoy various skin lesions and a high prevalence of intersex or testicular oocytes in adults the third population the alleghany population has not encountered mortality events of yoy and intersex prevalence is much lower the simulation involved projecting populations using a length based model under different environmental conditions in the simulations abiotic factors influenced population dynamics through their impacts on growth survival and recruitment response to the same environmental stress varied by population and life stage of the species factors affecting young adult and adult life stages had great influence on proportional stock density psd and the probability of having psd within the suggested range psd probability increases in water temperature had a negative effect and dominant role in the combined effect on population size structure e g psd and psd probability increases in flow velocity during the spring season also had a negative effect on abundance populations with high recruitment rates sustained relatively large population size even under high water temperature and or high flow velocity which suggests that factors and management strategies that benefit recruitment such as reduced chemical contaminants may compensate for the negative effects of warming water temperatures and high spring flow velocity on population size keywords growth mortality flow velocity temperature plasma vitellogenin proportional stock density 1 introduction the importance of water temperature and flow in regulating fluvial ecosystems has been well accepted for example water temperature controls metabolism and growth beschta et al 1987 allen 1995 johnson and jones 2000 and can influence disease prevalence marcos lopez et al 2010 flow modifies water chemistry mobility of substrates habitat condition and delivery of nutrients and organic matter which further influences behavior and survival of individual organisms statzner and higler 1986 jager et al 1993 allen 1995 grossman et al 1998 hart and finelli 1999 in addition the potential effects of chemicals on fish populations are of increasing concern nash et al 2004 kidd et al 2007 miller et al 2007 focks et al 2014 chemicals present in fertilizer pesticides personal care products and pharmaceuticals enter river ecosystems through a variety of pathways including overland storm flow point source discharge and groundwater many chemicals can have negative effects on wildlife by impairing reproduction and growth and some may suppress the immune system thereby reducing disease resistance e g dunier and siwicki 1993 miller et al 2007 milla et al 2011 these effects do not only occur at the individual level but can also pass onto the population level as a result the potential population level effects of chemical exposure have received increased attention pastorok et al 2002 grimm and thorbek 2014 for example laboratory studies showed that rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss exposed to o p ddt and o p dde may have lower reproduction success donohoe and curtis 1996 exposure to the synthetic estrogen ethynylestradiol in the natural environment caused the collapse of some fish populations kidd et al 2007 palace et al 2009 the effects of chemicals on fish and wildlife populations are complex especially in wild populations where difficulties exist in determining cause effect relationships and where populations experience multiple abiotic and biotic influences on vital rates such as the potential influence of water temperatures and streamflow on life stage specific growth and survival rates this inherent complexity of natural systems reduces the ability to predict adverse outcomes from exposure and to assess risk for fish and wildlife populations lapointe et al 2014 gandar et al 2017 however quantifying population level effects of chemical exposure in conjunction with changes in water temperature and streamflow which are fundamental physical properties of fluvial ecosystems is often necessary to help inform management and conservation decision making many of the existing modeling efforts to evaluate risk of chemicals to fish and wildlife populations focus on the mechanisms linking chemical exposure to individual level endpoints for example the hazard quotient approach barnthouse and suter 1986 the adverse outcome pathway model e g gust et al 2016 or dynamic energy budget models e g ashauer and escher 2010 challenges still lie in quantitatively evaluating the effects beyond individual level endpoints such as effects on population abundance and age structure species richness and ecosystem service pastorok et al 2002 grimm and thorbek 2014 forbes et al 2017 the individual based model e g forbes et al 2017 provides an alternative to explore population level and ecosystem level effects of chemicals but has high data demand part of the challenge is due to the paucity of data describing how observations made on individuals related to exposure to chemical compounds i e biomarkers ultimately affect populations hamilton et al 2016 for example if intersex is detected in a population the population level consequences are often unclear harris et al 2011 in addition assessing population level effects is often limited to a relatively small number of species where adequate data exists that allow for the quantification of abundance and stage specific vital rates despite these challenges and the subsequent uncertainty that is introduced quantitative population level assessments represent a critical exercise not only for informing natural resource decision making but also for highlighting the relative importance of different factors in structuring populations and for identifying data gaps that can inform future research efforts smallmouth bass was chosen as the model species for this study because it has a life history that is sensitive to environmental conditions including high water temperatures streamflow and chemical contaminants both high flow velocity and heat stress can negatively affect the nesting success and survival of early life stage of smallmouth bass shuter et al 1980 goff 1985 lukas and orth 1995 peterson and kwak 1999 rejwan et al 1999 lorantas et al 2013 in pennsylvania rivers in particular low recruitment and population declines of smallmouth bass in some rivers e g the juniata and susquehanna rivers has been observed since 2005 a variety of pathogens and parasites are observed during disease and mortality events starliper et al 2013 smith et al 2015 suggesting immunosuppression additionally a higher prevalence and severity of intersex testicular oocytes was observed in smallmouth bass collected in the susquehanna and juniata rivers when compared to the allegheny river blazer et al 2014 exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds and other chemicals is one of the potential causes for adverse health effects identified by state managers and scientists shull and pulket 2015 using smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu as a case study the first objective of this study was to use simulation to explore population level effects of water temperature flow velocity and exposure to chemicals that reduce reproduction when they act as a single factor multi factor but on a single life history parameter or multi factor on multiple life history parameters we borrowed or constructed relationships between life history parameters and environmental factors from the literature based on the life history of this species the second objective was to evaluate how population level responses to changes in temperature flow velocity and chemical exposure might vary by populations that have different underlying population dynamics to achieve the second objective we simulated three smallmouth bass populations whose life history parameters were estimated based on data collected from three pennsylvania rivers the third objective was to investigate the relative importance of life history parameters through which these abiotic factors influence population dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 length based population dynamics model in this study we applied a length based population dynamics model called length based model hereafter to simulate population level effects of envronmental stress the length based model describes the population dynamics in terms of the number of individules at each size class over time sullivan et al 1990 1 n l y 1 l p l l n l y s l y r l y 1 e x p ε n l y 1 ε n l y 1 n 0 σ n 2 where y indexes the

history of smallmouth bass we set seven size classes in this study ranging from 25 mm to 550 mm the first three size classes are 25 75 mm 75 1 125 mm and 125 1 175 mm containing the young of year yoy age 0 and the fourth size class 175 1 225 mm included juveniles that were mostly immature hoopes 1987 the last three size classes contained mature fish with the size class 225 1 300 mm representing young adults before reaching the harvestable size of 305 mm and the size classes 300 1 375 mm and 375 1 550 mm representing adults subject to fishing lorantas et al 2013 in the model we made the following assumptions about survival rate 1 survival rate of the first three size classes were a constant syoy representing the survival of yoy 2 survival rate of the fourth and fifth size class were a constant sjuv and syoung representing the survival of juveniles and young adults respectively and 3 survival rate of the last two size classes were a constant sadu representing the survival of adult

at 25 29 c horning and pearson 1973 shuter et al 1980 edwards et al 1983 in the simulation we assumed growth coefficient k to decrease with a temperature t higher than 29 c according to a scalar wt k

coutant 1975 and mortality occurs at a temperature higher than 35 c horning and pearson 1973 cherry et al 1975 adult smallmouth bass prefer temperatures of 21 27 c in the wild clancey 1980 and have a upper lethal temperatures about 32 c coble 1975 in the simulation for scenarios with a temperature outside the preferred range survival of yoy juveniles and adults was linearly reduced from s to zero

organism because male smallmouth bass in some pennsylvania rivers including our case study populations have been documented with high intersex prevalence blazer et al 2014 we predicted that high intersex prevalence could influence recruitment through a reduction in fertilization success and parental care niemuth and klaper 2015 however because no data exist to link intersex prevalence to recruitment for smallmouth bass we used a surrogate pathway for chemical exposure to affect recruitment through an inhibition of plasma vitellogenin vtg in females mills et al 2001 wheeler et al 2005 white et al 2017 examples of such chemical compounds include steroidal androgen 17ß trenboone fungicide prochloraz and pharmaceutical fadrozole vtg is important for egg production and these chemicals can reduce vtg levels affect fecundity and egg quality and eventually reduce recruitment of the population tyler and sumpter 1996 miller et al 2007 although we have not observed a reduction in female smallmouth bass vtg in our case study populations we used this relationship to demonstrate the population level effects of exposure to chemicals that affect reproduction regardless of the exact mechanism and to compare its effect independently and in combination with changes in water temperature and flow velocity in this simulation we borrowed a relationship developed using female fatheaded minnow pimephales promelas which describes the effect of vtg depression on female fecundity introduced by five hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis active chemicals miller et al 2007 we adopted this relationship to represent the effect of vtg depression on average annual recruitment of smallmouth bass caused by exposure to chemical contaminants fig 1 11 w v t g r 0 042 0 95 w v t g where wvtg r is a scalar for average annual recruitment r and wvtg is a scalar for vtg concentration i e the proportion of vtg concentration relative to baseline level assuming independent effect of each factor we calculated the combined effect of temperature flow velocity and exposure to chemical contaminants on a single life history parameter according to response addition schipper et al 2013 for example in this simulation both temperature and flow velocity had impact on yoy survival and thus the combined effect of temperature and flow velocity on yoy suvival was represented by a combined scalar wcom syoy as follows 12 w c o m s y o y w t s y o y w v s y o y 2 3 simulation with smallmouth bass 2 3 1 model parameterization this simulation study was based on three smallmouth bass populations that differ in their underlying population dynamics their life history parameters were estimated based on data collected from three pennsylvania rivers the alleghany river the juniata river and the susquehanna river we ran simulations for the each population and compared their responses to the same environmental stress the juniata and susquehanna population once supported a world class recreational bass fishery in pennsylvania but have suffered from degraded water quality disease and chemical contamination these issues have likely contributed to die offs of young bass and abundance decline of adult bass since 2005 arway and smith 2013 lorantas et al 2013 less disease and mortality of young are observed in the alleghany population which also has lower intersex prevalence and severity in adults simulation involved projecting the smallmouth bass population using the length based model with pre specified parameters table 1 under different environmental conditions fig 2 parameterization of the length based model was based on estimates of the most recent year 2012 from one of our previous studies in which we estimated the growth and mortality of these three smallmouth bass populations using a bayesian hierarchical modeling approach li et al 2017 the parameter values in table 1 were used as baseline values and were adjusted by multiplying the scalars corresponding to environmental conditions under each scenario we ran 1000 iterations for each scenario and evaluated the average response of the population in each scenario we projected the population for 100 years and tracked the population size at each size class over time 2 3 2 scenarios we first examined the effect of single factor i e water temperature flow velocity or chemical induced recruitment depression on the smallmouth bass population through its influence on a single parameter i e growth rate k mortalities syoy sjuv syoung sadu or recruitment r each factor was divided into ten levels between a lower and upper bound the lower bound for water temperature was the optimum temperature and its upper bound was the upper lethal temperature for smallmouth bass the lower bounds for flow velocity and relative vtg level were 2 m s and 0 1 and their upper bounds were 4 m s and 1 respectively we then explored the effect of temperature on populations through affecting multiple parameters simultaniously inlcuding growth rate k and mortalities syoy sjuv syoung and sadu lastly we tested a combined effect of temperature flow velocity and chemcial induced recruitment depression by combining one of the two levels low and high from each factor table 2 2 3 3 population evaluation the proportional stock density psd defined as the percentage of stock length the size of a fish reaching maturity fish that are also larger than quality length the size of a fish most anglers like to catch has been used as a measure of population structure and function for freshwater fish species anderson and weithman 1978 anderson 1980 gabelhouse 1984 willis et al 1993 gabelhouse 1984 suggested that the stock length and the quality length for smallmouth bass should be close to137 178 mm and 246 279 mm respectively in this study we set the minimum stock and quality lengths for smallmouth bass to be 225 mm and 300 mm respectively and thus the psd was calculated as 13 p s d n u m b e r o f f i s h 300 mm i e i n t h e l a s t t w o s i z e c l a s s e s n u m b e r o f f i s h 225 mm i e i n t h e l a s t t h r e e s i z e c l a s s e s 100 we could not find a psd range suggested for smallmouth bass population in the literature but studies have suggested a range of 40 70 for largemouth bass micropterus salmoides gabelhouse 1984 therefore in this study we also examined the psd over time under each scenario and calculated the probability of psd falling within this range 40 70 the psd probability for the modeled smallmouth population 3 results 3 1 effect of water temperature flow velocity and chemical induced reproduction depression through influencing a single parameter higher water temperature led to larger population size through affecting growth rate except for the susquehanna population in which increased water temperature showed little impact represented by clustered population size trajectories across temperature levels fig 3 water temperature had greater impact on population size through affecting young survival yoy and juvenile than young adult and adult survival represented by more differentiated population size trajectories across temperature levels higher water temperature resulted in smaller population size through affecting survival modeled smallmouth populations benefited from lower flow velocity and higher recruitment rates vtg levels which resulted larger population sizes because the calculation of psd in this study involved only young adult and adult fish only those factors that influenced young adult and adult life stages affected the psd fig 4 and psd probability fig 5 those factors included water temperature which modified growth rate and young adult and adult survival specifically high water temperature reduced psd through affecting growth rate and young adult and adult survival fig 4 the psd of juniata and susquehanna populations was reduced below the suggested range for smallmouth bass 40 70 as water temperature increased in all scenarios including temperature flow velocity and recruitment scenarios the juniata and susquehanna populations had higher psd than the allegheny population in which psd trajectories across all abiotic factor levels fell below the suggested range the psd probability declined as water temperature rose through affecting growth for the allegheny population and through affecting young adult and adult survival in all three populations fig 5 the psd probability of juniata and susquehanna populations had a dome curve response to warming water temperature through affecting growth with increasing psd probability as temperature elevated before a threshold around 31 2 c in our simulation and then followed by a sharp decline with further temperature rise similar to psd the psd probability of juniata and susquehanna populations was higher 0 1 0 8 for than the allegheny population 0 0 4 in all scenarios the allegheny population had a psd probability of approximately zero in most scenarios due to psd values falling below the suggested range fig 4 3 2 effect of water temperature through influencing multiple parameters simultaneously when water temperature affected growth and survival of all life stages simultaneously higher temperature resulted in a smaller population size lower psd and lower chance of having psd within the suggested range fig 6 similar to the single effect of temperature through affecting growth the psd probability of juniata and susquehanna populations was raised by increasing temperature up to a threshold and started to decrease sharply as temperature further increased overall higher psd and higher psd probability were observed for the juniata and susquehanna populations compared to the allegheny population 3 3 combined effect of water temperature flow velocity and chemical induced reproduction depression populations with high recruitment levels sustained relatively large population size in most scenarios even under high water temperature and or high flow velocity fig 7 in some scenarios for the allegheny and juniata populations low water temperature plus low flow velocity slightly compensated the negative effect of low recruitment by increasing population size water temperature became a dominant force in the combined effect on psd and psd probability with higher temperature leading to lower psd and lower psd probability regardless of flow velocity and recruitment level compared to the allegheny population the juniata and susquehanna populations had approximately 75 higher psd and 25 higher psd probability under low water temperature scenarios 4 discussion evaluating the population level effects of abiotic factors especially those related to anthropogenic alterations to the environment such as water temperatures streamflow and environmental contaminants supports fish and wildlife conservation e g habitat restoration endangered species restoration maintenance of important sports fisheries hobday and tegner 2002 li and rogers bennett 2017 and environmental management e g remediating contaminated areas and planning new facilities pastorok et al 2002 abiotic factors such as temperature streamflow and chemical contamination do not only directly impact individual level traits e g growth survival or fecundity but may also degrade habitat and reduce resources block migration routes lower population growth rate and slow down population recovery after disturbance these effects are difficult to predict directly based on individual traits but have to be evaluated from the population level perspective for example population growth of aquatic species was found to be sometimes more sensitive to chemical contamination than individual level traits forbes and calow 1999 in addition population level effects of cadmium and pentachlorophenol on soil invertebrates could not be predicted by directly using individual level traits kammenga et al 2001 focusing only on the individual level and ignoring population or higher level e g ecosystem or landscape level effects can lead to inaccurate risk assessment and possibly mislead management decision making e g barnthouse and suter 1986 pastorok et al 2003 however evaluation of abiotic effects beyond individual level endpoints e g population abundance and age structure species richness is generally lacking pastorok et al 2002 this study illustrated a model simulation approach by evaluating population level effects of water temperature flow velocity and chemical induced recruitment depression on a riverine fish the smallmouth bass however the proposed framework can extend to other abiotic factors and fish and wildlife species also this study extends evaluation of the effect of a single abiotic factor to a study that simulates the combined effect of multiple factors which has become a challenge in the environmental sciences lapointe et al 2014 gandar et al 2017 response to environmental stress may also vary among populations that differ in underlying population dynamics for example higher water temperature led to a larger population size by affecting growth rate of the allegheny and juniata populations but this temperature effect was minimal on the population size of the susquehanna population projected population size over years showed a more dynamic response to environmental stress from the susquehanna population than from the other two populations the juniata and susquehanna populations had higher psd than the allegheny population our previous study showed that the estimated growth and mortality of smallmouth bass varied greatly spatially shaped by different habitat conditions across rivers for example yoy mortality of the susquehanna population was estimated five times higher than those of the allegheny and juniata populations fish of the juniata population tended to grow slower but larger than the fish of the other two populations these differences in population characteristics may have led to their differential responses to environmental stress in this simulation this result suggests that the smallmouth bass populations in pennsylvania would benefit from river specific management plans regarding environmental stressors in this study we only considered the effects of exposure to chemical contaminants on recruitment through a pathway that affected females i e a decrease in vtg in female fish however exposure to chemical contaminants may also affect behavior and survival of individuals of both sexes taking smallmouth bass as an example whose male fish guard and care for the young endocrine disrupting compound edc induced intersex and potential changes in male nest guarding behavior could potentially reduce fertilization success and fry survival and further reduce recruitment coble 1975 blazer et al 2012 arway and smith 2013 exposure to chemicals may also reduce disease resistance through immunosuppression blazer et al 2010 although we did not model disease related mortality explicitly we did model stage specific survival as a function of temperature which may capture some of the disease related increases in natural mortality that are confounded by both temperature and chemical exposure studies linking chemical exposure and concentrations to reproductive success and survival of both sexes and multiple life stages are needed to better quantify the complex interactions that may lead to detrimental population level effects and how they may interact with other biotic and abiotic factors because we were only able to investigate the effects of exposure to chemical contaminants on recruitment as opposed to also modeling the potential effects of chemical exposure on growth and survival our results are likely conservative estimates on potential population level effects in addition our modeling of chemical contaminant effects was not based on any specific compound but rather on response of an indicator to exposure future research that can incorporate effect pathways of specific chemicals will aid our understanding of the mechanisms leading to negative population level outcomes high recruitment levels tended to counteract the negative impacts of high water temperature and or high flow velocity on smallmouth bass and helped sustained a large population size this result suggested that under stressful environmental conditions such as warming water temperatures and increased spring flow velocity management strategies that focus on boosting recruitment could be feasible and efficient to sustain a large population the strategies benefiting recruitment e g restricted harvesting season or area and harvestable size limit reducing exposure to potential edcs and other chemicals affecting disease resistance are generally easier to achieve compared to those attempting to mediate the stochasticity of river environments e g building dams or modifying morphology of rivers to adjust streamflow in the example of smallmouth bass in pennsylvania stressful environmental conditions have become a concern of fishery management because spawning and the young survival of smallmouth bass are greatly influenced by environmental conditions including temperature flow velocity dissolved oxygen concentrations and water quality rejwan et al 1999 lorantas et al 2013 shull and pulket 2015 smith et al 2015 the fishery is currently managed through closed seasons size creel limit stocking and habitat enhancement which all benefit recruitment if resources are not a limiting factor based on our study the maintenance of high recruitment levels and its ability to mitigate against the negative effects of higher water temperatures and flow velocity suggests that any negative effects of chemical contaminants on recruitment could be particularly detrimental if an increase in water temperatures or spring flow velocity is predicted to occur as a result of changing environmental conditions the benefit of boosting recruitment to counteract any negative effect of warming water temperatures and high flow velocity is limited to sustaining a large population boosting recruitment would not help improve population structure i e psd or the psd probability in our simulation instead water temperature became the dominant force in the combined effect on psd and psd probability this result is a result of how psd was calculated our calculation of psd involved only mature fish i e young adults and adults and thus only those factors influencing young adults and adults in our model would modify psd which only included water temperature therefore our simulation cannot imply that recruitment or flow velocity plays a less important role than water temperature in affecting population structure also this result highlighted the importance of using multiple criteria in population evaluation that cover different aspects of the population such as population size and population size structure in conclusion we demonstrated a model simulation approach to explore population level effects of environmental factors and exposure to chemical contamination on fish and wildlife using three smallmouth bass populations in pennsylvania as a case study variability in population level responses to environmental stressors is likely common based on differences in underlying population dynamics environmental factors that influence different life stages of a species may also have differential effects on populations based on what life stage is being affected for instance factors affecting young adult and adult may play an important role in modifying psd and psd probability factors and management strategies that benefit recruitment may help compensate negative effect of warming water temperature and high flow velocity on population size and water temperature may dominate the combined effect on population size structure e g psd and psd probability in this simulation disclaimer this

25235,evaluating stochastic abiotic factors and their combined effects on fish and wildlife populations have been challenging in environmental sciences contributing to this challenge is the paucity of data describing how observations made on individuals related to exposure to chemical compounds ultimately effect population vital rates and how this exposure interacts with other abiotic drivers using three smallmouth bass populations in pennsylvania as a case study we explored both single factor and combined effects of water temperature flow velocity and chemical exposure on populations through a model simulation although there are many pathways through which chemicals can affect population vital rates we focused on one where chemical exposure leads to reduced reproduction among the three populations considered two the juniata and susquehanna populations have experienced adverse health including the potential adverse effects of environmental stress and chemical contamination that may cause disease and mortality of young of year yoy various skin lesions and a high prevalence of intersex or testicular oocytes in adults the third population the alleghany population has not encountered mortality events of yoy and intersex prevalence is much lower the simulation involved projecting populations using a length based model under different environmental conditions in the simulations abiotic factors influenced population dynamics through their impacts on growth survival and recruitment response to the same environmental stress varied by population and life stage of the species factors affecting young adult and adult life stages had great influence on proportional stock density psd and the probability of having psd within the suggested range psd probability increases in water temperature had a negative effect and dominant role in the combined effect on population size structure e g psd and psd probability increases in flow velocity during the spring season also had a negative effect on abundance populations with high recruitment rates sustained relatively large population size even under high water temperature and or high flow velocity which suggests that factors and management strategies that benefit recruitment such as reduced chemical contaminants may compensate for the negative effects of warming water temperatures and high spring flow velocity on population size keywords growth mortality flow velocity temperature plasma vitellogenin proportional stock density 1 introduction the importance of water temperature and flow in regulating fluvial ecosystems has been well accepted for example water temperature controls metabolism and growth beschta et al 1987 allen 1995 johnson and jones 2000 and can influence disease prevalence marcos lopez et al 2010 flow modifies water chemistry mobility of substrates habitat condition and delivery of nutrients and organic matter which further influences behavior and survival of individual organisms statzner and higler 1986 jager et al 1993 allen 1995 grossman et al 1998 hart and finelli 1999 in addition the potential effects of chemicals on fish populations are of increasing concern nash et al 2004 kidd et al 2007 miller et al 2007 focks et al 2014 chemicals present in fertilizer pesticides personal care products and pharmaceuticals enter river ecosystems through a variety of pathways including overland storm flow point source discharge and groundwater many chemicals can have negative effects on wildlife by impairing reproduction and growth and some may suppress the immune system thereby reducing disease resistance e g dunier and siwicki 1993 miller et al 2007 milla et al 2011 these effects do not only occur at the individual level but can also pass onto the population level as a result the potential population level effects of chemical exposure have received increased attention pastorok et al 2002 grimm and thorbek 2014 for example laboratory studies showed that rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss exposed to o p ddt and o p dde may have lower reproduction success donohoe and curtis 1996 exposure to the synthetic estrogen ethynylestradiol in the natural environment caused the collapse of some fish populations kidd et al 2007 palace et al 2009 the effects of chemicals on fish and wildlife populations are complex especially in wild populations where difficulties exist in determining cause effect relationships and where populations experience multiple abiotic and biotic influences on vital rates such as the potential influence of water temperatures and streamflow on life stage specific growth and survival rates this inherent complexity of natural systems reduces the ability to predict adverse outcomes from exposure and to assess risk for fish and wildlife populations lapointe et al 2014 gandar et al 2017 however quantifying population level effects of chemical exposure in conjunction with changes in water temperature and streamflow which are fundamental physical properties of fluvial ecosystems is often necessary to help inform management and conservation decision making many of the existing modeling efforts to evaluate risk of chemicals to fish and wildlife populations focus on the mechanisms linking chemical exposure to individual level endpoints for example the hazard quotient approach barnthouse and suter 1986 the adverse outcome pathway model e g gust et al 2016 or dynamic energy budget models e g ashauer and escher 2010 challenges still lie in quantitatively evaluating the effects beyond individual level endpoints such as effects on population abundance and age structure species richness and ecosystem service pastorok et al 2002 grimm and thorbek 2014 forbes et al 2017 the individual based model e g forbes et al 2017 provides an alternative to explore population level and ecosystem level effects of chemicals but has high data demand part of the challenge is due to the paucity of data describing how observations made on individuals related to exposure to chemical compounds i e biomarkers ultimately affect populations hamilton et al 2016 for example if intersex is detected in a population the population level consequences are often unclear harris et al 2011 in addition assessing population level effects is often limited to a relatively small number of species where adequate data exists that allow for the quantification of abundance and stage specific vital rates despite these challenges and the subsequent uncertainty that is introduced quantitative population level assessments represent a critical exercise not only for informing natural resource decision making but also for highlighting the relative importance of different factors in structuring populations and for identifying data gaps that can inform future research efforts smallmouth bass was chosen as the model species for this study because it has a life history that is sensitive to environmental conditions including high water temperatures streamflow and chemical contaminants both high flow velocity and heat stress can negatively affect the nesting success and survival of early life stage of smallmouth bass shuter et al 1980 goff 1985 lukas and orth 1995 peterson and kwak 1999 rejwan et al 1999 lorantas et al 2013 in pennsylvania rivers in particular low recruitment and population declines of smallmouth bass in some rivers e g the juniata and susquehanna rivers has been observed since 2005 a variety of pathogens and parasites are observed during disease and mortality events starliper et al 2013 smith et al 2015 suggesting immunosuppression additionally a higher prevalence and severity of intersex testicular oocytes was observed in smallmouth bass collected in the susquehanna and juniata rivers when compared to the allegheny river blazer et al 2014 exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds and other chemicals is one of the potential causes for adverse health effects identified by state managers and scientists shull and pulket 2015 using smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu as a case study the first objective of this study was to use simulation to explore population level effects of water temperature flow velocity and exposure to chemicals that reduce reproduction when they act as a single factor multi factor but on a single life history parameter or multi factor on multiple life history parameters we borrowed or constructed relationships between life history parameters and environmental factors from the literature based on the life history of this species the second objective was to evaluate how population level responses to changes in temperature flow velocity and chemical exposure might vary by populations that have different underlying population dynamics to achieve the second objective we simulated three smallmouth bass populations whose life history parameters were estimated based on data collected from three pennsylvania rivers the third objective was to investigate the relative importance of life history parameters through which these abiotic factors influence population dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 length based population dynamics model in this study we applied a length based population dynamics model called length based model hereafter to simulate population level effects of envronmental stress the length based model describes the

history of smallmouth bass we set seven size classes in this study ranging from 25 mm to 550 mm the first three size classes are 25 75 mm 75 1 125 mm and 125 1 175 mm containing the young of year yoy age 0 and the fourth size class 175 1 225 mm included juveniles that were mostly immature hoopes 1987 the last three size classes contained mature fish with the size class 225 1 300 mm representing young adults before reaching the harvestable size of 305 mm and the size classes 300 1 375 mm and 375 1 550 mm representing adults subject to fishing lorantas et al 2013 in the model we made the following assumptions about survival rate 1 survival rate of the first three size classes were a constant syoy representing the survival of yoy 2 survival rate of the fourth and fifth size class were a constant sjuv and syoung representing the survival of juveniles and young adults respectively and 3 survival rate of the last two size classes were a constant sadu representing the survival of adult

at 25 29 c horning and pearson 1973 shuter et al 1980 edwards et al 1983 in the simulation we assumed growth coefficient k to decrease with a temperature t higher than 29 c according to a scalar wt k

organism because male smallmouth bass in some pennsylvania rivers including our case study populations have been documented with high intersex prevalence blazer et al 2014 we predicted that high intersex prevalence could influence recruitment through a reduction in fertilization success and parental care niemuth and klaper 2015 however because no data exist to link intersex prevalence to recruitment for smallmouth bass we used a surrogate pathway for chemical exposure to affect recruitment through an inhibition of plasma vitellogenin vtg in females mills et al 2001 wheeler et al 2005 white et al 2017 examples of such chemical compounds include steroidal androgen 17ß trenboone fungicide prochloraz and pharmaceutical fadrozole vtg is important for egg production and these chemicals can reduce vtg levels affect fecundity and egg quality and eventually reduce recruitment of the population tyler and sumpter 1996 miller et al 2007 although we have not observed a reduction in female smallmouth bass vtg in our case study populations we used this relationship to demonstrate the population level effects of exposure to chemicals that affect reproduction regardless of the exact mechanism and to compare its effect independently and in combination with changes in water temperature and flow velocity in this simulation we borrowed a relationship developed using female fatheaded minnow pimephales promelas which describes the effect of vtg depression on female fecundity introduced by five hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis active chemicals miller et al 2007 we adopted this relationship to represent the effect of vtg depression on average annual recruitment of smallmouth bass caused by exposure to chemical contaminants fig 1 11 w v t g r 0 042 0 95 w v t g where wvtg r is a scalar for average annual recruitment r and wvtg is a scalar for vtg concentration i e the proportion of vtg concentration relative to baseline level assuming independent effect of each factor we calculated the combined effect of temperature flow velocity and exposure to chemical contaminants on a single life history parameter according to response addition schipper et al 2013 for example in this simulation both temperature and flow velocity had impact on yoy survival and thus the combined effect of temperature and flow velocity on yoy suvival was represented by a combined scalar wcom syoy as follows 12 w c o m s y o y w t s y o y w v s y o y 2 3 simulation with smallmouth bass 2 3 1 model parameterization this simulation study was based on three smallmouth bass populations that differ in their underlying population dynamics their life history parameters were estimated based on data collected from three pennsylvania rivers the alleghany river the juniata river and the susquehanna river we ran simulations for the each population and compared their responses to the same environmental stress the juniata and susquehanna population once supported a world class recreational bass fishery in pennsylvania but have suffered from degraded water quality disease and chemical contamination these issues have likely contributed to die offs of young bass and abundance decline of adult bass since 2005 arway and smith 2013 lorantas et al 2013 less disease and mortality of young are observed in the alleghany population which also has lower intersex prevalence and severity in adults simulation involved projecting the smallmouth bass population using the length based model with pre specified parameters table 1 under different environmental conditions fig 2 parameterization of the length based model was based on estimates of the most recent year 2012 from one of our previous studies in which we estimated the growth and mortality of these three smallmouth bass populations using a bayesian hierarchical modeling approach li et al 2017 the parameter values in table 1 were used as baseline values and were adjusted by multiplying the scalars corresponding to environmental conditions under each scenario we ran 1000 iterations for each scenario and evaluated the average response of the population in each scenario we projected the population for 100 years and tracked the population size at each size class over time 2 3 2 scenarios we first examined the effect of single factor i e water temperature flow velocity or chemical induced recruitment depression on the smallmouth bass population through its influence on a single parameter i e growth rate k mortalities syoy sjuv syoung sadu or recruitment r each factor was divided into ten levels between a lower and upper bound the lower bound for water temperature was the optimum temperature and its upper bound was the upper lethal temperature for smallmouth bass the lower bounds for flow velocity and relative vtg level were 2 m s and 0 1 and their upper bounds were 4 m s and 1 respectively we then explored the effect of temperature on populations through affecting multiple parameters simultaniously inlcuding growth rate k and mortalities syoy sjuv syoung and sadu lastly we tested a combined effect of temperature flow velocity and chemcial induced recruitment depression by combining one of the two levels low and high from each factor table 2 2 3 3 population evaluation the proportional stock density psd defined as the percentage of stock length the size of a fish reaching maturity fish that are also larger than quality length the size of a fish most anglers like to catch has been used as a measure of population structure and function for freshwater fish species anderson and weithman 1978 anderson 1980 gabelhouse 1984 willis et al 1993 gabelhouse 1984 suggested that the stock length and the quality length for smallmouth bass should be close to137 178 mm and 246 279 mm respectively in this study we set the minimum stock and quality lengths for smallmouth bass to be 225 mm and 300 mm respectively and thus the psd was calculated as 13 p s d n u m b e r o f f i s h 300 mm i e i n t h e l a s t t w o s i z e c l a s s e s n u m b e r o f f i s h 225 mm i e i n t h e l a s t t h r e e s i z e c l a s s e s 100 we could not find a psd range suggested for smallmouth bass population in the literature but studies have suggested a range of 40 70 for largemouth bass micropterus salmoides gabelhouse 1984 therefore in this study we also examined the psd over time under each scenario and calculated the probability of psd falling within this range 40 70 the psd probability for the modeled smallmouth population 3 results 3 1 effect of water temperature flow velocity and chemical induced reproduction depression through influencing a single parameter higher water temperature led to larger population size through affecting growth rate except for the susquehanna population in which increased water temperature showed little impact represented by clustered population size trajectories across temperature levels fig 3 water temperature had greater impact on population size through affecting young survival yoy and juvenile than young adult and adult survival represented by more differentiated population size trajectories across temperature levels higher water temperature resulted in smaller population size through affecting survival modeled smallmouth populations benefited from lower flow velocity and higher recruitment rates vtg levels which resulted larger population sizes because the calculation of psd in this study involved only young adult and adult fish only those factors that influenced young adult and adult life stages affected the psd fig 4 and psd probability fig 5 those factors included water temperature which modified growth rate and young adult and adult survival specifically high water temperature reduced psd through affecting growth rate and young adult and adult survival fig 4 the psd of juniata and susquehanna populations was reduced below the suggested range for smallmouth bass 40 70 as water temperature increased in all scenarios including temperature flow velocity and recruitment scenarios the juniata and susquehanna populations had higher psd than the allegheny population in which psd trajectories across all abiotic factor levels fell below the suggested range the psd probability declined as water temperature rose through affecting growth for the allegheny population and through affecting young adult and adult survival in all three populations fig 5 the psd probability of juniata and susquehanna populations had a dome curve response to warming water temperature through affecting growth with increasing psd probability as temperature elevated before a threshold around 31 2 c in our simulation and then followed by a sharp decline with further temperature rise similar to psd the psd probability of juniata and susquehanna populations was higher 0 1 0 8 for than the allegheny population 0 0 4 in all scenarios the allegheny population had a psd probability of approximately zero in most scenarios due to psd values falling below the suggested range fig 4 3 2 effect of water temperature through influencing multiple parameters simultaneously when water temperature affected growth and survival of all life stages simultaneously higher temperature resulted in a smaller population size lower psd and lower chance of having psd within the suggested range fig 6 similar to the single effect of temperature through affecting growth the psd probability of juniata and susquehanna populations was raised by increasing temperature up to a threshold and started to decrease sharply as temperature further increased overall higher psd and higher psd probability were observed for the juniata and susquehanna populations compared to the allegheny population 3 3 combined effect of water temperature flow velocity and chemical induced reproduction depression populations with high recruitment levels sustained relatively large population size in most scenarios even under high water temperature and or high flow velocity fig 7 in some scenarios for the allegheny and juniata populations low water temperature plus low flow velocity slightly compensated the negative effect of low recruitment by increasing population size water temperature became a dominant force in the combined effect on psd and psd probability with higher temperature leading to lower psd and lower psd probability regardless of flow velocity and recruitment level compared to the allegheny population the juniata and susquehanna populations had approximately 75 higher psd and 25 higher psd probability under low water temperature scenarios 4 discussion evaluating the population level effects of abiotic factors especially those related to anthropogenic alterations to the

sports fisheries hobday and tegner 2002 li and rogers bennett 2017 and environmental management e g remediating contaminated areas and planning new facilities pastorok et al 2002 abiotic factors such as temperature streamflow and chemical contamination do not only directly impact individual level traits e g growth survival or fecundity but may also degrade habitat and reduce resources block migration routes lower population growth rate and slow down population recovery after disturbance these effects are difficult to predict directly based on individual traits but have to be evaluated from the population level perspective for example population growth of aquatic species was found to be sometimes more sensitive to chemical contamination than individual level traits forbes and calow 1999 in addition population level effects of cadmium and pentachlorophenol on soil invertebrates could not be predicted by directly using individual level traits kammenga et al 2001 focusing only on the individual level and ignoring population or higher level e g ecosystem or landscape level effects can lead to inaccurate risk assessment and possibly mislead management decision making e g barnthouse and suter 1986 pastorok et al 2003 however evaluation of abiotic effects beyond individual level endpoints e g population abundance and age structure species richness is generally lacking pastorok et al 2002 this study illustrated a model simulation approach by evaluating population level effects of water temperature flow velocity and chemical induced recruitment depression on a riverine fish the smallmouth bass however the proposed framework can extend to other abiotic factors and fish and wildlife species also this study extends evaluation of the effect of a single abiotic factor to a study that simulates the combined effect of multiple factors which has become a challenge in the environmental sciences lapointe et al 2014 gandar et al 2017 response to environmental stress may also vary among populations that differ in underlying population dynamics for example higher water temperature led to a larger population size by affecting growth rate of the allegheny and juniata populations but this temperature effect was minimal on the population size of the susquehanna population projected population size over years showed a more dynamic response to environmental stress from the susquehanna population than from the other two populations the juniata and susquehanna populations had higher psd than the allegheny population our previous study showed that the estimated growth and mortality of smallmouth bass varied greatly spatially shaped by different habitat conditions across rivers for example yoy mortality of the susquehanna population was estimated five times higher than those of the allegheny and juniata populations fish of the juniata population tended to grow slower but larger than the fish of the other two populations these differences in population characteristics may have led to their differential responses to environmental stress in this simulation this result suggests that the smallmouth bass populations in pennsylvania would benefit from river specific management plans regarding environmental stressors in this study we only considered the effects of exposure to chemical contaminants on recruitment through a pathway that affected females i e a decrease in vtg in female fish however exposure to chemical contaminants may also affect behavior and survival of individuals of both sexes taking smallmouth bass as an example whose male fish guard and care for the young endocrine disrupting compound edc induced intersex and potential changes in male nest guarding behavior could potentially reduce fertilization success and fry survival and further reduce recruitment coble 1975 blazer et al 2012 arway and smith 2013 exposure to chemicals may also reduce disease resistance through immunosuppression blazer et al 2010 although we did not model disease related mortality explicitly we did model stage specific survival as a function of temperature which may capture some of the disease related increases in natural mortality that are confounded by both temperature and chemical exposure studies linking chemical exposure and concentrations to reproductive success and survival of both sexes and multiple life stages are needed to better quantify the complex interactions that may lead to detrimental population level effects and how they may interact with other biotic and abiotic factors because we were only able to investigate the effects of exposure to chemical contaminants on recruitment as opposed to also modeling the potential effects of chemical exposure on growth and survival our results are likely conservative estimates on potential population level effects in addition our modeling of chemical contaminant effects was not based on any specific compound but rather on response of an indicator to exposure future research that can incorporate effect pathways of specific chemicals will aid our understanding of the mechanisms leading to negative population level outcomes high recruitment levels tended to counteract the negative impacts of high water temperature and or high flow velocity on smallmouth bass and helped sustained a large population size this result suggested that under stressful environmental conditions such as warming water temperatures and increased spring flow velocity management strategies that focus on boosting recruitment could be feasible and efficient to sustain a large population the strategies benefiting recruitment e g restricted harvesting season or area and harvestable size limit reducing exposure to potential edcs and other chemicals affecting disease resistance are generally easier to achieve compared to those attempting to mediate the stochasticity of river environments e g building dams or modifying morphology of rivers to adjust streamflow in the example of smallmouth bass in pennsylvania stressful environmental conditions have become a concern of fishery management because spawning and the young survival of smallmouth bass are greatly influenced by environmental conditions including temperature flow velocity dissolved oxygen concentrations and water quality rejwan et al 1999 lorantas et al 2013 shull and pulket 2015 smith et al 2015 the fishery is currently managed through closed seasons size creel limit stocking and habitat enhancement which all benefit recruitment if resources are not a limiting factor based on our study the maintenance of high recruitment levels and its ability to mitigate against the negative effects of higher water temperatures and flow velocity suggests that any negative effects of chemical contaminants on recruitment could be particularly detrimental if an increase in water temperatures or spring flow velocity is predicted to occur as a result of changing environmental conditions the benefit of boosting recruitment to counteract any negative effect of warming water temperatures and high flow velocity is limited to sustaining a large population boosting recruitment would not help improve population structure i e psd or the psd probability in our simulation instead water temperature became the dominant force in the combined effect on psd and psd probability this result is a result of how psd was calculated our calculation of psd involved only mature fish i e young adults and adults and thus only those factors influencing young adults and adults in our model would modify psd which only included water temperature therefore our simulation cannot imply that recruitment or flow velocity plays a less important role than water temperature in affecting population structure also this result highlighted the importance of using multiple criteria in population evaluation that cover different aspects of the population such as population size and population size structure in conclusion we demonstrated a model simulation approach to explore population level effects of environmental factors and exposure to chemical contamination on fish and wildlife using three smallmouth bass populations in pennsylvania as a case study variability in population level responses to environmental stressors is likely common based on differences in underlying population dynamics environmental factors that influence different life stages of a species may also have differential effects on populations based on what life stage is being affected for instance factors affecting young adult and adult may play an important role in modifying psd and psd probability factors and management strategies that benefit recruitment may help compensate negative effect of warming water temperature and high flow velocity on population size and water temperature may dominate the combined effect on population size structure e g psd and psd probability in this simulation disclaimer this

25236,we developed and applied a wildfire simulation package in the envision agent based landscape modelling system the wildfire package combines statistical modelling of fire occurrence with a high resolution mechanistic wildfire spread model that can capture fine scale effects of fire feedbacks and fuel management and replicate restoration strategies at scales that are meaningful to forest managers we applied the model to a landscape covering 1 2 million ha of fire prone area in central oregon usa where wildland fires are increasingly impacting conservation amenity values and developed areas we conducted simulations to examine the effect of human versus natural ignitions on future fire regimes under current restoration programs and whether contemporary fire regimes observed in the past 20 years are likely to change as result of fire feedbacks and management activities the ignition prediction model revealed non linear effects of location and time of year and distinct spatiotemporal patterns for human versus natural ignitions fire rotation interval among replicate simulations varied from 78 to 170 years and changed little over the 50 yr simulation suggesting a stable but highly variable and uncertain future fire regime interestingly the potential for fire on fire feedbacks was higher for human versus natural ignitions due to human ignition hotspots within the study area we compare the methods and findings with other forest landscape simulation model flsm studies and discuss future application of flsms to address emerging wildfire management and policy issues on fire frequent forests in the western us keywords agent based modelling envision landscape modelling forest management modelling wildfire modelling generalized additive models 1 introduction in the western us large scale forest management efforts are being implemented on public lands to restore forest resiliency to wildfire in fire dependent forests and reduce fire risk to socioecological values the work is aimed at counteracting the effects of a century of fire suppression originally intended to reduce wildfire risk calkin et al 2014 north et al 2015 the unforeseen and unintended consequences of these past fire suppression policies have been amplified by climate change westerling 2016 urban expansion theobald and romme 2007 and poor perception of risk from highly uncertain wildfire events leading to a system that has been termed a socioecological pathology fischer et al 2016 one tool that can help understand the long term effectiveness of these policies are forest landscape simulation models flsms that simulate forest management under a background of stochastic wildfire over time these models can help test a wide range of policy questions about how landscapes respond to forest management activities under a stochastic background of large fire events that often mask long term landscape change for instance does variability in bioregional and landscape scale climatic drivers of wildfire overwhelm the potential effects of fire on fire feedbacks under elevated burning rates predicted by climate change models mckenzie and littell 2017 there are few flsms that can simulate detailed forest fuels and restoration management programs under a background of stochastic large e g 104 ha fire loudermilk et al 2014 scheller and mladenoff 2004 2007 syphard et al 2011 and even fewer available to researchers with the ability to incorporate human decision making related to forests and fire for example modelling landscape trajectories in response to widespread federal forest restoration policies in the western us stephens et al 2016 requires the simulation of spatially explicit stand scale simulation of fuel treatments that include multi year sequences of mechanical thinning surface fuels mastication piling and prescribed fire silvicultural prescriptions aimed at reducing fire severity must be modelled to consider the structure species biophysical setting and fire ecology of individual stands cochran et al 1994 haugo et al 2015 o hara et al 2010 stand treatments within restoration planning areas must then be coordinated in terms of treatment density dimensions and spatial arrangement finney 2001 fig 5 to achieve specific ecological and fire management objectives collins et al 2010 finney 2001 stevens et al 2016 equally important is the accurate representation of post treatment fuels since the landscape effect of fuel treatments on large fire spread is strongly influenced by the ratio of pre to post treatment spread rates see finney

groups that drive wildfire ignitions in specific locations and seasons also respond to wildfire impacts over time with policies to manage landscape fuels in this paper we describe the development and application of a wildfire modelling subsystem within the agent based landscape modelling system envision bolte et al 2004 guzy et al 2008 hulse et al 2009 envision is a spatially explicit landscape modelling platform capable of simulating multiple processes of landscape change and has been applied to a range of environmental management problems including watershed management restoration of fire adapted forests and land use change barros et al 2017 bolte 2010 spies et al 2017 we describe the design testing and application of the wildfire submodel on a 1 2 million ha study area specifically we used envision to simulate a 50 yr period with and without contemporary forest management activities and used the outputs to address the following questions 1 are fire distributions and fire severity stationary over time for human versus natural ignitions or are there tipping points 2 is there evidence for potential feedbacks between human and natural ignitions i e is current fire limited by past fire 3 what are the effects of contemporary forest restoration policies on fire distributions generated from the different sources of ignitions 4 what is the variability in annual fire activity relative to the effects of management the methods advance the integration of wildfire simulation with agent based landscape models and the results show how landscape feedbacks and human drivers of wildfire can affect fire regimes and ecological conditions we compare our work with envision to other landscape modeling studies and highlight current trends as well as important differences in the structuring of submodels for wildfire and forest management the work complements related studies as part of the forests people fire project spies et al 2014 on long term impacts of alternative forest

small private inholdings homeowners the tribal lands confederated tribes of warm springs 21 occupy the northern portion of the study area and federal lands 61 are primarily the deschutes national forest dnf corporate forests 6 and family forests 4 are intermixed with federal land the gilchrist state forest accounts for 2 of the land area and homeowners cover about 7 of the study area

et al 2009 2016 is a landscape modelling platform that consists of a core spatial landscape and policy system with a plug in architecture allowing the incorporation of physical and biological disturbances and human activities on a spatially explicit landscape over time appendix a fig a2 in supplemental material the modelling platform consists of five main components 1 a spatial framework for representing landscape features as polygons points and grids 2 an agent based modelling system to simulate the decision makers and their adoption of different policies 3 a policy scenario building system that specifies policies with landscape activities 4 a plug in architecture to incorporate autonomous process models submodels and 5 evaluation models that track and report landscape production metrics the interface also provides a number of tools for visualizing spatial inputs and outputs envision landscapes were represented by individual decision units idu polygons attributed with a vegetation state fuels and management activities spies et al 2017 envision submodels were created to model landscape change over time as affected by wildfire vegetation succession and forest management activities appendix a fig a2 in supplemental material the latter is implemented via a preference system specific to each policy scenario that allocates management activities on the landscape the envision configuration for the fpf project included five submodels vegetation dynamics forest management wildfire and wildfire effects and population growth spies et al 2017 the latter model is described elsewhere and was not invoked in the present study the remaining models are briefly described below with a focus on the wildfire and wildfire effects submodels additional details are available in appendix a in the supplementary material and in related papers that used the modelling system ager et al 2017c charnley et al 2017 spies et al 2017 2 3 vegetation dynamics vegetation dynamics were simulated with a state and transition simulation model stsm adopted from halofsky et al 2014a the model classified the landscape into a discrete set of vegetation states hereafter vegclass with each vegclass having a probabilistic and deterministic pathway that describes the vegetation trajectory over time in response to succession and disturbance wildfire and or forest management a vegclass is characterized by a dominant and codominant tree species average tree size forest canopy cover percentage and canopy layering category table 1 table a1 appendix a in supplementary material shows the ecological stratification of the landscape and potential vegetation management groups vegclasses are transient and define the state of an idu at a given point in time when one or more characteristics of the vegclass change a state transition is triggered and the idu is attributed a new vegclass which is passed along to the next simulation time step state transitions which can be deterministic or probabilistic were developed using the vegetation dynamics development tool vddt and adopted from halofsky et al 2014a vegclass attributes at the initial condition year one in simulation were based on 2006 satellite imagery and inventory plots using the gradient nearest neighborhood gnn method ohmann et al 2011 and updated to reflect vegetation growth and large historical fires recorded in the monitoring trends in burn severity dataset mtbs mtbs data access 2017 for 2006 to 2012 and forest management see below and see spies et al 2017 for more details 2 4 forest management forest management was modelled by allocating treatments on the landscape based on user defined allocation rules that are specific to treatment actions and the ownerships in the study area however only federal land management was modelled in this study management unit specific wood volume or area treatment targets are used to constrain treatment activity allocation rules include stand characteristics that preclude management hectares treated per year and mean patch size of treated areas management options included various types of commercial and non commercial harvesting prescribed fire and mowing and grinding simulated on federal lands in the current simulations we specifically modelled two scenarios 1 a no management scenario noman and 2 a current management scenario cman that treated a total of 8500 ha year 1with treatment types allocated as 50 mechanical thinning 30 mowing and grinding and 20 prescribed fire the current management scenario represents a treatment rate of 0 7 of the study area per year 2 5 wildfire wildfire was simulated within envision via a wildfire simulation submodel fig 2 using the minimum travel time mtt fire spread algorithm finney 2002 and associated crown fire models as implemented in flammap finney 2006 and distributed in the usfs fire behavior library brittain 2018 the code library contains all the input and output functionality of the flammap5 program the mtt algorithm models two dimensional fire growth under constant weather by huygens principle where the growth and behavior of the fire edge are modelled as a vector or wave front knight and coleman 1993 the mtt algorithm has been extensively applied in both the research and management environments miller and ager 2013 noonan wright et al 2011 and is embedded in a number of wildfire decision support systems used in the us and elsewhere kalabokidis et al 2016 oliveira et al 2016 salis et al 2016 wells 2009 the wildfire submodel is called each simulation year by envision initiating a sequence of modelling steps fig 2 in sequence the submodel first reads simulation run parameters from an xml file including file paths and related information the submodel then reads and translates the vegclass from the idu polygons to the five fuels variables and three topography variables aspect slope elevation and writes a binary raster 90 x 90 m input file for flammap fuel variables are the fuel model scott and burgan 2005 that describes surface fuels and four variables measuring canopy fuels canopy bulk density canopy cover canopy base height and total stand height canopy fuels were determined by simulating representative stands for each vegclass through the forest vegetation simulator fire and fuels extension fvs ffe dixon 2002 and recording the mean value surface fuel models for the portion of the study area in the dnf were assigned to each idu based on the majority representation in the forest s fuel model layer outside the forest we used the landfire 2008 rapid refresh fbfm40 layer landfire 2013 both the landfire and dnf fuel layers have been extensively used for fire simulation as part of forest project planning surface and canopy fuels were modelled dynamically according to the state transitions associated with each vegclass in addition to the baseline fuel models each vegclass had one or more fuel model variants to accommodate changes in fuels that were not accompanied by changes in the vegclass appendix a table a3 in supplementary material the baseline fuel model was assigned to variant 1 and additional variants were invoked when an idu was disturbed by fire or management but the corresponding vegclass did not change the type of disturbance dictated which variant was selected appendix a table a3 in supplementary material by envision the variant remained in place until the time in variant tiv limit was reached or the vegclass transitioned to a new class as a result of a deterministic or probabilistic transition 2 5 1 spatiotemporal fire prediction model we used empirically derived relationships between energy release component erc and historical fire attributes to predict daily fire occurrence and fire size finney et al 2011 preisler and ager 2013 preisler et al 2004 the statistical model was developed using historical ignition data 1992 2009 for the entire fpf study area from the spatial wildfire database of the us short 2014 there were 11 618 ignitions in the study area between 1992 and 2009 6379 were natural and 5239 were human caused daily erc data were downloaded from the raws usa climate archive for 25 remote stations appendix a table a2 and fig a3 in supplementary material in the study area from 1961 to 2011 depending on the station western regional climate center 2014 variability among the stations was relatively low and hence erc values were averaged by day of ignition we developed independent statistical models for fire occurrence versus fire size as described individually below the predictions used as input to envision are obtained by performing random draws from the corresponding estimated distributions 2 5 2 predicting fire occurrence plots of the historical fire occurrence data in the study area for the period 1992 2009 indicated differences in both spatial and temporal patterns of ignitions and substantial differences between ignition types see figs 3 and 4 in ager et al 2017b and fig 3 consequently we estimated separate probability models for lightning and human caused fires with spatial location day of year and erc as explanatory variables in other words the probability models are spatially km2 and temporally day of year explicit we followed previous statistical modelling of wildfires and fire danger rating systems used in the us bradshaw et al 1983 that used erc as a predictor finney et al 2011 the spatially explicit statistical models follow those in preisler et al 2004 and preisler et al 2009 the specifics of the model were 1 logit p1 α1o log 1 π g11 erc g12 long lat g13 day of year τ 2 logit p2 α2o log 1 π g21 erc g22 long lat g23 day of year where p 1 and p 2 are the probability of lightning and human caused ignitions respectively the functions g are non parametric smooth spline functions wood 2006 included in the model to account for the effect of erc and the potentially non linear seasonal and spatial patterns seen in the ignition data see also preisler et al 2009 because we observed outliers large number of ignitions in some years due to large lighting events and because none of the explanatory variables used in the model account for these lighting episodes we included a random year effect τ in the model to simulate episodic lightning ignitions brillinger et al 2006 the term log 1 π is an offset added to the intercept α with π equal to the sampling proportion of the km km day voxels with no ignition brillinger 2003 sampling of the voxels with no ignition was done to create a manageable data size the total number of voxels in the study area over the 18 year study period was over 800 million to find voxels that lacked ignitions we used a 500 m grid of the study area and randomly selected three sets of grid points for each day of the historical ignition data record 6534 days and the mean erc value for that day from the 25 stations was assigned to these non ignitions these were added to the ignition data to create a dataset that included both ignitions and non ignitions location lat long was included in the model to account for spatial drivers of ignition patterns although these specific factors were not investigated while climate change may lead to changes in spatial lightning patterns and population growth may lead to increases in ignition numbers these considerations were beyond the scope of the current study we used the mixed gam computation vehicle mgcv package wood 2006 in the open source r statistical package r core team 2014 to estimate the models in eqs 1 and 2 the estimated probabilities of ignition were then used to simulate spatially and seasonally explicit ignitions for both lightning and human caused fires the estimated random year effects in the model for lightning ignitions were not gaussian consequently in our simulations we generated a random year effect by sampling from the estimated empirical distribution of τ next we estimated a model for the probability of an ignition resulting in a fire 10 ha the model used erc and spatial location as explanatory variables we found no significant seasonal effect on the probability of an ignition becoming a large fire consequently the final models did not include a day of year term the specific models used were 3 logit p1 β1o β11 erc h12 long lat 4 logit p2 β2o β21 erc h22 long lat where p 1 and p 2 are the probability of a lightning and human caused ignition burning an area larger than 10 ha respectively the functions h are non parametric smooth spline functions included in the model to account for the effect of spatial location on the probability of ignitions becoming large fires for each day and location with a simulated ignition the estimated values of p 1 and p 2 were used to simulate a large fire occurrence fires 10 ha in our historical sample included 313 fires out of 11 000 2 5 3 predicting fire size the distribution of fire sizes given an occurrence of a fire greater than 10 ha was estimated using the log generalized pareto distribution with erc as an explanatory variable ager et al 2014c specifically we used 5 f u x 1 σ x 1 α x u 10 σ x 1 1 α x where u log fire size for fires greater than 10 ha x erc and α and σ are the shape and scale parameters respectively we used a spline function for the relationship between the shape parameter and erc and a linear function for the relationship between the scale parameter and erc for location and day with a simulated fire greater than 10 ha we used the estimated shape and scale parameters to simulate a fire size from the pareto distribution in eq 5 2 5 4 generating future erc the daily erc values which drive the estimation process were derived from historical data from the raws climate archive referenced above and listed in appendix a table a2 in supplementary material we used historical daily erc values averaged over the study area to characterize the distribution of erc streams specifically we estimated the parameters for an autoregressive model of order one with day of year as an explanatory to account for the seasonal pattern noted in section 2 5 2 the equation for the model was 6 yti μι yt 1 i s day of year ε t 2 365 i 1 t where s is a smooth spline function and ε random noise the subscript i refers to the i th simulated year out of t years finally the intercept μι is a random intercept to account for between year variability seen in the historical erc data this model was used to generate streams of 365 daily erc values for each simulated year as specified by the user replicate firelists are created by repeating the process creating a unique sequence of erc values based on historical patterns 2 5 5 fuel moistures fuel moisture files are used by the flammap dll to set moistures for each fuel size class 1 hr 10 hr 100 hr 1000 hr and fuel model scott and burgan 2005 as well as live herbaceous and woody components we used the historical 1987 2011 mean fuel moisture values for each fuel size class for each value of erc used in the simulations 2 5 6 winds winds were modelled independently from fire probabilities we used historical records 1994 2011 to randomly sample gust wind direction based on day of year to simulate ignitions under conditions when fires actively spread we based wind speed values on gust data derived from lava butte raws weather data but restricted to days in the historical record where fires occurred that exceeded 500 ha a gust speed probability distribution was generated from these records and used to sample gust speed for each ignition 2 5 7 burn periods the mtt fire spread algorithm uses inputs on time rather than size of fire finney 2002 thus to obtain the fire size predicted by the fire prediction system it was necessary to translate fire size ha to burn period minutes and subsequent adjustments if the desired fire size was not achieved in other words it was necessary to guarantee that the simulated fire perimeters were materialized in any specific landscape and burning conditions with fire size and spatial distributions that reflect the predicted firelist we created a fire size burn period distribution with an mtt version encapsulated in fconstmtt a command line version of flammap finney 2002 by simulating multiple sets of 100 random ignition points with burn periods ranging from 30 min to 8000 min wind speed azimuth and erc were fixed at 18 mph 220 degrees and 60 respectively the simulated fire sizes and corresponding burn periods where used to estimate a second order polynomial linear regression model using fire size as predictor and burn period as dependent variable appendix a fig a4 in supplementary material the model was applied to obtain an initial burn period for each predicted fire size on the firelist table 2 2 5 8 creating firelists we developed the fire prediction system in r r core team 2014 that reads synthetic future erc streams section 2 5 4 and predicts daily fire occurrence section 2 5 2 location and size section 2 5 3 the prediction system writes a text file with lists of ignitions firelist and associated predicted fire weather parameters wind speed and azimuth section 2 5 6 burn probability section 2 5 2 burn period section 2 5 7 fire cause lightning or human and fuel moisture conditions section 2 5 5 for each day a fire occurs in each simulation year table 2 the firelists are generated for a user specified simulation period and number of replicates the fire prediction system was executed before an envision simulation the fire prediction system was designed to run in parallel on 8 processors and was batch run on a six core 3 50 ghz intel xenon cpu with 128 gb of ram for 30 replicates of 50 years each section 2 7 for a given batch run to generate five firelists predicting 50 years each took under 25 min we assessed the statistical model by comparing the distribution of random draws from the estimated probability models with the empirical distributions of the observed data both data sets plotted against erc 2 5 9 burn period adjustments to determine whether the predicted fire size would materialize under variable sets of ignition location fuel and weather conditions we ran a set of firelists with envision to control for the potential effect of vegetation succession wildfire and management in simulated fire size we forced all ignitions to occur in the same year simulation year 1 we observed two issues with fires simulated with envision the first being that when ignitions landed in non burnable or fuel limited areas the predicted fire size was not reached to correct this first problem we determined that if the simulated fire size in envision was smaller than the predicted fire size by a factor of 0 2 the ignition location x y was randomly sampled within a radius of 5 km up to a maximum of five times the x and y coordinates of the simulated fire size that came closest to the predicted fire size replaced the original fire location a second problem was observed whereby fire sizes were overestimated in envision usually as a consequence of ignitions landing on fast burning fuels coupled with sampled weather conditions well above the average conditions in these cases if the fire size was more than 1 5 times the predicted fire size the original burn period bp was reduced proportionally to the difference between the predicted and simulated fire sizes as follows 7 n e w b p o r i g i n a l b p 0 5 s i m u l a t e d p r e d i c t e d the resulting predicted versus simulated fire size was then plotted and examined for outliers 2 6 fire effects fire effects were implemented on each burned idu using flame length generated by the wildfire submodel a fire effects lookup table was used to translate flame lengths into severity classes that include low intensity fires mortality 20 mixed severity fires 20 mortality 80 and stand replacing fire mortality 80 flame length thresholds used to classify fire severity were obtained using fvs ffe simulations on representative tree lists for each vegclass in this process the fire and fuels extension to fvs reinhardt and crookston 2003 was used to simulate fires of varying flame lengths for each representative tree list and the flame length thresholds that generated the abovementioned stand mortality thresholds were determined similar to the approach used previously to build loss functions for mortality to old growth ager et al 2010 within envision these flame length thresholds are cross referenced with flame lengths from fire perimeters generated by the wildfire submodel to determine wildfire effects on each idu low severity fires do not trigger changes in vegclass but reduce surface fuel accumulation fuel model stand replacing fires will kill the majority of trees and return the idu to a post disturbance state depending on the idu pre fire conditions mixed severity fires can alter surface fuel i e fuel model or can trigger a state transition if changes occur to canopy cover and or number of canopy layers comparisons of initial fire severity outputs barros et al 2017 spies et al 2017 with fire severity data from the mtbs project suggested that envision overestimated the proportion of stand replacing fire in forested areas thus we increased the upper flame length thresholds of mixed severity fire above which fire severity was classified as stand replacing this adjustment corrected the proportion of stand replacing fire simulated by envision to levels comparable with historical fire severity according to mtbs severity maps eidenshink et al 2007 severity classes were also used to compute other fire related metrics e g smoke production timber volume losses 2 7 envision execution envision runs on an annual time step in the following simplified sequence vegetation succession wildfire submodel forest management submodel and evaluative models see spies et al 2017 for a detailed description of evaluative models in envision after each module runs the relevant idu information is updated and carried over to the next module and or time step this precludes for example thinning from below to happen in a stand that experienced stand replacing fire even though salvage logging can occur the wildfire submodel reads the firelist generated from the fire prediction system section 2 5 8 along with fire weather conditions for each fire each fire is simulated sequentially but fires are not allowed to overlap within the year fire perimeters are written as a shapefile and a grid of flame lengths is recorded both annually and daily the flame length grid for each perimeter is overlaid with the idu polygons and the mean flame length is calculated and used to affect state changes in vegetation as described in the fire effects section 2 6 the wildfire submodel also generates a grid of flame lengths similar to that generated by a static flammap simulation ager et al 2011 using predefined fuel moisture and fire weather conditions 2 8 simulation experiments we performed 30 replicates where each replicate simulation used a different firelist section 2 5 8 covering 50 years of ignitions generated by the fire prediction system we used the simulation output to describe the performance of the fire prediction system and the simulated fires within envision this included examination of 1 statistically generated erc versus historical and 2 fire size distributions of historical predicted and simulated datasets evidence for fire feedbacks was obtained by analyzing intersections among simulated fire perimeters within the previous ten years we chose a ten year timespan based on previous analyses that showed fires did not affect current fire growth if they were older than 10 years ager et al 2017a for the remaining questions we analyzed simulation outputs for area burned and severity by year for the 30 replicates for a given scenario a 50 yr envision run takes 3 h to run on a six core 3 50 ghz intel xenon cpu with 128gb of ram envision is available for download at http envision bioe orst edu and submodels described here are available by request to the author 3 results 3 1 historical ignition patterns we previously described aspects of the historical fire regime in the study area ager et al 2017b and include additional description here to provide the context for simulation experiments below several aspects of the fire regime including the spatial patterns of ignitions provided important details that affected our design and calibration of the envision fire simulation submodel the mean annual historical area burned 1992 2009 for the fpf study area was 14 997 ha or 0 48 per year with 645 ignitions per year and a mean fire size of 22 ha median 12 ha historical mean fire size from human ignitions was 26 ha median 6 ha compared to 22 ha for fires caused by natural ignitions median 6 ha excluding fires that were less than 10 ha mean fire size for human versus natural ignitions was 620 versus 1741 ha median 268 vs 371 respectively temporal ignition patterns were distinctly different for human versus lightning ignitions within the study area fig 3 with the latter showing strong peaks during the summer compared to the former human ignitions occurred throughout the period of natural ignitions but were more frequent in the spring and fall effectively extending the fire season by about three months and generating fires under low erc relative to lightning ignitions the episodic pattern of lightning ignitions results from regional convective activity associated with cold fronts that intersect high pressure systems that develop over the pacific northwest during midsummer spatial patterns of ignitions were also distinctly different between human and lightning categories fig 4 human ignitions were strongly clustered around developed areas and to a lesser extent in popular recreation sites e g deschutes river fig 4b two of the largest developed areas warm springs and bend fig 4d had the highest density of human ignitions lightning ignitions had the highest densities in the south central and southeast portion of the study area 3 2 fire forecasting model validation both daily ignition frequency and the resulting fire size were positively and non linearly related to erc erc streams generated by the model eq 6 captured daily and yearly variability and seasonal trends fig 6 with forecasted values generally remaining within the maximum and minimum observed data fire size distributions generated by the statistical model eq 5 showed a similar pattern and distribution as the historical data fig 5a b additionally we compared the forecasted wildfire size generated from the statistical prediction model with the outputs from the envision run to validate the fire prediction system see 2 5 9 for details we used the contemporary management scenario cman for this comparison and the results showed that fire sizes generated from random draws from the empirical distributions were closely related to fire sizes simulated within envision runs fig 7 observed outliers were caused by a number of factors including ignitions that occurred with a combination of fire spread conditions that include fuel models with slower spread rate low windspeed and low erc 3 3 simulation experiment the 50 yr envision simulation experiment using contemporary forest management cman revealed substantial among replicate n 30 and inter annual 50 years variability similarly to the historical fire data fig 8 the mean proportion of area burned per year was similar between historical and simulated fires and equaled 0 86 and 0 84 of the study area respectively the pooled among year coefficient of variation cv across all replicates for area burned per year was 153 indicating that the magnitude of variation among years was about three times larger than the mean annual area burned fire rotation interval number of years required to burn the entire study area varied among the 30 replicates from 78 to 170 years the comparison between fire size distributions for predicted statistical model and simulated for 3 out of 30 envision replicates fig 9 showed good correspondence when compared to the fire size obtained with envision the 1st and 3rd quartiles and mean and median fire size matched well over the datasets mean fire size across all replicates from human ignitions was 601 ha median 27 ha compared to 1047 ha for fires caused by natural ignitions median 34 ha simulated replicates showed on average higher median values fig 9 and larger extreme values than the predicted dataset this was mostly due to overestimation in simulated datasets of the number of fires between fire size classes of 1 103 ha and 1 106 ha we also examined the occurrence of extreme fire years with burn areas above the 10 yr moving average on average in each 50 yr simulation there were 17 min max 12 21 years and 15 min max 11 19 years very large extreme years fig 10 to examine the effect of ignition type on area burned over time we analyzed area burned by cause for the cman scenario fig 11 although the mean annual area burned over the simulation did not vary substantially between the two ignition types temporal trends showed decadal periods where human ignitions burned up to about 0 3 more 37 500 ha on an annual basis compared to natural ignitions for instance in simulation year 20 natural ignitions resulted in about 0 8 100 000 ha of the study area burning compared to about 0 3 human caused fires spatial differences in burned area between the ignition types were apparent from the simulation outputs with the effects of human ignitions especially pronounced along the northeast end of the study area where there were ignition hotspots around developed areas and recreation sites fig 12 in general there was an east west and north south gradient of area burned from natural ignitions that resulted from the combined effects of ignition probability and spread rates of vegetation and fuels in the different locations fig 12 most area burned in the simulations resulted from mixed severity fire followed by high severity fig 13 which is in agreement with recent empirical fire severity reported for the study area by reilly et al 2017 the different classes of fire severity surface mixed severity stand replacing did not have substantial trends over time for the cman scenario fig 13b or the noman scenario fig 13a although more area burned overall under noman there was a slight downward trend in the area burned by mixed severity and corresponding upward trend in surface fire severity especially in the last decade of the simulation although inter annual variability masked the trends changes in vegetation and fuels from succession and management activities were not sufficient to dramatically change trends in area burned within the study area fig 13 the potential fire behavior as measured by flame length and spread rate exhibited upward trends for the landscape noman as a whole as determined from flammap simulations appendix a figs a5 a6 in supplemental material under the modelled contemporary rates of burning the potential for fire feedbacks to self regulate wildfire spread within our simulations was not large based on the frequency with which fires intersected previous fire footprints fig 14 for instance the rate of intersection among fires that burned within a ten year time window average lifespan of fuel treatment prichard et al 2017 was estimated at between 2 4 at any given year per year and did not change between the noman and cman scenarios fig 14 given that there are about 14 fires per year on average an intersection of two fires would be expected about every other year the relationship between fire size and intersection frequency showed that both small and large fires had a high propensity to intersect the latter because they spread farther over the landscape and former because their ignitions are spatially clustered in ignition hotpots fig 15 but lack the fuels to spread thus the hotspots for human ignitions increased the potential for landscape feedbacks compared to natural ignitions which are more dispersed 4 discussion our simulation experiments complement related research ager et al 2017a barros et al 2017 2018 charnley et al 2017 spies et al 2017 as part of the forest people fire fpf project spies et al 2014 although a number of modifications and improvements to the envision model were made since these earlier analyses the results of the current study suggested that future burned area is not limited by available fuels even with fuel reduction as part of forest restoration management programs noss et al 2006 stephens et al 2016 usda forest service 2015 and that current climate regimes are not sufficient to generate megafire tipping points adams 2013 that dramatically alter the forest landscape this result is similar to other modelling studies in the western us loudermilk et al 2014 scheller and mladenoff 2007 stevens et al 2016 syphard et al 2011 where a wide range of simulated management scenarios did not dramatically alter rates of burning however restoration management combined with contemporary levels of wildfire did result in ecologically important reductions in fire intensity and severity a finding also consistent with empirical and simulation studies on the effect of fuels modification on fire behavior kalies and yocom kent 2016 the predicted reduction in severity and intensity but not spread rate burned area can be traced to the differences in the recovery rate of the respective fire regime components specifically recovery rates for fire spread are relatively short 5 20 years compared to fire frequency 30 100 years prichard et al 2017 thus allowing the effects of management to dissipate on the landscape before the next fire typically arrives nevertheless the ecological changes we observed in the simulation lend support to restoration policies that call for thinning and burning to improve fire resiliency on federal forests in the western us stephens et al 2016 and indicate the rate of treatment needs to be sufficiently high to maintain reduced fuel levels on a large enough part of the landscape or in key places our analysis of variability among years and replicates for future wildfire scenarios depicted a high uncertainty of large wildfire events fire rotation interval among plausible future scenarios varied among replicate simulations from 78 to 170 years meaning that there was a twofold difference in the average rate of burning area per year highlighting the uncertainty of fire as a driver of future landscape change even without considering potential amplification of fire regimes from climate change extreme fire years hulse et al 2016 were considered as those that exceeded a 10 yr moving average and were observed in 15 out of 50 years in the simulation previous flsm studies rarely report fire event level details regarding variation in size frequency and severity or describe unusual extreme fire events that are important from a policy perspective since these fires can change attitudes towards fire and public policy our most extreme fire event burned 11 4 of our study area a few studies do report variation in fire size syphard et al 2011 reported mean fire size by elevation class for a 50 yr simulation in the sierra mountains the maximum simulated fire being 36 237 ha 1 7 of the study area loudermilk et al 2014 report a maximum mean fire size of 652 ha among five replicates over a 100 year simulation for a 85 000 ha fire prone study area 0 8 in california high variability in fire size e g years with little fire slows the development of robust risk governance systems that can adapt to changing fire regimes with legislation and local policies that govern development in fire prone areas steelman 2016 one reason we get extremely large fires in envision compared to some other models is that fire sizes are drawn from statistical distributions rather than monte carlo simulation of historical events or pre determined fire regimes syphard et al 2011 our model captures potentially rare but plausible fire events as predicted in time series analyses of erc streams and captures inter annual variability in weather abatzoglou and williams 2016 this bottom up fire model improves the ability to model major events that drive landscape change and helps incorporate the stochastic and unpredictable nature of landscapes and populations scheller et al 2011 in our study we found that the potential for fire feedbacks as estimated from encounter rates between fire events was dependent on both fire size and ignition type both small and large fires had high encounter rates a finding that suggests other factors besides area burned price et al 2015 influence fire on fire events modelling how fire feedbacks interact with fuel management at the patch or event scale is key to understanding how fire can be leveraged to meet ecological restoration objectives in us federal land management agencies barros et al 2018 north et al 2015 self regulating wildfire results from interactions between ignition events and fuel beds that modulate burned area and severity ignitions within prior fire footprints can fail to spread or spread at a lower rate and intensity krawchuk et al 2006 prichard et al 2010 safford et al 2009 or ignited fires can burn into previously burned areas and go out understanding these mechanisms and the dynamics of fire on fire and fire on treatment interactions is key to addressing the current fire deficit with policies that allow more natural ignitions to burn on low risk landscapes north et al 2012 prior studies on the self regulating properties of wildfire are almost exclusively based on empirical data and are limited to either single events or relatively small samples of historical fires barnett et al 2016 collins et al 2009 coop et al 2014 holsinger et al 2016 parks et al 2015 2016 price et al 2015 in contrast to empirical studies with available data forest simulation models can provide detailed outputs that can be mined to study these interactions on large populations of fire on fire interactions over many fire rotations and replicate simulations as in our previous work ager et al 2014c preisler and ager 2013 we used empirically derived relationships between energy release component erc and historical fire attributes to predict daily fire occurrence location and fire size however we improved the spatiotemporal resolution of the fire prediction model compared to other fire simulation finney et al 2011 and forest landscape simulation studies by using a generalized additive model gam that included non linear effects of location and time of year a wide range of statistical techniques have been used to estimate fire ignition probability from empirical data including random forest analysis oliveira et al 2012 kernel density interpolations de la riva et al 2004 koutsias et al 2004 maximum entropy maxent estimation parisien et al 2012 and logistic regression del hoyo et al 2011 lozano et al 2007 martell et al 1987 padilla and vega garcía 2011 gam applies nonparametric splines to fit a wide range of functional forms compared to parametric functions allowing us to model non linear relationships between the log odds of fire occurrence and explanatory variables within a logistic model brillinger et al 2006 preisler et al 2004 the method is particularly useful for accounting for non linear interactions between ignition location and day of year observed in complex spatiotemporal patterns of lightning and human ignitions we note that our use of erc as a driver assumed a stationary fire climate response which is appropriate for most of the northwestern us where the biomass of fuels is generally not limiting mckenzie and littell 2017 but fuel moisture limits fire activity littell et al 2009 we acknowledge that in other regions where fuels are driven by short term climate drivers our modelling approach is not appropriate mckenzie and littell 2017 we also note that our predicted fire activity does not account for potential future increases in erc from climate change abatzoglou and williams 2016 abatzoglou and brown 2012 littell et al 2009 which is the subject of our future work concurrent application of the envision model as part of the broader fpf study spies et al 2014 revealed a number of additional findings barros et al 2017 examined a range of alternative fuel management scenarios and found that relative to a no management scenario area burned and the likelihood of very large fires was reduced under all management scenarios though differences on average were rather small the authors also found that despite the reduction in area burned when the forest was managed there was no decreasing trend in area burned through a 50 yr period spies et al 2017 analyzed the impact of different restoration scenarios on fire behavior wood production carbon and measures of biodiversity and resilient vegetation and found that fuel treatments could have significant effects on landscape conditions over time ager et al 2017a estimated reduction in area burned from fire feedbacks for a range of fire rotation intervals both short term negative and long term positive feedbacks were observed our studies as part of the fpf project add to prior flsm studies which have focused on tradeoffs among multiple competing ecological and management objectives under dynamic disturbances e g scheller et al 2011 barros et al 2018 found that the addition of one simulated wildfire per year under favorable weather conditions in low risk areas and over the course of 50 years increased forest resilience in fire adapted forest types but there were tradeoffs including potential reduction in wildlife habitat and increases in smoke and area burned in fire sensitive forest types other studies have examined tradeoffs between treatment rate and intensity and long term versus short term risks ager et al 2017a halofsky et al 2014b scheller et al 2007 spies et al 2017 syphard et al 2011 for instance syphard et al 2011 found that area treated had a larger effect than intensity of treatment and treatments were most effective where wildfire likelihood was the highest thus treatment location was more important than treatment type risk tradeoffs or competing risks from fuel management programs i e the relative effects of short term negative impacts to ecological values critical habitat carbon versus long term benefits from reduced future wildfire impacts have been examined in a number of studies that incorporated wildfire into simulations loudermilk et al 2014 scheller et al 2011 syphard et al 2011 and others factoring it as an exogenous process collins et al 2011 roloff et al 2005 spies et al 2017 found in the central oregon cascades that management reduced spotted owl habitat despite also reducing wildfire severity this occurred in part because treatments kept younger non habitat forests from becoming owl habitat and replacing owl habitats lost to wildfire by contrast syphard et al 2011 found more biomass and large trees survived wildfire post fuels treatment in the southern sierra nevada mountains small biomass was removed that protected large trees where biomass was accumulated and treatments conferred ecological benefit by preserving large trees scheller et al 2011 also studied risk tradeoffs in fisher martes pennanti habitat in the sierra nevada mountains and found that direct negative effects on habitat were less than indirect positive effects over the long run in general these and other studies have found that management activities that cause short term loss of habitat or other ecosystem services have longer term positive impacts from reduced fire extent and or severity and thus suggest long term benefits outweigh short term adverse impacts of management another contribution to the flsm literature is our partitioning of human and natural ignitions as separate disturbance processes many models do not consider potential agent influences as sources of ignitions which is necessary to model ecological change driven by natural influences versus human caused ignitions balch et al 2017 parisien et al 2016 syphard and keeley 2015 fires from human ignitions are not permitted to be managed for ecological benefit and thus policy simulations to explore fire feedbacks that let fires burn due to changes in suppression policies need to consider the ignition source barros et al 2018 expansion of the wui is predicted to double by year 2030 theobald and romme 2007 thus both human activity in the wildlands that cause ignitions and susceptible structures will both increase our results indicate that both the timing and location of the two ignition types differ substantially in the study area both contributing nearly equally to area burned but with different spatial patterns and feedbacks studies of human versus natural ignitions have illustrated regional and continental wide patterns and the role of human ignitions lengthening the fire season balch et al 2017 campos ruiz et al 2018 parisien et al 2016 and the differential impacts to structures collins et al 2016 but not their effect on fire regimes over time in our study area the slightly smaller fires from human ignitions could be related to both the timing and location of the two sources of ignitions relative to roads and suppression resources human ignitions were relatively more frequent in the spring and fall and thus extended the fire season compared to natural ignitions alone balch et al 2017 over the long run ecological effects of the two ignition sources could change successional trajectories if they ignite in different seasons and the fires have different effects on vegetation studies that have investigated climate wildfire drivers have not distinguished between human and lightning and the relationships are likely different in ignition limited systems mckenzie and littell 2017 the integration of ignition specific wildfire occurrence models adds functionality that is needed to model agent behavior as both progenitors of fire and actors that respond to it for instance policy adoption for regulations on forest activities hunting recreation and wildfire risk education butry et al 2010 prestemon and butry 2010 prestemon et al 2010 would be connected to locations and seasons with ignition hotspots by contrast policy adoption for fuel management with protection objectives would focus on areas with high lightning ignition escape potential and risk policies that seek to expand area burned by natural ignitions to restore fire regimes would emphasize areas of frequent ignitions and low risk fires agent based simulations can then be used to identify synergies between fuel management policies ignition prevention programs and fires managed for restoration to broadly address human versus natural fires in a coupled human and natural systems framework our study contributes to scientific progress in ecological modelling in several areas including fire feedbacks prichard et al 2017 the role of human versus natural ignitions as drivers of landscape change balch et al 2017 hulse et al 2016 parisien et al 2016 and fine scale statistical modelling of fire ignitions preisler et al 2004 moreover we coupled two foundational simulation frameworks the fire behavior models built on the usfs fire behavior libraries brittain 2018 and envision bolte 2018 the fire behavior code library encapsulates core fire modelling components used in continental scale wildfire research for strategic and tactical planning by researchers and practitioners in the us and elsewhere ager et al 2014b alcasena et al 2017 andrews 2007 brittain 2018 finney et al 2011 gill et al 1987 kalabokidis et al 2015 noonan wright et al 2011 oliveira et al 2016 rollins 2009 salis et al 2014 the integration into a flsm can simulate management disturbance succession and ecological impacts with agents that are aware of landscape conditions and respond to them within particular policy or goal domains policies include dynamic and spatially explicit restoration activities thinning mastication underburning applied at densities according to specific landscape priorities over time other flsm platforms have to varying degrees represented both human management policies and biophysical processes conlisk et al 2015 finney et al 2007 loudermilk et al 2014 millington et al 2009 scheller et al 2011 however management policies are typically hardwired over time to different degrees in these models while ignoring agent landscape and landscape fire feedbacks a gap that is most significant on mixed owner landscapes where risk governance is fragmented and biophysical and social risk systems interact to drive public wildfire policy implementation charnley et al 2017 steelman 2016 in our study the location and rate of treatments were dynamically allocated in response to landscape conditions at annual time steps treatments were not however receptive to agent feedbacks since we assumed static agent behavior in this particular study see spies et al 2017 many challenges remain particularly in the representation of agent behavior and translating social science in the models e g a better understanding of how fire outcomes affect attitudes and forest management policy at landscape and ownership scales charnley et al 2017 kline et al 2017 it is possible that many existing models operate at spatiotemporal scales that mask the patch dynamics of forest succession disturbance and management that ultimately drive landscape change keane et al 2015 for example seed dispersal and establishment in post fire environments challenges also exist to develop diverse research teams required to integrate social and biophysical science into agent based flsms kline et al 2017 shindler et al 2017 our future work is leveraging envision to understand the interacting effects of climate change fuel treatment and increased wildfire on future habitat for protected wildlife species these experiments will also allow the comparative assessment of leverage price et al 2015 from synergies between wildfire versus fuel management to reduce ecological impacts of large severe fire thus addressing current fire policy debates in the western us over the management of wildfires to reduce the fire deficit and improve ecological use of wildfires as fuel treatments north et al 2015 statistical downscaling of climate change scenarios and erc streams abatzoglou and brown 2012 makes it possible to simulate the effects of climate change on fire activity within envision since large fire activity is driven by sequences of high erc rather than average conditions finney et al 2009 we expect a more robust estimation of future wildfires compared to modelling efforts that use average fire regimes predicted by global circulation model data our modelling platform sets the stage for simulating future climate impacts on fire abatzoglou and kolden 2013 and how agent behavior can improve adaptation to future fire

25236,we developed and applied a wildfire simulation package in the envision agent based landscape modelling system the wildfire package combines statistical modelling of fire occurrence with a high resolution mechanistic wildfire spread model that can capture fine scale effects of fire feedbacks and fuel management and replicate restoration strategies at scales that are meaningful to forest managers we applied the model to a landscape covering 1 2 million ha of fire prone area in central oregon usa where wildland fires are increasingly impacting conservation amenity values and developed areas we conducted simulations to examine the effect of human versus natural ignitions on future fire regimes under current restoration programs and whether contemporary fire regimes observed in the past 20 years are likely to change as result of fire feedbacks and management activities the ignition prediction model revealed non linear effects of location and time of year and distinct spatiotemporal patterns for human versus natural ignitions fire rotation interval among replicate simulations varied from 78 to 170 years and changed little over the 50 yr simulation suggesting a stable but highly variable and uncertain future fire regime interestingly the potential for fire on fire feedbacks was higher for human versus natural ignitions due to human ignition hotspots within the study area we compare the methods and findings with other forest landscape simulation model flsm studies and discuss future application of flsms to address emerging wildfire management and policy issues on fire frequent forests in the western us keywords agent based modelling envision landscape modelling forest management modelling wildfire modelling generalized additive models 1 introduction in the western us large scale forest management efforts are being implemented on public lands to restore forest resiliency to wildfire in fire dependent forests and reduce fire risk to socioecological values the work is aimed at counteracting the effects of a century of fire suppression originally intended to reduce wildfire risk calkin et al 2014 north et al 2015 the unforeseen and unintended consequences of these past fire suppression policies have been amplified by climate change westerling 2016 urban expansion theobald and romme 2007 and poor perception of risk from highly uncertain wildfire events leading to a system that has been termed a socioecological pathology fischer et al 2016 one tool that can help understand the long term effectiveness of these policies are forest landscape simulation models flsms that simulate forest management under a background of stochastic wildfire over time these models can help test a wide range of policy questions about how landscapes respond to forest management activities under a stochastic background of large fire events that often mask long term landscape change for instance does variability in bioregional and landscape scale climatic drivers of wildfire overwhelm the potential effects of fire on fire feedbacks under elevated burning rates predicted by climate change models mckenzie and littell 2017 there are few flsms that can simulate detailed forest fuels and restoration management programs under a background of stochastic large e g 104 ha fire loudermilk et al 2014 scheller and mladenoff 2004 2007 syphard et al 2011 and even fewer available to researchers with the ability to incorporate human decision making related to forests and fire for example modelling landscape trajectories in response to widespread federal forest restoration policies in the western us stephens et al 2016 requires the simulation of spatially explicit stand scale simulation of fuel treatments that include multi year sequences of mechanical thinning surface fuels mastication piling and prescribed fire silvicultural prescriptions aimed at reducing fire severity must be modelled to consider the structure species biophysical setting and fire ecology of individual stands cochran et al 1994 haugo et al 2015 o hara et al 2010 stand treatments within restoration planning areas must then be coordinated in terms of treatment density dimensions and spatial arrangement finney 2001 fig 5 to achieve specific ecological and fire management objectives collins et al 2010 finney 2001 stevens et al 2016 equally important is the accurate representation of post treatment fuels since the landscape effect of fuel treatments on large fire spread is strongly influenced by the ratio of pre to post treatment spread rates see finney 2001 fig 9 forest dynamics in treated and burned areas are modelled to replicate recovery of fuels after treatment under specific ecological conditions prichard et al 2010 safford et al 2012 usda forest service 2014 to capture the temporal dynamics of fire on treatment interactions barnett et al 2016 and fire on fire feedbacks prichard et al 2017 the complexity of flsms is amplified on typical western us landscapes that are mosaics of different forest types and public private and private industrial ownerships each having respective operational and economic constraints and motivations to manage forests and fuels towards particular ecological and socioeconomic goals charnley et al 2015 analyzing how landowner behavior affects landscape change requires incorporating agent behavior and preferences for the adoption of specific policies kline et al 2017 spies et al 2014 agent based landscape simulation models are relatively new for scenario planning on landscapes that are subjected to frequent ecological disturbances e g floods wildfire windstorms insect outbreaks loehman et al 2017 scheller et al 2017 and where multiple agents e g land managers representing different ownerships homeowners and stakeholders who may not own land but influence decision making by landowners exist in such cases agent based models abms can provide a way to understand agent behavior policy feedbacks and unexpected impacts over long time periods bone et al 2014 hulse et al 2016 spies et al 2014 compared to modelling forest management activities and landowner agent behavior incorporating stochastic disturbance has its own set of challenges and in the case of wildfire includes 1 plausible future spatiotemporal patterns of human agent versus natural ignitions parisien et al 2016 2 modelling fire spread though heterogeneous fuel beds finney et al 2011 and 3 representing fire severity and fire effects on forest vegetation reinhardt et al 1997 large fires e g 20 000 to 100 000 ha in the western us are relatively rare events that account for most of the area burned and have limited historical precedence within a typical study area e g 10 000 100 000 ha making model calibration difficult human ignitions which are important drivers of fire in some but not all areas balch et al 2017 parisien et al 2016 are highly non random and correlated with anthropogenic variables in abm frameworks actor groups that drive wildfire ignitions in specific locations and seasons also respond to wildfire impacts over time with policies to manage landscape fuels in this paper we describe the development and application of a wildfire modelling subsystem within the agent based landscape modelling system envision bolte et al 2004 guzy et al 2008 hulse et al 2009 envision is a spatially explicit landscape modelling platform capable of simulating multiple processes of landscape change and has been applied to a range of environmental management problems including watershed management restoration of fire adapted forests and land use change barros et al 2017 bolte 2010 spies et al 2017 we describe the design testing and application of the wildfire submodel on a 1 2 million ha study area specifically we used envision to simulate a 50 yr period with and without contemporary forest management activities and used the outputs to address the following questions 1 are fire distributions and fire severity stationary over time for human versus natural ignitions or are there tipping points 2 is there evidence for potential feedbacks between human and natural ignitions i e is current fire limited by past fire 3 what are the effects of contemporary forest restoration policies on fire distributions generated from the different sources of ignitions 4 what is the variability in annual fire activity relative to the effects of management the methods advance the integration of wildfire simulation with agent based landscape models and the results show how landscape feedbacks and human drivers of wildfire can affect fire regimes and ecological conditions we compare our work with envision to other landscape modeling studies and highlight current trends as well as important differences in the structuring of submodels for wildfire and forest management the work complements related studies as part of the forests people fire project spies et al 2014 on long term impacts of alternative forest restoration activities and fire regimes on ecosystem services ager et al 2017a barros et al 2017 spies et al 2017 2 methods 2 1 study areas we used two nested study areas for the work reported here the first is the 3 32 million ha forests people fire fpf project spies et al 2014 located in central and south central oregon fig 1 this larger area was used to build and calibrate the fire prediction system described below and detailed descriptions of the forest conditions and ownership are reported elsewhere ager et al 2014a we used a smaller 1 25 million ha subarea to simulate scenarios with envision henceforth north study area the land in the north study area is owned and administrated by a number of entities including federal tribal corporate forests family forests and a large number of small private inholdings homeowners the tribal lands confederated tribes of warm springs 21 occupy the northern portion of the study area and federal lands 61 are primarily the deschutes national forest dnf corporate forests 6 and family forests 4 are intermixed with federal land the gilchrist state forest accounts for 2 of the land area and homeowners cover about 7 of the study area management on the dnf is based on a suite of land management designations e g general forest scenic areas recreation wildlife wilderness determined by the land and resource management plan usda forest service 1990 with ca 46 of the area available for forest and fuel management activities dominant forest types range from subalpine forest along the eastern slope of the cascades to the west of the north study area to juniper woodlands and arid shrublands to the east fig 1 in between lies a mosaic of dry and moist mixed conifer forest intermixed with lodgepole pine pinus contorta and ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa dry mixed conifer forests are composed of ponderosa pine lodgepole pine douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii and grand and white fir abies grandis and a concolor moist mixed conifer forests include the same species as in the dry mixed forest with associations of mountain hemlock tsuga mertensiana much of the lower elevation forested area has dense understories as a result of fire suppression although federal managers have thinned and underburned some of these to promote fire resiliency appendix a fig a1 in supplemental material and partial harvest during the 20th century removed many of large fire resistant ponderosa pine and douglas fir merschel et al 2014 the mean number of ignitions per year was 372 1992 2013 and the mean area burned was 1423 ha the area was affected by large fires 10 000 ha in the last two decades including the b b complex fire in 2003 36 733 ha and sunnyside turnoff in 2013 21 448 ha 2 2 envision overview envision guzy et al 2008 hulse et al 2009 2016 is a landscape modelling platform that consists of a core spatial landscape and policy system with a plug in architecture allowing the incorporation of physical and biological disturbances and human activities on a spatially explicit landscape over time appendix a fig a2 in supplemental material the modelling platform consists of five main components 1 a spatial framework for representing landscape features as polygons points and grids 2 an agent based modelling system to simulate the decision makers and their adoption of different policies 3 a policy scenario building system that specifies policies with landscape activities 4 a plug in architecture to incorporate autonomous process models submodels and 5 evaluation models that track and report landscape production metrics the interface also provides a number of tools for visualizing spatial inputs and outputs envision landscapes were represented by individual decision units idu polygons attributed with a vegetation state fuels and management activities spies et al 2017 envision submodels were created to model landscape change over time as affected by wildfire vegetation succession and forest management activities appendix a fig a2 in supplemental material the latter is implemented via a preference system specific to each policy scenario that allocates management activities on the landscape the envision configuration for the fpf project included five submodels vegetation dynamics forest management wildfire and wildfire effects and population growth spies et al 2017 the latter model is described elsewhere and was not invoked in the present study the remaining models are briefly described below with a focus on the wildfire and wildfire effects submodels additional details are available in appendix a in the supplementary material and in related papers that used the modelling system ager et al 2017c charnley et al 2017 spies et al 2017 2 3 vegetation dynamics vegetation dynamics were simulated with a state and transition simulation model stsm adopted from halofsky et al 2014a the model classified the landscape into a discrete set of vegetation states hereafter vegclass with each vegclass having a probabilistic and deterministic pathway that describes the vegetation trajectory over time in response to succession and disturbance wildfire and or forest management a vegclass is characterized by a dominant and codominant tree species average tree size forest canopy cover percentage and canopy layering category table 1 table a1 appendix a in supplementary material shows the ecological stratification of the landscape and potential vegetation management groups vegclasses are transient and define the state of an idu at a given point in time when one or more characteristics of the vegclass change a state transition is triggered and the idu is attributed a new vegclass which is passed along to the next simulation time step state transitions which can be deterministic or probabilistic were developed using the vegetation dynamics development tool vddt and adopted from halofsky et al 2014a vegclass attributes at the initial condition year one in simulation were based on 2006 satellite imagery and inventory plots using the gradient nearest neighborhood gnn method ohmann et al 2011 and updated to reflect vegetation growth and large historical fires recorded in the monitoring trends in burn severity dataset mtbs mtbs data access 2017 for 2006 to 2012 and forest management see below and see spies et al 2017 for more details 2 4 forest management forest management was modelled by allocating treatments on the landscape based on user defined allocation rules that are specific to treatment actions and the ownerships in the study area however only federal land management was modelled in this study management unit specific wood volume or area treatment targets are used to constrain treatment activity allocation rules include stand characteristics that preclude management hectares treated per year and mean patch size of treated areas management options included various types of commercial and non commercial harvesting prescribed fire and mowing and grinding simulated on federal lands in the current simulations we specifically modelled two scenarios 1 a no management scenario noman and 2 a current management scenario cman that treated a total of 8500 ha year 1with treatment types allocated as 50 mechanical thinning 30 mowing and grinding and 20 prescribed fire the current management scenario represents a treatment rate of 0 7 of the study area per year 2 5 wildfire wildfire was simulated within envision via a wildfire simulation submodel fig 2 using the minimum travel time mtt fire spread algorithm finney 2002 and associated crown fire models as implemented in flammap finney 2006 and distributed in the usfs fire behavior library brittain 2018 the code library contains all the input and output functionality of the flammap5 program the mtt algorithm models two dimensional fire growth under constant weather by huygens principle where the growth and behavior of the fire edge are modelled as a vector or wave front knight and coleman 1993 the mtt algorithm has been extensively applied in both the research and management environments miller and ager 2013 noonan wright et al 2011 and is embedded in a number of wildfire decision support systems used in the us and elsewhere kalabokidis et al 2016 oliveira et al 2016 salis et al 2016 wells 2009 the wildfire submodel is called each simulation year by envision initiating a sequence of modelling steps fig 2 in sequence the submodel first reads simulation run parameters from an xml file including file paths and related information the submodel then reads and translates the vegclass from the idu polygons to the five fuels variables and three topography variables aspect slope elevation and writes a binary raster 90 x 90 m input file for flammap fuel variables are the fuel model scott and burgan 2005 that describes surface fuels and four variables measuring canopy fuels canopy bulk density canopy cover canopy base height and total stand height canopy fuels were determined by simulating representative stands for each vegclass through the forest vegetation simulator fire and fuels extension fvs ffe dixon 2002 and recording the mean value surface fuel models for the portion of the study area in the dnf were assigned to each idu based on the majority representation in the forest s fuel model layer outside the forest we used the landfire 2008 rapid refresh fbfm40 layer landfire 2013 both the landfire and dnf fuel layers have been extensively used for fire simulation as part of forest project planning surface and canopy fuels were modelled dynamically according to the state transitions associated with each vegclass in addition to the baseline fuel models each vegclass had one or more fuel model variants to accommodate changes in fuels that were not accompanied by changes in the vegclass appendix a table a3 in supplementary material the baseline fuel model was assigned to variant 1 and additional variants were invoked when an idu was disturbed by fire or management but the corresponding vegclass did not change the type of disturbance dictated which variant was selected appendix a table a3 in supplementary material by envision the variant remained in place until the time in variant tiv limit was reached or the vegclass transitioned to a new class as a result of a deterministic or probabilistic transition 2 5 1 spatiotemporal fire prediction model we used empirically derived relationships between energy release component erc and historical fire attributes to predict daily fire occurrence and fire size finney et al 2011 preisler and ager 2013 preisler et al 2004 the statistical model was developed using historical ignition data 1992 2009 for the entire fpf study area from the spatial wildfire database of the us short 2014 there were 11 618 ignitions in the study area between 1992 and 2009 6379 were natural and 5239 were human caused daily erc data were downloaded from the raws usa climate archive for 25 remote stations appendix a table a2 and fig a3 in supplementary material in the study area from 1961 to 2011 depending on the station western regional climate center 2014 variability among the stations was relatively low and hence erc values were averaged by day of ignition we developed independent statistical models for fire occurrence versus fire size as described individually below the predictions used as input to envision are obtained by performing random draws from the corresponding estimated distributions 2 5 2 predicting fire occurrence plots of the historical fire occurrence data in the study area for the period 1992 2009 indicated differences in both spatial and temporal patterns of ignitions and substantial differences between ignition types see figs 3 and 4 in ager et al 2017b and fig 3 consequently we estimated separate probability models for lightning and human caused fires with spatial location day of year and erc as explanatory variables in other words the probability models are spatially km2 and temporally day of year explicit we followed previous statistical modelling of wildfires and fire danger rating systems used in the us bradshaw et al 1983 that used erc as a predictor finney et al 2011 the spatially explicit statistical models follow those in preisler et al 2004 and preisler et al 2009 the specifics of the model were 1 logit p1 α1o log 1 π g11 erc g12 long lat g13 day of year τ 2 logit p2 α2o log 1 π g21 erc g22 long lat g23 day of year where p 1 and p 2 are the probability of lightning and human caused ignitions respectively the functions g are non parametric smooth spline functions wood 2006 included in the model to account for the effect of erc and the potentially non linear seasonal and spatial patterns seen in the ignition data see also preisler et al 2009 because we observed outliers large number of ignitions in some years due to large lighting events and because none of the explanatory variables used in the model account for these lighting episodes we included a random year effect τ in the model to simulate episodic lightning ignitions brillinger et al 2006 the term log 1 π is an offset added to the intercept α with π equal to the sampling proportion of the km km day voxels with no ignition brillinger 2003 sampling of the voxels with no ignition was done to create a manageable data size the total number of voxels in the study area over the 18 year study period was over 800 million to find voxels that lacked ignitions we used a 500 m grid of the study area and randomly selected three sets of grid points for each day of the historical ignition data record 6534 days and the mean erc value for that day from the 25 stations was assigned to these non ignitions these were added to the ignition data to create a dataset that included both ignitions and non ignitions location lat long was included in the model to account for spatial drivers of ignition patterns although these specific factors were not investigated while climate change may lead to changes in spatial lightning patterns and population growth may lead to increases in ignition numbers these considerations were beyond the scope of the current study we used the mixed gam computation vehicle mgcv package wood 2006 in the open source r statistical package r core team 2014 to estimate the models in eqs 1 and 2 the estimated probabilities of ignition were then used to simulate spatially and seasonally explicit ignitions for both lightning and human caused fires the estimated random year effects in the model for lightning ignitions were not gaussian consequently in our simulations we generated a random year effect by sampling from the estimated empirical distribution of τ next we estimated a model for the probability of an ignition resulting in a fire 10 ha the model used erc and spatial location as explanatory variables we found no significant seasonal effect on the probability of an ignition becoming a large fire consequently the final models did not include a day of year term the specific models used were 3 logit p1 β1o β11 erc h12 long lat 4 logit p2 β2o β21 erc h22 long lat where p 1 and p 2 are the probability of a lightning and human caused ignition burning an area larger than 10 ha respectively the functions h are non parametric smooth spline functions included in the model to account for the effect of spatial location on the probability of ignitions becoming large fires for each day and location with a simulated ignition the estimated values of p 1 and p 2 were used to simulate a large fire occurrence fires 10 ha in our historical sample included 313 fires out of 11 000 2 5 3 predicting fire size the distribution of fire sizes given an occurrence of a fire greater than 10 ha was estimated using the log generalized pareto distribution with erc as an explanatory variable ager et al 2014c specifically we used 5 f u x 1 σ x 1 α x u 10 σ x 1 1 α x where u log fire size for fires greater than 10 ha x erc and α and σ are the shape and scale parameters respectively we used a spline function for the relationship between the shape parameter and erc and a linear function for the relationship between the scale parameter and erc for location and day with a simulated fire greater than 10 ha we used the estimated shape and scale parameters to simulate a fire size from the pareto distribution in eq 5 2 5 4 generating future erc the daily erc values which drive the estimation process were derived from historical data from the raws climate archive referenced above and listed in appendix a table a2 in supplementary material we used historical daily erc values averaged over the study area to characterize the distribution of erc streams specifically we estimated the parameters for an autoregressive model of order one with day of year as an explanatory to account for the seasonal pattern noted in section 2 5 2 the equation for the model was 6 yti μι yt 1 i s day of year ε t 2 365 i 1 t where s is a smooth spline function and ε random noise the subscript i refers to the i th simulated year out of t years finally the intercept μι is a random intercept to account for between year variability seen in the historical erc data this model was used to generate streams of 365 daily erc values for each simulated year as specified by the user replicate firelists are created by repeating the process creating a unique sequence of erc values based on historical patterns 2 5 5 fuel moistures fuel moisture files are used by the flammap dll to set moistures for each fuel size class 1 hr 10 hr 100 hr 1000 hr and fuel model scott and burgan 2005 as well as live herbaceous and woody components we used the historical 1987 2011 mean fuel moisture values for each fuel size class for each value of erc used in the simulations 2 5 6 winds winds were modelled independently from fire probabilities we used historical records 1994 2011 to randomly sample gust wind direction based on day of year to simulate ignitions under conditions when fires actively spread we based wind speed values on gust data derived from lava butte raws weather data but restricted to days in the historical record where fires occurred that exceeded 500 ha a gust speed probability distribution was generated from these records and used to sample gust speed for each ignition 2 5 7 burn periods the mtt fire spread algorithm uses inputs on time rather than size of fire finney 2002 thus to obtain the fire size predicted by the fire prediction system it was necessary to translate fire size ha to burn period minutes and subsequent adjustments if the desired fire size was not achieved in other words it was necessary to guarantee that the simulated fire perimeters were materialized in any specific landscape and burning conditions with fire size and spatial distributions that reflect the predicted firelist we created a fire size burn period distribution with an mtt version encapsulated in fconstmtt a command line version of flammap finney 2002 by simulating multiple sets of 100 random ignition points with burn periods ranging from 30 min to 8000 min wind speed azimuth and erc were fixed at 18 mph 220 degrees and 60 respectively the simulated fire sizes and corresponding burn periods where used to estimate a second order polynomial linear regression model using fire size as predictor and burn period as dependent variable appendix a fig a4 in supplementary material the model was applied to obtain an initial burn period for each predicted fire size on the firelist table 2 2 5 8 creating firelists we developed the fire prediction system in r r core team 2014 that reads synthetic future erc streams section 2 5 4 and predicts daily fire occurrence section 2 5 2 location and size section 2 5 3 the prediction system writes a text file with lists of ignitions firelist and associated predicted fire weather parameters wind speed and azimuth section 2 5 6 burn probability section 2 5 2 burn period section 2 5 7 fire cause lightning or human and fuel moisture conditions section 2 5 5 for each day a fire occurs in each simulation year table 2 the firelists are generated for a user specified simulation period and number of replicates the fire prediction system was executed before an envision simulation the fire prediction system was designed to run in parallel on 8 processors and was batch run on a six core 3 50 ghz intel xenon cpu with 128 gb of ram for 30 replicates of 50 years each section 2 7 for a given batch run to generate five firelists predicting 50 years each took under 25 min we assessed the statistical model by comparing the distribution of random draws from the estimated probability models with the empirical distributions of the observed data both data sets plotted against erc 2 5 9 burn period adjustments to determine whether the predicted fire size would materialize under variable sets of ignition location fuel and weather conditions we ran a set of firelists with envision to control for the potential effect of vegetation succession wildfire and management in simulated fire size we forced all ignitions to occur in the same year simulation year 1 we observed two issues with fires simulated with envision the first being that when ignitions landed in non burnable or fuel limited areas the predicted fire size was not reached to correct this first problem we determined that if the simulated fire size in envision was smaller than the predicted fire size by a factor of 0 2 the ignition location x y was randomly sampled within a radius of 5 km up to a maximum of five times the x and y coordinates of the simulated fire size that came closest to the predicted fire size replaced the original fire location a second problem was observed whereby fire sizes were overestimated in envision usually as a consequence of ignitions landing on fast burning fuels coupled with sampled weather conditions well above the average conditions in these cases if the fire size was more than 1 5 times the predicted fire size the original burn period bp was reduced proportionally to the difference between the predicted and simulated fire sizes as follows 7 n e w b p o r i g i n a l b p 0 5 s i m u l a t e d p r e d i c t e d the resulting predicted versus simulated fire size was then plotted and examined for outliers 2 6 fire effects fire effects were implemented on each burned idu using flame length generated by the wildfire submodel a fire effects lookup table was used to translate flame lengths into severity classes that include low intensity fires mortality 20 mixed severity fires 20 mortality 80 and stand replacing fire mortality 80 flame length thresholds used to classify fire severity were obtained using fvs ffe simulations on representative tree lists for each vegclass in this process the fire and fuels extension to fvs reinhardt and crookston 2003 was used to simulate fires of varying flame lengths for each representative tree list and the flame length thresholds that generated the abovementioned stand mortality thresholds were determined similar to the approach used previously to build loss functions for mortality to old growth ager et al 2010 within envision these flame length thresholds are cross referenced with flame lengths from fire perimeters generated by the wildfire submodel to determine wildfire effects on each idu low severity fires do not trigger changes in vegclass but reduce surface fuel accumulation fuel model stand replacing fires will kill the majority of trees and return the idu to a post disturbance state depending on the idu pre fire conditions mixed severity fires can alter surface fuel i e fuel model or can trigger a state transition if changes occur to canopy cover and or number of canopy layers comparisons of initial fire severity outputs barros et al 2017 spies et al 2017 with fire severity data from the mtbs project suggested that envision overestimated the proportion of stand replacing fire in forested areas thus we increased the upper flame length thresholds of mixed severity fire above which fire severity was classified as stand replacing this adjustment corrected the proportion of stand replacing fire simulated by envision to levels comparable with historical fire severity according to mtbs severity maps eidenshink et al 2007 severity classes were also used to compute other fire related metrics e g smoke production timber volume losses 2 7 envision execution envision runs on an annual time step in the following simplified sequence vegetation succession wildfire submodel forest management submodel and evaluative models see spies et al 2017 for a detailed description of evaluative models in envision after each module runs the relevant idu information is updated and carried over to the next module and or time step this precludes for example thinning from below to happen in a stand that experienced stand replacing fire even though salvage logging can occur the wildfire submodel reads the firelist generated from the fire prediction system section 2 5 8 along with fire weather conditions for each fire each fire is simulated sequentially but fires are not allowed to overlap within the year fire perimeters are written as a shapefile and a grid of flame lengths is recorded both annually and daily the flame length grid for each perimeter is overlaid with the idu polygons and the mean flame length is calculated and used to affect state changes in vegetation as described in the fire effects section 2 6 the wildfire submodel also generates a grid of flame lengths similar to that generated by a static flammap simulation ager et al 2011 using predefined fuel moisture and fire weather conditions 2 8 simulation experiments we performed 30 replicates where each replicate simulation used a different firelist section 2 5 8 covering 50 years of ignitions generated by the fire prediction system we used the simulation output to describe the performance of the fire prediction system and the simulated fires within envision this included examination of 1 statistically generated erc versus historical and 2 fire size distributions of historical predicted and simulated datasets evidence for fire feedbacks was obtained by analyzing intersections among simulated fire perimeters within the previous ten years we chose a ten year timespan based on previous analyses that showed fires did not affect current fire growth if they were older than 10 years ager et al 2017a for the remaining questions we analyzed simulation outputs for area burned and severity by year for the 30 replicates for a given scenario a 50 yr envision run takes 3 h to run on a six core 3 50 ghz intel xenon cpu with 128gb of ram envision is available for download at http envision bioe orst edu and submodels described here are available by request to the author 3 results 3 1 historical ignition patterns we previously described aspects of the historical fire regime in the study area ager et al 2017b and include additional description here to provide the context for simulation experiments below several aspects of the fire regime including the spatial patterns of ignitions provided important details that affected our design and calibration of the envision fire simulation submodel the mean annual historical area burned 1992 2009 for the fpf study area was 14 997 ha or 0 48 per year with 645 ignitions per year and a mean fire size of 22 ha median 12 ha historical mean fire size from human ignitions was 26 ha median 6 ha compared to 22 ha for fires caused by natural ignitions median 6 ha excluding fires that were less than 10 ha mean fire size for human versus natural ignitions was 620 versus 1741 ha median 268 vs 371 respectively temporal ignition patterns were distinctly different for human versus lightning ignitions within the study area fig 3 with the latter showing strong peaks during the summer compared to the former human ignitions occurred throughout the period of natural ignitions but were more frequent in the spring and fall effectively extending the fire season by about three months and generating fires under low erc relative to lightning ignitions the episodic pattern of lightning ignitions results from regional convective activity associated with cold fronts that intersect high pressure systems that develop over the pacific northwest during midsummer spatial patterns of ignitions were also distinctly different between human and lightning categories fig 4 human ignitions were strongly clustered around developed areas and to a lesser extent in popular recreation sites e g deschutes river fig 4b two of the largest developed areas warm springs and bend fig 4d had the highest density of human ignitions lightning ignitions had the highest densities in the south central and southeast portion of the study area 3 2 fire forecasting model validation both daily ignition frequency and the resulting fire size were positively and non linearly related to erc erc streams generated by the model eq 6 captured daily and yearly variability and seasonal trends fig 6 with forecasted values generally remaining within the maximum and minimum observed data fire size distributions generated by the statistical model eq 5 showed a similar pattern and distribution as the historical data fig 5a b additionally we compared the forecasted wildfire size generated from the statistical prediction model with the outputs from the envision run to validate the fire prediction system see 2 5 9 for details we used the contemporary management scenario cman for this comparison and the results showed that fire sizes generated from random draws from the empirical distributions were closely related to fire sizes simulated within envision runs fig 7 observed outliers were caused by a number of factors including ignitions that occurred with a combination of fire spread conditions that include fuel models with slower spread rate low windspeed and low erc 3 3 simulation experiment the 50 yr envision simulation experiment using contemporary forest management cman revealed substantial among replicate n 30 and inter annual 50 years variability similarly to the historical fire data fig 8 the mean proportion of area burned per year was similar between historical and simulated fires and equaled 0 86 and 0 84 of the study area respectively the pooled among year coefficient of variation cv across all replicates for area burned per year was 153 indicating that the magnitude of variation among years was about three times larger than the mean annual area burned fire rotation interval number of years required to burn the entire study area varied among the 30 replicates from 78 to 170 years the comparison between fire size distributions for predicted statistical model and simulated for 3 out of 30 envision replicates fig 9 showed good correspondence when compared to the fire size obtained with envision the 1st and 3rd quartiles and mean and median fire size matched well over the datasets mean fire size across all replicates from human ignitions was 601 ha median 27 ha compared to 1047 ha for fires caused by natural ignitions median 34 ha simulated replicates showed on average higher median values fig 9 and larger extreme values than the predicted dataset this was mostly due to overestimation in simulated datasets of the number of fires between fire size classes of 1 103 ha and 1 106 ha we also examined the occurrence of extreme fire years with burn areas above the 10 yr moving average on average in each 50 yr simulation there were 17 min max 12 21 years and 15 min max 11 19 years very large extreme years fig 10 to examine the effect of ignition type on area burned over time we analyzed area burned by cause for the cman scenario fig 11 although the mean annual area burned over the simulation did not vary substantially between the two ignition types temporal trends showed decadal periods where human ignitions burned up to about 0 3 more 37 500 ha on an annual basis compared to natural ignitions for instance in simulation year 20 natural ignitions resulted in about 0 8 100 000 ha of the study area burning compared to about 0 3 human caused fires spatial differences in burned area between the ignition types were apparent from the simulation outputs with the effects of human ignitions especially pronounced along the northeast end of the study area where there were ignition hotspots around developed areas and recreation sites fig 12 in general there was an east west and north south gradient of area burned from natural ignitions that resulted from the combined effects of ignition probability and spread rates of vegetation and fuels in the different locations fig 12 most area burned in the simulations resulted from mixed severity fire followed by high severity fig 13 which is in agreement with recent empirical fire severity reported for the study area by reilly et al 2017 the different classes of fire severity surface mixed severity stand replacing did not have substantial trends over time for the cman scenario fig 13b or the noman scenario fig 13a although more area burned overall under noman there was a slight downward trend in the area burned by mixed severity and corresponding upward trend in surface fire severity especially in the last decade of the simulation although inter annual variability masked the trends changes in vegetation and fuels from succession and management activities were not sufficient to dramatically change trends in area burned within the study area fig 13 the potential fire behavior as measured by flame length and spread rate exhibited upward trends for the landscape noman as a whole as determined from flammap simulations appendix a figs a5 a6 in supplemental material under the modelled contemporary rates of burning the potential for fire feedbacks to self regulate wildfire spread within our simulations was not large based on the frequency with which fires intersected previous fire footprints fig 14 for instance the rate of intersection among fires that burned within a ten year time window average lifespan of fuel treatment prichard et al 2017 was estimated at between 2 4 at any given year per year and did not change between the noman and cman scenarios fig 14 given that there are about 14 fires per year on average an intersection of two fires would be expected about every other year the relationship between fire size and intersection frequency showed that both small and large fires had a high propensity to intersect the latter because they spread farther over the landscape and former because their ignitions are spatially clustered in ignition hotpots fig 15 but lack the fuels to spread thus the hotspots for human ignitions increased the potential for landscape feedbacks compared to natural ignitions which are more dispersed 4 discussion our simulation experiments complement related research ager et al 2017a barros et al 2017 2018 charnley et al 2017 spies et al 2017 as part of the forest people fire fpf project spies et al 2014 although a number of modifications and improvements to the envision model were made since these earlier analyses the results of the current study suggested that future burned area is not limited by available fuels even with fuel reduction as part of forest restoration management programs noss et al 2006 stephens et al 2016 usda forest service 2015 and that current climate regimes are not sufficient to generate megafire tipping points adams 2013 that dramatically alter the forest landscape this result is similar to other modelling studies in the western us loudermilk et al 2014 scheller and mladenoff 2007 stevens et al 2016 syphard et al 2011 where a wide range of simulated management scenarios did not dramatically alter rates of burning however restoration management combined with contemporary levels of wildfire did result in ecologically important reductions in fire intensity and severity a finding also consistent with empirical and simulation studies on the effect of fuels modification on fire behavior kalies and yocom kent 2016 the predicted reduction in severity and intensity but not spread rate burned area can be traced to the differences in the recovery rate of the respective fire regime components specifically recovery rates for fire spread are relatively short 5 20 years compared to fire frequency 30 100 years prichard et al 2017 thus allowing the effects of management to dissipate on the landscape before the next fire typically arrives nevertheless the ecological changes we observed in the simulation lend support to restoration policies that call for thinning and burning to improve fire resiliency on federal forests in the western us stephens et al 2016 and indicate the rate of treatment needs to be sufficiently high to maintain reduced fuel levels on a large enough part of the landscape or in key places our analysis of variability among years and replicates for future wildfire scenarios depicted a high uncertainty of large wildfire events fire rotation interval among plausible future scenarios varied among replicate simulations from 78 to 170 years meaning that there was a twofold difference in the average rate of burning area per year highlighting the uncertainty of fire as a driver of future landscape change even without considering potential amplification of fire regimes from climate change extreme fire years hulse et al 2016 were considered as those that exceeded a 10 yr moving average and were observed in 15 out of 50 years in the simulation previous flsm studies rarely report fire event level details regarding variation in size frequency and severity or describe unusual extreme fire events that are important from a policy perspective since these fires can change attitudes towards fire and public policy our most extreme fire event burned 11 4 of our study area a few studies do report variation in fire size syphard et al 2011 reported mean fire size by elevation class for a 50 yr simulation in the sierra mountains the maximum simulated fire being 36 237 ha 1 7 of the study area loudermilk et al 2014 report a maximum mean fire size of 652 ha among five replicates over a 100 year simulation for a 85 000 ha fire prone study area 0 8 in california high variability in fire size e g years with little fire slows the development of robust risk governance systems that can adapt to changing fire regimes with legislation and local policies that govern development in fire prone areas steelman 2016 one reason we get extremely large fires in envision compared to some other models is that fire sizes are drawn from statistical distributions rather than monte carlo simulation of historical events or pre determined fire regimes syphard et al 2011 our model captures potentially rare but plausible fire events as predicted in time series analyses of erc streams and captures inter annual variability in weather abatzoglou and williams 2016 this bottom up fire model improves the ability to model major events that drive landscape change and helps incorporate the stochastic and unpredictable nature of landscapes and populations scheller et al 2011 in our study we found that the potential for fire feedbacks as estimated from encounter rates between fire events was dependent on both fire size and ignition type both small and large fires had high encounter rates a finding that suggests other factors besides area burned price et al 2015 influence fire on fire events modelling how fire feedbacks interact with fuel management at the patch or event scale is key to understanding how fire can be leveraged to meet ecological restoration objectives in us federal land management agencies barros et al 2018 north et al 2015 self regulating wildfire results from interactions between ignition events and fuel beds that modulate burned area and severity ignitions within prior fire footprints can fail to spread or spread at a lower rate and intensity krawchuk et al 2006 prichard et al 2010 safford et al 2009 or ignited fires can burn into previously burned areas and go out understanding these mechanisms and the dynamics of fire on fire and fire on treatment interactions is key to addressing the current fire deficit with policies that allow more natural ignitions to burn on low risk landscapes north et al 2012 prior studies on the self regulating properties of wildfire are almost exclusively based on empirical data and are limited to either single events or relatively small samples of historical fires barnett et al 2016 collins et al 2009 coop et al 2014 holsinger et al 2016 parks et al 2015 2016 price et al 2015 in contrast to empirical studies with available data forest simulation models can provide detailed outputs that can be mined to study these interactions on large populations of fire on fire interactions over many fire rotations and replicate simulations as in our previous work ager et al 2014c preisler and ager 2013 we used empirically derived relationships between energy release component erc and historical fire attributes to predict daily fire occurrence location and fire size however we improved the spatiotemporal resolution of the fire prediction model compared to other fire simulation finney et al 2011 and forest landscape simulation studies by using a generalized additive model gam that included non linear effects of location and time of year a wide range of statistical techniques have been used to estimate fire ignition probability from empirical data including random forest analysis oliveira et al 2012 kernel density interpolations de la riva et al 2004 koutsias et al 2004 maximum entropy maxent estimation parisien et al 2012 and logistic regression del hoyo et al 2011 lozano et al 2007 martell et al 1987 padilla and vega garcía 2011 gam applies nonparametric splines to fit a wide range of functional forms compared to parametric functions allowing us to model non linear relationships between the log odds of fire occurrence and explanatory variables within a logistic model brillinger et al 2006 preisler et al 2004 the method is particularly useful for accounting for non linear interactions between ignition location and day of year observed in complex spatiotemporal patterns of lightning and human ignitions we note that our use of erc as a driver assumed a stationary fire climate response which is appropriate for most of the northwestern us where the biomass of fuels is generally not limiting mckenzie and littell 2017 but fuel moisture limits fire activity littell et al 2009 we acknowledge that in other regions where fuels are driven by short term climate drivers our modelling approach is not appropriate mckenzie and littell 2017 we also note that our predicted fire activity does not account for potential future increases in erc from climate change abatzoglou and williams 2016 abatzoglou and brown 2012 littell et al 2009 which is the subject of our future work concurrent application of the envision model as part of the broader fpf study spies et al 2014 revealed a number of additional findings barros et al 2017 examined a range of alternative fuel management scenarios and found that relative to a no management scenario area burned and the likelihood of very large fires was reduced under all management scenarios though differences on average were rather small the authors also found that despite the reduction in area burned when the forest was managed there was no decreasing trend in area burned through a 50 yr period spies et al 2017 analyzed the impact of different restoration scenarios on fire behavior wood production carbon and measures of biodiversity and resilient vegetation and found that fuel treatments could have significant effects on landscape conditions over time ager et al 2017a estimated reduction in area burned from fire feedbacks for a range of fire rotation intervals both short term negative and long term positive feedbacks were observed our studies as part of the fpf project add to prior flsm studies which have focused on tradeoffs among multiple competing ecological and management objectives under dynamic disturbances e g scheller et al 2011 barros et al 2018 found that the addition of one simulated wildfire per year under favorable weather conditions in low risk areas and over the course of 50 years increased forest resilience in fire adapted forest types but there were tradeoffs including potential reduction in wildlife habitat and increases in smoke and area burned in fire sensitive forest types other studies have examined tradeoffs between treatment rate and intensity and long term versus short term risks ager et al 2017a halofsky et al 2014b scheller et al 2007 spies et al 2017 syphard et al 2011 for instance syphard et al 2011 found that area treated had a larger effect than intensity of treatment and treatments were most effective where wildfire likelihood was the highest thus treatment location was more important than treatment type risk tradeoffs or competing risks from fuel management programs i e the relative effects of short term negative impacts to ecological values critical habitat carbon versus long term benefits from reduced future wildfire impacts have been examined in a number of studies that incorporated wildfire into simulations loudermilk et al 2014 scheller et al 2011 syphard et al 2011 and others factoring it as an exogenous process collins et al 2011 roloff et al 2005 spies et al 2017 found in the central oregon cascades that management reduced spotted owl habitat despite also reducing wildfire severity this occurred in part because treatments kept younger non habitat forests from becoming owl habitat and replacing owl habitats lost to wildfire by contrast syphard et al 2011 found more biomass and large trees survived wildfire post fuels treatment in the southern sierra nevada mountains small biomass was removed that protected large trees where biomass was accumulated and treatments conferred ecological benefit by preserving large trees scheller et al 2011 also studied risk tradeoffs in fisher martes pennanti habitat in the sierra nevada mountains and found that direct negative effects on habitat were less than indirect positive effects over the long run in general these and other studies have found that management activities that cause short term loss of habitat or other ecosystem services have longer term positive impacts from reduced fire extent and or severity and thus suggest long term benefits outweigh short term adverse impacts of management another contribution to the flsm literature is our partitioning of human and natural ignitions as separate disturbance processes many models do not consider potential agent influences as sources of ignitions which is necessary to model ecological change driven by natural influences versus human caused ignitions balch et al 2017 parisien et al 2016 syphard and keeley 2015 fires from human ignitions are not permitted to be managed for ecological benefit and thus policy simulations to explore fire feedbacks that let fires burn due to changes in suppression policies need to consider the ignition source barros et al 2018 expansion of the wui is predicted to double by year 2030 theobald and romme 2007 thus both human activity in the wildlands that cause ignitions and susceptible structures will both increase our results indicate that both the timing and location of the two ignition types differ substantially in the study area both contributing nearly equally to area burned but with different spatial patterns and feedbacks studies of human versus natural ignitions have illustrated regional and continental wide patterns and the role of human ignitions lengthening the fire season balch et al 2017 campos ruiz et al 2018 parisien et al 2016 and the differential impacts to structures collins et al 2016 but not their effect on fire regimes over time in our study area the slightly smaller fires from human ignitions could be related to both the timing and location of the two sources of ignitions relative to roads and suppression resources human ignitions were relatively more frequent in the spring and fall and thus extended the fire season compared to natural ignitions alone balch et al 2017 over the long run ecological effects of the two ignition sources could change successional trajectories if they ignite in different seasons and the fires have different effects on vegetation studies that have investigated climate wildfire drivers have not distinguished between human and lightning and the relationships are likely different in ignition limited systems mckenzie and littell 2017 the integration of ignition specific wildfire occurrence models adds functionality that is needed to model agent behavior as both progenitors of fire and actors that respond to it for instance policy adoption for regulations on forest activities hunting recreation and wildfire risk education butry et al 2010 prestemon and butry 2010 prestemon et al 2010 would be connected to locations and seasons with ignition hotspots by contrast policy adoption for fuel management with protection objectives would focus on areas with high lightning ignition escape potential and risk policies that seek to expand area burned by natural ignitions to restore fire regimes would emphasize areas of frequent ignitions and low risk fires agent based simulations can then be used to identify synergies between fuel management policies ignition prevention programs and fires managed for restoration to broadly address human versus natural fires in a coupled human and natural systems framework our study contributes to scientific progress in ecological modelling in several areas including fire feedbacks prichard et al 2017 the role of human versus natural ignitions as drivers of landscape change balch et al 2017 hulse et al 2016 parisien et al 2016 and fine scale statistical modelling of fire ignitions preisler et al 2004 moreover we coupled two foundational simulation frameworks the fire behavior models built on the usfs fire behavior libraries brittain 2018 and envision bolte 2018 the fire behavior code library encapsulates core fire modelling components used in continental scale wildfire research for strategic and tactical planning by researchers and practitioners in the us and elsewhere ager et al 2014b alcasena et al 2017 andrews 2007 brittain 2018 finney et al 2011 gill et al 1987 kalabokidis et al 2015 noonan wright et al 2011 oliveira et al 2016 rollins 2009 salis et al 2014 the integration into a flsm can simulate management disturbance succession and ecological impacts with agents that are aware of landscape conditions and respond to them within particular policy or goal domains policies include dynamic and spatially explicit restoration activities thinning mastication underburning applied at densities according to specific landscape priorities over time other flsm platforms have to varying degrees represented both human management policies and biophysical processes conlisk et al 2015 finney et al 2007 loudermilk et al 2014 millington et al 2009 scheller et al 2011 however management policies are typically hardwired over time to different degrees in these models while ignoring agent landscape and landscape fire feedbacks a gap that is most significant on mixed owner landscapes where risk governance is fragmented and biophysical and social risk systems interact to drive public wildfire policy implementation charnley et al 2017 steelman 2016 in our study the location and rate of treatments were dynamically allocated in response to landscape conditions at annual time steps treatments were not however receptive to agent feedbacks since we assumed static agent behavior in this particular study see spies et al 2017 many challenges remain particularly in the representation of agent behavior and translating social science in the models e g a better understanding of how fire

25237,the mangrove landscapes of the ratones river and itacorubi located in the municipality of florianópolis south of brazil are environmentally fragmented due to anthropogenic use of the soil which hinders the dispersal of their native species for the maintenance of ecological connectivity this paper aims to identify the most critical habitat fragments of both landscape mangroves and to restore its ecosystem benefits however different metrics of graph theory provide distinct results of connectivity thus this work also proposes a novel method to combine various connectivity metrics in a concise measurement all investigated metrics make use of probabilistic models related to the displacement of an endangered species lontra longicaudis of the local fauna after the identification of the most critical habitat fragments they were analyzed structurally and functionally on the landscape this study provides guidelines for environmental management for the most critical and maintenance of the least critical fragments keywords landscape mangroves connectivity ecology graph theory 1 introduction biodiversity is an essential indicator of the health of an ecosystem rapport 1995 as spatial connectivity permits the movement and exchange of populations maintaining their genetic flow crooks and sanjayan 2006 luque et al 2012 the concept of landscape ecology is fundamental for the development of ecological planning which manages natural or cultural landscapes different ecosystems and types of land occupation forman and wilson 1995 the landscape elements spatially structured by matrices stains and corridors proposed by forman and godron 1986 strongly control all movements flows and changes in natural systems and population at different scales which causes a direct connection between structure and function therefore ecological connectivity establishes a close relationship between the spatial structure of the habitat and the survival of the species unfortunately anthropogenic factors have made this process difficult in a landscape through landscape connectivity taylor et al 1993 define the extent to which landscape facilitates or hinders the movement of species among habitats these extensions depend on the configuration of the spots and corridors in a matrix having multiple forms of connections both structural spatial form of the landscape and functional movement of the species in the landscape burel and baudry 1999 in addition only by analyzing the landscape in a structural and functional form it is possible to produce a significant value of connectivity see kindlmann and burel 2008 the graph theory is a mathematical field related to connectivity problems that were recently adapted for studies in landscape ecology and conservation biology urban et al 2009 urban and keitt 2001 its application involves measuring ecological connectivity in fragmented landscapes through nodes habitat fragments and links potential of species dispersal in multiple applications galpern et al 2011 urban et al 2009 among a myriad of models probabilistic connection models provide a more comprehensive approach since they weighted the distance between nodes by the probability of species dispersion among habitat fragments bunn et al 2000 saura and pascual hortal 2007 urban and keitt 2001 the minimum cost for species populations to move between fragments determines the identification of potential connections in a permeable landscape heterogeneous landscape adriaensen et al 2003 the importance of ecological connectivity for the conservation of ecosystems led to the proliferation of studies and research about distinct methods to quantify it however according to kindlmann and burel 2008 different metrics generate unlike values of connectivity indexes for the same landscape present in 123 countries the mangroves are examples of a natural ecosystem typology that is suffering severe degradation with the loss and fragmentation of its space their formation occurs in the transition between terrestrial and marine environments the mangroves grow primarily in the tropical but also in the subtropical warm and humid coastal climate they cover a total area of 150 000 km2 with 47 of existing mangroves in indonesia brazil australia mexico and nigeria spalding et al 2010 estimations suggest a considerable loss of mangroves in the world between 1980 and 2005 around 3 5 million hectares which implies a decrease of 20 of its surface associated with human activities fao 2007 kathiresan and bingham 2001 spalding et al 2010 brazilian mangroves account for 8 5 of total mangroves on the planet with approximately 13 000 km2 located along almost all the coast being the second country in extension of mangroves in the world spalding et al 2010 however there was a total decrease of approximately 40 from its original cover with a loss of 25 since the beginning of the 20th century icmbio 2017 the degradation began in the colonial period during the 16th century to obtain a pigment for an ink production rio de janeiro 2001 more recently the degradation is the result of the increase in urban population and changes in land use as an incentive to reverse the degradation of mangroves the scientific community has highlighted its ecosystem benefits from the global to the local scale as the mangroves are composed of arboreal or shrub species highly adapted to survive in the face of the effects of wind waves and water currents fao 2007 kathiresan and bingham 2001 they can attenuate the disturbances of climate changes due to their resistance and resilience alongi 2008 spalding et al 2010 the mangroves exert as natural damping systems in the floods saline intrusion and prevention of coastal erosion fao 2007 kathiresan and bingham 2001 also they function as biological filters by absorption nutrients and also toxins which favor the creation of fertile soils hogarth 2015 kathiresan and bingham 2001 spalding et al 2010 a large variety of terrestrial and marine fauna migrates to mangroves during specific periods and may even remain throughout their life cycle due to the abundance of food and because they are an optimal area for sheltering nagelkerken et al 2008 the mangroves are a vital area for ecological connectivity with other adjacent ecosystems thus this article aims to identify the most critical habitat fragments for the maintenance of the ecological connectivity of two mangrove landscapes ratones river and itacorubi located in the municipality of florianópolis in the south of brazil these landscapes are in different stages of degradation due to human use which causes a decrease and isolation of the mangroves among themselves and with the vegetation of their nearby surroundings and for native species from dispersing among their habitats these circumstances determine the importance of ecological connectivity as one of the primary objectives for the protection of the environment as it enhances its ecosystem services therefore a novel method was proposed based on the principles of landscape ecology to combine the different measures of the graph theory into a single value of ecological connectivity between 0 and 1 for each habitat fragment where 0 represents the least connected and 1 the most ecologically connected fragment in the landscape for the identification of the most critical fragments the study is based on the behavior of lontra longidaudis a threatened species of local fauna 2 methodology the scheme of fig 1 represents the research methodology plan using as a study base an endangered species of the local fauna this study analyses the ecological connectivity in the structural spatial characterization of the landscape and functional displacement of the studied species form for two mangrove landscapes in the municipality of florianópolis for this purpose this work employs a total of six connectivity metrics of the graph theory with probabilistic connection models these metrics rely on three parts nodes dispersion and links the nodes refer to the habitat fragments used by the species studied mangroves and dense vegetation of its near environment the dispersion is an attribute related to the displacement distance of the species the links are the least cost paths of displacement the combination of these parts provides the potential connections of the species among habitat fragments through the landscape permeability resistance to movement within the landscape this research uses the following cartographic data of the locality drainage basin epagri 2007 based on the analysis of the data of the cartographic base of santa catarina state at scales 1 50 000 and 1 100 000 land use map of municipal director plan pmf 2014 scale 1 10 000 typologies of vegetation klein 1978 scale 1 1 000 000 map of remaining vegetation sar 2005 scale 1 50 000 and the vegetation cover of the island of santa catarina 1978 caruso 1981 scale 1 50 000 all maps were updated and adapted according to the most recent satellite images of world imagery esri 2017 and field visit the used software for the maps was gis geographic information system arcgis 10 3 georeferenced with the projection system for wgs 1984 utm zone 22s and for the metrics conefor sensinode 2 6 and matlab r2016a from the results of the metrics combination a single ecological connectivity value for each node between 0 and 1 was obtained according to the proposed method it was possible to identify the most critical habitat fragments for the two case studies then they were analyzed structurally and functionally in the landscape relating them to the current environmental protection laws to maintain ecological connectivity 2 1 characterization of mangrove landscapes mangroves of the ratones river and itacorubi are at the southern limit with respect to areas with mangrove in the south american continent after this limit these peculiar landscapes disappear due to the low temperatures in the subtropical zone and also due to the presence of strong waves in the studied landscapes the development of mangroves is due to the protection of the north bay in the insular part of the municipality of florianópolis mangroves in this area are generally associated with coastal bays and lagoons cintron and schaeffer novelli 1981 they have a maritime fluvial character and are in the drainage basin of the ratones river and itacorubi the mangroves have the same name as their basin for this study the mangroves drainage basin delimits the analyzed landscapes with an area of 116 23 km2 for ratones river and 28 27 km2 for itacorubi they are located respectively at 27 34 52 566 s 48 31 0 241 w and 27 27 55 427 s 48 30 19 029 w fig 2 respectively the flora of both mangroves is composed of three species rhizophora mangle avicennia schaueriana and laguncularia racemosa with a remarkable degree of development despite its proximity to the latitudinal limit cintron and schaeffer novelli 1981 its fauna constitutes of invertebrates fishes birds reptiles and mammals in addition to microscopic organisms functioning as a transitional ecosystem for many terrestrial marine or freshwater species it communicates in its immediate environment with dense rainforest called tropical rainforest due to its characteristics related to tropical climate factors and high rainfall with high biological diversity and vertical stratification it also communicates with the restinga vegetation brazilian term which has a coastal characteristic with shrub and herbaceous structure in addition to the typologies of the mentioned vegetations there are also exotic forests of pinus spp and eucalyptus spp despite its rich biodiversity the loss and fragmentation of ecosystems is a problem in both case studies they are mainly due to the use of agriculture and urban development throughout history although with different stages of degradation in the ratones river the land use is mainly rural while in itacorubi it is predominantly urban especially in the flattest areas with the abandonment of agricultural practice in some localities the coverage of natural soil was partially restored this is why there is currently secondary vegetation in different stages of growth however different from the original vegetation this vegetation has low biodiversity due to its recent formation sevegnani and schroeder 2013 the indiscriminate and intensive use of land has been happening in previously preserved area without an efficient control over these occupations in previously preserved areas demonstrating a lack of compliance with the environmental laws fig 3 shows the most recent municipal environmental protection map from 2014 delineated for the ratones river and itacorubi basins although those laws are not sufficiently adequate for the management of natural spaces therefore this highlights the importance of identification of the most critical habitat fragments and helps the maintenance of the ecological connectivity in mangrove landscapes providing an alternative plan to restructure the local fauna and flora 2 2 specie of study for this study we focused the species lontra longicaudis of the mustelidae family which is included in the red list category of the iucn international union for conservation of nature and natural resources as near threatened rheingantz and trinca 2015 and the official list of endangered species of brazilian fauna ibama 1990 it is present in both aquatic and terrestrial environments according to olimpio 1990 mangroves in the locality are essential areas for the species as shelter and food but they are also present in the surrounding vegetation this species adapts to a wide variety of habitats and altitudes but it is sensitive to human interference gallo reynoso 1997 the displacement range of the species during the dry season is from 2 to 4 km and from 7 to 9 km in the rainy season gallo reynoso 1989 note that to measure dispersion there are differences among species or among the same species at different times resulting in different degrees of connectivity for the same landscape kindlmann and burel 2008 thus for the species of study a dispersion of 8 km was selected due to the occurrence of precipitation during all months of the year and the absence of a defined dry season in the municipality of florianópolis according to the köppen geiger classification peel et al 2007 2 3 potential connections in the landscape permeability the resistance to the movement of the species in a heterogeneous landscape defines the landscape permeability a low resistance denotes ease of movement and a high resistance a movement restriction zeller et al 2012 through a permeable landscape it is possible to identify potential connections which simulate the least cost pathways of the species to ensure ecological connectivity adriaensen et al 2003 chardon et al 2003 state that the incorporation of resistance in the landscape to measure the shortest distance between habitats provides better results than the euclidean distance geometric distance between two points these mentioned studies used environmentally degraded landscapes as the two mangrove landscapes of the municipality of florianópolis as shown in table 1 both landscapes are divided into categories according to their natural elements flora and rivers and anthropic elements land uses and roadways these categories determine the resistance values for the displacement of the studied species for each landscape category the mangrove is the primary habitat of the species of study and therefore has the minimum value of resistance the native vegetation in the immediate environment is divided according to its plant structure or planting regeneration stages dense vegetation low dense vegetation and herbaceous and or shrub vegetation both mangroves and dense vegetation have low resistance since they are the survival habitats of the species for the species of study the river is a connecting element having low resistance and roadways work as a connection impediment with high resistance value which varies according to the width and the speed traffic in the mangrove landscape of the ratones river with areas between 0 02 and 36 47 km2 totaling 65 41 km2 and 56 27 in the landscape the rest of the flora low dense vegetation shrub and or herbaceous vegetation and exotic vegetation represents 12 91 in the landscape rural use 19 59 and urban use 11 23 regarding itacorubi 20 fragments of habitats were identified between 0 015 and 6 64 km2 of the area totaling 16 06 km2 and 56 83 in the landscape the rest of the flora has a 4 82 the rural use a 1 92 and urban use a 36 43 in the landscape note that all landscape categories e g habitat fragments rural use urban use and others have been delineated based on cartographic data see the introduction of section 2 to identify the potential connections the landscape permeability map was initially originated through a gis software fig 4 a raster was generated through the weighted overlay tool of arcgis 10 3 where each pixel 5 m 5 m has a determined resistance value see table 1 these values are a result of a combination of two layers each one with a distinct weight the flora and the use of the soil have an influence weight of 60 and 40 for rivers and roadways implying an alteration of the impedance values of rivers and roads depending on their surround environment for example sections of a river close to urban development have higher impedance than other sections of the same river close to a vegetated area the dispersion of the species depends on these resistance values between the points of origin and destination located in the center of gravity of the habitat fragments from the landscape permeability map the potential connections between source and destination points were determined through the use of the cost distance cost back link and cost path connectivity tools of arcgis 10 3 which verify the path of minimum cost between habitats ratones river landscape generated 1171 potential connections between all points located in the center of gravity of the habitat fragments in the habitat fragment represented by point 31 due to the shape and large extension the center of gravity lies outside the boundary of the area the solution for this issue passed through the segmentation of the total area in three parts 31a 31b and 31c aiming a similar area as long the center of gravity is inside of the new sub segment finally itacorubi landscape generated 190 potential connections 2 4 connectivity metrics this paper considers different metrics of connectivity from the literature of graph theory in studies of landscape ecology and conservation biology graph theory models make use of a set of nodes and links the nodes represent the habitat fragments while the link indicates the potential capacity of an individual to disperse between the nodes galpern et al 2011 urban et al 2009 according to kindlmann and burel 2008 it is important to develop functional connectivity measures that add both the movement behavior of the species and the structure of the landscape the quantification of the ecological connectivity can be through binary or probabilistic connection models pascual hortal and saura 2006 saura and pascual hortal 2007 however in the binary model there is no measure of the potential dispersion between each node considering only whether they are connected or not depending only on the dispersion distance in the probabilistic model the connections are characterized by a probability of dispersion p ij between the nodes i and j having a more effective result in the landscape bunn et al 2000 saura and pascual hortal 2007 urban and keitt 2001 the present study reviews six metrics of probabilistic connection models considering the relationship between the nodes fragments of mangroves and dense vegetation of their near environment dispersion the distance of displacement of the species of study and links lower cost travel routes those metrics are widely used in the literature see saura and pascual hortal 2007 bunn et al 2000 urban and keitt 2001 among others the flux area weighted flux and probability of connectivity index metrics were calculated through the conefor sensinode 2 6 saura and torné 2009 the metrics influx potential outflux potential and metapopulation capacity were implemented and calculated using matlab r2016a the formulas used for each of the metrics mentioned are the following i flux f bunn et al 2000 urban and keitt 2001 1 f i 1 n j 1 j i n p ij ii area weighted flux awf bunn et al 2000 urban and keitt 2001 2 awf i 1 n j 1 j i n a i a j p ij iii probability of connectivity index pc saura and pascual hortal 2007 3 pc a l 2 i 1 n j 1 n a i a j p ij iv influx potential ip malvadkar et al 2015 4 ip i 1 n j 1 n p ij a j v outflux potential op malvadkar et al 2015 5 op i 1 n j 1 n p ij a i vi metapopulation capacity mc hanski and ovaskainen 2000 6 mc λ p max where a i and a j are the areas of the nodes i and j a l is the total area of the landscape p ij is the direct probability of dispersion between the nodes i and j p ij is the probability of the best path of all possible paths between i and j for example let p ij be equal to 0 6 p iq be equal to 0 8 and p jq be equal to 0 8 then p ij equals to the maximum likelihood of dispersion i e the best path from i to j is passing through q thus the resulting probability 0 8 0 8 0 64 is higher than p ij when two nodes are completely isolated p ij will be equal to 0 finally λ p max is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix p where p ij p ij and 0 for i j the probability of dispersion p ij is calculated as 7 p ij e k d ij where d ij is the distance between the nodes and k is a constant the value of k 0 038 was obtained using a dispersion probability of 5 for 8 km of dispersion the results of this analysis may vary depending on the metric selected each metric has weak and strong points making direct comparison difficult the metric f takes into account only the direct probability of dispersion awf considers the direct probability but weighted by the area of the two nodes pc takes into account the maximum likelihood of dispersion giving more importance to stepping stones saura and pascual hortal 2007 since it may comprise intermediary nodes to reach the final destination ip considers the probability next to the area of the target node the reverse of op which considers the probability next to the area of the source node finally mc captures the impact of ecological connectivity on the persistence of species metapopulation note that the pc metric has a range of total landscape connectivity between 0 and 1 where the value 1 is a landscape occupied by 100 of habitat and the other metrics between 0 and the importance of each fragment habitat was obtained by pascual hortal and saura 2006 saura and pascual hortal 2007 urban and keitt 2001 8 dx i 100 x x x where x is the result of connectivity metrics calculated for the landscape taking into account all landscape nodes and x is the value of the same metric calculated after exclusion of node i from the landscape for mc metric the importance of each node is measured according to the formula hanski and ovaskainen 2000 9 dmc i x i 2 λ p max where x is the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue λ p max although the dx values for all metrics have a minimum range of 0 the maximum in general has no bound thus this work proposes to normalize the indexes dx of each metric between 0 and 1 see eq 10 after that the average of the normalized indexes node by node is evaluated for the importance of each fragment of habitat see eq 11 10 dx j i dx j i min dx j max dx j min dx j 11 x i n m 1 j 1 n m dx j i where dx j i refers to the importance of node i for measure j and n m is the total number of metrics from the results obtained from eq 11 the nodes were normalized once more between 0 and 1 in the same fashion of eq 10 thus the ecological connectivity value of each habitat fragment is defined as being 0 to the least connected node and 1 to the most ecologically connected in the landscape 3 results and discussion according to the analysis of the results it is possible to verify that the order of the most connected habitat fragment to the least ecologically connected in the landscape is not dominated by any specific metric as mentioned before each metric has its guidelines for evaluating connectivity and the combination of them represents a synthesis of all the metrics for example in rio ratones the node considered to be the most connected relative to node 28 see fig 5 is also pointed by awf op and mc metrics in the f pc and ip metrics this same node represents the values 0 876 0 781 and 0 858 respectively as for itacorubi the most connected node node 18 see fig 5 is assigned by the metrics awf pc ip op however in the f and mc metrics this node represents the values 0 061 and 0 692 respectively from the value of the ecological connectivity of each habitat fragment through the combination of the metrics the most critical habitat fragments were identified in the two mangrove landscapes in a range between 0 and 1 less connected and more connected respectively the nodes were divided according to their value of ecological connectivity the most critical nodes were considered to be in the 25 of the lowest values critical those that are more than 25 and less or equal than 75 and less critical those that are more than 75 the division into ranges is always subjective and must be chosen according to what is most appropriate to the study subsequently the most critical nodes are structurally and functionally analyzed also the habitat fragments belong to three different categories according to their current environmental protection laws protected areas considered permanent preservation areas partially protected areas which are areas of preservation with limited use areas special urbanization areas and green leisure areas and areas without environmental protection see fig 5 in ratones river from a total of 47 nodes 43 are in the most critical region totaling 11 91 km2 of the 65 41 km2 of existing habitat fragments as for itacorubi of the 20 nodes 16 are in the most critical region with a total of 2 00 km2 of the 16 07 km2 of existing habitat fragments although 81 78 of the area of the habitat fragments of ratones river are in the less critical range 91 49 of the nodes are in the most critical interval the same proportion occurs in itacorubi where 87 56 of the area of the habitat fragments are in the less critical range and 80 of the nodes are in the most critical interval thus in general the reduced size of habitat area poses a significant risk to ecological connectivity nevertheless the ecological connectivity is not only influenced by the area among the most critical nodes in ratones river node 14 has the lowest connectivity value with an area of 0 12 km2 while node 32 has the highest connectivity value 0 194 with a smaller area 0 029 km2 in itacorubi node 6 has the lowest connectivity value with an area of 0 036 km2 while node 11 has the highest connectivity value 0 211 with also a smaller area 0 016 km2 this shows that the value of the connectivity is also the result of the spatial distribution of these nodes in the landscape influenced by the structural and functional aspects in the structural aspect the most critical nodes mainly those of connectivity values between 0 and 0 05 are more isolated occupying spaces distant from the other nodes in a functional aspect these nodes are located where urban use and roads predominate which makes difficult the movement of the species among habitats these issues occur in both mangrove landscapes of study in both ratones river and itacorubi the percentage of the habitat fragments has a similar proportion concerning their drainage basins area however the main characteristic that differentiates them is the kind of land use in the landscape ratones river has a 19 59 rural area and an 11 23 urban area the most critical nodes mainly those with values between 0 and 0 05 are related to the urban use on the other hand itacorubi is more urbanized in relation to land use with 36 43 urban and only 1 92 rural the distribution of the most critical nodes prevails mainly those of values between 0 and 0 05 in the most isolated habitat fragments and or near roads although mangroves of both landscapes are not included as most critical fragments of habitats due to their area extension and spatial structural and functional location the connection with nearby vegetation is crucial for the conservation of their ecosystem services therefore it is necessary to restore the most critical nodes and to maintain the least critical of appropriate laws according to the analysis of environmental protection laws in the most critical fragments of habitats in the ratones river 26 52 is protected 32 21 is partially protected and 41 27 is unprotected as for itacorubi 30 is protected 32 85 is partially protected and 37 15 is unprotected in the unprotected or partially protected areas of both landscapes environmental management should be considered for the protection of these fragments with active control likewise it is necessary to delimit other areas of environmental protection that facilitate the restoration of native vegetation creating an ecological connection between ecosystems and improving the mobility of the studied species across the entire mangrove landscape 4 conclusion the methodology developed in this article made possible to identify the most critical habitat fragments for the maintenance of the ecological connectivity of two mangrove landscapes in the municipality of florianópolis these landscapes were environmentally degraded by human use land uses for agriculture and urbanization in different proportions in the two cases have disrupted a connection of mangroves to each other and to the vegetation in their immediate surroundings preventing the movement of native species among their habitats in light of this situation this paper proposed to determine the ecological connectivity value of each habitat fragment using a combination of different connectivity metrics each metric belongs to the graph theory literature of probabilistic connection models adapted for studies of landscape ecology bunn et al 2000 saura and pascual hortal 2007 and urban and keitt 2001 among others employed these metrics in fragmented landscapes such those investigated in this work following the proposed methodology it was possible to identify the potential connections of the species of study between the fragments of habitat analyzed in section 3 the use of the species l longicaudis in this methodology is opportune since it is present in aquatic and terrestrial environments it also uses both mangroves and nearby vegetation as a habitat for survival as it is an endangered species this study can also be viewed as a guideline for its conservation furthermore it would be appropriate to complement with other species of differentiated dispersion characteristics in addition to aerial environment species for a better comparison although there are a variety of metrics that analyze different aspects of the landscape the construction of a unique metric by the combination of a set of metrics produces a more general connectivity result thus the final connectivity value does not have a bias towards a single metric additionally the normalization of the metrics between 0 and 1 allows a concise evaluation of the importance of each fragment of habitat from the least connected to the most connected the identification of the most critical habitats fragments made possible to analyze the structural and functional aspects of these landscapes resulting in an indicative to restore the most critical fragments and maintain the least critical for a continuity as a suggestion ecological connectivity should be considered one of the primary objectives to achieve with efficient urban planning measures aiming the defense of the environment and the conservation of ecosystem benefits acknowledgments the authors are grateful to conselho nacional de

in the world between 1980 and 2005 around 3 5 million hectares which implies a decrease of 20 of its surface associated with human activities fao 2007 kathiresan and bingham 2001 spalding et al 2010 brazilian mangroves account for 8 5 of total mangroves on the planet with approximately 13 000 km2 located along almost all the coast being the second country in extension of mangroves in the world spalding et al 2010 however there was a total decrease of approximately 40 from its original cover with a loss of 25 since the beginning of the 20th century icmbio 2017 the degradation began in the colonial period during the 16th century to obtain a pigment for an ink production rio de janeiro 2001 more recently the degradation is the result of the increase in urban population and changes in land use as an incentive to reverse the degradation of mangroves the scientific community has highlighted its ecosystem benefits from the global to the local scale as the mangroves are composed of arboreal or shrub species highly adapted to survive in the face of the effects of wind waves and water currents fao 2007 kathiresan and bingham 2001 they can attenuate the disturbances of climate changes due to their resistance and resilience alongi 2008 spalding et al 2010 the mangroves exert as natural damping systems in the floods saline intrusion and prevention of coastal erosion fao 2007 kathiresan and bingham 2001 also they function as biological filters by absorption nutrients and also toxins which favor the creation of fertile soils hogarth 2015 kathiresan and bingham 2001 spalding et al 2010 a large variety of terrestrial and marine fauna migrates to mangroves during specific periods and may even remain throughout their life cycle due to the abundance of food and because they are an optimal area for sheltering nagelkerken et al 2008 the mangroves are a vital area for ecological connectivity with other adjacent ecosystems thus this article aims to identify the most critical habitat fragments for the maintenance of the ecological connectivity of two mangrove landscapes ratones river and itacorubi located in the municipality of florianópolis in the south of brazil these landscapes are in different stages of degradation due to human use which causes a decrease and isolation of the mangroves among themselves and with the vegetation of their nearby surroundings and for native species from dispersing among their habitats these circumstances determine the importance of ecological connectivity as one of the primary objectives for the protection of the environment as it enhances its ecosystem services therefore a novel method was proposed based on the principles of landscape ecology to combine the different measures of the graph theory into a single value of ecological connectivity between 0 and 1 for each habitat fragment where 0 represents the least connected and 1 the most ecologically connected fragment in the landscape for the identification of the most critical fragments the study is based on the behavior of lontra longidaudis a threatened species of local fauna 2 methodology the scheme of fig 1 represents the research methodology plan using as a study base an endangered species of the local fauna this study analyses the ecological connectivity in the structural spatial characterization of the landscape and functional displacement of the studied species form for two mangrove landscapes in the municipality of florianópolis for this purpose this work employs a total of six connectivity metrics of the graph theory with probabilistic connection models these metrics rely on three parts nodes dispersion and links the nodes refer to the habitat fragments used by the species studied mangroves and dense vegetation of its near environment the dispersion is an attribute related to the displacement distance of the species the links are the least cost paths of displacement the combination of these parts provides the potential connections of the species among habitat fragments through the landscape permeability resistance to movement within the landscape this research uses the following cartographic data of the locality drainage basin epagri 2007 based on the analysis of the data of the cartographic base of santa catarina state at scales 1 50 000 and 1 100 000 land use map of municipal director plan pmf 2014 scale 1 10 000 typologies of vegetation klein 1978 scale 1 1 000 000 map of remaining vegetation sar 2005 scale 1 50 000 and the vegetation cover of the island of santa catarina 1978 caruso 1981 scale 1 50

arcgis 10 3 georeferenced with the projection system for wgs 1984 utm zone 22s and for the metrics conefor sensinode 2 6 and matlab r2016a from the results of the metrics combination a single ecological connectivity value for each node between 0 and 1 was obtained according to the proposed method it was possible to identify the most critical habitat fragments for the two case studies then they were analyzed structurally and functionally in the landscape relating them to the current environmental protection laws to maintain ecological connectivity 2 1 characterization of mangrove landscapes mangroves of the ratones river and itacorubi are at the southern limit with respect to areas with mangrove in the south american continent after this limit these peculiar landscapes disappear due to the low temperatures in the subtropical zone and also due to the presence of strong waves in the studied landscapes the development of mangroves is due to the protection of the north bay in the insular part of the municipality of florianópolis mangroves in this area are generally associated with coastal bays and lagoons cintron and schaeffer novelli 1981 they have a maritime fluvial character and are in the drainage basin of the ratones river and itacorubi the mangroves have the same name as their basin for this study the mangroves drainage basin delimits the analyzed landscapes with an area of 116 23 km2 for ratones river and 28 27 km2 for itacorubi they are located respectively at 27 34 52 566 s 48 31 0 241 w and 27 27 55 427 s 48 30 19 029 w fig 2 respectively the flora of both mangroves is composed of three species rhizophora mangle avicennia schaueriana and laguncularia racemosa with a remarkable degree of development despite its proximity to the latitudinal limit cintron and schaeffer novelli 1981 its fauna constitutes of invertebrates fishes birds reptiles and mammals in addition to microscopic organisms functioning as a transitional ecosystem for many terrestrial marine or freshwater species it communicates in its immediate environment with dense rainforest called tropical rainforest due to its characteristics related to tropical climate factors and high rainfall with high biological diversity and vertical stratification it also communicates with the restinga vegetation brazilian term which has a coastal characteristic with shrub and herbaceous structure in addition to the typologies of the mentioned vegetations there are also exotic forests of pinus spp and eucalyptus spp despite its rich biodiversity the loss and fragmentation of ecosystems is a problem in both case studies they are mainly due to the use of agriculture and urban development throughout history although with different stages of degradation in the ratones river the land use is mainly rural while in itacorubi it is predominantly urban especially in the flattest areas with the abandonment of agricultural practice in some localities the coverage of natural soil was partially restored this is why there is currently secondary vegetation in different stages of growth however different from the original vegetation this vegetation has low biodiversity due to its recent formation sevegnani and schroeder 2013 the indiscriminate and intensive use of land has been happening in previously preserved area without an efficient control over these occupations in previously preserved areas demonstrating a lack of compliance with the environmental laws fig 3 shows the most recent municipal environmental protection map from 2014 delineated for the ratones river and itacorubi basins although those laws are not sufficiently adequate for the management of natural spaces therefore this highlights the importance of identification of the most critical habitat fragments and helps the maintenance of the ecological connectivity in mangrove landscapes providing an alternative plan to restructure the local fauna and flora 2 2 specie of study for this study we focused the species lontra longicaudis of the mustelidae family which is included in the red list category of the iucn international union for conservation of nature and natural resources as near threatened rheingantz and trinca 2015 and the official list of endangered species of brazilian fauna ibama 1990 it is present in both aquatic and terrestrial environments according to olimpio 1990 mangroves in the locality are essential areas for the species as shelter and food but they are also present in the surrounding vegetation this species adapts to a wide variety of habitats and altitudes but it is sensitive to human interference gallo reynoso 1997 the displacement range of the species during the dry season is from 2 to 4 km and from 7 to 9 km in the rainy season gallo reynoso 1989 note that to measure dispersion there are differences among species or among the same species at different times resulting in different degrees of connectivity for the same landscape kindlmann and burel 2008 thus for the species of study a dispersion of 8 km was selected due to the occurrence of precipitation during all months of the year and the absence of a defined dry season in the municipality of florianópolis according to the köppen geiger classification peel et al 2007 2 3 potential connections in the landscape permeability the resistance to the movement of the species in a heterogeneous landscape defines the landscape permeability a low resistance denotes ease of movement and a high resistance a movement restriction zeller et al 2012 through a permeable landscape it is possible to identify potential connections which simulate the least cost pathways of the species to ensure ecological connectivity adriaensen et al 2003 chardon et al 2003 state that the incorporation of resistance in the landscape to measure the shortest distance between habitats provides better results than the euclidean distance geometric distance between two points these mentioned studies used environmentally degraded landscapes as the two mangrove landscapes of the municipality of florianópolis as shown in table 1 both landscapes are divided into categories according to their natural elements flora and rivers and anthropic elements land uses and roadways these categories determine the resistance values for the displacement of the studied species for each landscape category the mangrove is the primary habitat of the species of study and therefore has the minimum value of resistance the native vegetation in the immediate environment is divided according to its plant structure or planting regeneration stages dense vegetation low dense vegetation and herbaceous and or shrub vegetation both mangroves and dense vegetation have low resistance since they are the survival habitats of the species for the species of study the river is a connecting element having low resistance and roadways work as a connection impediment with high resistance value which varies according to the width and the speed traffic in the mangrove landscape of the ratones river with areas between 0 02 and 36 47 km2 totaling 65 41 km2 and 56 27 in the landscape the rest of the flora low dense vegetation shrub and or herbaceous vegetation and exotic vegetation represents 12 91 in the landscape rural use 19 59 and urban use 11 23 regarding itacorubi 20 fragments of habitats were identified between 0 015 and 6 64 km2 of the area totaling 16 06 km2 and 56 83 in the landscape the rest of the flora has a 4 82 the rural use a 1 92 and urban use a 36 43 in the landscape note that all landscape categories e g habitat fragments rural use urban use and others have been delineated based on cartographic data see the introduction of section 2 to identify the potential connections the landscape permeability map was initially originated through a gis software fig 4 a raster was generated through the weighted overlay tool of arcgis 10 3 where each pixel 5 m 5 m has a determined resistance value see table 1 these values are a result of a combination of two layers each one with a distinct weight the flora and the use of the soil have an influence weight of 60 and 40 for rivers and roadways implying an alteration of the impedance values of rivers and roads depending on their surround environment for example sections of a river close to urban development have higher impedance than other sections of the same river close to a vegetated area the dispersion of the species depends on these resistance values between the points of origin and destination located in the center of gravity of the habitat fragments from the landscape permeability map the potential connections between source and destination points were determined through the use of the cost distance cost back link and cost path connectivity tools of arcgis 10 3 which verify the path of minimum cost between habitats ratones river landscape generated 1171 potential connections between all points located in the center of gravity of the habitat fragments in the habitat fragment represented by point 31 due to the shape and large extension the center of gravity lies outside the boundary of the area the solution for this issue passed through the segmentation of the total area in three parts 31a 31b and 31c aiming a similar area as long the center of gravity is inside of the new sub segment finally itacorubi landscape generated 190 potential connections 2 4 connectivity metrics this paper considers different metrics of connectivity from the literature of graph theory in studies of landscape ecology and conservation biology graph theory models make use of a set of nodes and links the nodes represent the habitat fragments while the link indicates the potential capacity of an individual to disperse between the nodes galpern et al 2011 urban et al 2009 according to kindlmann and burel 2008 it is important to develop functional connectivity measures that add both the movement behavior of the species and the structure of the landscape the quantification of the ecological connectivity can be through binary or probabilistic connection models pascual hortal and saura 2006 saura and pascual hortal 2007 however in the binary model there is no measure of the potential dispersion between each node considering only whether they are connected or not depending only on the dispersion distance in the probabilistic model the connections are characterized by a probability of dispersion p ij between the nodes i and j having a more effective result in the landscape bunn et al 2000 saura and pascual hortal 2007 urban and keitt 2001 the present study reviews six metrics of probabilistic connection models considering the relationship between the nodes fragments of mangroves and dense vegetation of their near environment dispersion the distance of displacement of the species of study and links lower cost travel routes those metrics are widely used in the literature see saura and pascual hortal 2007 bunn et al 2000 urban and keitt 2001 among others the flux area weighted flux and probability of connectivity index metrics were calculated through the conefor sensinode 2 6 saura and torné 2009 the metrics influx potential outflux potential and metapopulation capacity were implemented and calculated using matlab r2016a the formulas used for each of the metrics mentioned are the following i flux f bunn et al 2000 urban and keitt 2001 1 f i 1 n j 1 j i n p ij ii area weighted flux awf bunn et al 2000 urban and keitt 2001 2 awf i 1 n j 1 j i n a i a j p ij iii probability of connectivity index pc saura and pascual hortal 2007 3 pc a l 2 i 1 n j 1 n a i a j p ij iv influx potential ip malvadkar et al 2015 4 ip i 1 n j 1 n p ij a j v outflux potential op malvadkar et al 2015 5 op i 1 n j 1 n p ij a i vi metapopulation capacity mc hanski and ovaskainen 2000 6 mc λ p max where a i and a j are the areas of the nodes i and j a l is the total area of the landscape p ij is the direct probability of dispersion between the nodes i and j p ij is the probability of the best path of all possible paths between i and j for example let p ij be equal to 0 6 p iq be equal to 0 8 and p jq be equal to 0 8 then p ij equals to the maximum likelihood of dispersion i e the best path from i to j is passing through q thus the resulting probability 0 8 0 8 0 64 is higher than p ij when two nodes are completely isolated p ij will be equal to 0 finally λ p max is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix p where p ij p ij and 0 for i j the probability of dispersion p ij is calculated as 7 p ij e k d ij where d ij is the distance between the nodes and k is a constant the value of k 0 038 was obtained using a dispersion probability of 5 for 8 km of dispersion the results of this analysis may vary depending on the metric selected each metric has weak and strong points making direct comparison difficult the metric f takes into account only the direct probability of dispersion awf considers the direct probability but weighted by the area of the two nodes pc takes into account the maximum likelihood of dispersion giving more importance to stepping stones saura and pascual hortal 2007 since it may comprise intermediary nodes to reach the final destination ip considers the probability next to the area of the target node the reverse of op which considers the probability next to the area of the source node finally mc captures the impact of ecological connectivity on the persistence of species metapopulation note that the pc metric has a range of total landscape connectivity between 0 and 1 where the value 1 is a landscape occupied by 100 of habitat and the other metrics between 0 and the importance of each fragment habitat was obtained by pascual hortal and saura 2006 saura and pascual hortal 2007 urban and keitt 2001 8 dx i 100 x x x where x is the result of connectivity metrics calculated for the landscape taking into account all landscape nodes and x is the value of the same metric calculated after exclusion of node i from the landscape for mc metric the importance of each node is measured according to the formula hanski and ovaskainen 2000 9 dmc i x i 2 λ p max where x is the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue λ p max although the dx values for all metrics have a minimum range of 0 the maximum in general has no bound thus this work proposes to normalize the indexes dx of each metric between 0 and 1 see eq 10 after that the average of the normalized indexes node by node is evaluated for the importance of each fragment of habitat see eq 11 10 dx j i dx j i min dx j max dx j min dx j 11 x i n m 1 j 1 n m dx j i where dx j i refers to the importance of node i for measure j and n m is the total number of metrics from the results obtained from eq 11 the nodes were normalized once more between 0 and 1 in the same fashion of eq 10 thus the ecological connectivity value of each habitat fragment is defined as being 0 to the least connected node and 1 to the most ecologically connected in the landscape 3 results and discussion according to the analysis of the results it is possible to verify that the order of the most connected habitat fragment to the least ecologically connected in the landscape is not dominated by any specific metric as mentioned before each metric has its guidelines for evaluating connectivity and the combination of them represents a synthesis of all the metrics for example in rio ratones the node considered to be the most connected relative to node 28 see fig 5 is also pointed by awf op and mc metrics in the f pc and ip metrics this same node represents the values 0 876 0 781 and 0 858 respectively as for itacorubi the most connected node node 18 see fig 5 is assigned by the metrics awf pc ip op however in the f and mc metrics this node represents the values 0 061 and 0 692 respectively from the value of the ecological connectivity of each habitat fragment through the combination of the metrics the most critical habitat fragments were identified in the two mangrove landscapes in a range between 0 and 1 less connected and more connected respectively the nodes were divided according to their value of ecological connectivity the most critical nodes were considered to be in the 25 of the lowest values critical those that are more than 25 and less or equal than 75 and less critical those that are more than 75 the division into ranges is always subjective and must be chosen according to what is most appropriate to the study subsequently the most critical nodes are structurally and functionally analyzed also the habitat fragments belong to three different categories according to their current environmental protection laws protected areas considered permanent preservation areas partially protected areas which are areas of preservation with limited use areas special urbanization areas and green leisure areas and areas without environmental protection see fig 5 in ratones river from a total of 47 nodes 43 are in the most critical region totaling 11 91 km2 of the 65 41 km2 of existing habitat fragments as for itacorubi of the 20 nodes 16 are in the most critical region with a total of 2 00 km2 of the 16 07 km2 of existing habitat fragments although 81 78 of the area of the habitat fragments of ratones river are in the less critical range 91 49 of the nodes are in the most critical interval the same proportion occurs in itacorubi where 87 56 of the area of the habitat fragments are in the less critical range and 80 of the nodes are in the most critical interval thus in general the reduced size of habitat area poses a significant risk to ecological connectivity nevertheless the ecological connectivity is not only influenced by the area among the most critical nodes in ratones river node 14 has the lowest connectivity value with an area of 0 12 km2 while node 32 has the highest connectivity value 0 194 with a smaller area 0 029 km2 in itacorubi node 6 has the lowest connectivity value with an area of 0 036 km2 while node 11 has the highest connectivity value 0 211 with also a smaller area 0 016 km2 this shows that the value of the connectivity is also the result of the spatial distribution of these nodes in the landscape influenced by the structural and functional aspects in the structural aspect the most critical nodes mainly those of connectivity values between 0 and 0 05 are more isolated occupying spaces distant from the other nodes in a functional aspect these nodes are located where urban use and roads predominate which makes difficult the movement of the species among habitats these issues occur in both mangrove landscapes of study in both ratones river and itacorubi the percentage of the habitat fragments has a similar proportion concerning their drainage basins area however the main characteristic that differentiates them is the kind of land use in the landscape ratones river has a 19 59 rural area and an 11 23 urban area the most critical nodes mainly those with values between 0 and 0 05 are related to the urban use on the other hand itacorubi is more urbanized in relation to land use with 36 43 urban and only 1 92 rural the distribution of the most critical nodes prevails mainly those of values between 0 and 0 05 in the most isolated habitat fragments and or near roads although mangroves of both landscapes are not included as most critical fragments of habitats due to their area extension and spatial structural and functional location the connection with nearby vegetation is crucial for the conservation of their ecosystem services therefore it is necessary to restore the most critical nodes and to maintain the least critical of appropriate laws according to the analysis of environmental protection laws in the most critical fragments of habitats in the ratones river 26 52 is protected 32 21 is partially protected and 41 27 is unprotected as for itacorubi 30 is protected 32 85 is partially protected and 37 15 is unprotected in the unprotected or partially protected areas of both landscapes environmental management should be considered for the protection of these fragments with active control likewise it is necessary to delimit other areas of environmental protection that facilitate the restoration of native vegetation creating an ecological connection between ecosystems and improving the mobility of the studied species across the entire mangrove landscape 4 conclusion the methodology developed in this article made possible to identify the most critical habitat fragments for the maintenance of the ecological connectivity of two mangrove landscapes in the municipality of florianópolis these landscapes were environmentally degraded by human use land uses for agriculture and urbanization in different proportions in the two cases have disrupted a connection of mangroves to each other and to the vegetation in their immediate surroundings preventing the movement of native species among their habitats in light of this situation this paper proposed to determine the ecological connectivity value of each habitat fragment using a combination of different connectivity metrics each metric belongs to the graph theory literature of probabilistic connection models adapted for studies of landscape ecology bunn et al 2000 saura and pascual hortal 2007 and urban and keitt 2001 among others employed these metrics in fragmented landscapes such those investigated in this work following the proposed methodology it was possible to identify the potential connections of the species of study between the fragments of habitat analyzed in section 3 the use of the species l longicaudis in this methodology is opportune since it is present in aquatic and terrestrial environments it also uses both mangroves and nearby vegetation as a habitat for survival as it is an endangered species this study can also be viewed as a guideline for its conservation furthermore it would be appropriate to complement with other species of differentiated dispersion characteristics in addition to aerial environment species for a better comparison although there are a variety of metrics that analyze different aspects of the landscape the construction of a unique metric by the combination of a set of metrics produces a more general connectivity result thus the final connectivity value does not have a bias towards a single metric additionally the normalization of the metrics between 0 and 1 allows a concise evaluation of the importance of each fragment of habitat from the least connected to the most connected the identification of the most critical habitats fragments made possible to analyze the structural and functional aspects of these landscapes resulting in an indicative to restore the most critical fragments and maintain the least critical for a continuity as a suggestion ecological connectivity should be considered one of the primary objectives to achieve with efficient urban planning measures aiming the defense of the environment and the conservation of ecosystem benefits acknowledgments the authors are grateful to conselho nacional de

25238,to quantify the rate at which wildlife die from anthropogenic sources like wind farms and poisoning one may look for the carcasses the number of detected carcasses or the absence of carcasses however needs to be corrected for imperfect detection and early removal by scavengers to perform this correction there exist more than a dozen open variants of the lincoln petersen closed population capture recapture estimator these different variants typically yield very different results because they are based on different assumptions that end users do not always consider i conduct a simulation study highlighting severe biases in lincoln petersen type estimators when their assumptions are violated recent attempts to relax these assumptions within the closed population capture recapture paradigm involve increasingly complex analysis yet the resulting modified estimators still apply to restricted settings only by contrast there is an abundant literature about flexible process based open population capture recapture models and how to fit them to survey data using numerical likelihood optimization my simulations illustrate the good performance of this approach in the presence of complex sources of bias for moderate sample sizes i review existing guidelines to deal with sparser datasets as a perspective i use the example of bird mortality estimation in wind farms to argue that the lack of methodological consensus can set the stage for evidence complacency biostatisticians should strive to avoid the proliferation of alternative methods and instead work towards increasingly general and unified frameworks keywords sustainability population size population dynamics monitoring wind power wind turbine collision incidental take 1 introduction energy suppliers increasingly turn to wind energy as a way to curb carbon dioxide emission however whether the low carbon dioxide emission always and everywhere justifies the environmental impact of wind energy is still debated partly because we lack adequate data and methodologies to address imperfections in available data devine wright 2005 kunz et al 2007 loss et al 2014 for example in france less than 5 of the impact assessments conducted in the last 20 years followed a full before after control impact protocol marx 2017 as a result these reports give a partial view of the impacts and are difficult to compare to

table 1 wind farm operators are typically required to perform standardized carcass surveys the data resulting from these surveys need to be corrected for variation in nuisance parameters imperfect detection of carcasses and early removal by scavengers more than a dozen methods are currently available to perform this correction i first review the principles of the different methods their underlying assumptions about the processes at stake and their range of application second i conduct a simulation study to compare the performance of different methods in a range of scenarios third i discuss the managerial implications of the proliferation of methods invoking recent debates about evidence complacency 2 material and methods 2 1 schematic overview a process based model of carcass surveys in most cases field technicians conduct a series of systematic surveys separated by unmonitored intervals between surveys the problem at hand can then be reformulated into an open population capture recapture problem cormack 1964 jolly 1965 seber 1965 i e a hierarchical hidden markov chain model with an observation process detection during the sampling occasions and a state process entry of new carcasses and disappearance of old ones during the intervals between sampling occasions fig 1 the main difference with usual capture recapture problems is that carcasses cannot be released back into the population first because they are motionless and second because in many cases the field technicians are required to remove the carcasses upon detection for this reason trial experiments are conducted in addition to the carcass searches detection trial experiments consist in planting carcasses or surrogate carcasses at locations unknown to the field technicians and letting them record whether they detect them persistence trial experiments consist in monitoring the fate of planted carcasses and recording how long they persist 2 2 variations around the lincoln petersen estimator noting n t the instantaneous population size number of carcasses on the ground at any point in time and neglecting the time required to systematically search the area for carcasses the lincoln petersen estimator williams et al 2002 is n ˆ t c p ˆ where c is the number of individual carcasses detected and p is the probability to detect a carcass in basic capture recapture applications p is estimated by drawing k individuals marking and releasing them in the population and eventually drawing another sample of which k will be marked the estimator for p is then p ˆ k k in applications to carcass search data p is estimated using the detection trial experiment as described in the previous section the lincoln petersen estimator provides a snapshot of the instantaneous population size however managers have little interest in the instantaneous population size because of the open population nature of the problem at any given time some of the carcasses currently in the population may be too old therefore not relevant to the time period of interest while some of the carcasses may have disappeared already fig 1 in an open capture recapture problem the parameter of interest is indeed the size of the superpopulation sensu schwarz and arnason 1996 that is the overall number of carcasses that entered the population between the start t 0 and end t t of the study denoted n without subscript fig 1 to get n we need to complexify the capture recapture model in order to incorporate the processes in fig 1 in the context of carcass surveys many variations of the lincoln petersen estimator have been proposed to try and adapt that estimator for an open population their principle is to multiply p by a term that also accommodates the persistence process in general these estimators mostly focus on the bias caused by the early removal of carcasses by scavengers and decay only the most recent estimators also consider the possibility that carcasses persist undetected for long periods of time bleed through sensu wolpert 2015 the winkelman estimator winkelman 1992 assumes that all fatalities occur at time 0 that no carcass was pre existing before time 0 and that a single search is performed at time t the estimator is then n ˆ c p ˆ φ ˆ where φ is the probability for a carcass to persist from time 0 to time i and c is the number of detected carcasses at time i the jones estimator jones et al 2009 replaces the φ ˆ of the winkelman estimator by e 0 5 i t where t is the average time to removal and i is the interval duration by doing so they assume that time to removal is exponentially distributed the 0 5 multiplication factor is an attempt at removing some of the bias caused by the violation of the assumption that all fatalities occur at the beginning of the interval jones et al also recommend multiplying the denominator by a m i n 1 log 0 01 t i term designed to avoid over corrections when the interval duration far exceeds the expected persistence time the huso estimator huso 2011 replaces the φ of the winkelman estimator by the integral of the instantaneous removal rate between 0 and i if time to removal is assumed to be exponentially distributed this yields φ ˆ t i 1 e i t which is the formula contractors have been using following huso 2011 i also applied the m i n 1 log 0 01 t i correction term when computing the huso estimator the erickson estimator erickson et al 1998 replaces the φ ˆ of the winkelman estimator by the ratio between the expected time to removal and the interval duration n ˆ c p ˆ t i this estimator comes from the steady state solution to a differential equation shoenfeld 2004 as explained by shoenfeld 2004 one assumes that the search effort is constant through time instead of discrete as assumed by other estimators that times to removal are exponentially distributed and that the model parameters have remained constant for a long time the korner nievergelt kn estimator korner nievergelt et al 2011 acknowledges the serial nature of carcass search data i e that the same locations are searched multiple times cf fig 1 korner nievergelt et al 2015 are particularly concerned about the bias caused by detection heterogeneity i e some carcasses are easier to detect and remove than others to treat this source of bias they also addressed the issue of the undetected persistence of carcasses over many search occasions they proposed several variants of the 2011 estimator in the following i used 1 φ φ 1 i 1 φ 1 i t i i 1 t t n i 1 p φ n i as the kn persistence correction term that term replaces the φ of the winkelman estimator the wolpert estimator wolpert 2015 generalizes the kn estimator by allowing for weibull age variation in persistence probability i e a fast increase in removal probability as the carcass ages so like the kn estimator the bleed through of carcasses that persist undetected for more than one sampling occasion is accounted for however wolpert 2015 does not make explicit the link between his bleed through parameter b and the time to removal the inner workings of the wolpert estimator are quite complex with multiple recursions back in time and multiple integrals unfortunately the acmer r package that implements the approach is not fully operational yet so i could not include this estimator in my simulation study more than half a dozen other variants of the lincoln petersen estimator have been proposed reviewed by bernardino et al 2013 for the sake of simplicity i only considered the above five considering that other variants occupied intermediate positions between these five 2 3 open population capture recapture models in all the other fields of application of capture recapture concepts to deal with open population problems we have long used models that incorporate the processes of gains and losses in the focal population cormack 1964 jolly 1965 seber 1965 these models constitute the basis for modern hidden markov chain modelling i e a major segment of biostatistics however unlike closed population problems open population capture recapture problems do not have a straightforward analytical solution especially if we concern ourselves with age time and individual variation as exemplified by the complex computations in wolpert 2015 furthermore adding or removing model features would entail a full rework of the analytical solution meaning that the framework is not really flexible for these reasons modern capture recapture efforts are almost entirely based on numerical parameter estimation that is finding the parameter values that maximize the model likelihood given the data a range of frequentist and bayesian methods are available to find the maximum likelihood carcass data are however slightly different from typical capture recapture data because carcasses are not mobile the data come in three separate components the carcass survey data the detection trial data and the persistence trial data these three components can be analyzed jointly using the same hierarchical capture recapture model péron et al 2013 alternatively one may fix the persistence and detection rates to known values and analyze only the carcass search data etterson 2013 in the latter case careful attention should be taken 1 that the sampling uncertainty of the persistence and detection rates is carried over e g using a parametric bootstrap and 2 that the experiments that yielded these estimates were conducted in conditions comparable to those of the carcass searches same environment same season etc the carrying over of sampling uncertainty is especially important if the focus is on estimating the probability that at least one individual was taken cf dealing with sparse datasets in the discussion section importantly an open capture recapture model tailored to a series of t sampling occasions would feature t 1 parameters to represent the temporal variation in the rate of entry of new carcasses i e temporal variation in collision rate if the data were too sparse to support the full time variation in the rate of entry of new carcasses one would simplify the model the typical solution is to assume a constant rate of entry β i i i j i j is the probability that a carcass of the superpopulation will become available for detection during interval i of length i i this would remove t 1 parameters from the list of parameters to estimate alternatively if there is a mode one may describe the temporal variation in the rate of new entries using 2 4 parameters e g gaussian distribution raised cosine distribution sinh arcsinh distribution péron et al 2014 contrary to the claims of huso et al 2015b 2016 there are therefore no more identifiability issues with the open population approach than with lincoln petersen approaches further points of discussion regarding the applicability of the open population maximum likelihood approach pertain to some of the proposed extensions of the base model péron and hines 2014 recommended categorizing carcasses into two stages representing age classes e g fresh and dry but their routine also applies if there is no information about the carcass stage a full age specific variant where the age of the carcass is inferred after detection by way of model fitting was also proposed by péron et al 2013 at the time this approach was deemed too computer intensive and sensitive to convergence issues local minima in the model likelihood for practical implementation but i reprise the full age specific variant here as a side note if using forensic methods the time since death could be determined with precision in the field upon detection specific algorithms could be employed that yield a better precision of the final estimate péron et al 2014 péron et al 2013 and etterson 2013 also recommended leaving the detected carcasses on the ground and have a separate team perform trial experiments on them this recommendation has been used to criticize the open population approach and deem it impossible to implement because for legal and other reasons carcasses often need to be removed upon detection but the open population approach still performs if the carcasses are removed upon detection provided an adequate number of externally obtained carcasses are brought in for the trial experiments three irreducible caveats however apply to both the open population and lincoln petersen approaches 1 if not using the naturally occurring carcasses in the trial experiments the externally obtained surrogate carcasses may not have the same properties as the naturally occurring ones 2 the surrogate carcasses may influence the behavior of scavengers e g attract them so that they eventually find the naturally occurring ones or on the contrary feed them enough that they neglect the naturally occurring ones 3 some of the fatalities may not be detectible using carcass searches because the animal was only wounded and died elsewhere crippling loss in summary the literature contains two approaches to infer mortality from carcass survey data one approach uses an estimator developed for closed populations and attempts various modifications in many cases ad hoc to deal with the open population nature of the problem the other approach recognizes the open population problem from the outset and develops a process based modeling framework drawing from methodologies that have been used for this purpose for over 50 years 2 4 post hoc correction for early removals in the open population approach the focal parameter is the size of the superpopulation of carcasses that are available for detection during at least one of the sampling occasions however some carcasses are removed during the same interval as they first appear these carcasses do not enter the superpopulation sensu schwarz and arnason 1996 therefore we need to account for the process of early removal after having fitted the open population model by manipulating the parameter estimates under some assumption about the distribution of early removals within each time interval i e did early removals occur more or less early in the interval or were they uniformly distributed péron et al 2013 schwarz and arnason 1996 the resulting quantity is denoted n in the r package fatalitycmr péron and hines 2014 2 5 post hoc area correction whatever the type of analysis the final estimator needs to be extrapolated from the survey area to the area of reference huso et al 2015b offered an excellent review of the aspects to consider when performing this extrapolation the search radius may be smaller than the distance at which carcasses may be projected by the turbine blades hull and muir 2010 a fraction of the search area may not be searchable at all because of vegetation or terrain one may want to extrapolate from a small sample of monitored turbines to the whole wind farm however contra huso et al 2015b i do not recommend performing a post hoc correction for spatial variation in searchability within the search area other than for parts of the search area that were not monitored at all environmental factors that influence detection probability within the search area should be incorporated when estimating detection probability 2 6 simulation study i simulated series of t 6 sampling occasions separated by constant time intervals i hereafter describe the persistence process in terms of the probability for an undetected carcass to persist on the ground for one full time interval i e the time unit is one interval i considered two scenarios of persistence probability in scenario persistence1 the persistence probability increased between the first and second intervals then plateaued for three intervals and eventually dropped at a faster pace than linear this scenario was designed to emulate the preferential removal of easy to detect carcasses during the first interval korner nievergelt et al 2015 followed by a super exponential ageing process bispo et al 2013 wolpert 2015 in scenario persistence2 the persistence probability initially dropped and then increased this scenario was designed to emulate persistence in a dry environment where carcasses that escape scavengers in the first few intervals become mummified in all scenarios detection probability at each sampling occasion was constant through time taking value 0 1 0 5 or 0 8 depending on scenario the rate of entry of new carcasses was also constant throughout the simulated study period meaning that β i 1 t in the simulations once detected the carcasses were left on the ground and used in trial experiments an additional 25 or 50 carcasses were brought in and planted throughout the survey area immediately after the first sampling occasion these carcasses were used in the trial experiments along with the detected ones from the collisions i computed the average bias and root mean squared error rmse over 100 simulations per scenario minus the simulations that yielded zero detected carcasses up to 40 of cases in some scenarios surveys that yield zero detections cannot be handled using either the maximum likelihood approach péron et al 2013 or the lincoln petersen approach huso et al 2015a i review how to deal with sparse datasets within the constraints of the process described in fig 1 in the discussion i also computed the bias of the composite estimator obtained by averaging the winkelman erickson jones and huso estimators this composite estimator appears to be increasingly used in operator reports 3 results the open population maximum likelihood approach performed best yielding the smallest bias and smallest rmse fig 2 this result was expected since i fit the exact same model that was used to generate the data the winkelman estimator exhibited a severe positive bias fig 2 meaning overestimation of collision rate due to the violation of its unrealistic assumptions regarding the rate of entry of new carcasses the erickson estimator was severely negatively biased probably because the assumption of constant search effort was violated and because the simulation was short meaning the system was not in its steady state yet the jones and huso estimators over estimated the number of fatalities fig 2 as expected because they do not account for the possibility that carcasses persist undetected over more than one sampling occasion the korner nievergelt kn estimator was only slightly biased in the scenario persistence1 fig 2 but changing the shape of the persistence age relationship led to major bias in this estimator fig s1 rmse yielded the same conclusions about the relative performance of the estimators figs s2 and s3 the bias of the composite estimator obtained by averaging the winkelman erickson jones and huso estimators was moderate when detection probability was high bias of 18 to 1 for detection probability of 0 8 fig s4 but quickly increased when detection probability was low 50 bias for detection probability of 0 1 fig s4 the relatively good performance of the composite estimator for high detection probability is explained by the fact that in these specific conditions the biases of the winkelman and erickson estimators seemed to compensate each other fig 2 importantly the performance of all the approaches including the open population maximum likelihood approach declined when detection probability decreased and when the number of carcasses available for detection decreased this well known issue is further discussed by huso et al 2015a and under dealing with sparse datasets in the discussion section 4 discussion that the open population maximum likelihood approach was the least biased and most precise when applied to datasets simulated using an open population capture recapture model was not surprising however the magnitude of the bias in the other estimators is a cause of concern as far as i can judge end users of the lincoln petersen estimators never test hypotheses about sources of bias and furthermore the lincoln petersen type estimators are not really flexible i e cannot be adapted if a source of bias is suspected consequently the results of a lincoln petersen estimator are likely to be considered final despite the potential violation of their assumptions by contrast end users of the maximum likelihood approach have a culture of goodness of fit testing and model selection within the information theoretic framework akaike information criterion meaning that it is straightforward to test for the occurrence of sources of bias and account for them in the model the main message of this study is that open population maximum likelihood approaches do not require more data than lincoln petersen approaches yet they allow more flexibility should more data be available the lincoln petersen approaches represent attempts to find analytical solutions to capture recapture problems that are best tackled with models developed to mimic the data generating processes usually requiring numerical optimization the choice of an appropriate estimator can have major operational implications when operators are required to provision a mitigation fund in proportion to their estimated take administrations are likely to set the official cost of a bird life at a value that maintains the overall envelope within economically sustainable bounds over estimating the rate of collision can thus lead to devaluate the official cost of a bird life similarly when agencies use the estimated probability that a rare species was taken to trigger specific measures if that probability is overestimated actual collision will rarely be witnessed in the wind farms that were affected by precautionary measures and operators are likely to become increasingly less compliant on the opposite the risk of under estimating the take are obvious in terms of sustainability especially for long lived species like raptors whose population viability is very sensitive to even small changes in adult survival probability mertz 1971 4 1 dealing with sparse datasets mortality estimation from carcass surveys stands out from other capture recapture applications because the data are typically sparse etterson 2013 huso et al 2015a few carcasses of protected species are ever detected in one focal wind project which does not mean that the cumulative impact of the wind projects over the range of these protected species is negligible nor that the wind farms comply with their legal requirements however as emphasized by huso et al 2015a and confirmed in this study neither the lincoln petersen approaches nor the open population maximum likelihood approaches work when the number of detected carcasses is small or zero in the case of the lincoln petersen approaches this is because the sampling variance of the estimators contains a 1 c 2 term meaning that the sampling variance of the estimate diverges towards the infinite as c declines while the estimate itself is by construction zero when c is zero in the open population maximum likelihood approach the estimator is also zero when c is zero and furthermore there are numerical instabilities when the model parameters tend towards zero and identifiability issues such as the inability to distinguish between the binomial and poisson distributions in small samples barker et al 2017 either way following huso et al 2015a and péron and hines 2014 when few carcasses have been detected i recommend using the evidence of absence approach huso et al 2015a promote a bayesian approach designed to combine existing data with new data as they become available under the assumption that the number of fatalities varies from year to year in a predictable manner in the absence of a priori beliefs about the number of fatalities a frequentist approach can also be employed one then only needs to compute the probability not to observe a carcass that was part of the superpopulation denoted here p 0 1 to match bayesian notation the ad hoc estimate for the superpopulation size would then be n eq 1 a parametric bootstrap can be used to compute the confidence interval of n and the probability that n is above a given administrative threshold péron and hines 2014 1 n c n 0 n c c n p 0 1 n 1 p 0 1 c averaging across possible entry dates p 0 1 should be computed as eq 2 2 p 0 1 x 0 β 0 j 0 x φ j d 1 t 1 j 1 d 1 φ x j 1 1 φ x d 1 j 1 d 1 p x j 1 j 1 t 1 φ x j 1 j 1 t 1 p x j 1 i 2 t β i d i t 1 j i d 1 φ j i 1 φ d i j i d 1 p j i j i t 1 φ j i j i t 1 p j i eq 2 represents the sum over possible ages of the probability not to record a carcass of that age weighed by the probability that the carcass is of that age φ a and p a respectively denote the probability of persistence up to age a and the probability to be detected when of age a the β i denote the rate of entry of new carcasses in the case of sparse data there is not enough information to document these β i parameters one must therefore make some assumptions and assign arbitrary values to them several options are considered in the r package fatalitycmr péron and hines 2014 an alternative is to compute p 0 1 as one minus the sum of the probabilities to record a carcass of known age sometimes referred to as the jolly s χ approach jolly 1965 this alternative is somewhat faster especially when age effects are discarded and features in the r package fatalitycmr importantly g 1 p 0 1 is the denominator that one might use in a lincoln petersen estimator and corresponds to the g of huso et al 2015a 4 2 data requirements the basic data requirements for the open population maximum likelihood approach do not differ from those of the lincoln petersen estimators meaning that the maximum likelihood approach or its sparse data approximation previous section can be applied without modifying standard data collection protocols however the maximum likelihood approach also makes it possible to collect and analyze more than what is typically done i list below some of the new features that could be included in field protocols in order to harvest some additional benefits 1 age classes in the fatalitycmr r package we offered the option to separate fresh and dry carcasses in the search data and in the trial experiments this represents a minimal modification of the search protocol field technicians simply visually assess the state of the carcasses upon detection the trial experiments would however need to be stratified by age class 2 time since carcass placement some operators only report aggregated data such as k out of k planted carcasses were detected on occasion x i recommend following the warren hicks data format warren hicks et al 2013 which stores the full information about the time since carcass placement therefore allowing age effects to be modelled at the data analysis stage an issue to keep in mind however is that if using naturally occurring carcasses time since initial detection is not the same as time since death requiring the adequate modeling of carcass age péron et al 2014 2013 3 forensic determination of time since death for select species of high patrimonial value it might be cost effective to precisely determine the time since death when the carcasses are discovered using this information a different brand of open capture recapture model can be fit péron et al 2014 which is likely to improve precision and bias of the estimates 4 using detected carcasses in trial experiments in most cases detected carcasses are removed upon detection there are legal requirements in some cases preventing holding on to the corpses of protected species health hazards for project employees could also be invoked if carcasses are really numerous or involve particular disease carrying species for bats and maybe passerines carcasses may have to be removed and stored for later examination and determination of the species some operators also argue that carcasses attract scavengers and therefore need to be removed to reduce scavenger bias because detected carcasses are removed the trial experiments are then performed using externally obtained surrogate carcasses as previously mentioned relying on surrogate carcasses may introduce a bias if the persistence and detection probability of these carcasses is different from those of carcasses stemming from actual collision leaving carcasses where found and using a double observer protocol etterson 2013 to include these naturally occurring carcasses in trial experiments would avoid these bias and at the minimum it would increase the sample size of the trial experiments at little cost the main issue is that the time since death must be inferred because the carcasses are detected possibly long after death but there are models for this péron et al 2013 which i used in this study 5 record environmental covariates and do not pool species arbitrarily although the effect of environmental features and species characteristics on detection probability and persistence time is intuitive and acknowledged by most authors in practice operators rarely record and account for environmental factors and they sometimes pool species together in improper categories e g passerines and bats all birds together etc 4 3 recommendations for agency level management 1 central database of trial experiment results as far as i know efforts to pool the results of the trial experiments are in an infancy stage wind project developers could draw from the accumulated data to complement their own smaller projects could pay to access a database of experimental results instead of conducting their own small scale separate experiments this would also allow further research into spatial and temporal variation in bias and mortality 2 scientific peer review the fact that two of the early estimators which are still widely in use today were never published in peer reviewed academic journals is quite exceptional for the field from this non reviewed basis a community of researchers and practitioners with a vested interest in fatality estimation evolved and seems to have somewhat diverged from the rest of the wildlife biology and biostatistics communities this possibly explains the late recognition of the congruence with capture recapture modeling the term lincoln petersen estimator was for example until now completely absent from the fatality estimation literature 4 4 are methodological debates delaying the uptake of major evidence this section uses the example of fatality estimation to discuss the notion that when biostatisticians and conservation biologists fail to reach a timely consensus about peripheral issues other stakeholders may have the opportunity to ignore all evidence including the evidence that the research community agrees upon ezrahi 1990 and latour and woolgar 1979 already warned that modern societies tend to discount any science that does not confirm dominant world views cognitive dissonances between scientific evidence and perception based constructions prevent of slows down the uptake of new science especially if these perceptions are socially validated or if compliance to old beliefs generates a social benefit kool et al 2010 wind energy is overall perceived as good for society devine wright 2005 even if people do not desire the turbines themselves in their backyard devine wright 2005 yet the wind farms are actually not environmental friendly arnett et al 2016 erickson et al 2014 loss et al 2014 this cognitive dissonance sets the stage for evidence complacency sensu sutherland and wordley 2017 that is the selective and delayed uptake of available scientific evidence by decision makers decision makers can choose to promote the greenhouse gas emission reduction aspect and discount the harmful to wildlife aspect the first reason that the evidence complacency strategy might be attractive is that even if decision makers are willing and able to obtain enough scientific evidence to inform their decision relying on scientific evidence might divert power and influence towards those who provide evidence sutherland and wordley 2017 for example post construction monitoring may be perceived as a challenge to the administrative and judiciary authorities that delivered the construction permit often against strong local opposition the second reason is that scientific evidence comes with a quantified uncertainty e g p value thus when decision makers use scientific evidence as part of their process they publicly take the risk that the evidence backing the decision was wrong even if the whole purpose of the evidence based approach is to quantify and minimize that risk nichols and williams 2006 runge 2011 the mere acknowledgement that the decision maker willingly takes a risk constitutes a political liability stewart 2002 because uncertainty is explicit evidence based decision processes can also expose decision makers to legal challenges ruhl and fischman 2010 that a more opaque non quantitative decision process would probably avoid this aversion for uncertainty would operate on top of the logistical and financial burden of the evidence based approach overall leading managers to prefer more qualitative and experience based approaches to decision support pullin et al 2004 my point is that by failing to reach a timely consensus on how to best assess the environmental impact of wind farms biostatisticians and conservation biologists have artificially exaggerated the scientific uncertainty surrounding the impact of wind farms on wildlife and as a consequence the evidence complacency strategy could strive evidence that it was the case include the construction of wind farms in major raptor concentration areas in spain until 2006 atienza et al 2014 the delay between general industrial risk regulation and wildlife specific regulation in france law 2003 590 vs aug 26 2011 orders and the overall conservative adaptive management approach developed by the usa even after the infamous altamont scandal i am of course not advocating that debates should not occur among conservation biology and biostatistics circles but i question the benefits of having them occur in print the problem partly ensues from the broader scale social transformation of academia which has seen the individual value of each printed publication decrease bornmann and mutz 2015 vostal 2016 debates that used to occur among experts in restricted access arenas are now exposed in series of publications that criticize each other in that context increasing communication about data sutherland and wordley 2017 and co constructing scientific evidence with decision makers jasanoff 2004 can be double edged if it also increase the exposure of internal debates that uninformed readers may perceive as challenging the relevance of the evidence presented conservation biologists and biostatisticians should strive to present a united front about the core notions they agree about appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online

25238,to quantify the rate at which wildlife die from anthropogenic sources like wind farms and poisoning one may look for the carcasses the number of detected carcasses or the absence of carcasses however needs to be corrected for imperfect detection and early removal by scavengers to perform this correction there exist more than a dozen open variants of the lincoln petersen closed population capture recapture estimator these different variants typically yield very different results because they are based on different assumptions that end users do not always consider i conduct a simulation study highlighting severe biases in lincoln petersen type estimators when their assumptions are violated recent attempts to relax these assumptions within the closed population capture recapture paradigm involve increasingly complex analysis yet the resulting modified estimators still apply to restricted settings only by contrast there is an abundant literature about flexible process based open population capture recapture models and how to fit them to survey data using numerical likelihood optimization my simulations illustrate the good performance of this approach in the presence of complex sources of bias for moderate sample sizes i review existing guidelines to deal with sparser datasets as a perspective i use the example of bird mortality estimation in wind farms to argue that the lack of methodological consensus can set the stage for evidence complacency biostatisticians should strive to avoid the proliferation of alternative methods and instead work towards increasingly general and unified frameworks keywords sustainability population size population dynamics monitoring wind power wind turbine collision incidental take 1 introduction energy suppliers increasingly turn to wind energy as a way to curb carbon dioxide emission however whether the low carbon dioxide emission always and everywhere justifies the environmental impact of wind energy is still debated partly because we lack adequate data and methodologies to address imperfections in available data devine wright 2005 kunz et al 2007 loss et al 2014 for example in france less than 5 of the impact assessments conducted in the last 20 years followed a full before after control impact protocol marx 2017 as a result these reports give a partial view of the impacts and are difficult to compare to each other one of the major environmental impacts of wind energy is collisions of flying wildlife including protected species with wind turbines arnett et al 2016 erickson et al 2014 loss et al 2014 table 1 wind farm operators are typically required to perform standardized carcass surveys the data resulting from these surveys need to be corrected for variation in nuisance parameters imperfect detection of carcasses and early removal by scavengers more than a dozen methods are currently available to perform this correction i first review the principles of the different methods their underlying assumptions about the processes at stake and their range of application second i conduct a simulation study to compare the performance of different methods in a range of scenarios third i discuss the managerial implications of the proliferation of methods invoking recent debates about evidence complacency 2 material and methods 2 1 schematic overview a process based model of carcass surveys in most cases field technicians conduct a series of systematic surveys separated by unmonitored intervals between surveys the problem at hand can then be reformulated into an open population capture recapture problem cormack 1964 jolly 1965 seber 1965 i e a hierarchical hidden markov chain model with an observation process detection during the sampling occasions and a state process entry of new carcasses and disappearance of old ones during the intervals between sampling occasions fig 1 the main difference with usual capture recapture problems is that carcasses cannot be released back into the population first because they are motionless and second because in many cases the field technicians are required to remove the carcasses upon detection for this reason trial experiments are conducted in addition to the carcass searches detection trial experiments consist in planting carcasses or surrogate carcasses at locations unknown to the field technicians and letting them record whether they detect them persistence trial experiments consist in monitoring the fate of planted carcasses and recording how long they persist 2 2 variations around the lincoln petersen estimator noting n t the instantaneous population size number of carcasses on the ground at any point in time and neglecting the time required to systematically search the area for carcasses the lincoln petersen estimator williams et al 2002 is n ˆ t c p ˆ where c is the number of individual carcasses detected and p is the probability to detect a carcass in basic capture recapture applications p is estimated by drawing k individuals marking and releasing them in the population and eventually drawing another sample of which k will be marked the estimator for p is then p ˆ k k in applications to carcass search data p is estimated using the detection trial experiment as described in the previous section the lincoln petersen estimator provides a snapshot of the instantaneous population size however managers have little interest in the instantaneous population size because of the open population nature of the problem at any given time some of the carcasses currently in the population may be too old therefore not relevant to the time period of interest while some of the carcasses may have disappeared already fig 1 in an open capture recapture problem the parameter of interest is indeed the size of the superpopulation sensu schwarz and arnason 1996 that is the overall number of carcasses that entered the population between the start t 0 and end t t of the study denoted n without subscript fig 1 to get n we need to complexify the capture recapture model in order to incorporate the processes in fig 1 in the context of carcass surveys many variations of the lincoln petersen estimator have been proposed to try and adapt that estimator for an open population their principle is to multiply p by a term that also accommodates the persistence process in general these estimators mostly focus on the bias caused by the early removal of carcasses by scavengers and decay only the most recent estimators also consider the possibility that carcasses persist undetected for long periods of time bleed through sensu wolpert 2015 the winkelman estimator winkelman 1992 assumes that all fatalities occur at time 0 that no carcass was pre existing before time 0 and that a single search is performed at time t the estimator is then n ˆ c p ˆ φ ˆ where φ is the probability for a carcass to persist from time 0 to time i and c is the number of detected carcasses at time i the jones estimator jones et al 2009 replaces the φ ˆ of the winkelman estimator by e 0 5 i t where t is the average time to removal and i is the interval duration by doing so they assume that time to removal is exponentially distributed the 0 5 multiplication factor is an attempt at removing some of the bias caused by the violation of the assumption that all fatalities occur at the beginning of the interval jones et al also recommend multiplying the denominator by a m i n 1 log 0 01 t i term designed to avoid over corrections when the interval duration far exceeds the expected persistence time the huso estimator huso 2011 replaces the φ of the winkelman estimator by the integral of the instantaneous removal rate between 0 and i if time to removal is assumed to be exponentially distributed this yields φ ˆ t i 1 e i t which is the formula contractors have been using following huso 2011 i also applied the m i n 1 log 0 01 t i correction term when computing the huso estimator the erickson estimator erickson et al 1998 replaces the φ ˆ of the winkelman estimator by the ratio between the expected time to removal and the interval duration n ˆ c p ˆ t i this estimator comes from the steady state solution to a differential equation shoenfeld 2004 as explained by shoenfeld 2004 one assumes that the search effort is constant through time instead of discrete as assumed by other estimators that times to removal are exponentially distributed and that the model parameters have remained constant for a long time the korner nievergelt kn estimator korner nievergelt et al 2011 acknowledges the serial nature of carcass search data i e that the same locations are searched multiple times cf fig 1 korner nievergelt et al 2015 are particularly concerned about the bias caused by detection heterogeneity i e some carcasses are easier to detect and remove than others to treat this source of bias they also addressed the issue of the undetected persistence of carcasses over many search occasions they proposed several variants of the 2011 estimator in the following i used 1 φ φ 1 i 1 φ 1 i t i i 1 t t n i 1 p φ n i as the kn persistence correction term that term replaces the φ of the winkelman estimator the wolpert estimator wolpert 2015 generalizes the kn estimator by allowing for weibull age variation in persistence probability i e a fast increase in removal probability as the carcass ages so like the kn estimator the bleed through of carcasses that persist undetected for more than one sampling occasion is accounted for however wolpert 2015 does not make explicit the link between his bleed through parameter b and the time to removal the inner workings of the wolpert estimator are quite complex with multiple recursions back in time and multiple integrals unfortunately the acmer r package that implements the approach is not fully operational yet so i could not include this estimator in my simulation study more than half a dozen other variants of the lincoln petersen estimator have been proposed reviewed by bernardino et al 2013 for the sake of simplicity i only considered the above five considering that other variants occupied intermediate positions between these five 2 3 open population capture recapture models in all the other fields of application of capture recapture concepts to deal with open population problems we have long used models that incorporate the processes of gains and losses in the focal population cormack 1964 jolly 1965 seber 1965 these models constitute the basis for modern hidden markov chain modelling i e a major segment of biostatistics however unlike closed population problems open population capture recapture problems do not have a straightforward analytical solution especially if we concern ourselves with age time and individual variation as exemplified by the complex computations in wolpert 2015 furthermore adding or removing model features would entail a full rework of the analytical solution meaning that the framework is not really flexible for these reasons modern capture recapture efforts are almost entirely based on numerical parameter estimation that is finding the parameter values that maximize the model likelihood given the data a range of frequentist and bayesian methods are available to find the maximum likelihood carcass data are however slightly different from typical capture recapture data because carcasses are not mobile the data come in three separate components the carcass survey data the detection trial data and the persistence trial data these three components can be analyzed jointly using the same hierarchical capture recapture model péron et al 2013 alternatively one may fix the persistence and detection rates to known values and analyze only the carcass search data etterson 2013 in the latter case careful attention should be taken 1 that the sampling uncertainty of the persistence and detection rates is carried over e g using a parametric bootstrap and 2 that the experiments that yielded these estimates were conducted in conditions comparable to those of the carcass searches same environment same season etc the carrying over of sampling uncertainty is especially important if the focus is on estimating the probability that at least one individual was taken cf dealing with sparse datasets in the discussion section importantly an open capture recapture model tailored to a series of t sampling occasions would feature t 1 parameters to represent the temporal variation in the rate of entry of new carcasses i e temporal variation in collision rate if the data were too sparse to support the full time variation in the rate of entry of new carcasses one would simplify the model the typical solution is to assume a constant rate of entry β i i i j i j is the probability that a carcass of the superpopulation will become available for detection during interval i of length i i this would remove t 1 parameters from the list of parameters to estimate alternatively if there is a mode one may describe the temporal variation in the rate of new entries using 2 4 parameters e g gaussian distribution raised cosine distribution sinh arcsinh distribution péron et al 2014 contrary to the claims of huso et al 2015b 2016 there are therefore no more identifiability issues with the open population approach than with lincoln petersen approaches further points of discussion regarding the applicability of the open population maximum likelihood approach pertain to some of the proposed extensions of the base model péron and hines 2014 recommended categorizing carcasses into two stages representing age classes e g fresh and dry but their routine also applies if there is no information about the carcass stage a full age specific variant where the age of the carcass is inferred after detection by way of model fitting was also proposed by péron et al 2013 at the time this approach was deemed too computer intensive and sensitive to convergence issues local minima in the model likelihood for practical implementation but i reprise the full age specific variant here as a side note if using forensic methods the time since death could be determined with precision in the field upon detection specific algorithms could be employed that yield a better precision of the final estimate péron et al 2014 péron et al 2013 and etterson 2013 also recommended leaving the detected carcasses on the ground and have a separate team perform trial experiments on them this recommendation has been used to criticize the open population approach and deem it impossible to implement because for legal and other reasons carcasses often need to be removed upon detection but the open population approach still performs if the carcasses are removed upon detection provided an adequate number of externally obtained carcasses are brought in for the trial experiments three irreducible caveats however apply to both the open population and lincoln petersen approaches 1 if not using the naturally occurring carcasses in the trial experiments the externally obtained surrogate carcasses may not have the same properties as the naturally occurring ones 2 the surrogate carcasses may influence the behavior of scavengers e g attract them so that they eventually find the naturally occurring ones or on the contrary feed them enough that they neglect the naturally occurring ones 3 some of the fatalities may not be detectible using carcass searches because the animal was only wounded and died elsewhere crippling loss in summary the literature contains two approaches to infer mortality from carcass survey data one approach uses an estimator developed for closed populations and attempts various modifications in many cases ad hoc to deal with the open population nature of the problem the other approach recognizes the open population problem from the outset and develops a process based modeling framework drawing from methodologies that have been used for this purpose for over 50 years 2 4 post hoc correction for early removals in the open population approach the focal parameter is the size of the superpopulation of carcasses that are available for detection during at least one of the sampling occasions however some carcasses are removed during the same interval as they first appear these carcasses do not enter the superpopulation sensu schwarz and arnason 1996 therefore we need to account for the process of early removal after having fitted the open population model by manipulating the parameter estimates under some assumption about the distribution of early removals within each time interval i e did early removals occur more or less early in the interval or were they uniformly distributed péron et al 2013 schwarz and arnason 1996 the resulting quantity is denoted n in the r package fatalitycmr péron and hines 2014 2 5 post hoc area correction whatever the type of analysis the final estimator needs to be extrapolated from the survey area to the area of reference huso et al 2015b offered an excellent review of the aspects to consider when performing this extrapolation the search radius may be smaller than the distance at which carcasses may be projected by the turbine blades hull and muir 2010 a fraction of the search area may not be searchable at all because of vegetation or terrain one may want to extrapolate from a small sample of monitored turbines to the whole wind farm however contra huso et al 2015b i do not recommend performing a post hoc correction for spatial variation in searchability within the search area other than for parts of the search area that were not monitored at all environmental factors that influence detection probability within the search area should be incorporated when estimating detection probability 2 6 simulation study i simulated series of t 6 sampling occasions separated by constant time intervals i hereafter describe the persistence process in terms of the probability for an undetected carcass to persist on the ground for one full time interval i e the time unit is one interval i considered two scenarios of persistence probability in scenario persistence1 the persistence probability increased between the first and second intervals then plateaued for three intervals and eventually dropped at a faster pace than linear this scenario was designed to emulate the preferential removal of easy to detect carcasses during the first interval korner nievergelt et al 2015 followed by a super exponential ageing process bispo et al 2013 wolpert 2015 in scenario persistence2 the persistence probability initially dropped and then increased this scenario was designed to emulate persistence in a dry environment where carcasses that escape scavengers in the first few intervals become mummified in all scenarios detection probability at each sampling occasion was constant through time taking value 0 1 0 5 or 0 8 depending on scenario the rate of entry of new carcasses was also constant throughout the simulated study period meaning that β i 1 t in the simulations once detected the carcasses were left on the ground and used in trial experiments an additional 25 or 50 carcasses were brought in and planted throughout the survey area immediately after the first sampling occasion these carcasses were used in the trial experiments along with the detected ones from the collisions i computed the average bias and root mean squared error rmse over 100 simulations per scenario minus the simulations that yielded zero detected carcasses up to 40 of cases in some scenarios surveys that yield zero detections cannot be handled using either the maximum likelihood approach péron et al 2013 or the lincoln petersen approach huso et al 2015a i review how to deal with sparse datasets within the constraints of the process described in fig 1 in the discussion i also computed the bias of the composite estimator obtained by averaging the winkelman erickson jones and huso estimators this composite estimator appears to be increasingly used in operator reports 3 results the open population maximum likelihood approach performed best yielding the smallest bias and smallest rmse fig 2 this result was expected since i fit the exact same model that was used to generate the data the winkelman estimator exhibited a severe positive bias fig 2 meaning overestimation of collision rate due to the violation of its unrealistic assumptions regarding the rate of entry of new carcasses the erickson estimator was severely negatively biased probably because the assumption of constant search effort was violated and because the simulation was short meaning the system was not in its steady state yet the jones and huso estimators over estimated the number of fatalities fig 2 as expected because they do not account for the possibility that carcasses persist undetected over more than one sampling occasion the korner nievergelt kn estimator was only slightly biased in the scenario persistence1 fig 2 but changing the shape of the persistence age relationship led to major bias in this estimator fig s1 rmse yielded the same conclusions about the relative performance of the estimators figs s2 and s3 the bias of the composite estimator obtained by averaging the winkelman erickson jones and huso estimators was moderate when detection probability was high bias of 18 to 1 for detection probability of 0 8 fig s4 but quickly increased when detection probability was low 50 bias for detection probability of 0 1 fig s4 the relatively good performance of the composite estimator for high detection probability is explained by the fact that in these specific conditions the biases of the winkelman and erickson estimators seemed to compensate each other fig 2 importantly the performance of all the approaches including the open population maximum likelihood approach declined when detection probability decreased and when the number of carcasses available for detection decreased this well known issue is further discussed by huso et al 2015a and under dealing with sparse datasets in the discussion section 4 discussion that the open population maximum likelihood approach was the least biased and most precise when applied to datasets simulated using an open population capture recapture model was not surprising however the magnitude of the bias in the other estimators is a cause of concern as far as i can judge end users of the lincoln petersen estimators never test hypotheses about sources of bias and furthermore the lincoln petersen type estimators are not really flexible i e cannot be adapted if a source of bias is suspected consequently the results of a lincoln petersen estimator are likely to be considered final despite the potential violation of their assumptions by contrast end users of the maximum likelihood approach have a culture of goodness of fit testing and model selection within the information theoretic framework akaike information criterion meaning that it is straightforward to test for the occurrence of sources of bias and account for them in the model the main message of this study is that open population maximum likelihood approaches do not require more data than lincoln petersen approaches yet they allow more flexibility should more data be available the lincoln petersen approaches represent attempts to find analytical solutions to capture recapture problems that are best tackled with models developed to mimic the data generating processes usually requiring numerical optimization the choice of an appropriate estimator can have major operational implications when operators are required to provision a mitigation fund in proportion to their estimated take administrations are likely to set the official cost of a bird life at a value that maintains the overall envelope within economically sustainable bounds over estimating the rate of collision can thus lead to devaluate the official cost of a bird life similarly when agencies use the estimated probability that a rare species was taken to trigger specific measures if that probability is overestimated actual collision will rarely be witnessed in the wind farms that were affected by precautionary measures and operators are likely to become increasingly less compliant on the opposite the risk of under estimating the take are obvious in terms of sustainability especially for long lived species like raptors whose population viability is very sensitive to even small changes in adult survival probability mertz 1971 4 1 dealing with sparse datasets mortality estimation from carcass surveys stands out from other capture recapture applications because the data are typically sparse etterson 2013 huso et al 2015a few carcasses of protected species are ever detected in one focal wind project which does not mean that the cumulative impact of the wind projects over the range of these protected species is negligible nor that the wind farms comply with their legal requirements however as emphasized by huso et al 2015a and confirmed in this study neither the lincoln petersen approaches nor the open population maximum likelihood approaches work when the number of detected carcasses is small or zero in the case of the lincoln petersen approaches this is because the sampling variance of the estimators contains a 1 c 2 term meaning that the sampling variance of the estimate diverges towards the infinite as c declines while the estimate itself is by construction zero when c is zero in the open population maximum likelihood approach the estimator is also zero when c is zero and furthermore there are numerical instabilities when the model parameters tend towards zero and identifiability issues such as the inability to distinguish between the binomial and poisson distributions in small samples barker et al 2017 either way following huso et al 2015a and péron and hines 2014 when few carcasses have been detected i recommend using the evidence of absence approach huso et al 2015a promote a bayesian approach designed to combine existing data with new data as they become available under the assumption that the number of fatalities varies from year to year in a predictable manner in the absence of a priori beliefs about the number of fatalities a frequentist approach can also be employed one then only needs to compute the probability not to observe a carcass that was part of the superpopulation denoted here p 0 1 to match bayesian notation the ad hoc estimate for the superpopulation size would then be n eq 1 a parametric bootstrap can be used to compute the confidence interval of n and the probability that n is above a given administrative threshold péron and hines 2014 1 n c n 0 n c c n p 0 1 n 1 p 0 1 c averaging across possible entry dates p 0 1 should be computed as eq 2 2 p 0 1 x 0 β 0 j 0 x φ j d 1 t 1 j 1 d 1 φ x j 1 1 φ x d 1 j 1 d 1 p x j 1 j 1 t 1 φ x j 1 j 1 t 1 p x j 1 i 2 t β i d i t 1 j i d 1 φ j i 1 φ d i j i d 1 p j i j i t 1 φ j i j i t 1 p j i eq 2 represents the sum over possible ages of the probability not to record a carcass of that age weighed by the probability that the carcass is of that age φ a and p a respectively denote the probability of persistence up to age a and the probability to be detected when of age a the β i denote the rate of entry of new carcasses in the case of sparse data there is not enough information to document these β i parameters one must therefore make some assumptions and assign arbitrary values to them several options are considered in the r package fatalitycmr péron and hines 2014 an alternative is to compute p 0 1 as one minus the sum of the probabilities to record a carcass of known age sometimes referred to as the jolly s χ approach jolly 1965 this alternative is somewhat faster especially when age effects are discarded and features in the r package fatalitycmr importantly g 1 p 0 1 is the denominator that one might use in a lincoln petersen estimator and corresponds to the g of huso et al 2015a 4 2 data requirements the basic data requirements for the open population maximum likelihood approach do not differ from those of the lincoln petersen estimators meaning that the maximum likelihood approach or its sparse data approximation previous section can be applied without modifying standard data collection protocols however the maximum likelihood approach also makes it possible to collect and analyze more than what is typically done i list below some of the new features that could be included in field protocols in order to harvest some additional benefits 1 age classes in the fatalitycmr r package we offered the option to separate fresh and dry carcasses in the search data and in the trial experiments this represents a minimal modification of the search protocol field technicians simply visually assess the state of the carcasses upon detection the trial experiments would however need to be stratified by age class 2 time since carcass placement some operators only report aggregated data such as k out of k planted carcasses were detected on occasion x i recommend following the warren hicks data format warren hicks et al 2013 which stores the full information about the time since carcass placement therefore allowing age effects to be modelled at the data analysis stage an issue to keep in mind however is that if using naturally occurring carcasses time since initial detection is not the same as time since death requiring the adequate modeling of carcass age péron et al 2014 2013 3 forensic determination of time since death for select species of high patrimonial value it might be cost effective to precisely determine the time since death when the carcasses are discovered using this information a different brand of open capture recapture model can be fit péron et al 2014 which is likely to improve precision and bias of the estimates 4 using detected carcasses in trial experiments in most cases detected carcasses are removed upon detection there are legal requirements in some cases preventing holding on to the corpses of protected species health hazards for project employees could also be invoked if carcasses are really numerous or involve particular disease carrying species for bats and maybe passerines carcasses may have to be removed and stored for later examination and determination of the species some operators also argue that carcasses attract scavengers and therefore need to be removed to reduce scavenger bias because detected carcasses are removed the trial experiments are then performed using externally obtained surrogate carcasses as previously mentioned relying on surrogate carcasses may introduce a bias if the persistence and detection probability of these carcasses is different from those of carcasses stemming from actual collision leaving carcasses where found and using a double observer protocol etterson 2013 to include these naturally occurring carcasses in trial experiments would avoid these bias and at the minimum it would increase the sample size of the trial experiments at little cost the main issue is that the time since death must be inferred because the carcasses are detected possibly long after death but there are models for this péron et al 2013 which i used in this study 5 record environmental covariates and do not pool species arbitrarily although the effect of environmental features and species characteristics on detection probability and persistence time is intuitive and acknowledged by most authors in practice operators rarely record and account for environmental factors and they sometimes pool species together in improper categories e g passerines and bats all birds together etc 4 3 recommendations for agency level management 1 central database of trial experiment results as far as i know efforts to pool the results of the trial experiments are in an infancy stage wind project developers could draw from the accumulated data to complement their own smaller projects could pay to access a database of experimental results instead of conducting their own small scale separate experiments this would also allow further research into spatial and temporal variation in bias and mortality 2 scientific peer review the fact that two of the early estimators which are still widely in use today were never published in peer reviewed academic journals is quite exceptional for the field from this non reviewed basis a community of researchers and practitioners with a vested interest in fatality estimation evolved and seems to have somewhat diverged from the rest of the wildlife biology and biostatistics communities this possibly explains the late recognition of the congruence with capture recapture modeling the term lincoln petersen estimator was for example until now completely absent from the fatality estimation literature 4 4 are methodological debates delaying the uptake of major evidence this section uses the example of fatality estimation to discuss the notion that when biostatisticians and conservation biologists fail to reach a timely consensus about peripheral issues other stakeholders may have the opportunity to ignore all evidence including the evidence that the research community agrees upon ezrahi 1990 and latour and woolgar 1979 already warned that modern societies tend to discount any science that does not confirm dominant world views cognitive dissonances between scientific evidence and perception based constructions prevent of slows down the uptake of new science especially if these perceptions are socially validated or if compliance to old beliefs generates a social benefit kool et al 2010 wind energy is overall perceived as good for society devine wright 2005 even if people do not desire the turbines themselves in their backyard devine wright 2005 yet the wind farms are actually not environmental friendly arnett et al 2016 erickson et al 2014 loss et al 2014 this cognitive dissonance sets the stage for evidence complacency sensu sutherland and wordley 2017 that is the selective and delayed uptake of available scientific evidence by decision makers decision makers can choose to promote the greenhouse gas emission reduction aspect and discount the harmful to wildlife aspect the first reason that the evidence complacency strategy might be attractive is that even if decision makers are willing and able to obtain enough scientific evidence to inform their decision relying on scientific evidence might divert power and influence towards those who provide evidence sutherland and wordley 2017 for example post construction monitoring may be perceived as a challenge to the administrative and judiciary authorities that delivered the construction permit often against strong local opposition the second reason is that scientific evidence comes with a quantified uncertainty e g p value thus when decision makers use scientific evidence as part of their process they publicly take the risk that the evidence backing the decision was wrong even if the whole purpose of the evidence based approach is to quantify and minimize that risk nichols and williams 2006 runge 2011 the mere acknowledgement that the decision maker willingly takes a risk constitutes a political liability stewart 2002 because uncertainty is explicit evidence based decision processes can also expose decision makers to legal challenges ruhl and fischman 2010 that a more opaque non quantitative decision process would probably avoid this aversion for uncertainty would operate on top of the logistical and financial burden of the evidence based approach overall leading managers to prefer more qualitative and experience based approaches to decision support pullin et al 2004 my point is that by failing to reach a timely consensus on how to best assess the environmental impact of wind farms biostatisticians and conservation biologists have artificially exaggerated the scientific uncertainty surrounding the impact of wind farms on wildlife and as a consequence the evidence complacency strategy could strive evidence that it was the case include the construction of wind farms in major raptor concentration areas in spain until 2006 atienza et al 2014 the delay between general industrial risk regulation and wildlife specific regulation in france law 2003 590 vs aug 26 2011 orders and the overall conservative adaptive management approach developed by the usa even after the infamous altamont scandal i am of course not advocating that debates should not occur among conservation biology and biostatistics circles but i question the benefits of having them occur in print the problem partly ensues from the broader scale social transformation of academia which has seen the individual value of each printed publication decrease bornmann and mutz 2015 vostal 2016 debates that used to occur among experts in restricted access arenas are now exposed in series of publications that criticize each other in that context increasing communication about data sutherland and wordley 2017 and co constructing scientific evidence with decision makers jasanoff 2004 can be double edged if it also increase the exposure of internal debates that uninformed readers may perceive as challenging the relevance of the evidence presented conservation biologists and biostatisticians should strive to present a united front about the core notions they agree about appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online

25239,wetlands have been degraded and destroyed resulting in the decline of many wetland dependent species populations many conservation efforts are based on protection of individual wetlands however fluxes of energy materials and organisms between wetlands create important structural and functional connections upon which several species depend we investigated the role of individual wetlands within a wetlandscape in sustaining an amphibian population wetlandscapes were represented as networks where nodes were wetlands and links were flows of organisms described by an amphibian population model relationships between a wetland s connectivity to the other wetlands and the abundance of amphibians under different wetland management strategies were examined the first finding was that wetlands within a network can be classified into sinks where local mortality exceeds birth rate sources where local birth rate exceeds mortality and pseudo sinks where excessive immigration maintains the population above the carrying capacity these three wetland classes have low medium and high indegree a parameter reflecting a wetland s connectivity respectively the second finding was that management interventions in wetlands have different consequences according to the wetland s indegree wetland removal has the worst impact on amphibian populations if the wetland is a source and wetland restoration has the best impact if the wetland is a pseudo sink these findings provide support for policies that managing wetlands not as independent objects but as integral parts of the wetlandscape keywords connectivity ecological network wetland configuration amphibian model graph theory population dynamics 1 introduction wetlands are important ecosystems as they provide several functions and services calhoun et al 2016 yao et al 2017 creed et al 2017 and constitute an important source of biodiversity costanza et al 1997 gibbs 2000 in recent decades many wetlands have been drained because of urban or agricultural expansion davidson 2014 dixon et al 2016 golden et al 2017 wetland loss impacts on biodiversity both directly by removing habitat gibbs 2000 and indirectly by increasing the distance among remaining wetlands and resulting in functional isolation and increasing mortality of organisms migrating from one wetland to another baguette et al 2013 wetlands are not isolated features on the contrary they are dynamic complex ecosystem with biotic and abiotic connections to other wetlands on the wetlandscape cohen et al 2016 thorslund et al 2017 understanding the ecological dynamics of wetlandscapes is important to sustaining biodiversity semlitsch and bodie 1998 gibbs 2000 in particular amphibians survival is influenced by both wetland habitat and wetland connections to other wetlands dudgeon et al 2006 in fact these wetland qualities determine the success of amphibians breeding mushet et al 2012 wetland habitat is used by adults for mating and by offspring to complete their metamorphism from eggs factors such as availability of resources and dispersal capabilities influence the amphibian population in wetlands pechmann et al 1989 semlitsch 1996 availability of resources depends on wetland habitat properties e g area vegetation and on the number of amphibians competing for available resources amphibian dispersal relies on wetland distribution within the surrounding terrestrial habitat every year at the end of the summer amphibians start their migration through the terrestrial habitat and the following spring they reach a new aquatic breeding habitat pittman et al 2014 alteration of wetland habitat and distribution within the landscape such as wetland loss negatively influences both breeding and dispersal success by decreasing wetland density and increasing travel distances for amphibians gibbs 1993 management strategies have been implemented to protect biodiversity promoted by wetlands many of these management strategies focus on wetlands of special importance amezaga et al 2002 policy goals vary from no net loss to net gain accatino et al 2018 to general statements about the need to address adverse impacts to these wetlands e g calhoun et al 2016 few of these management strategies focus on the physical chemical or biological connections among wetlands e g cohen et al 2016 although it is widely recognized that wetland connectivity is important for biodiversity semlitsch 1996 semlitsch and bodie 1998 skelly et al 1999 marsh and trenham 2001 cushman 2006 concrete strategies in policies are still not well formulated the lack in wetland policies of clear operational strategic schemes based on wetland connectivity is at least in part due to the lack or rarity of quantitative assessments of the role of wetland connectivity in sustaining wetland biodiversity important steps forward would be to determine if and how wetland connectivity plays a role in sustaining biodiversity in a wetlandscape fortuna et al 2006 albanese and haukos 2017 and to explore if management interventions on the wetland itself i e wetland removal or restoration are influenced by wetland connectivity the sink source framework describes the distribution of species in the variety of interconnected habitat patches within a region pulliam 1988 watkinson and sutherland 1995 according to this framework a productive patch serves as a source of individuals which are dispersed to less productive patches called sinks pulliam 1988 dunning et al 1992 pulliam 1988 argued that in sink habitat patches reproduction is insufficient to balance local mortality whereas in source habitat patches reproduction balances local mortality the population in sinks is thus maintained by immigration from sources most studies classify sinks and sources only by demographic measures i e birth and death rate watkinson and sutherland 1995 the role of connectivity in the classification of sinks and sources has not been explored models are useful to test the sink source framework for exploring organism dispersal through wetlandscapes especially when empirical data are lacking or extremely difficult and costly to collect pittman et al 2014 patch based models e g skelly and meir 1997 trenham 1998 focus on population dynamics within patches which are important to describe fundamental ecological processes such as breeding marsh and trenham 2001 interspecific competition and predation wilbur 1997 beebee et al 1996 patch based models were successfully applied to wetlandscapes marsh and trenham 2001 wilbur 1997 however an exclusively patch based approach does not consider the role of wetland isolation and the mobility of individuals to other wetlands cushman 2006 in contrast network based models focus on connectivity within a network s node and they can be applied to wetlandscapes too e g albanese and haukos 2017 they make it possible to quantify changes to the connectivity of wetlands and identify wetlands critical to the maintenance of the whole system connectivity network based models are useful tools for combining both the within wetland population dynamics and the dispersal of individuals among wetlands estrada and bodin 2008 network based models can be used to identify keystone patches that are integral to the persistence of populations urban and keitt 2001 keitt 2003 and to quantify the robustness of populations to wetland loss bunn et al 2000 hanski 2001 jordán et al 2003 in this paper we addressed the role of wetland connectivity in determining the role of different wetlands to sustain amphibian populations we focused on amphibian species characterized by a bi phasic life cycle migrating into different wetlands during the course of their life we built a model of amphibian population dynamics in a wetland network and we formulated scenarios to address two research questions how does the connectivity of a wetland influence the abundance of the local population in the wetland itself and how does a management intervention on a single wetland e g wetland removal or wetland restoration influence the total landscape population by changing connectivity within the wetlandscape 2 methods we focused on amphibian species with life history traits characterized by a terrestrial and an aquatic phase but the approach could be adapted to amphibian species with other life history traits in summer amphibians congregate in wetlands for mating at the end of the summer amphibians leave wetlands and migrate through the terrestrial habitat searching food and refuges for overwintering until the next spring when they disperse again looking for aquatic breeding habitat pittman et al 2014 examples of species having such as life cycle are the northern leopard frog rana pipiens having a dispersal distance ranging between 2 km and 10 km kendell 2002 and the great plains toad anaxyrus cognatus having a dispersal distance ranging between 300 m and 1300 m cosewic 2010 2 1 model description we built a theoretical model for simulating the dynamics of a biphasic life cycle amphibian population within a wetlandscape the population dynamics of amphibians consist of a continuous repetition of reproduction phase and migration phase in the reproduction phase new offspring are produced in each wetland as a function of the abundance of the local population in the migration phase amphibians migrate from a wetland to another according to how wetlands are connected and their mortality our model was conceived in the medawar zone loehle 1990 grimm et al 2005 i e we included only the necessary elements for addressing our research questions and to avoid unnecessary details such as predation phenomena or climate variables like air and surface water temperature of wetlands 2 2 wetlandscape a network consists of a set of nodes that are defined as spatial elements and links that represent linkages between nodes urban and keitt 2001 we represented a wetlandscape as a network where the nodes are wetlands whereas the links are flows of amphibians between wetlands we connected two wetlands by a link if the distance between a given pair of wetlands was less than or equal to the maximum distance walkable by the amphibians fig 1a links were assigned a weight equal to the potential connectivity c i j which is defined as the probability of an amphibian leaving wetland i to choose wetland j as breeding site the following year to determine the connectivity between two wetlands either a boundary approach or a distance approach could be used the boundary approach consists of methods that determine the weight based on the presence or the length of a shared boundary ermagun and levinson 2018 the distance approach consists of a set of methods that determine the weight using the geographic distance ermagun and levinson 2018 both the boundary approach and the distance approach or a combination of them have been used to construct a theory driven spatial weighting matrix dray et al 2006 as well as biological considerations such as propagation process sokal and oden 1978 patch size hanski 1994 and dispersion capability knapp et al 2003 in our work the potential connectivity represented only the spatial interactions among wetlands and combined the boundary approach and distance approach using a weighted average with the parameter β as the weight to balance the relative importance of adjacency over the inverse distance the underlying assumption is that amphibians will move from wetland i to wetland j if the two wetlands are adjacent see below for definition or if two wetlands are close each other the potential connectivity has this expression 1 c i j β a i j 1 β 1 x i j the term aij was the adjacency term and was computed with the voronoi tessellation galpern et al 2012 this method consisted of a subdivision of the landscape into polygons each polygon associated with a wetland fig 1b the polygon was formed by all the points of the landscape nearer to that wetland than to any other kenkel et al 1989 since each wetland was the centroid of a polygonal region for each one we assigned an adjacency value of aij 1 if the polygons of the two wetlands were adjacent and aij 0 otherwise the adjacent polygons in the tessellation described hypothesized regions of proximity for the organism within which there is high connectivity galpern et al 2012 the term xij was the euclidean distance between wetlands i and j this term took into account that an amphibian was more likely to go to a wetland at a shorter distance we set β 0 5 assuming an equal effect played by adjacency and distance 2 3 amphibian population dynamics the amphibian population dynamics were described using a time discrete model with a time step t of one year divided in two sub steps the first for breeding in wetlands and the second for migration from one wetland to another fig 1c in the notation of our model n t i represented the number of amphibians in wetland i at the beginning of year t n t 1 2 i represented the number of amphibians in wetland i after the breeding phase and n t 1 i represented the number of amphibians in wetland i after the dispersal phase of year t in the breeding phase the adults in each wetland produced offspring that went through the metamorphic cycle and became juveniles ready to move to reproduce in another wetland the following year the population n t 1 2 i consisted of the population n t i increased by the number of new individuals generated that successfully completed the metamorphic cycle here after called newborns in wetland i 2 n t 1 2 i n t i m a x 0 r n t i 1 n t i k the survival of the new individuals generated was density dependent at low density individuals did not interfere with each other whereas at higher densities resources became less available for each individual we characterized a wetland by its carrying capacity k which is the maximum size of the population that each wetland can sustain parameter r represented the intrinsic growth rate the max operator assured that the number of new individuals generated was not negative in the migration phase each amphibian in wetland i moved to wetland j with a certain probability such a probability corresponded to the effective connectivity wij which consisted of the potential connectivity c i j modified for taking into account the dispersal distance of amphibians p i j the probability of mortality due to distance travelled dij and the natural mortality μ 3 w i j c i j p i j 1 d i j 1 μ the dispersal distance was computed with a negative exponential function of the distance travelled x i j p i j e δ x i j where δ is the dispersal capacity evaluated as a function of the amphibian maximum walkable distance x m a x δ 1 x m a x the same functional shape was used in other similar models e g bunn et al 2000 hanski and ovaskainen 2000 saura and pascual hortal 2007 the term d i j described the mortality during the winter for migration and it is proportional to the distance x i j between the two wetlands d i j γ x i j the term γ was a coefficient representing the probability of mortality per distance unit implicitly including the probability of dying in the search of a wintering place the natural mortality μ was considered a constant parameter of the amphibian species the effective connectivity w i j is the fraction of amphibians in wetland j which choose wetland i as destination and arrive there safely in the following time step the number of amphibians at the time t 1 that reached wetland i was calculated as 4 n t 1 i j 1 m i w i j n t 1 2 j the term mi is the number of wetlands connected to wetland i the sum j 1 m i w i j i e the sum of weights of the ingoing links of wetland i represented the fraction of the amphibians n t 1 2 j incoming from the other wetlands of the network at time t 1 n t 1 i are defined as immigrants the sum j 1 m i w i j gave a measure of how much the wetland i was reachable from other wetlands in the network and was called indegree jordán et al 2003 estrada and bodin 2008 we used indegree for quantifying wetland connectivity 2 4 scenarios for different wetlandscapes we used the population model to run simulations over different randomly generated wetland networks to investigate the role of wetland indegree on the local amphibian populations we first analyzed the behavior of the system on a single randomly generated wetland network single network scenario and then analyzed the relationship between wetlands indegree and population on a set of randomly generated wetland networks using a monte carlo simulation approach multi networks scenario to investigate the impact of wetland removal and restoration on the population we conducted wetland removal and restoration scenarios also using a monte carlo simulation approach wetland removal and restoration scenarios the single network scenario was used to explore the overall population dynamics and the local population dynamics in single wetlands of the network with each wetland characterized by a different value of indegree we randomly generated a network of 50 wetlands and ran the population dynamics model on it for generating the random network we used the algorithm developed by fachada et al 2014 this algorithm generates a random network configuration starting from deterministic topological parameters e g slope number of clusters total points and stochastic parameters e g average separation of line centers along the x axis average separation of line centers along the y axis cluster fatness stochastic parameters varied for each network and were randomly extracted from a uniform distribution of values stochastic parameters made it possible to define a network configuration that was not deterministically assigned but had some random variations the model was initialized to 20 amphibians per wetland and parameterized as in table 1 with a fixed simulation time horizon all the wetlands in the network were characterized by the same carrying capacity k this allowed us to explore the relationship between wetlands indegree and population since wetlands only differed for their indegree value without other confounding factors due to habitat difference we classified the wetlands of the network into three classes of indegree low medium or high using the jenks natural breaks classification a data clustering method that minimizes each class s average deviation from the class meanwhile maximizing each class s deviation from the means of the other cluster jenks 1967 we then explored the local population dynamics in three wetlands each one belonging to a different class of indegree specifically we investigated 1 the number of newborns produced in the wetlands and 2 the number of immigrants the multi network scenario consisted of running simulations for several randomly generated networks all having the same topologic characteristic this scenario served to assess if the observations made from the single network scenario could be considered general and to explore with more detail the relationship between indegree of the wetland and its local population we generated 100 networks of 50 wetlands each and ran the population dynamics model for each one of the networks for each network configuration the values of r k and μ were extracted from a uniform distribution within a fixed range within each experiment the parameters were kept constant and k was equal for all the wetlands the model was initialized with 20 amphibians per wetland with the range of values of parameters provided in table 1 i e the same demographic parameters of the single network scenario as in the single network scenario wetlands carrying capacity was set equal for all the wetlands of all the networks we ran the simulations over a period of 60 years checking that this time horizon was long enough to reach a steady state we compared the population size in each wetland with its indegree value pulling together all the wetlands in all the simulations we then explored how the population dynamics evolved within the wetland network analyzing the different contribution played by immigrants and newborns at each time step the wetlands within the random networks were divided according to their indegree into three classes low medium high using the jenks method we made pairwise comparison between the distribution of amphibian population abundance within classes using the kolmogorov smirnov and student s t test significance level 0 05 for both tests kolmogorov smirnov test was used to detect a statically significant difference between the distributions of the amphibian population abundance at the steady states in the different classes of indegree student s t test was used to detect a statistically significant difference between the means of the amphibian population abundance at the steady states in the different classes of indegree wetland removal and restoration scenarios were used to estimate the role of wetland indegree on amphibian population when a wetland was removed or restored the wetland removal scenario consisted of removing a wetland from the network simulating the amphibian population dynamics in the altered network and comparing the result with the non altered network for a given network the experiment was repeated by iteratively removing one wetland at a time for all the other wetlands we set an equal value for carrying capacity k we repeated the procedure with 100 randomly generated wetlands and then examined the relationship between the indegree of the wetland removed and the impact on the total population this relationship was independent from the carrying capacity of the removed wetland since all the wetlands have the same k the wetland restoration scenario consisted of increasing the carrying capacity of a wetland in the network by duplicating its original value while keeping constant the carrying capacity of the other wetlands in the network the population dynamics of the altered network was simulated and the results compared to the non altered network for a given network the experiment was repeated by iteratively enhancing one wetland at a time we repeated the procedure with 100 randomly generated wetlands and examined the relationship between the indegree of the wetland improved and the impact on the total population we generated 100 wetland networks and repeated the wetland restoration scenario for each network we then compared the population of the altered and non altered networks to analyze the impact of management strategies as in multi network scenario the wetlands within the random networks were divided into three classes low medium high according to their indegree using the jenks method we made pairwise comparison between the distributions of amphibian population abundance within classes with the kolmogorov smirnov and student s t test significance level 0 05 to detect statistically significant differences in the distribution and in the mean value respectively the methodology and all the simulations are implemented with matlab r2016a 3 results 3 1 single network scenario the simulation on the single network scenario showed that the total population abundance after a transient phase reached a steady state the local population in each wetland behaved in the same way this shows that the length of the time horizon 60 years was sufficient to represent the population dynamics of the wetland network hereafter we present the results referred to the steady state for the wetland network generated fig 2 a we calculated the frequency distribution of the indegree and divided the wetlands into three classes low medium and high fig 2b we investigated the abundance of the population in three wetlands marked in fig 2a each one belonging to a different class wetland a low indegree showed the smallest population wetland b medium indegree showed the largest population and wetland c high indegree showed an intermediate population wetland a had a relatively small proportion of newborns wetland b had a larger proportion of newborns compared to wetland a and c and wetland c had no newborns fig 3 3 2 multi network scenario the behavior of the single network scenario fig 3 was generalizable fig 4 the low indegree class had the smallest population the medium indegree class had the largest population and the high indegree class had an intermediate population fig 4a the kolmogorov smirnov test revealed that the data belonging to different indegree classes had significantly different distribution p value 0 001 the student s t test revealed that data belonging to different indegree classes had significantly different mean values p value 0 02 the contribution of immigrants and newborns to the population for the different classes is shown in the pie charts in fig 4b wetlands in all indegree classes showed that the majority of the population was composed of newborns but that the proportion of newborns in the population of the high indegree class was not as high as in the low or medium indegree classes this was because the pie chart could not capture the natural oscillation given by the model of the population dynamics but only displayed a median value the multi network scenario showed a non linear relationship fig 5 a between wetland indegree and wetland population as indegree increased from low to medium the population increased at medium indegree the population reached a peak and as indegree increased from median to high the population decreased the number of immigrants showed a linear increase as indegree increased fig 5b and the number of newborns showed a non linear relationship similar to the total population fig 5c 3 3 wetland removal and restoration scenarios the wetland removal scenario showed greater negative effects on the amphibian population when the removed wetland belonged to a medium indegree class fig 6 b in contrast the wetland restoration scenario showed greater positive effects on the amphibian population when the restored wetland belonged to the high indegree class fig 6a fig 7 directly compares the wetland removal and restoration scenarios by showing the deviation in the population abundance of the entire wetland network between altered and non altered networks based on the class of indegree of the altered wetland within the network the kolmogorov smirnov test revealed that the data belonging to different indegree classes had significantly different distribution p value 0 001 the student s t test revealed that the data belonging to different indegree classes had significantly different mean values p value 0 001 4 discussion wetlandscapes sustain sink source population dynamics with individual wetlands playing different roles sources or sinks according to their indegree we identified source wetlands where local birth rate is greater than mortality and sink wetlands where local mortality is greater than the birth rate and the population is maintained by continued immigration from source wetlands nearby among sink wetlands we identified two types those in which the population goes extinct in the absence of immigration and those in which immigration maintains the population above the carrying capacity such a distinction corresponds to true sinks and pseudo sinks respectively according to watkinson and sutherland s 1995 terminology mortality in pseudo sinks is caused by excessive immigration which provokes excessive mortality due to density effect the decline in population growth caused by crowding predators and competition hixon and johnson 2009 if immigration stops in a pseudo sink the population would decline but only to the carrying capacity both true sinks and pseudo sinks have been observed in nature watkinson et al 1989 engelhard et al 2017 erickson et al 2017 indegree is a useful proxy for classifying wetlands into sources sinks and pseudo sinks wetlands with a low indegree representing relatively isolated wetlands could be classified as sinks because few amphibians migrated to these wetlands and consequently they produced few newborns wetlands with medium indegree could be classified as sources because they had the highest population in fact the immigrants arriving in the wetlands and the generated newborns were fully sustained by wetlands resources expressed by the carrying capacity k specifically the population within each wetland did not exceed carrying capacity and a large number of amphibians was able to successfully emigrate from these wetlands these wetlands were highly productive in fact the number of newborns exceeded the number of immigrants and contributed positively to the total wetland population growth wetlands with a high indegree representing relatively connected wetlands could be classified as pseudo sinks because the largest number of immigrants arrived at these wetlands but the available resources in these wetlands were insufficient to sustain both the immigrant population and the generated offspring the number of newborns declined until all of them died due to a density effect that is the population of these wetlands exceeded carrying capacity most of the amphibians in these wetlands were immigrants since the breeding success within the wetland was low due to the competition for resources during the breeding phase fortuna et al 2006 it should be noted that all the wetlands had the same carrying capacity value k within each simulation therefore the difference between non competition for resources in source wetlands and competition for resources in pseudo sink was due to differences in the wetland s indegree management strategies have different impacts on amphibian populations depending on the indegree of the wetland for example the largest negative impact to the amphibian population was produced when the removed wetland belonged to the medium indegree class since a source wetland was removed fig 6b removing wetlands with high amphibian productivity results in a large loss to the amphibian population of the wetlandscape furthermore the largest positive impact to the amphibian population was produced when the enhance wetland bellowed to the high indegree class since the enhanced wetland was originally limited by its carrying capacity i e pseudo sink wetlands fig 6a in fact restoring wetlands with high indegree means that a high number of immigrants can now come to the wetland and reproduce successfully potentially shifting the wetland from a pseudo sink to a source in contrast restoring wetlands with low or medium indegree i e source or sinks did not lead to an increase in the amphibian population because they were limited by low indegree and not by low carrying capacity wetland removal and restoration strategies produced impacts on amphibian population dynamics that varied with wetland indegree fig 6 the impacts were not symmetrical fig 7 a loss in the amphibian population caused by wetland removal could not be compensated equally by wetland restoration in fact wetland removal had cascading consequences to the remaining wetlands because of 1 reducing the number or density of individuals dispersing and 2 increasing the dispersal distance among the remaining wetlands and thus reducing effective indegree in the network semlitsch and bodie 1998 in contrast wetland restoration had cascading consequences to the remaining wetlands because of reducing density effect of individuals breeding the modelled amphibian population dynamics are supported by empirical studies eggert et al 2015 arntzen et al 2017 lannoo et al 2017 amphibians occur on a continuum of sink source and pseudo sinks wetlands and contribute differentially to the population of the wetlandscape eggert et al 2015 knowledge of the sinks sources and pseudo sinks behavior can improve wetland management strategies designed for conservation of species at risk pulliam 1988 lawton 1993 eggert et al 2015 for example reintroducing a species into presently unoccupied parts of a species range is more likely to succeed if the reintroduction occurs into a source wetland rather than a sink wetland pulliam 1988 furthermore wetland removal could focus on wetlands with low indegree and wetland restoration could focus on wetlands with high indegree to increase species population with these insights the conservation strategies can include design of wetland networks to optimize sink source dynamics in the future our model can be improved by adding a two step migration system which would enable to simulate the migration from breeding habitat to winter habitat at the end of summer and the dispersal from winter habitat to breeding habitat at the beginning of spring in addition simulation scenarios where wetlands are added to the network could be analyzed to assess the wetland positions leading to the highest positive impact on the population 5 conclusion it is important to recognize the role of individual wetlands as defined by their connectivity within wetlandscapes the adoption of a single object perspective for wetland management is incomplete given the flux of energy materials and organisms that occur among wetlands and in light of our results wetlands can have different roles sink source pseudo sinks in sustaining an amphibian population within wetlandscapes wetland indegree is a key property for 1 quantifying wetland connectivity and 2 classifying wetlands into sinks sources and pseudo sinks wetland removal and restoration are not compensatory rather these management strategies have different impacts on species population dynamics depending on the indegree among wetlands for example wetland removal can result in population loss that is not compensated by wetland restoration understanding the role of indegree of wetlands within wetlandscapes and the differential impacts of wetland management strategies on these connections is important for sustainable management of wetland dependent species at risk acknowledgement we wish to

25239,wetlands have been degraded and destroyed resulting in the decline of many wetland dependent species populations many conservation efforts are based on protection of individual wetlands however fluxes of energy materials and organisms between wetlands create important structural and functional connections upon which several species depend we investigated the role of individual wetlands within a wetlandscape in sustaining an amphibian population wetlandscapes were represented as networks where nodes were wetlands and links were flows of organisms described by an amphibian population model relationships between a wetland s connectivity to the other wetlands and the abundance of amphibians under different wetland management strategies were examined the first finding was that wetlands within a network can be classified into sinks where local mortality exceeds birth rate sources where local birth rate exceeds mortality and pseudo sinks where excessive immigration maintains the population above the carrying capacity these three wetland classes have low medium and high indegree a parameter reflecting a wetland s connectivity respectively the second finding was that management interventions in wetlands have different consequences according to the wetland s indegree wetland removal has the worst impact on amphibian populations if the wetland is a source and wetland restoration has the best impact if the wetland is a pseudo sink these findings provide support for policies that managing wetlands not as independent objects but as integral parts of the wetlandscape keywords connectivity ecological network wetland configuration amphibian model graph theory population dynamics 1 introduction wetlands are important ecosystems as they provide several functions and services calhoun et al 2016 yao et al 2017 creed et al 2017 and constitute an important source of biodiversity costanza et al 1997 gibbs 2000 in recent decades many wetlands have been drained because of urban or agricultural expansion davidson 2014 dixon et al 2016 golden et al 2017 wetland loss impacts on biodiversity both directly by removing habitat gibbs 2000 and indirectly by increasing the distance among remaining wetlands and resulting in functional isolation and increasing mortality of organisms migrating from one wetland to another baguette et al 2013 wetlands are not isolated features on the contrary they are dynamic complex ecosystem with biotic and abiotic connections to other wetlands on the wetlandscape cohen et al 2016 thorslund et al 2017 understanding the ecological dynamics of wetlandscapes is important to sustaining biodiversity semlitsch and bodie 1998 gibbs 2000 in particular amphibians survival is influenced by both wetland habitat and wetland connections to other wetlands dudgeon et al 2006 in fact these wetland qualities determine the success of amphibians breeding mushet et al 2012 wetland habitat is used by adults for mating and by offspring to complete their metamorphism from eggs factors such as availability of resources and dispersal capabilities influence the amphibian population in wetlands pechmann et al 1989 semlitsch 1996 availability of resources depends on wetland habitat properties e g area vegetation and on the number of amphibians competing for available resources amphibian dispersal relies on wetland distribution within the surrounding terrestrial habitat every year at the end of the summer amphibians start their migration through the terrestrial habitat and the following spring they reach a new aquatic breeding habitat pittman et al 2014 alteration of wetland habitat and distribution within the landscape such as wetland loss negatively influences both breeding and dispersal success by decreasing wetland density and increasing travel distances for amphibians gibbs 1993 management strategies have been implemented to protect biodiversity promoted by wetlands many of these management strategies focus on wetlands of special importance amezaga et al 2002 policy goals vary from no net loss to net gain accatino et al 2018 to general statements about the need to address adverse impacts to these wetlands e g calhoun et al 2016 few of these management strategies focus on the physical chemical or biological connections among wetlands e g cohen et al 2016 although it is widely recognized that wetland connectivity is important for biodiversity semlitsch 1996 semlitsch and bodie 1998 skelly et al 1999 marsh and trenham 2001 cushman 2006 concrete strategies in policies are still not well formulated the lack in wetland policies of clear operational strategic schemes based on wetland connectivity is at least in part due to the lack or rarity of quantitative assessments of the role of wetland connectivity in sustaining wetland biodiversity important steps forward would be to determine if and how wetland connectivity plays a role in sustaining biodiversity in a wetlandscape fortuna et al 2006 albanese and haukos 2017 and to explore if management interventions on the wetland itself i e wetland removal or restoration are influenced by wetland connectivity the sink source framework describes the distribution of species in the variety of interconnected habitat patches within a region pulliam 1988 watkinson and sutherland 1995 according to this framework a productive patch serves as a source of individuals which are dispersed to less productive patches called sinks pulliam 1988 dunning et al 1992 pulliam 1988 argued that in sink habitat patches reproduction is insufficient to balance local mortality whereas in source habitat patches reproduction balances local mortality the population in sinks is thus maintained by immigration from sources most studies classify sinks and sources only by demographic measures i e birth and death rate watkinson and sutherland 1995 the role of connectivity in the classification of sinks and sources has not been explored models are useful to test the sink source framework for exploring organism dispersal through wetlandscapes especially when empirical data are lacking or extremely difficult and costly to collect pittman et al 2014 patch based models e g skelly and meir 1997 trenham 1998 focus on population dynamics within patches which are important to describe fundamental ecological processes such as breeding marsh and trenham 2001 interspecific competition and predation wilbur 1997 beebee et al 1996 patch based models were successfully applied to wetlandscapes marsh and trenham 2001 wilbur 1997 however an exclusively patch based approach does not consider the role of wetland isolation and the mobility of individuals to other wetlands cushman 2006 in contrast network based models focus on connectivity within a network s node and they can be applied to wetlandscapes too e g albanese and haukos 2017 they make it possible to quantify changes to the connectivity of wetlands and identify wetlands critical to the maintenance of the whole system connectivity network based models are useful tools for combining both the within wetland population dynamics and the dispersal of individuals among wetlands estrada and bodin 2008 network based models can be used to identify keystone patches that are integral to the persistence of populations urban and keitt 2001 keitt 2003 and to quantify the robustness of populations to wetland loss bunn et al 2000 hanski 2001 jordán et al 2003 in this paper we addressed the role of wetland connectivity in determining the role of different wetlands to sustain amphibian populations we focused on amphibian species characterized by a bi phasic life cycle migrating into different wetlands during the course of their life we built a model of amphibian population dynamics in a wetland network and we formulated scenarios to address two research questions how does the connectivity of a wetland influence the abundance of the local population in the wetland itself and how does a management intervention on a single wetland e g wetland removal or wetland restoration influence the total landscape population by changing connectivity within the wetlandscape 2 methods we focused on amphibian species with life history traits characterized by a terrestrial and an aquatic phase but the approach could be adapted to amphibian species with other life history traits in summer amphibians congregate in wetlands for mating at the end of the summer amphibians leave wetlands and migrate through the terrestrial habitat searching food and refuges for overwintering until the next spring when they disperse again looking for aquatic breeding habitat pittman et al 2014 examples of species having such as life cycle are the northern leopard frog rana pipiens having a dispersal distance ranging between 2 km and 10 km kendell 2002 and the great plains toad anaxyrus cognatus having a dispersal distance ranging between 300 m and 1300 m cosewic 2010 2 1 model description we built a theoretical model for simulating the dynamics of a biphasic life cycle amphibian population within a wetlandscape the population dynamics of amphibians consist of a continuous repetition of reproduction phase and migration phase in the reproduction phase new offspring are produced in each wetland as a function of the abundance of the local population in the migration phase amphibians migrate from a wetland to another according to how wetlands are connected and their mortality our model was conceived in the medawar zone loehle 1990 grimm et al 2005 i e we included only the necessary elements for addressing our research questions and to avoid unnecessary details such as predation phenomena or climate variables like air and surface water temperature of wetlands 2 2 wetlandscape a network consists of a set of nodes that are defined as spatial elements and links that represent linkages between nodes urban and keitt 2001 we represented a wetlandscape as a network where the nodes are wetlands whereas the links are flows of amphibians between wetlands we connected two wetlands by a link if the distance between a given pair of wetlands was less than or equal to the maximum distance walkable by the amphibians fig 1a links were assigned a weight equal to the potential connectivity c i j which is defined as the probability of an amphibian leaving wetland i to choose wetland j as breeding site the following year to determine the connectivity between two wetlands either a boundary approach or a distance approach could be used the boundary approach consists of methods that determine the weight based on the presence or the length of a shared boundary ermagun and levinson 2018 the distance approach consists of a set of methods that determine the weight using the geographic distance ermagun and levinson 2018 both the boundary approach and the distance approach or a combination of them have been used to construct a theory driven spatial weighting matrix dray et al 2006 as well as biological considerations such as propagation process sokal and oden 1978 patch size hanski 1994 and dispersion capability knapp et al 2003 in our work the potential connectivity represented only the spatial interactions among wetlands and combined the boundary approach and distance approach using a weighted average with the parameter β as the weight to balance the relative importance of adjacency over the inverse distance the underlying assumption is that amphibians will move from wetland i to wetland j if the two wetlands are adjacent see below for definition or if two wetlands are close each other the potential connectivity has this expression 1 c i j β a i j 1 β 1 x i j the term aij was the adjacency term and was computed with the voronoi tessellation galpern et al 2012 this method consisted of a subdivision of the landscape into polygons each polygon associated with a wetland fig 1b the polygon was formed by all the points of the landscape nearer to that wetland than to any other kenkel et al 1989 since each wetland was the centroid of a polygonal region for each one we assigned an adjacency value of aij 1 if the polygons of the two wetlands were adjacent and aij 0 otherwise the adjacent polygons in the tessellation described hypothesized regions of proximity for the organism within which there is high connectivity galpern et al 2012 the term xij was the euclidean distance between wetlands i and j this term took into account that an amphibian was more likely to go to a wetland at a shorter distance we set β 0 5 assuming an equal effect played by adjacency and distance 2 3 amphibian population dynamics the amphibian population dynamics were described using a time discrete model with a time step t of one year divided in two sub steps the first for breeding in wetlands and the second for migration from one wetland to another fig 1c in the notation of our model n t i represented the number of amphibians in wetland i at the beginning of year t n t 1 2 i represented the number of amphibians in wetland i after the breeding phase and n t 1 i represented the number of amphibians in wetland i after the dispersal phase of year t in the breeding phase the adults in each wetland produced offspring that went through the metamorphic cycle and became juveniles ready to move to reproduce in another wetland the following year the population n t 1 2 i consisted of the population n t i increased by the number of new individuals generated that successfully completed the metamorphic cycle here after called newborns in wetland i 2 n t 1 2 i n t i m a x 0 r n t i 1 n t i k the survival of the new individuals generated was density dependent at low density individuals did not interfere with each other whereas at higher densities resources became less available for each individual we characterized a wetland by its carrying capacity k which is the maximum size of the population that each wetland can sustain parameter r represented the intrinsic growth rate the max operator assured that the number of new individuals generated was not negative in the migration phase each amphibian in wetland i moved to wetland j with a certain probability such a probability corresponded to the effective connectivity wij which consisted of the potential connectivity c i j modified for taking into account the dispersal distance of amphibians p i j the probability of mortality due to distance travelled dij and the natural mortality μ 3 w i j c i j p i j 1 d i j 1 μ the dispersal distance was computed with a negative exponential function of the distance travelled x i j p i j e δ x i j where δ is the dispersal capacity evaluated as a function of the amphibian maximum walkable distance x m a x δ 1 x m a x the same functional shape was used in other similar models e g bunn et al 2000 hanski and ovaskainen 2000 saura and pascual hortal 2007 the term d i j described the mortality during the winter for migration and it is proportional to the distance x i j between the two wetlands d i j γ x i j the term γ was a coefficient representing the probability of mortality per distance unit implicitly including the probability of dying in the search of a wintering place the natural mortality μ was considered a constant parameter of the amphibian species the effective connectivity w i j is the fraction of amphibians in wetland j which choose wetland i as destination and arrive there safely in the following time step the number of amphibians at the time t 1 that reached wetland i was calculated as 4 n t 1 i j 1 m i w i j n t 1 2 j the term mi is the number of wetlands connected to wetland i the sum j 1 m i w i j i e the sum of weights of the ingoing links of wetland i represented the fraction of the amphibians n t 1 2 j incoming from the other wetlands of the network at time t 1 n t 1 i are defined as immigrants the sum j 1 m i w i j gave a measure of how much the wetland i was reachable from other wetlands in the network and was called indegree jordán et al 2003 estrada and bodin 2008 we used indegree for quantifying wetland connectivity 2 4 scenarios for different wetlandscapes we used the population model to run simulations over different randomly generated wetland networks to investigate the role of wetland indegree on the local amphibian populations we first analyzed the behavior of the system on a single randomly generated wetland network single network scenario and then analyzed the relationship between wetlands indegree and population on a set of randomly generated wetland networks using a monte carlo simulation approach multi networks scenario to investigate the impact of wetland removal and restoration on the population we conducted wetland removal and restoration scenarios also using a monte carlo simulation approach wetland removal and restoration scenarios the single network scenario was used to explore the overall population dynamics and the local population dynamics in single wetlands of the network with each wetland characterized by a different value of indegree we randomly generated a network of 50 wetlands and ran the population dynamics model on it for generating the random network we used the algorithm developed by fachada et al 2014 this algorithm generates a random network configuration starting from deterministic topological parameters e g slope number of clusters total points and stochastic parameters e g average separation of line centers along the x axis average separation of line centers along the y axis cluster fatness stochastic parameters varied for each network and were randomly extracted from a uniform distribution of values stochastic parameters made it possible to define a network configuration that was not deterministically assigned but had some random variations the model was initialized to 20 amphibians per wetland and parameterized as in table 1 with a fixed simulation time horizon all the wetlands in the network were characterized by the same carrying capacity k this allowed us to explore the relationship between wetlands indegree and population since wetlands only differed for their indegree value without other confounding factors due to habitat difference we classified the wetlands of the network into three classes of indegree low medium or high using the jenks natural breaks classification a data clustering method that minimizes each class s average deviation from the class meanwhile maximizing each class s deviation from the means of the other cluster jenks 1967 we then explored the local population dynamics in three wetlands each one belonging to a different class of indegree specifically we investigated 1 the number of newborns produced in the wetlands and 2 the number of immigrants the multi network scenario consisted of running simulations for several randomly generated networks all having the same topologic characteristic this scenario served to assess if the observations made from the single network scenario could be considered general and to explore with more detail the relationship between indegree of the wetland and its local population we generated 100 networks of 50 wetlands each and ran the population dynamics model for each one of the networks for each network configuration the values of r k and μ were extracted from a uniform distribution within a fixed range within each experiment the parameters were kept constant and k was equal for all the wetlands the model was initialized with 20 amphibians per wetland with the range of values of parameters provided in table 1 i e the same demographic parameters of the single network scenario as in the single network scenario wetlands carrying capacity was set equal for all the wetlands of all the networks we ran the simulations over a period of 60 years checking that this time horizon was long enough to reach a steady state we compared the population size in each wetland with its indegree value pulling together all the wetlands in all the simulations we then explored how the population dynamics evolved within the wetland network analyzing the different contribution played by immigrants and newborns at each time step the wetlands within the random networks were divided according to their indegree into three classes low medium high using the jenks method we made pairwise comparison between the distribution of amphibian population abundance within classes using the kolmogorov smirnov and student s t test significance level 0 05 for both tests kolmogorov smirnov test was used to detect a statically significant difference between the distributions of the amphibian population abundance at the steady states in the different classes of indegree student s t test was used to detect a statistically significant difference between the means of the amphibian population abundance at the steady states in the different classes of indegree wetland removal and restoration scenarios were used to estimate the role of wetland indegree on amphibian population when a wetland was removed or restored the wetland removal scenario consisted of removing a wetland from the network simulating the amphibian population dynamics in the altered network and comparing the result with the non altered network for a given network the experiment was repeated by iteratively removing one wetland at a time for all the other wetlands we set an equal value for carrying capacity k we repeated the procedure with 100 randomly generated wetlands and then examined the relationship between the indegree of the wetland removed and the impact on the total population this relationship was independent from the carrying capacity of the removed wetland since all the wetlands have the same k the wetland restoration scenario consisted of increasing the carrying capacity of a wetland in the network by duplicating its original value while keeping constant the carrying capacity of the other wetlands in the network the population dynamics of the altered network was simulated and the results compared to the non altered network for a given network the experiment was repeated by iteratively enhancing one wetland at a time we repeated the procedure with 100 randomly generated wetlands and examined the relationship between the indegree of the wetland improved and the impact on the total population we generated 100 wetland networks and repeated the wetland restoration scenario for each network we then compared the population of the altered and non altered networks to analyze the impact of management strategies as in multi network scenario the wetlands within the random networks were divided into three classes low medium high according to their indegree using the jenks method we made pairwise comparison between the distributions of amphibian population abundance within classes with the kolmogorov smirnov and student s t test significance level 0 05 to detect statistically significant differences in the distribution and in the mean value respectively the methodology and all the simulations are implemented with matlab r2016a 3 results 3 1 single network scenario the simulation on the single network scenario showed that the total population abundance after a transient phase reached a steady state the local population in each wetland behaved in the same way this shows that the length of the time horizon 60 years was sufficient to represent the population dynamics of the wetland network hereafter we present the results referred to the steady state for the wetland network generated fig 2 a we calculated the frequency distribution of the indegree and divided the wetlands into three classes low medium and high fig 2b we investigated the abundance of the population in three wetlands marked in fig 2a each one belonging to a different class wetland a low indegree showed the smallest population wetland b medium indegree showed the largest population and wetland c high indegree showed an intermediate population wetland a had a relatively small proportion of newborns wetland b had a larger proportion of newborns compared to wetland a and c and wetland c had no newborns fig 3 3 2 multi network scenario the behavior of the single network scenario fig 3 was generalizable fig 4 the low indegree class had the smallest population the medium indegree class had the largest population and the high indegree class had an intermediate population fig 4a the kolmogorov smirnov test revealed that the data belonging to different indegree classes had significantly different distribution p value 0 001 the student s t test revealed that data belonging to different indegree classes had significantly different mean values p value 0 02 the contribution of immigrants and newborns to the population for the different classes is shown in the pie charts in fig 4b wetlands in all indegree classes showed that the majority of the population was composed of newborns but that the proportion of newborns in the population of the high indegree class was not as high as in the low or medium indegree classes this was because the pie chart could not capture the natural oscillation given by the model of the population dynamics but only displayed a median value the multi network scenario showed a non linear relationship fig 5 a between wetland indegree and wetland population as indegree increased from low to medium the population increased at medium indegree the population reached a peak and as indegree increased from median to high the population decreased the number of immigrants showed a linear increase as indegree increased fig 5b and the number of newborns showed a non linear relationship similar to the total population fig 5c 3 3 wetland removal and restoration scenarios the wetland removal scenario showed greater negative effects on the amphibian population when the removed wetland belonged to a medium indegree class fig 6 b in contrast the wetland restoration scenario showed greater positive effects on the amphibian population when the restored wetland belonged to the high indegree class fig 6a fig 7 directly compares the wetland removal and restoration scenarios by showing the deviation in the population abundance of the entire wetland network between altered and non altered networks based on the class of indegree of the altered wetland within the network the kolmogorov smirnov test revealed that the data belonging to different indegree classes had significantly different distribution p value 0 001 the student s t test revealed that the data belonging to different indegree classes had significantly different mean values p value 0 001 4 discussion wetlandscapes sustain sink source population dynamics with individual wetlands playing different roles sources or sinks according to their indegree we identified source wetlands where local birth rate is greater than mortality and sink wetlands where local mortality is greater than the birth rate and the population is maintained by continued immigration from source wetlands nearby among sink wetlands we identified two types those in which the population goes extinct in the absence of immigration and those in which immigration maintains the population above the carrying capacity such a distinction corresponds to true sinks and pseudo sinks respectively according to watkinson and sutherland s 1995 terminology mortality in pseudo sinks is caused by excessive immigration which provokes excessive mortality due to density effect the decline in population growth caused by crowding predators and competition hixon and johnson 2009 if immigration stops in a pseudo sink the population would decline but only to the carrying capacity both true sinks and pseudo sinks have been observed in nature watkinson et al 1989 engelhard et al 2017 erickson et al 2017 indegree is a useful proxy for classifying wetlands into sources sinks and pseudo sinks wetlands with a low indegree representing relatively isolated wetlands could be classified as sinks because few amphibians migrated to these wetlands and consequently they produced few newborns wetlands with medium indegree could be classified as sources because they had the highest population in fact the immigrants arriving in the wetlands and the generated newborns were fully sustained by wetlands resources expressed by the carrying capacity k specifically the population within each wetland did not exceed carrying capacity and a large number of amphibians was able to successfully emigrate from these wetlands these wetlands were highly productive in fact the number of newborns exceeded the number of immigrants and contributed positively to the total wetland population growth wetlands with a high indegree representing relatively connected wetlands could be classified as pseudo sinks because the largest number of immigrants arrived at these wetlands but the available resources in these wetlands were insufficient to sustain both the immigrant population and the generated offspring the number of newborns declined until all of them died due to a density effect that is the population of these wetlands exceeded carrying capacity most of the amphibians in these wetlands were immigrants since the breeding success within the wetland was low due to the competition for resources during the breeding phase fortuna et al 2006 it should be noted that all the wetlands had the same carrying capacity value k within each simulation therefore the difference between non competition for resources in source wetlands and competition for resources in pseudo sink was due to differences in the wetland s indegree management strategies have different impacts on amphibian populations depending on the indegree of the wetland for example the largest negative impact to the amphibian population was produced when the removed wetland belonged to the medium indegree class since a source wetland was removed fig 6b removing wetlands with high amphibian productivity results in a large loss to the amphibian population of the wetlandscape furthermore the largest positive impact to the amphibian population was produced when the enhance wetland bellowed to the high indegree class since the enhanced wetland was originally limited by its carrying capacity i e pseudo sink wetlands fig 6a in fact restoring wetlands with high indegree means that a high number of immigrants can now come to the wetland and reproduce successfully potentially shifting the wetland from a pseudo sink to a source in contrast restoring wetlands with low or medium indegree i e source or sinks did not lead to an increase in the amphibian population because they were limited by low indegree and not by low carrying capacity wetland removal and restoration strategies produced impacts on amphibian population dynamics that varied with wetland indegree fig 6 the impacts were not symmetrical fig 7 a loss in the amphibian population caused by wetland removal could not be compensated equally by wetland restoration in fact wetland removal had cascading consequences to the remaining wetlands because of 1 reducing the number or density of individuals dispersing and 2 increasing the dispersal distance among the remaining wetlands and thus reducing effective indegree in the network semlitsch and bodie 1998 in contrast wetland restoration had cascading consequences to the remaining wetlands because of reducing density effect of individuals breeding the modelled amphibian population dynamics are supported by empirical studies eggert et al 2015 arntzen et al 2017 lannoo et al 2017 amphibians occur on a continuum of sink source and pseudo sinks wetlands and contribute differentially to the population of the wetlandscape eggert et al 2015 knowledge of the sinks sources and pseudo sinks behavior can improve wetland management strategies designed for conservation of species at risk pulliam 1988 lawton 1993 eggert et al 2015 for example reintroducing a species into presently unoccupied parts of a species range is more likely to succeed if the reintroduction occurs into a source wetland rather than a sink wetland pulliam 1988 furthermore wetland removal could focus on wetlands with low indegree and wetland restoration could focus on wetlands with high indegree to increase species population with these insights the conservation strategies can include design of wetland networks to optimize sink source dynamics in the future our model can be improved by adding a two step migration system which would enable to simulate the migration from breeding habitat to winter habitat at the end of summer and the dispersal from winter habitat to breeding habitat at the beginning of spring in addition simulation scenarios where wetlands are added to the network could be analyzed to assess the wetland positions leading to the highest positive impact on the population 5 conclusion it is important to recognize the role of individual wetlands as defined by their connectivity within wetlandscapes the adoption of a single object perspective for wetland management is incomplete given the flux of energy materials and organisms that occur among wetlands and in light of our results wetlands can have different roles sink source pseudo sinks in sustaining an amphibian population within wetlandscapes wetland indegree is a key property for 1 quantifying wetland connectivity and 2 classifying wetlands into sinks sources and pseudo sinks wetland removal and restoration are not compensatory rather these management strategies have different impacts on species population dynamics depending on the indegree among wetlands for example wetland removal can result in population loss that is not compensated by wetland restoration understanding the role of indegree of wetlands within wetlandscapes and the differential impacts of wetland management strategies on these connections is important for sustainable management of wetland dependent species at risk acknowledgement we wish to
