7270,there are serious concerns between forest and water quantity chinese extensive land area makes the relationship more complicated thus the effects of forest structure on hydrological processes in china were not fully comprehended in this research forest s hydrological functions including rainfall partitioning litter interception evapotranspiration et were analyzed in china the results showed that throughfall was the largest proportion of gross precipitation with fraction between 69 3 8 8 and 84 4 5 6 then was canopy interception which varied from 14 6 1 4 to 29 1 3 3 throughfall was correlated with gross precipitation canopy thickness and canopy density canopy interception was correlated with gross precipitation lai canopy density biomass mixed degree uniform angle index aggregation index stemflow accounted for only 1 2 0 32 of gross precipitation with the greatest fraction of 2 1 0 2 in xbh site and the least fraction of 0 3 0 1 in db site gross precipitation was the main factor in determining stemflow db site had the greatest litter interception 7 7 0 8 mm and hb site had the least 0 9 0 3 mm litter interception had closer correlation with undecomposed litter mass 0 66 than total litter mass 0 46 path coefficient analysis showed that stand density shannon wiener index litter mass size ratio had greater impact on litter interception than other factors et was mainly influenced by precipitation and it also correlated with lai canopy density and biomass in north china et percentage the ratio of et and precipitation was 82 7 109 5 while it decreased to 63 1 88 5 in south china et demand in xbs site was larger than precipitation et percentage increased with increasing latitude and elevation decreased with increasing temperature keywords forest structure rainfall partitioning evapotranspiration factor 1 introduction forests have impacts on improving water availability at regional and global scale ellison et al 2012 they were also considered as the main measure for soil and water conservation due to their positive functions in reduce erosion komatsu et al 2008 however forests reduced water supply for they evaporated greater rainwater than other land use type beschta et al 2000 the controversy between forest and water has attracted considerable attention for more than 200 years andréassian 2004 the complexity of hydrological process caused the fruitless debate multiple factors such as climatology geography forest type structure etc influence the process liu et al 2001 among all the influence factors forests were the most prominent factor due to human beings had great effect on forests distribution benyon and doody 2015 it is an important step to characterizing the roles of forests played in hydrological cycle in terms of rainfall partitioning evapotranspiration et infiltration and runoff generation love et al 2010 siles et al 2010 forest structure re routed vertical precipitation pathways by canopy canopy partitioned rainwater into interception throughfall and stemflow fig 1 rainfall partitioning is the first and most important process that forests act on water cycle livesley et al 2014 while the interactions between forest structure and rainwater pathway are difficult to find out herwitz 1985 zimmermann et al 2007 during rainfall events in summer raindrops are intercepted by canopy other raindrops fall through the canopy directly to the ground which is called throughfall crockford and richardson 2000 brauman et al 2010 most of the interception rainwater 10 50 of gross precipitation evaporate back to atmosphere in several hours after precipitation event klaassen et al 1998 carlyle moses 2004 while the left 0 12 of gross precipitation flow to ground via trunks or stems which is called stemflow dunkerley 2000 previous researches were done to record rainfall partitioning table 1 it differed from forest type and structure generally interception was not considered as a necessary process for flood process but interception influenced antecedent soil moisture condition which was important for the flood generation tsiko et al 2012 stemflow was important resource of ground water stemflow also contributed to soil chemistry johnson and lehmann 2006 horizontal precipitation was also one of the most important hydrological inputs ingraham and matthews 1988 it was reported as one factor in determining sequoia sempervirens distribution cooper 1917 horizontal precipitation like fog was crucial forest characteristic factor in mountains ingraham and matthews 1988 0 17 of precipitation input was from horizontal precipitation dawson 1998 forests re routed the pathway of horizontal precipitation also by canopy interception ingwersen 1985 the process was influenced by forest structure humid degree wind speed temperature etc compared to vertical precipitation fog or dew water were less than 0 5 mm each night much less than vertical precipitation simultaneously in actual precipitation monitoring vertical and horizontal precipitations were indistinguishable dawson 1998 therefore they were always observed together so was this research litter refers to all dead forestry materials above the soil surface helvey and patric 1965 it performs important ecological functions as well as forests including conserve soil and nutrition intercept precipitation provide habitat for organism sangha et al 2006 compared to canopy interception litter interception accounted for only a small faction of gross precipitation however litter interception played significant roles in water cycle process bulcock and jewitt 2012 litter also helped in limiting soil moisture loss from evaporation reduced the amplitude of soil temperature by insulating the surface sangha et al 2006 furthermore the function of soil conservation should be noted particularly in the condition that canopy increased raindrop sizes and consequently accelerated soil erosion putuhena and cordery 2000 wei et al 2005 litter could prevent soil particle detachment effectively by absorbing the energy of raindrops bulcock and jewitt 2012 previous researches on litter were mainly focused on the rainwater storage capacity of litter few researches were conducted on the function of litter interception in water cycle et accounted for a large component of gross precipitation exerted great influence on the flow amount oishi et al 2010 it is an integrated term composed of plant transpiration soil evaporation and canopy intercepted precipitation raz yaseef et al 2012 it was a general agreement that et from forest was higher than et from grassland and shrub when concerned about et for forest types there was contrastive results of whether conifer forests had greater or less et than broad leaved forests benyon and doody 2015 forest was considered as a prominent feature of watershed streamflow brauman et al 2010 the relationship between forest and streamflow can help understand water resource availability clearly love et al 2010 the most scientific way was hydrological comparison in watersheds ingwersen 1985 paired watershed design was invented to research forest s influences on the water cycle mcculloch and robinson 1993 with paired watershed and long term monitoring various results were reported table 2 these results showed that in arid areas forests had effective function in increase stream flow while in tropical and subtropical areas forest coverage change had little influence on stream flow wang and zhang 2001 research scale also appeared to be a major issue ellison et al 2012 in small scale studies the effects of forests on water balance was typically assumed to be negative zhang et al 2001 andréassian 2004 while large scale modeling predictions showed that deforestation led to runoff decrease ellison et al 2012 wang et al 2015 although hydrological impacts of forest on water yield were proved by above researches the fact remains that forests have different impacts on runoff with specific climatological contexts andréassian 2004 both meteorological and forest conditions could result in various hydrological responses made the understanding complicated ellison et al 2012 in general most of these researches focused on the relationships between forest and precipitation characteristics existed forest structure studies were conducted in specific research site it is still need further research for comprehensive understanding in this research eight research sites in china were set to conduct stand investigation the objectives were to 1 partition the rainwater balance of the forest by determining throughfall stemflow and interception in china 2 investigate litter interception 3 quantify et of forest land 4 obtain relationships between forest structure factors and hydrological process regionally 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites description landscapes meteorology and forest conditions varied significantly due to the vast territory of china southern china is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges to the west sit major mountain ranges high plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north such as the taklimakan and the gobi desert climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer china is owning over 8000 kinds of tree species the 7th national forest inventory in 2004 2008 revealed that there were 195 5 million ha forests covering 20 4 of the country s land area dai et al 2013 temperature and precipitation combination factor was considered as the main driving force of forest distribution fang and yoda 1990 forest coverages were higher in southern provinces mean coverage was greater than 35 forests coverages in northeastern and central provinces were in the range of 25 35 and 15 25 respectively provinces in the northwestern region had the lowest forest coverage less than 15 hu et al 2015 this research was conducted in 8 representative sites in china 18 54 n 73 135 e fig 2 a concerned xb region had poor vegetation condition fig 2b and precipitation shortage problem xb region had three research sites geographical characteristics of these eight research sites were summarized in table 3 2 2 forest stand investigation investigation data collected between 2008 and 2012 were relied to process the research in each site various stand plots 30 m 30 m were established plot number in each site was determined by the stand area these plots occupied full range of typical forest stand formations found in the region fig 3 plots were placed at least 200 m apart and as far as possible included a single forest species element locations with recent or large canopy gaps were avoided all methods relied upon the same basic measure of floristic dissimilarity between sites in each plot all trees with the diameter at breast height dbh greater than 3 cm were measured for girth and identified to species fig 3b leaf area index lai of forestry leaves was measured by a lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences species dbh height position crown canopy density stand density wood cover soil depth depths of litter forest distribution pattern mixed degree tree size ratio biomass in the plot were recorded several indexes were calculated and employed to explore the relationships between forest structure factors and hydrological responses aggregation index ai responded for quantify aggregation levels within a single stand calculation of ai for class i is based on

throughfall observations a hobo weather station onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa was installed in an open area within each site fig 3a recorded parameters included precipitation barometric pressure wind speed net radiation air temperature and relative humidity all the parameters were measured in 15 min time intervals throughfall investigations were conducted in 30 m 30 m experimental plots several hobo rg3 rainfall gauges were set in the plot randomly during the research period fig 3c all throughfall data were recorded in 1 min time interval automatically fig 3d 2 4 stemflow and interception observations stemflow investigations were conducted in 30 m 30 m experimental plots stemflow was collected by an open pvc tube mounted around each typical tree then the tube was sealed with neutral silicone sealant fig 3f collected stems were connected to a hobo rg3 m gauge all stemflow data from precipitation events throughout the year were recorded in 1 min time interval automatically the trees were divided into several series as the diameter cm results expressed as millimeters which was calculated from eq 5 5 sf i 1 n c i m i s 1000 where n is the number of trunk diameter series c i is the stemflow amount of the ith series trunk diameter ml in specific precipitation event m i is the tree s number of the ith series trunk diameter s is the plot area m2 under forest conditions vegetation interception can be divided into canopy and litter interception canopy interception is the difference between the gross precipitation falling on the top of the canopy and the net precipitation falling through the canopy the net precipitation consists of throughfall and stemflow based on this theory canopy interception was calculated by eq 6 6 p i p p t p s where is pi canopy interception mm p is gross precipitation mm pt is throughfall mm ps is stemflow mm the water storage capacity of litter is the maximum water amount that litter can store inside litter litter cannot store more moisture after reaching their storage capacity so litter interception can be described by the saturation function in this research each research plot was divided into 36 investigate units 5m 5 m each 1 m 1 m litter sample was randomly collected from each unit litter samples were used to measure their water content and water holding capacity in the laboratory litter collection time was along with forest investigation litter interception was calculated by the litter interception model established by zagyvai kiss et al 2014 eq 7 7 e s s w i 1 1 e p t s w i 1 where e s is litter interception mm s is the storage capacity mm w i 1 is the antecedent water content mm p t is throughfall mm litter interception result calculated by this model represented the maximum interception amount of each precipitation event 2 5 estimating et for forests et measurements were conducted in experimental plots sap flux was measured in typical trees by thermal dissipation probe tdp to avoid solar radiation tdp was installed in the north of trunk at the height of 1 3 m there were four probes for each tdp fig 3e named s0 s1 s2 and s3 they were 10 15 cm apart from each other all the probes were wrapped by radiation shield sap flux was recorded in 5 min time intervals automatically by the data collector the calculation equation was granier 1987 8 j s 0 714 d tmax d tact 1

parameters of dbh sapwood area model ag is the ground area of the plot 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall partitioning characteristics monthly rainfall distributions in eight sites during the study period were shown in fig 4 there was a usual climatological pattern that winter was drought and majority of the rainfall events occurred during summer months research sites in southern china had greater precipitation than sites in northern china gross precipitations in xn hd zn sites were 938 2 1561 6 and 1379 4 mm respectively they were humid areas majority months had gross precipitation greater than 100 mm gross precipitation in db site was 632 7 mm it was semi arid area sites in xb had the least rainfall mean monthly precipitation was 36 3 12 5 mm rainfall partitioning in forest stands varied among sites in china due to various factors fig 5 that was for forest types and climatic conditions were various among sites crockford and richardson 2000 forest canopy and biomass intercepted rainwater so that reduced throughfall carlyle moses 2004 the connectivity of above ground biomass and trunk properties formed stemflow pathways hamburg and lin 1998 thus impacted on stemflow amount climate conditions impacted on the intensity and duration of precipitation events and evaporation rate from the wet canopy oishi et al 2010 3 1 1 throughfall and impact factors throughfall accounted for the largest proportion of gross precipitation it ranged from 69 3 8 8 to 84 4 5 6 among research sites it was the least in hd site and the largest in xbs site mean proportion of throughfall in china was 76 4 5 66 throughfall was the main pathway for rainwater to reach the ground latitude parker 1983 elevation rustad et al 1994 seasonality hamburg and lin 1998 precipitation soulsby 1997 forest species composition parker 1983 and land use hamburg and lin 1998 were reported to impact throughfall gross precipitation was the most relevant factor for precipitation determined the input amount of throughfall marin et al 2000 data analyzed from hb xbg and hd indicated that there were positive linear relationships with high correlations r 2 0 96 between gross precipitation and throughfall table 4 throughfall increased with increasing precipitation table 4 linear relationships were also reported by carlyle moses 2004 shachnovich et al 2008 xiao and mcpherson 2011 for matorral pine forest and urban forests no significant relation was found between rainfall intensity and throughfall p 0 055 the research from shachnovich et al 2008 came to the same conclusion rainfall patterns acted on the linearity and slope of regression equation high intensity and short duration rainfall might yield greater throughfall than rainfall events of low intensity and long duration siles et al 2010 lower determining coefficients due to that precipitation in china was less and in longer duration marin et al 2000 canopy thickness and canopy density were both in linear relationships with throughfall the determine coefficients were smaller than that of precipitation throughfall decreased with their increase krämer and hölscher 2009 found that greater canopy density was negatively correlated with throughfall llorens and domingo 2007 reported significant negative relationships between dbh lai and throughfall tobon et al 2000 reported that canopy gap and lai were the main parameters determining rainfall partitioning that was for larger canopy intercepted more rainwater so that led to the decrease of throughfall komatsu et al 2008 3 1 2 canopy interception and impact factors canopy interception accounted for 22 4 5 2 of gross precipitation forests in hd site intercepted the largest proportion of rainfall 29 1 3 3 of the rainwater was intercepted interception in hb and zn sites also accounted for larger proportions with percentile of 28 3 and 25 4 respectively it was the least in xbs site only 14 6 1 4 of the rainwater was intercepted canopy interceptions of three sites in xb region were lower due to the lower coverage and forest biomass factors that influenced canopy interception amount were in three main aspects they were precipitation tree characteristics and meteorological conditions staelens et al 2008 precipitation determined rainwater amount which drives canopy interception process xiao and mcpherson 2011 there was power relationship between precipitation and canopy interception table 5 geographic pattern of canopy interception in china fig 4 was consistent with precipitation fig 5 precipitations of southern sites xn hd and zn sites were greater than northern sites canopy interceptions were also greater than northern sites rainfall pattern also impacted on canopy interception rainfall of high intensity and short duration presented lower interception values than low intensity long duration events and if rainfall was not continuous even for short periods during an event higher values of interception result crockford and richardson 2000 canopy interception was greater than 50 when gross precipitation was less than 5 mm or rainfall intensity was less than 10 mm h wei and zhou 1991 liu et al 2001 rustad et al 1994 suggests that higher rainfall intensity generated a stronger impact on vegetation reduced maximum canopy storage and lower interception loss this was might for dry canopy had larger water holding capacity when it was wet the capacity would be limited canopy interception was also affected by forest structure table 5 canopy interception of hb was greater than those of other northern sites this was for lai in hb was 3 2 1 3 greater than lai i xb and db lai was in linear relationships with interception in po pt sb and pt qv forests canopy density biomass mixed degree and aggregation index were all in exponential relationships with interception these factors increase led to increasing canopy interception canopy area was the crucial factor in determining interception amount livesley et al 2014 interception was reported to be higher in conifers than in evergreen broad leaved forest this was caused primarily by the seasonal rainfall in china fig 4 conifer forests had greater canopy interception loss in winter komatsu et al 2008 there was another reason reported by crockford and richardson 2000 needle clusters could hold intercepted rainfall more securely than the vertically aligned board leaves crockford and richardson 2000 only uniform angle index had negative correlation with interception regular tree distribution led to greater interception this was for that regular tree distribution formed greater lai which could intercept greater rainwater livesley et al 2014 3 1 3 stemflow and impact factors mean stemflow proportion was 1 2 0 7 in china in xbh site stemflow was the largest 2 1 0 2 of the rainwater reached ground through stemflow in db site stemflow only accounted for 0 3 0 1 of the gross precipitation reported stemflow was less than 1 in lowland rain forests bruijnzeel et al 2011 while stemflow was 8 9 for pines with up to 13 1 for rainfall events in which precipitation was greater than 25 mm crockford and richardson 1990 stemflow was only a very small proportion of precipitation and sometimes it was neglected in some hydrological balance studies liu 1997 marin et al 2000 however stemflow was particularly important in dry lands bhark and small 2003 it contributed about 10 of the annual soil water input chang and matzner 2000 navar and bryan 1990 found that stemflow contributed greater water than rainwater source in mexico s northeast semi arid shrubs durocher 1990 johnson and lehmann 2006 reported that stemflow was preferentially recharge to groundwater sources through channeling along root pathways latter research by návar 2011 indicated that stemflow infiltrated deep into soil through roots it could be potential source of groundwater recharge forest diverted significant stemflow volumes to the stem base where it subsequently infiltrates deep into the soil and remains available for plant uptake llorens and domingo 2007 simultaneously nutrient contents in stemflow were greater than those in rainfall and throughfall wei and zhou 1991 stemflow might be dominate nutrients and moisture resources of the forests in dry hilltops like xb region had poor precipitation stemflow was crucial for forest grow long time evolution led to forests in xb need stemflow urgently therefore stemflow proportions in three sites were greater than southern sites stemflow proportions of forests were variable across china the variability of stemflow among forest types can be attributed in part to differences in climatic patterns meteorological conditions and tree species andré et al 2008 and levia et al 2010 both reported that stemflow was related to tree species and size including factors like crown size leaf shape and orientation branch angle and bark roughness aboal et al 1999 however stemflow was mainly determined by the precipitation table 6 significant relationships between stemflow and stand factors were not found in this research this was for that at the beginning of stemflow generation forest factors had great impacts on stemflow process once the canopy interception capacity reached its peak stemflow generation had been documented to closely match the gross precipitation durocher 1990 therefore precipitation was the main factor in determining mean stemflow in hb and hd sites stemflow increased linearly with precipitation increase in xbg site they were in polynomial relationship in xb forest previous studies also indicated that stemflow increased with the magnitude of a precipitation event paltineanu and starr 2000 kuraji et al 2001 xiao and mcpherson 2011 andré et al 2008 reported that stemflow was linearly related to rainfall 3 2 litter layer interception characteristics litter interception and mass in each site were investigated and figured in fig 6 litter interception in db was the largest 7 7 0 8 mm rainfall was intercepted then were the litters in xbg zn and hd sites litter could intercept 6 0 4 0 mm 5 0 2 4 mm and 4 6 2 1 mm rainfall respectively litter interception in xbh site was 3 6 0 5 mm litters in xbs and xn sites had the same interception of 1 7 0 3 mm litter in hb site had the least interception only 0 9 0 3 mm rainfall could be intercepted the right axis in fig 6 was litter mass mean litter mass in china was 19 4 13 1 t hm2 among all the research sites db owned the most litter mass up to 40 2 3 2 t hm2 litter mass in hd site was the least about 9 3 2 1 t hm2 fig 6 illustrated that sites in north of china db hb xbs xbh xbg had more litter than sites xn hd zn in south of china in some researches litter interception was neglected in hydrological cycle however gerrits et al 2010 found forest floor interception values of 20 of throughfall litter layer intercepted throughfall and evaporated to atmosphere in several hours made forest land had higher transpiration rates therefore litter interception was an important component in ecosystem according to helvey and patric 1965 litter interception was mainly determined by litter amount and drying rate climate and water capacity determine the drying rate helvey and patric 1965 bulcock and jewitt 2012 putuhena and cordery 2000 reported that the water storage capacity of litter from pinus radiata increased with litter amount two axes in fig 6 showed that litter interception had positive correlation with the litter mass when correlated litter interception with litter mass standard deviation σ 3 14 undecomposed litter mass σ 6 78 and semi decomposed litter mass σ 7 65 they could be described as linear relationships fig 7 litter interception had closer relation with undecomposed litter mass this was for the water storage capacity of litter decreased after decomposition litter decomposition was cell uptake and metabolism caused by microbial species or communities high temperature might be the reason caused that litter amount and interception in xn hd zn less than that in northern sites decomposition led to nutrients release and structure destroy and water storage capacity decreased sangha et al 2006 each 1 f rise in temperature increased the litter decomposition rate by approximately 1 shachnovich et al 2008 chemical composition and morphology caused by tree species were also impacted on litter decomposition smaller and thinner leaves might contribute to faster litter decomposition sangha et al 2006 marin et al 2000 reported that litter interception increased with increasing throughfall however interception was also a threshold process as certain rainwater amount was required for interception before rainwater infiltration and runoff generation sangha et al 2006 interception was usually described by the saturation function because litter cannot store more rainwater after reaching their storage capacity tsiko et al 2012 litter interception was influenced by numerous structure factors in this research 17 forest structure factors table 7 were investigated to process path coefficient analysis direct and indirect effects of factors were evaluated by path coefficient analysis method which was calculated using spss statistical program the analysis results showed that x 4 x 8 x 11 x 14 x 15 had greater impact on litter interception table 7 path coefficient indicated the degree order was x 11 x 14 x 8 x 15 x 4 x 11 had the greatest impact on litter interception its path coefficient was 1 31 direct effects of x 14 x 8 were greater than their indirect effect direct effect of x 4 was the least its indirect effect was greater than direct index x 4 impact on litter interception mainly through the litter mass 3 3 evapotranspiration forest consumed a large portion of rainwater to atmosphere through et with a mean et percentage the ratio of et and precipitation of 86 05 in north china et percentage ranged from 82 7 to 109 5 from 63 1 to 88 5 in the south et percentages were relatively greater in northern forests due to the collective effects of lower temperature and higher latitude wei et al 2005 et percentage increased with decreasing temperature and increasing latitude fig 8 a and b σ was 7 82 or 7 29 respectively drier air and lower precipitation in the north made potential evaporation fully realized whereas the opposite occurred in the south with humid air and higher precipitation they were not conducive to et therefore et percentage was relatively low in southern sites et percentage increased with increasing elevation fig 8 c σ was 100 26 hd site also had greater et percentage for the higher elevation et percentage was found to be highly variable among various forest sites owing to meteorological and forest conditions benyon and doody 2015 it was less than 20 at a japanese site where p was 2405 mm komatsu et al 2008 it accounted for more than 90 at an australian site where p was 1179 mm crockford and richardson 1990 previous research showed et percentage ranged from 20 to 90 all over the world rich 1952 özhan et al 2010 li et al 2010 large fraction of precipitation was evaporated to atmosphere through forest canopy litter and soil this showed that forest was very important to hydrological cycle the results showed that transpiration was still the largest portion of precipitation in comparison to canopy and litter interception in xbs site et percentage was 109 5 which indicated that et demand was larger than precipitation due to high transpiration of the forest not only in field observation plot scale studies also obtain similar results dai et al 2013 this phenomenon illustrated that trees in xbs sites consumed extra water resources from infiltration excess overland flow soil stored water groundwater or stream water klaassen et al 1998 domingo et al 2001 wang et al 2011 in this condition forest returned larger amount of local water resources to atmosphere thus forest had negative impact on available water there was evidence that some species particularly seedlings grown trees use less water than others because of differing vegetative characteristics andré et al 2008 these kinds of tree species should be promoted in arid areas to use rainwater resources reasonably annual forest et was highly variable among eight sites in china due to the differences in precipitation temperature latitude forest species forest structure etc et was strongly related to precipitation fig 9 a that illustrated that annual et was mainly controlled by precipitation amount fig 9a this agreed to study from zhang et al 2001 wang et al 2011 and özhan et al 2010 china owned vast geographic territory with high precipitation variability south china owed greater precipitation than north china fig 4 therefore et in southern sites were significantly greater than those in northern sites table 8 column 3 et had been carried out relation analysis with forest structure factors in hb site logarithmic relationships were established in four forest types between et and lai in hd site their relationship was exponential they were in positive regression et increased with the lai increasing fig 9b this was for that lai increase reflected larger branches and leaves led to the increase of transpiration areas therefore mature and fast growing forests with high lai resulted in less runoff and more et wang et al 2011 in previous researches li et al 2010 indicated that et was significantly related to lai especially in rainy season fig 9b indicated that cl qv and ph were in southern sites they had greater et than others this was might for that higher precipitation led to greater interception which was part of et et followed a polynomial trend with canopy density larger canopy led to greater et fig 9c this was for that lai and canopy both led to interception increase so increased et indirectly biomass also had positive regression relationship with et in hb site et increased with biomass increasing they were described as power function fig 9d biomass was the main resource of forest litter layer bulcock and jewitt 2012 biomass increase could enhance both canopy density and litter amount which led to greater et dunkerley 2000 et of shrubbery was significantly lower than arbor trees for the lower canopy however et would not increase with lai canopy and biomass endlessly well stocked forest vegetation appeared to consumed water at about same rate regardless of species or forest structure brauman et al 2010 4 conclusion hydrological responses to precipitation forest species and structure in eight sites across china were explored in this research throughfall was the largest proportion of gross precipitation with fraction between 69 3 8 8 and 84 4 5 6 throughfall was correlated with gross precipitation canopy thickness and canopy density canopy interception varied from 14 6 1 4 to 29 1 3 3 of gross precipitation canopy interception was correlated with precipitation lai canopy density biomass mixed degree uniform angle index aggregation index stemflow accounted for only 1 2 0 7 of gross precipitation with the greatest fraction of 2 1 0 2 in xbh site and the least fraction of 0 3 0 1 in db site stemflow was correlated with precipitation litter interception varied among eight sites the greatest litter interception was 7 7 0 8 mm in db site and the least litter interception was 0 9 0 3 mm in hb site litter interception had closer correlation with undecomposed litter mass 0 66 than total litter mass 0 46 path coefficient analysis showed that stand density shannon wiener index litter mass size ratio had greater impact on litter interception among all forest structure factors evapotranspiration et was mainly determined by precipitation and it also correlated with lai canopy density and biomass et percentage the ratio of et and precipitation increased with increasing latitude and elevation decreased with increasing temperature et consumed large portion of rainwater it ranged from 82 7 to 109 5 in northern sites and from 63 1 to 88 5 in southern sites of gross precipitation et demand in xbs site was larger than precipitation acknowledgements the authors are greatly indebted to the national key technology r d program p r china grant number 2015bad07b030201 and 2011 collaborative

7270,there are serious concerns between forest and water quantity chinese extensive land area makes the relationship more complicated thus the effects of forest structure on hydrological processes in china were not fully comprehended in this research forest s hydrological functions including rainfall partitioning litter interception evapotranspiration et were analyzed in china the results showed that throughfall was the largest proportion of gross precipitation with fraction between 69 3 8 8 and 84 4 5 6 then was canopy interception which varied from 14 6 1 4 to 29 1 3 3 throughfall was correlated with gross precipitation canopy thickness and canopy density canopy interception was correlated with gross precipitation lai canopy density biomass mixed degree uniform angle index aggregation index stemflow accounted for only 1 2 0 32 of gross precipitation with the greatest fraction of 2 1 0 2 in xbh site and the least fraction of 0 3 0 1 in db site gross precipitation was the main factor in determining stemflow db site had the greatest litter interception 7 7 0 8 mm and hb site had the least 0 9 0 3 mm litter interception had closer correlation with undecomposed litter mass 0 66 than total litter mass 0 46 path coefficient analysis showed that stand density shannon wiener index litter mass size ratio had greater impact on litter interception than other factors et was mainly influenced by precipitation and it also correlated with lai canopy density and biomass in north china et percentage the ratio of et and precipitation was 82 7 109 5 while it decreased to 63 1 88 5 in south china et demand in xbs site was larger than precipitation et percentage increased with increasing latitude and elevation decreased with increasing temperature keywords forest structure rainfall partitioning evapotranspiration factor 1 introduction forests have impacts on improving water availability at regional and global scale ellison et al 2012 they were also considered as the main measure for soil and water conservation due to their positive functions in reduce erosion komatsu et al 2008 however forests reduced water supply for they evaporated greater rainwater than other land use type beschta et al 2000 the controversy between forest and water has attracted considerable attention for more than 200 years andréassian 2004 the complexity of hydrological process caused the fruitless debate multiple factors such as climatology geography forest type structure etc influence the process liu et al 2001 among all the influence factors forests were the most prominent factor due to human beings had great effect on forests distribution benyon and doody 2015 it is an important step to characterizing the roles of forests played in hydrological cycle in terms of rainfall partitioning evapotranspiration et infiltration and runoff generation love et al 2010 siles et al 2010 forest structure re routed vertical precipitation pathways by canopy canopy partitioned rainwater into interception throughfall and stemflow fig 1 rainfall partitioning is the first and most important process that forests act on water cycle livesley et al 2014 while the interactions between forest structure and rainwater pathway are difficult to find out herwitz 1985 zimmermann et al 2007 during rainfall events in summer raindrops are intercepted by canopy other raindrops fall through the canopy directly to the ground which is called throughfall crockford and richardson 2000 brauman et al 2010 most of the interception rainwater 10 50 of gross precipitation evaporate back to atmosphere in several hours after precipitation event klaassen et al 1998 carlyle moses 2004 while the left 0 12 of gross precipitation flow to ground via trunks or stems which is called stemflow dunkerley 2000 previous researches were done to record rainfall partitioning table 1 it differed from forest type and structure generally interception was not considered as a necessary process for flood process but interception influenced antecedent soil moisture condition which was important for the flood generation tsiko et al 2012 stemflow was important resource of ground water stemflow also contributed to soil chemistry johnson and lehmann 2006 horizontal precipitation was also one of the most important hydrological inputs ingraham and matthews 1988 it was reported as one factor in determining sequoia sempervirens distribution cooper 1917 horizontal precipitation like fog was crucial forest characteristic factor in mountains ingraham and matthews 1988 0 17 of precipitation input was from horizontal precipitation dawson 1998 forests re routed the pathway of horizontal precipitation also by canopy interception ingwersen 1985 the process was influenced by forest structure humid degree wind speed temperature etc compared to vertical precipitation fog or dew water were less than 0 5 mm each night much less than vertical precipitation simultaneously in actual precipitation monitoring vertical and horizontal precipitations were indistinguishable dawson 1998 therefore they were always observed together so was this research litter refers to all dead forestry materials above the soil surface helvey and patric 1965 it performs important ecological functions as well as forests including conserve soil and nutrition intercept precipitation provide habitat for organism sangha et al 2006 compared to canopy interception litter interception accounted for only a small faction of gross precipitation however litter interception played significant roles in water cycle process bulcock and jewitt 2012 litter also helped in limiting soil moisture loss from evaporation reduced the amplitude of soil temperature by insulating the surface sangha et al 2006 furthermore the function of soil conservation should be noted particularly in the condition that canopy increased raindrop sizes and consequently accelerated soil erosion putuhena and cordery 2000 wei et al 2005 litter could prevent soil particle detachment effectively by absorbing the energy of raindrops bulcock and jewitt 2012 previous researches on litter were mainly focused on the rainwater storage capacity of litter few researches were conducted on the function of litter interception in water cycle et accounted for a large component of gross precipitation exerted great influence on the flow amount oishi et al 2010 it is an integrated term composed of plant transpiration soil evaporation and canopy intercepted precipitation raz yaseef et al 2012 it was a general agreement that et from forest was higher than et from grassland and shrub when concerned about et for forest types there was contrastive results of whether conifer forests had greater or less et than broad leaved forests benyon and doody 2015 forest was considered as a prominent feature of watershed streamflow brauman et al 2010 the relationship between forest and streamflow can help understand water resource availability clearly love et al 2010 the most scientific way was hydrological comparison in watersheds ingwersen 1985 paired watershed design was invented to research forest s influences on the water cycle mcculloch and robinson 1993 with paired watershed and long term monitoring various results were reported table 2 these results showed that in arid areas forests had effective function in increase stream flow while in tropical and subtropical areas forest coverage change had little influence on stream flow wang and zhang 2001 research scale also appeared to be a major issue ellison et al 2012 in small scale studies the effects of forests on water balance was typically assumed to be negative zhang et al 2001 andréassian 2004 while large scale modeling predictions showed that deforestation led to runoff decrease ellison et al 2012 wang et al 2015 although hydrological impacts of forest on water yield were proved by above researches the fact remains that forests have different impacts on runoff with specific climatological contexts andréassian 2004 both meteorological and forest conditions could result in various hydrological responses made the understanding complicated ellison et al 2012 in general most of these researches focused on the relationships between forest and precipitation characteristics existed forest structure studies were conducted in specific research site it is still need further research for comprehensive understanding in this research eight research sites in china were set to conduct stand investigation the objectives were to 1 partition the rainwater balance of the forest by determining throughfall stemflow and interception in china 2 investigate litter interception 3 quantify et of forest land 4 obtain relationships between forest structure factors and hydrological process regionally 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites description landscapes meteorology and forest conditions varied significantly due to the vast territory of china southern china is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges to the west sit major mountain ranges high plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north such as the taklimakan and the gobi desert climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer china is owning over 8000 kinds of tree species the 7th national forest inventory in 2004 2008 revealed that there were 195 5 million ha forests covering 20 4 of the country s land area dai et al 2013 temperature and precipitation combination factor was considered as the main driving force of forest distribution fang and yoda 1990 forest coverages were higher in southern provinces mean coverage was greater than 35 forests coverages in northeastern and central provinces were in the range of 25 35 and 15 25 respectively provinces in the northwestern region had the lowest forest coverage less than 15 hu et al 2015 this research was conducted in 8 representative sites in china 18 54 n 73 135 e fig 2 a concerned xb region had poor vegetation condition fig 2b and precipitation shortage problem xb region had three research sites geographical characteristics of these eight research sites were summarized in table 3 2 2 forest stand investigation investigation data collected between 2008 and 2012 were relied to process the research in each site various stand plots 30 m 30 m were established plot number in each site was determined by the stand area these plots occupied full range of typical forest stand formations found in the region fig 3 plots were placed at least 200 m apart and as far as possible included a single forest species element locations with recent or large canopy gaps were avoided all methods relied upon the same basic measure of floristic dissimilarity between sites in each plot all trees with the diameter at breast height dbh greater than 3 cm were measured for girth and identified to species fig 3b leaf area index lai of forestry leaves was measured by a lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences species dbh height position crown canopy density stand density wood cover soil depth depths of litter forest distribution pattern mixed degree tree size ratio biomass in the plot were recorded several indexes were calculated and employed to explore the relationships between forest structure factors and hydrological responses aggregation index ai responded for quantify aggregation levels within a single stand calculation of ai for class i is based on

throughfall observations a hobo weather station onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa was installed in an open area within each site fig 3a recorded parameters included precipitation barometric pressure wind speed net radiation air temperature and relative humidity all the parameters were measured in 15 min time intervals throughfall investigations were conducted in 30 m 30 m experimental plots several hobo rg3 rainfall gauges were set in the plot randomly during the research period fig 3c all throughfall data were recorded in 1 min time interval automatically fig 3d 2 4 stemflow and interception observations stemflow investigations were conducted in 30 m 30 m experimental plots stemflow was collected by an open pvc tube mounted around each typical tree then the tube was sealed with neutral silicone sealant fig 3f collected stems were connected to a hobo rg3 m gauge all stemflow data from precipitation events throughout the year were recorded in 1 min time interval automatically the trees were divided into several series as the diameter cm results expressed as millimeters which was calculated from eq 5 5 sf i 1 n c i m i s 1000 where n is the number of trunk diameter series c i is the stemflow amount of the ith series trunk diameter ml in specific precipitation event m i is the tree s number of the ith series trunk diameter s is the plot area m2 under forest conditions vegetation interception can be divided into canopy and litter interception canopy interception is the difference between the gross precipitation falling on the top of the canopy and the net precipitation falling through the canopy the net precipitation consists of throughfall and stemflow based on this theory canopy interception was calculated by eq 6 6 p i p p t p s where is pi canopy interception mm p is gross precipitation mm pt is throughfall mm ps is stemflow mm the water storage capacity of litter is the maximum water amount that litter can store inside litter litter cannot store more moisture after reaching their storage capacity so litter interception can be described by the saturation function in this research each research plot was divided into 36 investigate units 5m 5 m each 1 m 1 m litter sample was randomly collected from each unit litter samples were used to measure their water content and water holding capacity in the laboratory litter collection time was along with forest investigation litter interception was calculated by the litter interception model established by zagyvai kiss et al 2014 eq 7 7 e s s w i 1 1 e p t s w i 1 where e s is litter interception mm s is the storage capacity mm w i 1 is the antecedent water content mm p t is throughfall mm litter interception result calculated by this model represented the maximum interception amount of each precipitation event 2 5 estimating et for forests et measurements were conducted in experimental plots sap flux was measured in typical trees by thermal dissipation probe tdp to avoid solar radiation tdp was installed in the north of trunk at the height of 1 3 m there were four probes for each tdp fig 3e named s0 s1 s2 and s3 they were 10 15 cm apart from each other all the probes were wrapped by radiation shield sap flux was recorded in 5 min time intervals automatically by the data collector the calculation equation was granier 1987 8 j s 0 714 d tmax d tact 1

period were shown in fig 4 there was a usual climatological pattern that winter was drought and majority of the rainfall events occurred during summer months research sites in southern china had greater precipitation than sites in northern china gross precipitations in xn hd zn sites were 938 2 1561 6 and 1379 4 mm respectively they were humid areas majority months had gross precipitation greater than 100 mm gross precipitation in db site was 632 7 mm it was semi arid area sites in xb had the least rainfall mean monthly precipitation was 36 3 12 5 mm rainfall partitioning in forest stands varied among sites in china due to various factors fig 5 that was for forest types and climatic conditions were various among sites crockford and richardson 2000 forest canopy and biomass intercepted rainwater so that reduced throughfall carlyle moses 2004 the connectivity of above ground biomass and trunk properties formed stemflow pathways hamburg and lin 1998 thus impacted on stemflow amount climate conditions impacted on the intensity and duration of precipitation events and evaporation rate from the wet canopy oishi et al 2010 3 1 1 throughfall and impact factors throughfall accounted for the largest proportion of gross precipitation it ranged from 69 3 8 8 to 84 4 5 6 among research sites it was the least in hd site and the largest in xbs site mean proportion of throughfall in china was 76 4 5 66 throughfall was the main pathway for rainwater to reach the ground latitude parker 1983 elevation rustad et al 1994 seasonality hamburg and lin 1998 precipitation soulsby 1997 forest species composition parker 1983 and land use hamburg and lin 1998 were reported to impact throughfall gross precipitation was the most relevant factor for precipitation determined the input amount of throughfall marin et al 2000 data analyzed from hb xbg and hd indicated that there were positive linear relationships with high correlations r 2 0 96 between gross precipitation and throughfall table 4 throughfall increased with increasing precipitation table 4 linear relationships were also reported by carlyle moses 2004 shachnovich et al 2008 xiao and mcpherson 2011 for matorral pine forest and urban forests no significant relation was found between rainfall intensity and throughfall p 0 055 the research from shachnovich et al 2008 came to the same conclusion rainfall patterns acted on the linearity and slope of regression equation high intensity and short duration rainfall might yield greater throughfall than rainfall events of low intensity and long duration siles et al 2010 lower determining coefficients due to that precipitation in china was less and in longer duration marin et al 2000 canopy thickness and canopy density were both in linear relationships with throughfall the determine coefficients were smaller than that of precipitation throughfall decreased with their increase krämer and hölscher 2009 found that greater canopy density was negatively correlated with throughfall llorens and domingo 2007 reported significant negative relationships between dbh lai and throughfall tobon et al 2000 reported that canopy gap and lai were the main parameters determining rainfall partitioning that was for larger canopy intercepted more rainwater so that led to the decrease of throughfall komatsu et al 2008 3 1 2 canopy interception and impact factors canopy interception accounted for 22 4 5 2 of gross precipitation forests in hd site intercepted the largest proportion of rainfall 29 1 3 3 of the rainwater was intercepted interception in hb and zn sites also accounted for larger proportions with percentile of 28 3 and 25 4 respectively it was the least in xbs site only 14 6 1 4 of the rainwater was intercepted canopy interceptions of three sites in xb region were lower due to the lower coverage and forest biomass factors that influenced canopy interception amount were in three main aspects they were precipitation tree characteristics and meteorological conditions staelens et al 2008 precipitation determined rainwater amount which drives canopy interception process xiao and mcpherson 2011 there was power relationship between precipitation and canopy interception table 5 geographic pattern of canopy interception in china fig 4 was consistent with precipitation fig 5 precipitations of southern sites xn hd and zn sites were greater than northern sites canopy interceptions were also greater than northern sites rainfall pattern also impacted on canopy interception rainfall of high intensity and short duration presented lower interception values than low intensity long duration events and if rainfall was not continuous even for short periods during an event higher values of interception result crockford and richardson 2000 canopy interception was greater than 50 when gross precipitation was less than 5 mm or rainfall intensity was less than 10 mm h wei and zhou 1991 liu et al 2001 rustad et al 1994 suggests that higher rainfall intensity generated a stronger impact on vegetation reduced maximum canopy storage and lower interception loss this was might for dry canopy had larger water holding capacity when it was wet the capacity would be limited canopy interception was also affected by forest structure table 5 canopy interception of hb was greater than those of other northern sites this was for lai in hb was 3 2 1 3 greater than lai i xb and db lai was in linear relationships with interception in po pt sb and pt qv forests canopy density biomass mixed degree and aggregation index were all in exponential relationships with interception these factors increase led to increasing canopy interception canopy area was the crucial factor in determining interception amount livesley et al 2014 interception was reported to be higher in conifers than in evergreen broad leaved forest this was caused primarily by the seasonal rainfall in china fig 4 conifer forests had greater canopy interception loss in winter komatsu et al 2008 there was another reason reported by crockford and richardson 2000 needle clusters could hold intercepted rainfall more securely than the vertically aligned board leaves crockford and richardson 2000 only uniform angle index had negative correlation with interception regular tree distribution led to greater interception this was for that regular tree distribution formed greater lai which could intercept greater rainwater livesley et al 2014 3 1 3 stemflow and impact factors mean stemflow proportion was 1 2 0 7 in china in xbh site stemflow was the largest 2 1 0 2 of the rainwater reached ground through stemflow in db site stemflow only accounted for 0 3 0 1 of the gross precipitation reported stemflow was less than 1 in lowland rain forests bruijnzeel et al 2011 while stemflow was 8 9 for pines with up to 13 1 for rainfall events in which precipitation was greater than 25 mm crockford and richardson 1990 stemflow was only a very small proportion of precipitation and sometimes it was neglected in some hydrological balance studies liu 1997 marin et al 2000 however stemflow was particularly important in dry lands bhark and small 2003 it contributed about 10 of the annual soil water input chang and matzner 2000 navar and bryan 1990 found that stemflow contributed greater water than rainwater source in mexico s northeast semi arid shrubs durocher 1990 johnson and lehmann 2006 reported that stemflow was preferentially recharge to groundwater sources through channeling along root pathways latter research by návar 2011 indicated that stemflow infiltrated deep into soil through roots it could be potential source of groundwater recharge forest diverted significant stemflow volumes to the stem base where it subsequently infiltrates deep into the soil and remains available for plant uptake llorens and domingo 2007 simultaneously nutrient contents in stemflow were greater than those in rainfall and throughfall wei and zhou 1991 stemflow might be dominate nutrients and moisture resources of the forests in dry hilltops like xb region had poor precipitation stemflow was crucial for forest grow long time evolution led to forests in xb need stemflow urgently therefore stemflow proportions in three sites were greater than southern sites stemflow proportions of forests were variable across china the variability of stemflow among forest types can be attributed in part to differences in climatic patterns meteorological conditions and tree species andré et al 2008 and levia et al 2010 both reported that stemflow was related to tree species and size including factors like crown size leaf shape and orientation branch angle and bark roughness aboal et al 1999 however stemflow was mainly determined by the precipitation table 6 significant relationships between stemflow and stand factors were not found in this research this was for that at the beginning of stemflow generation forest factors had great impacts on stemflow process once the canopy interception capacity reached its peak stemflow generation had been documented to closely match the gross precipitation durocher 1990 therefore precipitation was the main factor in determining mean stemflow in hb and hd sites stemflow increased linearly with precipitation increase in xbg site they were in polynomial relationship in xb forest previous studies also indicated that stemflow increased with the magnitude of a precipitation event paltineanu and starr 2000 kuraji et al 2001 xiao and mcpherson 2011 andré et al 2008 reported that stemflow was linearly related to rainfall 3 2 litter layer interception characteristics litter interception and mass in each site were investigated and figured in fig 6 litter interception in db was the largest 7 7 0 8 mm rainfall was intercepted then were the litters in xbg zn and hd sites litter could intercept 6 0 4 0 mm 5 0 2 4 mm and 4 6 2 1 mm rainfall respectively litter interception in xbh site was 3 6 0 5 mm litters in xbs and xn sites had the same interception of 1 7 0 3 mm litter in hb site had the least interception only 0 9 0 3 mm rainfall could be intercepted the right axis in fig 6 was litter mass mean litter mass in china was 19 4 13 1 t hm2 among all the research sites db owned the most litter mass up to 40 2 3 2 t hm2 litter mass in hd site was the least about 9 3 2 1 t hm2 fig 6 illustrated that sites in north of china db hb xbs xbh xbg had more litter than sites xn hd zn in south of china in some researches litter interception was neglected in hydrological cycle however gerrits et al 2010 found forest floor interception values of 20 of throughfall litter layer intercepted throughfall and evaporated to atmosphere in several hours made forest land had higher transpiration rates therefore litter interception was an important component in ecosystem according to helvey and patric 1965 litter interception was mainly determined by litter amount and drying rate climate and water capacity determine the drying rate helvey and patric 1965 bulcock and jewitt 2012 putuhena and cordery 2000 reported that the water storage capacity of litter from pinus radiata increased with litter amount two axes in fig 6 showed that litter interception had positive correlation with the litter mass when correlated litter interception with litter mass standard deviation σ 3 14 undecomposed litter mass σ 6 78 and semi decomposed litter mass σ 7 65 they could be described as linear relationships fig 7 litter interception had closer relation with undecomposed litter mass this was for the water storage capacity of litter decreased after decomposition litter decomposition was cell uptake and metabolism caused by microbial species or communities high temperature might be the reason caused that litter amount and interception in xn hd zn less than that in northern sites decomposition led to nutrients release and structure destroy and water storage capacity decreased sangha et al 2006 each 1 f rise in temperature increased the litter decomposition rate by approximately 1 shachnovich et al 2008 chemical composition and morphology caused by tree species were also impacted on litter decomposition smaller and thinner leaves might contribute to faster litter decomposition sangha et al 2006 marin et al 2000 reported that litter interception increased with increasing throughfall however interception was also a threshold process as certain rainwater amount was required for interception before rainwater infiltration and runoff generation sangha et al 2006 interception was usually described by the saturation function because litter cannot store more rainwater after reaching their storage capacity tsiko et al 2012 litter interception was influenced by numerous structure factors in this research 17 forest structure factors table 7 were investigated to process path coefficient analysis direct and indirect effects of factors were evaluated by path coefficient analysis method which was calculated using spss statistical program the analysis results showed that x 4 x 8 x 11 x 14 x 15 had greater impact on litter interception table 7 path coefficient indicated the degree order was x 11 x 14 x 8 x 15 x 4 x 11 had the greatest impact on litter interception its path coefficient was 1 31 direct effects of x 14 x 8 were greater than their indirect effect direct effect of x 4 was the least its indirect effect was greater than direct index x 4 impact on litter interception mainly through the litter mass 3 3 evapotranspiration forest consumed a large portion of rainwater to atmosphere through et with a mean et percentage the ratio of et and precipitation of 86 05 in north china et percentage ranged from 82 7 to 109 5 from 63 1 to 88 5 in the south et percentages were relatively greater in northern forests due to the collective effects of lower temperature and higher latitude wei et al 2005 et percentage increased with decreasing temperature and increasing latitude fig 8 a and b σ was 7 82 or 7 29 respectively drier air and lower precipitation in the north made potential evaporation fully realized whereas the opposite occurred in the south with humid air and higher precipitation they were not conducive to et therefore et percentage was relatively low in southern sites et percentage increased with increasing elevation fig 8 c σ was 100 26 hd site also had greater et percentage for the higher elevation et percentage was found to be highly variable among various forest sites owing to meteorological and forest conditions benyon and doody 2015 it was less than 20 at a japanese site where p was 2405 mm komatsu et al 2008 it accounted for more than 90 at an australian site where p was 1179 mm crockford and richardson 1990 previous research showed et percentage ranged from 20 to 90 all over the world rich 1952 özhan et al 2010 li et al 2010 large fraction of precipitation was evaporated to atmosphere through forest canopy litter and soil this showed that forest was very important to hydrological cycle the results showed that transpiration was still the largest portion of precipitation in comparison to canopy and litter interception in xbs site et percentage was 109 5 which indicated that et demand was larger than precipitation due to high transpiration of the forest not only in field observation plot scale studies also obtain similar results dai et al 2013 this phenomenon illustrated that trees in xbs sites consumed extra water resources from infiltration excess overland flow soil stored water groundwater or stream water klaassen et al 1998 domingo et al 2001 wang et al 2011 in this condition forest returned larger amount of local water resources to atmosphere thus forest had negative impact on available water there was evidence that some species particularly seedlings grown trees use less water than others because of differing vegetative characteristics andré et al 2008 these kinds of tree species should be promoted in arid areas to use rainwater resources reasonably annual forest et was highly variable among eight sites in china due to the differences in precipitation temperature latitude forest species forest structure etc et was strongly related to precipitation fig 9 a that illustrated that annual et was mainly controlled by precipitation amount fig 9a this agreed to study from zhang et al 2001 wang et al 2011 and özhan et al 2010 china owned vast geographic territory with high precipitation variability south china owed greater precipitation than north china fig 4 therefore et in southern sites were significantly greater than those in northern sites table 8 column 3 et had been carried out relation analysis with forest structure factors in hb site logarithmic relationships were established in four forest types between et and lai in hd site their relationship was exponential they were in positive regression et increased with the lai increasing fig 9b this was for that lai increase reflected larger branches and leaves led to the increase of transpiration areas therefore mature and fast growing forests with high lai resulted in less runoff and more et wang et al 2011 in previous researches li et al 2010 indicated that et was significantly related to lai especially in rainy season fig 9b indicated that cl qv and ph were in southern sites they had greater et than others this was might for that higher precipitation led to greater interception which was part of et et followed a polynomial trend with canopy density larger canopy led to greater et fig 9c this was for that lai and canopy both led to interception increase so increased et indirectly biomass also had positive regression relationship with et in hb site et increased with biomass increasing they were described as power function fig 9d biomass was the main resource of forest litter layer bulcock and jewitt 2012 biomass increase could enhance both canopy density and litter amount which led to greater et dunkerley 2000 et of shrubbery was significantly lower than arbor trees for the lower canopy however et would not increase with lai canopy and biomass endlessly well stocked forest vegetation appeared to consumed water at about same rate regardless of species or forest structure brauman et al 2010 4 conclusion hydrological responses to precipitation forest species and structure in eight sites across china were explored in this research throughfall was the largest proportion of gross precipitation with fraction between 69 3 8 8 and 84 4 5 6 throughfall was correlated with gross precipitation canopy thickness and canopy density canopy interception varied from 14 6 1 4 to 29 1 3 3 of gross precipitation canopy interception was correlated with precipitation lai canopy density biomass mixed degree uniform angle index aggregation index stemflow accounted for only 1 2 0 7 of gross precipitation with the greatest fraction of 2 1 0 2 in xbh site and the least fraction of 0 3 0 1 in db site stemflow was correlated with precipitation litter interception varied among eight sites the greatest litter interception was 7 7 0 8 mm in db site and the least litter interception was 0 9 0 3 mm in hb site litter interception had closer correlation with undecomposed litter mass 0 66 than total litter mass 0 46 path coefficient analysis showed that stand density shannon wiener index litter mass size ratio had greater impact on litter interception among all forest structure factors evapotranspiration et

7271,high spatial variability of arsenic as concentration in geogenic as contaminated groundwater has been commonly observed worldwide but the underlying reasons remain not well understood selecting a sulfate containing as affected aquifer at the datong basin northern china as the study area and combining hydrogeochemical investigation and sediment extraction with reactive transport modeling this work elucidated the roles of fe s as interactions in regulating the vertical variation of as concentration in the groundwater dissolved as concentration varied between 0 05 and 18 μmol l but generally increased in the depth of 20 25 m and then decreased in 25 30 m the high as groundwater contained low fe ii 0 007 mmol l and up to 15 μmol l sulfide in contrary to the s se asian deltas floodplains where high fe ii and as jointly occur in the groundwater devoid of sulfate reduction the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxides coupled to the degradation of organic matter with an estimated maximum rate of 0 22 mmol c l yr mainly accounted for the depth dependent increase of as concentration in the upper part of the shallow aquifer 25 m deep however the decreasing reactivity of fe iii oxides together with the increase of ph over depth rendered the majority of electrons being transferred to sulfate reduction the fe ii sulfides formed as a consequence not only helped to restrict the build up of fe ii in the groundwater but also probably co precipitated as to prompt as decrease in the depth of 25 30 m arsenite adsorbed on remaining fe iii oxides and newly formed fe ii sulfides is another important pool of as in the aquifer which varies in response to the extents of fe iii oxide and sulfate reduction and consequently alters as distribution coefficient between the solid and the aqueous phases this study highlights the importance of coupled geochemical cycling of fe s and as for as mobilization and reveals how it regulates as partitioning between groundwater and sediments keywords arsenic variability redox zonation fe s as interactions reactive transport model groundwater 1 introduction geogenic arsenic as contaminated groundwater has been an issue of worldwide concern due to the global occurrence and health threat to more than one hundred of million people fendorf et al 2010 ravenscroft et al 2009 long term intake of high as 10 µg l who 2011 groundwater can lead to numerous symptoms of chronic as poisoning particularly the cardio vascular diseases as well as fatal cancers in local residents argos et al 2010 and the use of high as groundwater for agricultural irrigation and livestock farming is likely to cause the accumulation of as in rice wheat grains and other food thus potentially expanding its impact to larger populations punshon et al 2017 in tackling with the problem of high as groundwater researchers have explored the processes governing as mobilization in different types of aquifers in the past two decades and substantially improved our understanding of as environmental behaviors however a clear interpretation of the complicated hydrobiogeochemistry of those aquifer systems which ultimately impacts the variability of as and other environmentally relevant elements remains a challenge fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 postma et al 2016 wang et al 2017 one of the unresolved problems which hinders the prediction of aqueous as is the high spatial variability of as concentration in the groundwater fendorf et al 2010 postma et al 2016 van geen et al 2008a in both great floodplains of south southeast s se asia fendorf et al 2010 postma et al 2012 van geen et al 2008a and arid humid regions of east asia gan et al 2014 guo et al 2014 pi et al 2017 groundwater as concentration greatly varied from sites to sites and even at the same locality showed high spatial variability while diversities in geological units site topography and local hydrogeological settings exert strong influences on the behaviors of as in those aquifers polizzotto et al 2008 stuckey et al 2015b van geen et al 2008b winkel et al 2011 one common feature is that geochemical properties of the aquifers and associated hydrobiogeochemical processes play critical roles in as mobilization stuckey et al 2016 wang et al 2017 in both deltas floodplains of s se asia and fluvial lacustrine plains of east asia the direct source of as in the groundwater has been commonly recognized to be the as associated with metal such as fe and mn oxides and sulfides and in reducing aquifers as is primarily released by the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides coupled to the degradation of organic matter mcarthur et al 2004 polizzotto et al 2005 postma et al 2012 xie et al 2013 however the loading and reactivities of endogenous or exogenous organic matter as well as redox components such as fe oxides sulfate in the high as aquifer systems may vary depending on their sources and other factors harvey et al 2002 postma et al 2012 whaley martin et al 2016 and thus influence the geochemical environments to different degrees yielding circumneutral to moderately alkaline ph and weakly oxidizing to strongly reducing conditions fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 pi et al 2017 postma et al 2007 for instance depending on the depositional environments and sediment burial age the as bearing fe iii oxides within aquifers probably exhibit large variations in composition and stability which in turn controls the fe iii oxide reduction rates and thus the extents of as release postma et al 2012 stuckey et al 2015a besides the reduction of fe iii oxides can also promote the re partitioning of fe and as between aqueous and solid phases horneman et al 2004 postma et al 2016 and as adsorption is further impacted by the surface site properties of sediments as species and the types of competing ions appelo et al 2002 dixit and hering 2003 giménez et al 2007 nguyen et al 2014 stachowicz et al 2008 more recently it has been recognized that sulfur s biogeochemical cycling exerts important influences on as fate in natural environments burton et al 2013 guo et al 2016 wallis et al 2011 wang et al 2014 groundwater sulfate may come from the atmospheric precipitation the dissolution of terrestrial evaporates the decomposition of s containing organic matter seawater transgression as well as anthropogenic perturbations farooqi et al 2007a stuckey et al 2015c xie et al 2013 in some cases aqueous sulfate could be produced by the oxidation of pyrite during the aquifer storage and recovery asr process which may simultaneously lead to the mobilization of incorporated as jones and pichler 2007 wallis et al 2011 under reducing conditions dissolved sulfate is an electron accepting competitor toward fe iii oxides postma and jakobsen 1996 and the produced sulfide can be actively involved in as transformations and mobilization immobilization burton et al 2011 2013 couture et al 2010 on the one hand sulfide induced as thiolation in natural water is able to produce a vast number of aqueous species that are stable under strongly reducing conditions and potentially enhance as mobility due to their weaker adsorption on fe minerals than arsenate and arsenite couture et al 2010 2013 kumar et al 2016 stucker et al 2014 on the other hand sulfide can react with as to produce as sulfide minerals causing as retention into sediments o day et al 2004 or result in the formation of various types of fe ii sulfide minerals that can re sequester as from the groundwater bostick and fendorf 2003 kocar et al 2010 lowers et al 2007 different from the scenario of s se asian deltas floodplains that high as groundwater usually occurs in aquifers devoid of sulfate reduction fendorf et al 2010 stuckey et al 2016 in some fluvial lacustrine basins of northern china such as the datong basin the hetao basin and the huhhot basin significant amounts of dissolved sulfate are present in the shallow aquifers and as enriched groundwater frequently occurs under sulfate reducing conditions guo et al 2013 2016 pi et al 2017 smedley et al 2003 wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 our previous studies via employing multiple isotope methods suggested that sulfate reduction is an important electron accepting process in the shallow aquifers of the datong basin and as mobilization is closely linked to the geochemical cycling of fe and s wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 the produced sulfide may have facilitated the reduction of as bearing fe iii oxides and or the formation as s components accounting for as 50 μg l in sulfate reducing groundwater wang et al 2014 besides fe mineral transformations between non sulfidic fe ii phases and fe ii sulfides induced by sulfate reduction are likely to regulate as enrichment in the groundwater via adsorption and co precipitation xie et al 2014a likewise previous studies in the hetao basin implied that microbial sulfate reduction contributed to the changes in dissolved fe ii sulfide and as and sulfide could enhance the reduction of as bearing fe iii oxides as well as the removal of fe ii by secondary precipitation guo et al 2013 2016 however how the fe s as interactions control the spatial variation of dissolved as concentrations in sulfate reducing aquifers and other similar environments remains not well understood and a quantitative elucidation of the interacting processes which is important for predicting aqueous as concentrations and water quality management is urgently needed in the present study we attempt to elucidate the fe s as interactions in a known high as aquifer system under sulfate reducing conditions and their roles in controlling the vertical variation of as concentration in the groundwater to achieve this goal we collected hydrochemical and sediment geochemical data from an as affected site at the datong basin and integrated them into a reactive transport model to analyze how water chemistry evolved over depth and how as was distributed between sediments and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling this study focuses on the shallow aquifer 20 30 m below the land surface beneath the west part of the dy site located in the center of datong basin fig 1 which is a typical geogenic as contaminated area in fluvial lacustrine basins of northern china the aquifer mainly comprises medium to fine sands with occasional silts and silty sands the water 18o 16o and d 1h isotope evidence suggested that meteoric water acted as an important recharge source of the high as groundwater xie et al 2012 a total of 16 groundwater samples were collected in july 2014 from the monitoring wells fig 1b groundwater pumped out directly entered an online flow cell that was equipped with portable meters hach hq40d for temperature t ph and electrical conductivity ec the dissolved fe ii sulfide and nh4 n concentrations were on site determined spectrophotometrically hach dr2800 after taking samples with filter equipped 0 45 μm syringes into the cuvettes containing colorimetric reagents with blanks calibrated using milli q water pi et al 2017 alkalinity was measured using gran titration method immediately in the field laboratory anion cation and total as samples were vacuum filtered 0 45 μm and then collected into pre cleaned 50 ml hdpe bottles respectively with cations and total as acidified to ph 2 using ultra pure hno3 dissolved organic carbon doc samples were quickly filtered acidified to ph 2 using ultra pure hcl and stored in 50 ml amber glass bottles aqueous arsenite and arsenate species were immediately separated on site using disposable anion exchange resin lc sax sigma aldrich le et al 2000 with the passages collected into hdpe bottles and acidified to ph 2 by ultra pure hno3 arsenate concentration was calculated from the difference between total as and arsenite the separation method for arsenate and arsenite was validated by testing mixed standards spiked to groundwater samples generating recoveries for arsenite and arsenate of 93 5 and 101 5 respectively however the presence of thioarsenate species that are also negatively charged might introduce uncertainty to arsenate concentrations see discussion below samples for carbon stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon dic were collected into 50 ml amber glass bottles sterilized by nan3 and sealed leaving no head space once collected all samples were stored in 4 c refrigerator until analyses during the borehole drilling 14 sediment cores were directly retrieved in hdpe liners from the aquifer with cautions taken to eliminate contamination and disturbance as much as possible and then stored in vacuum bags that were quickly vacuumized followed by immediate capping into pvc casings which were then sealed and preserved in the freezer until analyses 2 2 analytical methods major cation samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical omission spectrometry icp oes icap6300 thermo scientific and anions by ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact ic with detection limits of 0 01 mg l for all total as ast and arsenite that had been separately collected in the field were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkin elmer elandrc e with a detection limit of 0 5 μg l the doc concentrations were measured using the high temperature catalytic combustion method with the toc analyzer toc v shimadzu with a detection limit of 0 01 mg l the analytical errors for aqueous components above mentioned were generally within 5 the determination of carbon stable isotope of dic followed xie et al 2013 the carbon isotopic compositions were reported in standard δ13c notation representing the per mil deviations from the v pdb standard replicate analyses were within 0 2 to extract carbonate minerals freshly thawed subsample was mixed with deoxygenated 0 5 mol l formic acid ph 3 under nitrogen atmosphere into 500 ml glass bottle that was sealed with thick rubber stopper followed by 24 h shaking the co2 sample in the bottle headspace was taken and measured by gas chromatography chromotopac shimadzu the co2 content together with the solution ph was used to calculate the carbonate co3 content in the sediments the contents of ca and mg in the extractants after filtration through 0 22 µm filter were measured by icp oes and then recalculated to the calcite also likely including the polymorph aragonite and dolomite contents in the sediments the fe ii content in the extractants was spectrophotometrically measured after filtration through 0 22 µm filter and used to calculate the feco3 content for all sediment samples the sum of ca mg and fe ii contents is correlated with co3 with molar ratio of 0 95 1 21 namely close to 1 1 the acid volatile sulfide avs was firstly transformed into zns suspension using 6 mol l hcl 0 1 mol l ascorbic acid 10 wt zinc acetate solutions and then quantified by the methylene blue method xie et al 2014a the avs concentration was used to calculate fes content in the sediments assuming that the fe ii s molar ratio of acid dissolved fe ii sulfides overall is 1 1 after the removal of adsorbed as by 1 mol l nah2po4 ph 5 as contained in avs was extracted using 1 mol l hcl keon et al 2001 and measured by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs afs 820 titan since as co precipitated with carbonates could be also dissolved the amount of as co precipitated with avs was calculated by subtracting as extracted by 0 5 mol l formic acid ph 3 the analytical errors for carbonates avs and as were generally within 5 2 3 geochemical modeling speciation calculations and reactive transport modeling were conducted using the public code phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 the wateq4f dat database employed has been updated for arsenate and arsenite aqueous species as complexation with cations langmuir et al 2006 and the sulfidation of as species helz and tossell 2008 within the study area accelerated water flow through preferential path or porous medium seems not very possible and the vertical water flow generally can be described by infiltration through sandy aquifers with a flow rate of 0 37 0 10 m year although in localities the variations in water head may lead to deviations see supporting information for further description and flux rate estimation such a simplification which however remains in the acceptable range was applied to the 1 d reactive transport model this model consists of 10 cells with a cell length of 1 m which together cover the 20 30 m depth the flow rate was set to the average vertical infiltration rate of 0 37 m year and the model time was 1200 years solute dispersion was not considered in this model the simulation approach was based on the partial equilibrium concept and the degradation rates of organic matter c n molar ratio 100 1 5 were fitted to the changes in dissolved nh4 concentration over depth assuming that ammonium released from the decomposition of natural organic stays conservative in the reducing aquifer system and thus acts as a good indicator of the degradation intensity postma et al 2007 in addition to as release by the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides logk 4 89 postma et al 2007 as removal by fe ii sulfides fes precipitation logk 3 5 omoregie et al 2013 as adsorption on fe iii oxides and fes and the competitive effects of co existent components were considered in quantifying processes affecting as mobilization the diffuse double layer ddl model of dzombak and morel 1990 was adopted to describe as adsorption on mineral surfaces but in fitting the results it is necessary to adjust the surface site densities and relate them to the mineral amounts see supporting information for model details and the list of thermodynamic parameters used 3 results 3 1 aqueous chemistry the groundwater samples of the study area had ph values ranging from 7 84 to 8 28 with an average of 8 05 table 1 thus hosting weakly moderately alkaline conditions under such ph conditions the hco3 ion predominantly accounted for the alkalinity which varied from 5 94 to 10 2 mmol l and averaged at 7 40 mmol l table 1 higher ph appeared mostly in the lower part of the aquifer fig 2 c whereas higher alkalinity occurred in the upper part fig 2d thermodynamic calculation suggested that the partial pressure of co2 p co2 in the groundwater changed between 10 2 8 and 10 2 2 atm table 1 and generally decreased with depth fig 2e but apparently they all were higher than in the atmosphere p co2 10 3 4 the dissolved inorganic carbon had δ13cdic values between 23 8 and 11 3 with an average of 19 1 comparable to the mean value of biogenic inorganic carbon 13 6 observed in high as groundwater of the datong basin xie et al 2013 the doc concentrations ranged from 0 44 to 1 55 mmol l table 1 and showed an increasing trend at the upper half part of the aquifer followed by slight decrease at greater depths fig 2a na was the dominant cation in the groundwater and together with hco3 made na hco3 the main water type the vertical distribution of redox sensitive components indicates distinct trends in groundwater chemistry fig 2 no3 was only detected in two groundwater samples at the uppermost 1 m of the aquifer with a highest concentration of 0 13 mmol l fig 2f the dissolved fe ii concentration rose at the upper 3 m to 0 007 mmol l decreased at the depth of 23 28 m but then slightly re increased to 0 005 mmol l in the lower part fig 2 g it is worth noting that the mean value of groundwater fe ii concentration 0 0039 mmol l in our study site was almost one or two orders of magnitude lower than the s se asian high as groundwater e g 0 2 mmol l on average in the red river delta mcarthur et al 2004 postma et al 2007 dissolved so4 2 concentration reached 2 23 mmol l in the shallowest groundwater and gradually decreased over depth to almost zero at the depth of 28 m fig 2 h by contrast dissolved sulfide firstly increased up to 15 µmol l at 27 m deep and then decreased at greater depths fig 2i the presence of aqueous sulfide is also reflected by the strong odor of the groundwater pumped out the groundwater ast concentration ranged from 0 05 to 18 µmol l 4 1340 μg l with an average of 7 6 µmol l 570 μg l table 1 low as groundwater ast 10 µg l occurred exclusively in the shallow part of the aquifer fig 3 a with increasing depth as firstly rose to the highest level at 25 m deep and then decreased at greater depths but still maintained a moderate level the arsenite species as iii in fig 3b accounted for 7 6 to 85 7 of total as with an average of 62 6 and its distribution over depth exhibited a similar pattern with ast lower as iii ast ratios were mostly discerned in the shallow part of the aquifer arsenate concentration was calculated as the difference between ast and arsenite but as addressed by planer friedrich et al 2007 in the presence of dissolved sulfide the negatively charged thioarsenate may form and thus can be retained as arsenate due to the limitation of the current on site separation method in this study the as v species could be not limited to arsenate but also include the thioarsenate species despite such uncertainty the arsenite species overall is the main as species in the high as groundwater likewise studies on s se asian aquifers reported the presence of as v in reducing groundwater but also not as the dominant species charlet et al 2007 postma et al 2007 swartz et al 2004 3 2 fe ii sulfide and carbonate minerals in the presence of both fe ii and sulfide in the groundwater there is a potential for the precipitation of fe ii sulfide minerals the speciation calculation indicates that the majority of groundwater samples were oversaturated with respect to amorphous fe ii sulfide fes in fig 4 a in particular along with the increase of dissolved sulfide concentration there was an increasing trend in the saturation index si of amorphous fes in the depth of 20 24 m and the 0 value was maintained at greater depths fig 5 a estimated from the content of avs in the sediment samples the fes content ranged from 0 16 to 1 1 mg g and when re calculated to the contacting groundwater volume was 15 to 103 mmol l in concert with the variation of si value the fes content increased in the depth of 20 24 m and decreased at greater depths fig 6 a the difference between as leached out by 1 mol l hcl and by 0 5 mol l formic acid ph 3 operationally defined as arsenic co precipitated with avs ranged from 0 13 to 4 5 μg g and corresponded to 0 01 0 47 mmol l when re calculated to the contacting groundwater volume fig 6b the dissolved fe ii could also enter siderite in the presence of substantial hco3 except the shallowest groundwater all other samples were oversaturated with respect to siderite feco3 in figs 4b 5b the content of feco3 in the sediments varied between 0 13 and 3 4 mg kg namely between 8 9 and 233 mmol l when re calculated to the contacting groundwater volume the feco3 content increased from the top of the aquifer and reached the highest level at the depth of 23 m but then displayed a decreasing trend at greater depths fig 6c another type of carbonate mineral in the aquifer could be calcite caco3 most of the groundwater samples were oversaturated with respect to caco3 implying precipitation potential of this mineral fig 4c different from fes and feco3 the si value of caco3 did not show obvious depth dependent trend fig 5c the caco3 content in the sediments changed between 4 1 and 95 mg g with an average of 48 mg g all the groundwater samples were oversaturated with dolomite camg co3 2 and the dolomite content calculated from extracted mg concentration varied from 0 82 to 9 7 mg g with a mean value of 4 7 mg g overall calcite seems to be the major carbonate mineral in the sediments 4 discussion 4 1 redox zonation the depth dependent disappearance of no3 and so4 2 in combination with the presence of fe ii and sulfide in the groundwater suggests the evolution of redox sequence in the aquifer and the occurrence of fe iii oxide and or so4 2 reduction in the high as groundwater pi et al 2017 xie et al 2013 as reflected by the δ13cdic values fig 2b the biodegradation of organic matter could have been an important electron donating process to promote the redox zonation in the aquifer xie et al 2013 labile organic matter may be endogenous coming from the sedimentary organic matter which contained up to 5 wt organic carbon xie et al 2014b the biodegradation of sedimentary organic carbon not only could be a source of excessive co2 thereby along with groundwater permeation contributing to the higher p co2 in the groundwater relative to the atmosphere but also produced doc like microbially derived humic substance to elevate the concentration in the groundwater pi et al 2015 the modeling results suggest that the rates of organic matter degradation changed over depth in the upper 1 m of the aquifer 20 21 m depth the estimated rate was 0 04 mmol c l yr and in the 21 22 m depth it increased to 0 11 mmol c l yr in the depth of 22 25 m the rate further increased to 0 22 mmol c l yr however in the 25 30 m interval the rate decreased from 0 15 to 0 04 mmol c l yr in accordance with the field observations modeling results indicate that redox zonation began with denitrification in the uppermost part of the aquifer red line in fig 2f after the exhaustion of no3 the reduction of fe iii oxides and so4 2 co occurred in the zones of 22 28 m depth the solubility of fe iii oxides expressed as k fe3 oh 3 was fitted to be 10 41 25 in the depth of 20 25 m 10 41 3 of 25 26 m 10 41 5 of 26 27 m and 10 41 6 of 27 30 m suggesting an increasing trend in the stability of fe iii oxides over depth the fe iii oxides in solubility correspond to lepidocrocite or poorly crystalline goethite and the dissolved sulfate thus is a competitive electron acceptor toward the fe oxides postma and jakobsen 1996 in the 22 23 m depth only one third of electrons were transferred to the fe iii reduction leading to an equivalent release of fe ii whilst two third of the electrons were consumed by sulfate reduction to produce sulfide which in molar amount only equaled 20 of released fe ii according to the reaction stoichiometry in the depth of 23 25 m although the organic matter degradation rate and the stability of fe iii oxides kept constant the ph increase fig 2c caused by the fe iii oxide reduction in turn inhibited the dissolution of fe iii oxides postma et al 2016 and consequently more electrons were transferred to sulfate reduction resulting in the drop of fe ii release but the increase of dissolved sulfide concentration in the depth of 25 28 m the increased stability of the fe iii oxides additionally contributed to the decrease in electron shunting by fe iii reduction 20 for the same reason in the bottom 2 m of the aquifer where so4 2 though had been almost depleted the fe iii oxide reduction consumed only about 18 of the electrons so as to not prompt significant fe ii re increase fig 2 g whereas methanogenesis might use the rest of electrons and potentially resulted in the accumulation of ch4 in the groundwater red line in fig 2j the ch4 failed to be measured in this area but it was detected in neighboring as affected aquifers the co occurrence of fe oxide reduction and methanogenesis had been observed in high as reducing aquifers of s se asia postma et al 2007 2016 comparing the hydrochemical and sediment geochemical data above it is easy to find that much more fe ii resides in the sediments than in the groundwater the formation of both fe ii sulfide and siderite seems to be the controlling process fitting the saturation index and content of fes and feco3 indicates that in the 22 23 m depth about 76 3 of the fe ii released by fe iii oxide reduction was precipitated into feco3 and 23 6 into fes fig 6 in the interval of 23 25 m enhanced sulfate reduction and weakened fe iii oxide reduction resulted in the elevation of fes production but the decrease of feco3 precipitation over depth however below the depth of 25 m the decrease in electron flow and the increase in fe iii oxide stability jointly led to the decrease in fe ii release which then lessened the contents of fes and feco3 in the lower half part of the aquifer fig 6 in summary while a large amount of fe ii may have been initially released by fe iii oxide reduction most of them had been re partitioned back to the sediment via secondary mineral formation or fe mineral transformation leaving little fe ii in the groundwater such a process can be more favorable under the alkaline ph conditions because oh helps to remove protons released during the precipitation processes 4 2 geochemical constraints on arsenic variability 4 2 1 concurrent fe oxide and sulfate reduction our previous studies strongly suggested that in the shallow aquifer systems of the datong basin the dominant process controlling as release is the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxides wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 assuming an as fe molar ratio of 0 006 in the fe iii oxides based on previous sediment extraction results pi et al 2017 xie et al 2008 the modeling results indicate that the reduction of as bearing fe iii oxides mainly contributed to as increase in the upper 5 m groundwater fig 3a under the reducing conditions most of the released arsenate was reduced to arsenite and thus as iii showed an increasing trend similar to ast fig 3b the modeling results also suggest the presence of as v species in the groundwater and the modeled concentration reached the highest level at the depth of 25 m but much lower than the measured fig 3c taking the groundwater containing the highest ast 18 μmol l as an example the model calculation implies that in the presence of dissolved sulfide the thioarsenates would be the main as v species fig 7 a thioarsenates are likely to form under the alkaline reducing conditions burton et al 2013 couture et al 2010 kumar et al 2016 but depending on the dissolved sulfide concentration they would only account for 10 5 of ast the reason responsible for the difference from the measurement may be that as v reduction was kinetically controlled and thus did not reach equilibrium with other terminal electron accepting processes postma et al 2007 or that some arsenate temporarily remained unreduced when not yet transported into the as reductase containing bacterial cells saltikov et al 2005 despite the uncertainties the modeling results highlight the important control of redox zonation on the elevation of as iii concentration in the groundwater while the decrease in the rates of fe iii oxide reduction could reduce as release it alone cannot explain the decreasing trend in the lower part of the aquifer fig 3b it has been recognized that fe ii sulfide minerals produced under the sulfate reducing conditions could be a significant sequester for as pi et al 2017 xie et al 2014a the increasing as concentration in the interval of 22 25 m could favor the co precipitation of as with the neo formed fe ii sulfides kocar et al 2010 wilkin and ford 2006 while the fitting deviates to some extents from the measured content of as co precipitated with fes the modeling results agree with the observation that more as was sequestered into fes with the increase of aqueous as concentration fig 6b the content of as co precipitated with fes much increased in the depth of 25 27 m up to 0 47 mmol l where groundwater as reached rather high levels at greater depths the content deceased along with the depletion of so4 2 and the decrease of aqueous as concentration it is interesting to note that the zone with decreasing as concentration 25 28 m deep is exactly where sulfate reduction became predominant in the electron accepting processes consuming 70 90 of total electrons an important implication of this finding is that in aquifers containing both fe iii oxides and sulfate the increase of groundwater as will suspend in response to the depletion of easily reducible as bearing fe oxides i e the increased stability and the increasing electron shunting to sulfate reduction the as variation seems to be subtly influenced by the shifts in the redox zonation and the secondary mineral forming processes 4 2 2 arsenic adsorption the adsorption of as species on fe iii oxides and fes is another process potentially affecting as mobilization couture et al 2013 postma et al 2016 wolthers et al 2005 given the higher stability of fe iii oxides in the sediments than ferrihydrite 0 2 mol weak site per mol fe that is employed in the standard surface complexation model of dzombak and morel 1990 in this study the density of weak sites was reduced to 0 12 mmol per mol fe oxide in correspondence with a sedimentary fe oxide content of 1 mol fe iii oxide per liter of contacting groundwater for similar reasons the weak site number on fes became 0 02 mmol per mol fes in the sediments wolthers et al 2005 taking the highest as groundwater as an example again the modeling results indicate that arsenite occupied 10 3 of the surface site of fe iii oxides whereas other as species were insignificantly adsorbed fig 7b the silica complexes mainly occupied the weak site 77 9 fig 7b in accordance with observations of other studies employing the same modeling approach jessen et al 2012 postma et al 2007 the hco3 species only accounted for 3 4 of the site fig 7b in comparison surface complex calculation by postma et al 2007 indicated that hco3 covered 48 of the weak site of sedimentary fe oxide in the presence of about 10 mmol l aqueous hco3 arsenic displacement by hco3 from the surfaces of fe oxide minerals was suggested to be one of as mobilization mechanisms anawar et al 2004 appelo et al 2002 however the present study figs 1d 2a as well as postma et al 2007 observed that uppermost groundwater already had high hco3 concentration but contained very little as such observation suggests that the displacement effect of hco3 may be not significant in the dy aquifer arsenite occupied almost all surface sites of fes but taking the site densities and mineral contents into account the fe iii oxides adsorbed 5 9 times as much arsenic as fes fig 3d the arsenite adsorbed on fe iii oxides and fes which equals 60 120 of dissolved as iii therefore is another significant pool of as in the aquifer fig 3d it is noteworthy that the vertical distribution of the adsorbed as is generally proportional to that of dissolved as iii concentration as iii desorption adsorption will occur in tandem to the decrease or increase of aqueous as iii concentration under the control of thermodynamic equilibrium the similarity thus reflects the capacity of the adsorbed as pool to adapt to the changes in dissolved as iii concentration but as the dissolution of fe iii oxides leads to the decrease of surface site amount such a capacity may gradually lose secondary fes can supplement binding sites for as but since only part of the released fe ii was transformed into fes and the fes had a lower affinity for as than fe iii oxides couture et al 2013 the overall result would be a decrease in the distribution coefficient kd of as such as at the 25 m depth fig 3d due to the varying extents of fe iii oxide reduction over depth as iii transport through the aquifer could cause as desorption or retardation in different layers which additionally contributed to the variability of as concentrations in the groundwater 4 3 implication for other arsenic affected aquifers both the observation data and the reactive transport modeling results suggest that the geochemical processes of fe s and as are interacted and have strong impact on the fate of as in the aquifer system while the rate of organic matter degradation overall determines the extent of redox zonation the stability of fe iii oxides is one key factor determining the electron shunting between fe iii oxide and sulfate reduction potentially including methanogenesis when sulfate is exhausted kocar et al 2014 postma et al 2016 for the scenarios of s se asia such as the case of dan phuong holocene aquifer on the red river floodplain postma et al 2007 dissolved sulfate could have been depleted in the very shallow depths before it penetrated into deeper aquifers an exceptional observation should be the as and so4 2 co contaminated groundwater in punjab pakistan where dissolved so4 2 concentration ranged from 284 to 1550 mg l and as concentration reached 1900 μg l within the depth of 30 m farooqi et al 2007a however the mobilization of as existing mainly as arsenate in the punjab groundwater is more likely controlled by desorption under high ph up to 8 8 conditions instead of fe iii oxide reductive dissolution farooqi et al 2007b in contrast when neutral arsenite is the predominant as species in the high as reducing groundwater the effect of ph on as mobilization may be more prominent in restraining the rate of as release by fe iii oxide reduction than influencing as adsorption postma et al 2016 in s se asian holocene aquifers one of the important contributors to the decoupled relationship of dissolved fe ii and as concentration is the removal of fe ii by siderite horneman et al 2004 mcarthur et al 2004 postma et al 2007 yet high as groundwater generally had high fe ii concentration in addition to siderite precipitation fe ii is also removed by sulfate reduction in the datong aquifer and this process could be one reason for the occurrence of high as in low fe ii groundwater in some cases an inverse relationship between as and fe ii even can be observed in sulfate reducing groundwater guo et al 2013 pi et al 2017 wang et al 2014 in this study a total model time of 1200 years was assigned to describe the redox zonation in the aquifer the hydrochemistry at the end of modeling approaches a steady state prolonging the run time will cause no hydrochemical changes but produces more secondary minerals than measured for simplicity it is assumed that the rate of organic matter degradation kept constant in each cell over time this is acceptable for the not very long model time but may be inappropriate for a timescale of thousands of years postma et al 2016 showed that for a period of 6000 years the reactivity of the organic matter decreased as a power function of the burial age in the red river delta aquifer deposits such a dependence relationship may also explain the decreasing rate of organic matter degradation over the depth of 22 30 m in the present study site since the deeper sediments could be older in burial age and thus had less reactive organic carbon besides the changes in the rates of fe iii oxide reduction as a function of mineral stability as well as ph value can impact the adsorption affinity for as and thus the kd value that consequently varied by a factor of 2 over depth in the aquifer fig 3d in this sense the variability of as kd value if employed to predict as variation in the groundwater needs to be considered in as adsorption models covering a long timescale postma et al 2016 radloff et al 2011 van geen et al 2008b 5 conclusions for sulfate containing aquifers the vertical distribution of groundwater as concentration is geochemically controlled by the fe s as interactions as a result of the depth dependent redox zonation a good demonstration is the occurrence of geogenic as contaminated groundwater in a shallow sulfate reducing aquifer of the datong basin where as concentration showed high vertical variation between 0 05 and 18 μmol l but generally increased in the depth of 20 25 m and then decreased in 25 30 m the high as groundwater was generally low in dissolved fe ii 0 007 mmol l and contained appreciable dissolved sulfide up to 15 μmol l representative of a scenario contrary to the s se asian high as groundwater which usually occurs devoid of sulfate reduction hydrogeochemical data in combination with reactive transport modeling results suggest that electrons from the organic matter biodegradation were mainly shunted between the reduction of fe iii oxides and sulfate but the majority 60 may have been transferred to the latter process due to the moderate reactivity of fe iii oxides the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxides contributed to the increase of dissolved as concentration in the upper part of the aquifer most of the fe ii released was removed by the precipitation of both siderite and fe ii sulfides causing the decoupling of fe ii and as concentration groundwater as decrease in the lower part may be ascribed to as incorporation by fe ii sulfides which more likely occurs following the elevation of groundwater as as iii being the major aqueous as species can be adsorbed by the remaining fe iii oxides and newly formed fe ii sulfides but this pool of as changes in response to the extents of fe iii oxide reduction thereby leading to the variation of as distribution coefficient between the aqueous and the solid phases this study reinforces the importance of coupled geochemical cycling of fe s and as for as variation in groundwater with similar hydrogeochemical characteristics 6 author

7271,high spatial variability of arsenic as concentration in geogenic as contaminated groundwater has been commonly observed worldwide but the underlying reasons remain not well understood selecting a sulfate containing as affected aquifer at the datong basin northern china as the study area and combining hydrogeochemical investigation and sediment extraction with reactive transport modeling this work elucidated the roles of fe s as interactions in regulating the vertical variation of as concentration in the groundwater dissolved as concentration varied between 0 05 and 18 μmol l but generally increased in the depth of 20 25 m and then decreased in 25 30 m the high as groundwater contained low fe ii 0 007 mmol l and up to 15 μmol l sulfide in contrary to the s se asian deltas floodplains where high fe ii and as jointly occur in the groundwater devoid of sulfate reduction the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxides coupled to the degradation of organic matter with an estimated maximum rate of 0 22 mmol c l yr mainly accounted for the depth dependent increase of as concentration in the upper part of the shallow aquifer 25 m deep however the decreasing reactivity of fe iii oxides together with the increase of ph over depth rendered the majority of electrons being transferred to sulfate reduction the fe ii sulfides formed as a consequence not only helped to restrict the build up of fe ii in the groundwater but also probably co precipitated as to prompt as decrease in the depth of 25 30 m arsenite adsorbed on remaining fe iii oxides and newly formed fe ii sulfides is another important pool of as in the aquifer which varies in response to the extents of fe iii oxide and sulfate reduction and consequently alters as distribution coefficient between the solid and the aqueous phases this study highlights the importance of coupled geochemical cycling of fe s and as for as mobilization and reveals how it regulates as partitioning between groundwater and sediments keywords arsenic variability redox zonation fe s as interactions reactive transport model groundwater 1 introduction geogenic arsenic as contaminated groundwater has been an issue of worldwide concern due to the global occurrence and health threat to more than one hundred of million people fendorf et al 2010 ravenscroft et al 2009 long term intake of high as 10 µg l who 2011 groundwater can lead to numerous symptoms of chronic as poisoning particularly the cardio vascular diseases as well as fatal cancers in local residents argos et al 2010 and the use of high as groundwater for agricultural irrigation and livestock farming is likely to cause the accumulation of as in rice wheat grains and other food thus potentially expanding its impact to larger populations punshon et al 2017 in tackling with the problem of high as groundwater researchers have explored the processes governing as mobilization in different types of aquifers in the past two decades and substantially improved our understanding of as environmental behaviors however a clear interpretation of the complicated hydrobiogeochemistry of those aquifer systems which ultimately impacts the variability of as and other environmentally relevant elements remains a challenge fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 postma et al 2016 wang et al 2017 one of the unresolved problems which hinders the prediction of aqueous as is the high spatial variability of as concentration in the groundwater fendorf et al 2010 postma et al 2016 van geen et al 2008a in both great floodplains of south southeast s se asia fendorf et al 2010 postma et al 2012 van geen et al 2008a and arid humid regions of east asia gan et al 2014 guo et al 2014 pi et al 2017 groundwater as concentration greatly varied from sites to sites and even at the same locality showed high spatial variability while diversities in geological units site topography and local hydrogeological settings exert strong influences on the behaviors of as in those aquifers polizzotto et al 2008 stuckey et al 2015b van geen et al 2008b winkel et al 2011 one common feature is that geochemical properties of the aquifers and associated hydrobiogeochemical processes play critical roles in as mobilization stuckey et al 2016 wang et al 2017 in both deltas floodplains of s se asia and fluvial lacustrine plains of east asia the direct source of as in the groundwater has been commonly recognized to be the as associated with metal such as fe and mn oxides and sulfides and in reducing aquifers as is primarily released by the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides coupled to the degradation of organic matter mcarthur et al 2004 polizzotto et al 2005 postma et al 2012 xie et al 2013 however the loading and reactivities of endogenous or exogenous organic matter as well as redox components such as fe oxides sulfate in the high as aquifer systems may vary depending on their sources and other factors harvey et al 2002 postma et al 2012 whaley martin et al 2016 and thus influence the geochemical environments to different degrees yielding circumneutral to moderately alkaline ph and weakly oxidizing to strongly reducing conditions fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 pi et al 2017 postma et al 2007 for instance depending on the depositional environments and sediment burial age the as bearing fe iii oxides within aquifers probably exhibit large variations in composition and stability which in turn controls the fe iii oxide reduction rates and thus the extents of as release postma et al 2012 stuckey et al 2015a besides the reduction of fe iii oxides can also promote the re partitioning of fe and as between aqueous and solid phases horneman et al 2004 postma et al 2016 and as adsorption is further impacted by the surface site properties of sediments as species and the types of competing ions appelo et al 2002 dixit and hering 2003 giménez et al 2007 nguyen et al 2014 stachowicz et al 2008 more recently it has been recognized that sulfur s biogeochemical cycling exerts important influences on as fate in natural environments burton et al 2013 guo et al 2016 wallis et al 2011 wang et al 2014 groundwater sulfate may come from the atmospheric precipitation the dissolution of terrestrial evaporates the decomposition of s containing organic matter seawater transgression as well as anthropogenic perturbations farooqi et al 2007a stuckey et al 2015c xie et al 2013 in some cases aqueous sulfate could be produced by the oxidation of pyrite during the aquifer storage and recovery asr process which may simultaneously lead to the mobilization of incorporated as jones and pichler 2007 wallis et al 2011 under reducing conditions dissolved sulfate is an electron accepting competitor toward fe iii oxides postma and jakobsen 1996 and the produced sulfide can be actively involved in as transformations and mobilization immobilization burton et al 2011 2013 couture et al 2010 on the one hand sulfide induced as thiolation in natural water is able to produce a vast number of aqueous species that are stable under strongly reducing conditions and potentially enhance as mobility due to their weaker adsorption on fe minerals than arsenate and arsenite couture et al 2010 2013 kumar et al 2016 stucker et al 2014 on the other hand sulfide can react with as to produce as sulfide minerals causing as retention into sediments o day et al 2004 or result in the formation of various types of fe ii sulfide minerals that can re sequester as from the groundwater bostick and fendorf 2003 kocar et al 2010 lowers et al 2007 different from the scenario of s se asian deltas floodplains that high as groundwater usually occurs in aquifers devoid of sulfate reduction fendorf et al 2010 stuckey et al 2016 in some fluvial lacustrine basins of northern china such as the datong basin the hetao basin and the huhhot basin significant amounts of dissolved sulfate are present in the shallow aquifers and as enriched groundwater frequently occurs under sulfate reducing conditions guo et al 2013 2016 pi et al 2017 smedley et al 2003 wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 our previous studies via employing multiple isotope methods suggested that sulfate reduction is an important electron accepting process in the shallow aquifers of the datong basin and as mobilization is closely linked to the geochemical cycling of fe and s wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 the produced sulfide may have facilitated the reduction of as bearing fe iii oxides and or the formation as s components accounting for as 50 μg l in sulfate reducing groundwater wang et al 2014 besides fe mineral transformations between non sulfidic fe ii phases and fe ii sulfides induced by sulfate reduction are likely to regulate as enrichment in the groundwater via adsorption and co precipitation xie et al 2014a likewise previous studies in the hetao basin implied that microbial sulfate reduction contributed to the changes in dissolved fe ii sulfide and as and sulfide could enhance the reduction of as bearing fe iii oxides as well as the removal of fe ii by secondary precipitation guo et al 2013 2016 however how the fe s as interactions control the spatial variation of dissolved as concentrations in sulfate reducing aquifers and other similar environments remains not well understood and a quantitative elucidation of the interacting processes which is important for predicting aqueous as concentrations and water quality management is urgently needed in the present study we attempt to elucidate the fe s as interactions in a known high as aquifer system under sulfate reducing conditions and their roles in controlling the vertical variation of as concentration in the groundwater to achieve this goal we collected hydrochemical and sediment geochemical data from an as affected site at the datong basin and integrated them into a reactive transport model to analyze how water chemistry evolved over depth and how as was distributed between sediments and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling this study focuses on the shallow aquifer 20 30 m below the land surface beneath the west part of the dy site located in the center of datong basin fig 1 which is a typical geogenic as contaminated area in fluvial lacustrine basins of northern china the aquifer mainly comprises medium to fine sands with occasional silts and silty sands the water 18o 16o and d 1h isotope evidence suggested that meteoric water acted as an important recharge source of the high as groundwater xie et al 2012 a total of 16 groundwater samples were collected in july 2014 from the monitoring wells fig 1b groundwater pumped out directly entered an online flow cell that was equipped with portable meters hach hq40d for temperature t ph and electrical conductivity ec the dissolved fe ii sulfide and nh4 n concentrations were on site determined spectrophotometrically hach dr2800 after taking samples with filter equipped 0 45 μm syringes into the cuvettes containing colorimetric reagents with blanks calibrated using milli q water pi et al 2017 alkalinity was measured using gran titration method immediately in the field laboratory anion cation and total as samples were vacuum filtered 0 45 μm and then collected into pre cleaned 50 ml hdpe bottles respectively with cations and total as acidified to ph 2 using ultra pure hno3 dissolved organic carbon doc samples were quickly filtered acidified to ph 2 using ultra pure hcl and stored in 50 ml amber glass bottles aqueous arsenite and arsenate species were immediately separated on site using disposable anion exchange resin lc sax sigma aldrich le et al 2000 with the passages collected into hdpe bottles and acidified to ph 2 by ultra pure hno3 arsenate concentration was calculated from the difference between total as and arsenite the separation method for arsenate and arsenite was validated by testing mixed standards spiked to groundwater samples generating recoveries for arsenite and arsenate of 93 5 and 101 5 respectively however the presence of thioarsenate species that are also negatively charged might introduce uncertainty to arsenate concentrations see discussion below samples for carbon stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon dic were collected into 50 ml amber glass bottles sterilized by nan3 and sealed leaving no head space once collected all samples were stored in 4 c refrigerator until analyses during the borehole drilling 14 sediment cores were directly retrieved in hdpe liners from the aquifer with cautions taken to eliminate contamination and disturbance as much as possible and then stored in vacuum bags that were quickly vacuumized followed by immediate capping into pvc casings which were then sealed and preserved in the freezer until analyses 2 2 analytical methods major cation samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical omission spectrometry icp oes icap6300 thermo scientific and anions by ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact ic with detection limits of 0 01 mg l for all total as ast and arsenite that had been separately collected in the field were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkin elmer elandrc e with a detection limit of 0 5 μg l the doc concentrations were measured using the high temperature catalytic combustion method with the toc analyzer toc v shimadzu with a detection limit of 0 01 mg l the analytical errors for aqueous components above mentioned were generally within 5 the determination of carbon stable isotope of dic followed xie et al 2013 the carbon isotopic compositions were reported in standard δ13c notation representing the per mil deviations from the v pdb standard replicate analyses were within 0 2 to extract carbonate minerals freshly thawed subsample was mixed with deoxygenated 0 5 mol l formic acid ph 3 under nitrogen atmosphere into 500 ml glass bottle that was sealed with thick rubber stopper followed by 24 h shaking the co2 sample in the bottle headspace was taken and measured by gas chromatography chromotopac shimadzu the co2 content together with the solution ph was used to calculate the carbonate co3 content in the sediments the contents of ca and mg in the extractants after filtration through 0 22 µm filter were measured by icp oes and then recalculated to the calcite also likely including the polymorph aragonite and dolomite contents in the sediments the fe ii content in the extractants was spectrophotometrically measured after filtration through 0 22 µm filter and used to calculate the feco3 content for all sediment samples the sum of ca mg and fe ii contents is correlated with co3 with molar ratio of 0 95 1 21 namely close to 1 1 the acid volatile sulfide avs was firstly transformed into zns suspension using 6 mol l hcl 0 1 mol l ascorbic acid 10 wt zinc acetate solutions and then quantified by the methylene blue method xie et al 2014a the avs concentration was used to calculate fes content in the sediments assuming that the fe ii s molar ratio of acid dissolved fe ii sulfides overall is 1 1 after the removal of adsorbed as by 1 mol l nah2po4 ph 5 as contained in avs was extracted using 1 mol l hcl keon et al 2001 and measured by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs afs 820 titan since as co precipitated with carbonates could be also dissolved the amount of as co precipitated with avs was calculated by subtracting as extracted by 0 5 mol l formic acid ph 3 the analytical errors for carbonates avs and as were generally within 5 2 3 geochemical modeling speciation calculations and reactive transport modeling were conducted using the public code phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 the wateq4f dat database employed has been updated for arsenate and arsenite aqueous species as complexation with cations langmuir et al 2006 and the sulfidation of as species helz and tossell 2008 within the study area accelerated water flow through preferential path or porous medium seems not very possible and the vertical water flow generally can be described by infiltration through sandy aquifers with a flow rate of 0 37 0 10 m year although in localities the variations in water head may lead to deviations see supporting information for further description and flux rate estimation such a simplification which however remains in the acceptable range was applied to the 1 d reactive transport model this model consists of 10 cells with a cell length of 1 m which together cover the 20 30 m depth the flow rate was set to the average vertical infiltration rate of 0 37 m year and the model time was 1200 years solute dispersion was not considered in this model the simulation approach was based on the partial equilibrium concept and the degradation rates of organic matter c n molar ratio 100 1 5 were fitted to the changes in dissolved nh4 concentration over depth assuming that ammonium released from the decomposition of natural organic stays conservative in the reducing aquifer system and thus acts as a good indicator of the degradation intensity postma et al 2007 in addition to as release by the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides logk 4 89 postma et al 2007 as removal by fe ii sulfides fes precipitation logk 3 5 omoregie et al 2013 as adsorption on fe iii oxides and fes and the competitive effects of co existent components were considered in quantifying processes affecting as mobilization the diffuse double layer ddl model of dzombak and morel 1990 was adopted to describe as adsorption on mineral surfaces but in fitting the results it is necessary to adjust the surface site densities and relate them to the mineral amounts see supporting information for model details and the list of thermodynamic parameters used 3 results 3 1 aqueous chemistry the groundwater samples of the study area had ph values ranging from 7 84 to 8 28 with an average of 8 05 table 1 thus hosting weakly moderately alkaline conditions under such ph conditions the hco3 ion predominantly accounted for the alkalinity which varied from 5 94 to 10 2 mmol l and averaged at 7 40 mmol l table 1 higher ph appeared mostly in the lower part of the aquifer fig 2 c whereas higher alkalinity occurred in the upper part fig 2d thermodynamic calculation suggested that the partial pressure of co2 p co2 in the groundwater changed between 10 2 8 and 10 2 2 atm table 1 and generally decreased with depth fig 2e but apparently they all were higher than in the atmosphere p co2 10 3 4 the dissolved inorganic carbon had δ13cdic values between 23 8 and 11 3 with an average of 19 1 comparable to the mean value of biogenic inorganic carbon 13 6 observed in high as groundwater of the datong basin xie et al 2013 the doc concentrations ranged from 0 44 to 1 55 mmol l table 1 and showed an increasing trend at the upper half part of the aquifer followed by slight decrease at greater depths fig 2a na was the dominant cation in the groundwater and together with hco3 made na hco3 the main water type the vertical distribution of redox sensitive components indicates distinct trends in groundwater chemistry fig 2 no3 was only detected in two groundwater samples at the uppermost 1 m of the aquifer with a highest concentration of 0 13 mmol l fig 2f the dissolved fe ii concentration rose at the upper 3 m to 0 007 mmol l decreased at the depth of 23 28 m but then slightly re increased to 0 005 mmol l in the lower part fig 2 g it is worth noting that the mean value of groundwater fe ii concentration 0 0039 mmol l in our study site was almost one or two orders of magnitude lower than the s se asian high as groundwater e g 0 2 mmol l on average in the red river delta mcarthur et al 2004 postma et al 2007 dissolved so4 2 concentration reached 2 23 mmol l in the shallowest groundwater and gradually decreased over depth to almost zero at the depth of 28 m fig 2 h by contrast dissolved sulfide firstly increased up to 15 µmol l at 27 m deep and then decreased at greater depths fig 2i the presence of aqueous sulfide is also reflected by the strong odor of the groundwater pumped out the groundwater ast concentration ranged from 0 05 to 18 µmol l 4 1340 μg l with an average of 7 6 µmol l 570 μg l table 1 low as groundwater ast 10 µg l occurred exclusively in the shallow part of the aquifer fig 3 a with increasing depth as firstly rose to the highest level at 25 m deep and then decreased at greater depths but still maintained a moderate level the arsenite species as iii in fig 3b accounted for 7 6 to 85 7 of total as with an average of 62 6 and its distribution over depth exhibited a similar pattern with ast lower as iii ast ratios were mostly discerned in the shallow part of the aquifer arsenate concentration was calculated as the difference between ast and arsenite but as addressed by planer friedrich et al 2007 in the presence of dissolved sulfide the negatively charged thioarsenate may form and thus can be retained as arsenate due to the limitation of the current on site separation method in this study the as v species could be not limited to arsenate but also include the thioarsenate species despite such uncertainty the arsenite species overall is the main as species in the high as groundwater likewise studies on s se asian aquifers reported the presence of as v in reducing groundwater but also not as the dominant species charlet et al 2007 postma et al 2007 swartz et al 2004 3 2 fe ii sulfide and carbonate minerals in the presence of both fe ii and sulfide in the groundwater there is a potential for the precipitation of fe ii sulfide minerals the speciation calculation indicates that the majority of groundwater samples were oversaturated with respect to amorphous fe ii sulfide fes in fig 4 a in particular along with the increase of dissolved sulfide concentration there was an increasing trend in the saturation index si of amorphous fes in the depth of 20 24 m and the 0 value was maintained at greater depths fig 5 a estimated from the content of avs in the sediment samples the fes content ranged from 0 16 to 1 1 mg g and when re calculated to the contacting groundwater volume was 15 to 103 mmol l in concert with the variation of si value the fes content increased in the depth of 20 24 m and decreased at greater depths fig 6 a the difference between as leached out by 1 mol l hcl and by 0 5 mol l formic acid ph 3 operationally defined as arsenic co precipitated with avs ranged from 0 13 to 4 5 μg g and corresponded to 0 01 0 47 mmol l when re calculated to the contacting groundwater volume fig 6b the dissolved fe ii could also enter siderite in the presence of substantial hco3 except the shallowest groundwater all other samples were oversaturated with respect to siderite feco3 in figs 4b 5b the content of feco3 in the sediments varied between 0 13 and 3 4 mg kg namely between 8 9 and 233 mmol l when re calculated to the contacting groundwater volume the feco3 content increased from the top of the aquifer and reached the highest level at the depth of 23 m but then displayed a decreasing trend at greater depths fig 6c another type of carbonate mineral in the aquifer could be calcite caco3 most of the groundwater samples were oversaturated with respect to caco3 implying precipitation potential of this mineral fig 4c different from fes and feco3 the si value of caco3 did not show obvious depth dependent trend fig 5c the caco3 content in the sediments changed between 4 1 and 95 mg g with an average of 48 mg g all the groundwater samples were oversaturated with dolomite camg co3 2 and the dolomite content calculated from extracted mg concentration varied from 0 82 to 9 7 mg g with a mean value of 4 7 mg g overall calcite seems to be the major carbonate mineral in the sediments 4 discussion 4 1 redox zonation the depth dependent disappearance of no3 and so4 2 in combination with the presence of fe ii and sulfide in the groundwater suggests the evolution of redox sequence in the aquifer and the occurrence of fe iii oxide and or so4 2 reduction in the high as groundwater pi et al 2017 xie et al 2013 as reflected by the δ13cdic values fig 2b the biodegradation of organic matter could have been an important electron donating process to promote the redox zonation in the aquifer xie et al 2013 labile organic matter may be endogenous coming from the sedimentary organic matter which contained up to 5 wt organic carbon xie et al 2014b the biodegradation of sedimentary organic carbon not only could be a source of excessive co2 thereby along with groundwater permeation contributing to the higher p co2 in the groundwater relative to the atmosphere but also produced doc like microbially derived humic substance to elevate the concentration in the groundwater pi et al 2015 the modeling results suggest that the rates of organic matter degradation changed over depth in the upper 1 m of the aquifer 20 21 m depth the estimated rate was 0 04 mmol c l yr and in the 21 22 m depth it increased to 0 11 mmol c l yr in the depth of 22 25 m the rate further increased to 0 22 mmol c l yr however in the 25 30 m interval the rate decreased from 0 15 to 0 04 mmol c l yr in accordance with the field observations modeling results indicate that redox zonation began with denitrification in the uppermost part of the aquifer red line in fig 2f after the exhaustion of no3 the reduction of fe iii oxides and so4 2 co occurred in the zones of 22 28 m depth the solubility of fe iii oxides expressed as k fe3 oh 3 was fitted to be 10 41 25 in the depth of 20 25 m 10 41 3 of 25 26 m 10 41 5 of 26 27 m and 10 41 6 of 27 30 m suggesting an increasing trend in the stability of fe iii oxides over depth the fe iii oxides in solubility correspond to lepidocrocite or poorly crystalline goethite and the dissolved sulfate thus is a competitive electron acceptor toward the fe oxides postma and jakobsen 1996 in the 22 23 m depth only one third of electrons were transferred to the fe iii reduction leading to an equivalent release of fe ii whilst two third of the electrons were consumed by sulfate reduction to produce sulfide which in molar amount only equaled 20 of released fe ii according to the reaction stoichiometry in the depth of 23 25 m although the organic matter degradation rate and the stability of fe iii oxides kept constant the ph increase fig 2c caused by the fe iii oxide reduction in turn inhibited the dissolution of fe iii oxides postma et al 2016 and consequently more electrons were transferred to sulfate reduction resulting in the drop of fe ii release but the increase of dissolved sulfide concentration in the depth of 25 28 m the increased stability of the fe iii oxides additionally contributed to the decrease in electron shunting by fe iii reduction 20 for the same reason in the bottom 2 m of the aquifer where so4 2 though had been almost depleted the fe iii oxide reduction consumed only about 18 of the electrons so as to not prompt significant fe ii re increase fig 2 g whereas methanogenesis might use the rest of electrons and potentially resulted in the accumulation of ch4 in the groundwater red line in fig 2j the ch4 failed to be measured in this area but it was detected in neighboring as affected aquifers the co occurrence of fe oxide reduction and methanogenesis had been observed in high as reducing aquifers of s se asia postma et al 2007 2016 comparing the hydrochemical and sediment geochemical data above it is easy to find that much more fe ii resides in the sediments than in the groundwater the formation of both fe ii sulfide and siderite seems to be the controlling process fitting the saturation index and content of fes and feco3 indicates that in the 22 23 m depth about 76 3 of the fe ii released by fe iii oxide reduction was precipitated into feco3 and 23 6 into fes fig 6 in the interval of 23 25 m enhanced sulfate reduction and weakened fe iii oxide reduction resulted in the elevation of fes production but the decrease of feco3 precipitation over depth however below the depth of 25 m the decrease in electron flow and the increase in fe iii oxide stability jointly led to the decrease in fe ii release which then lessened the contents of fes and feco3 in the lower half part of the aquifer fig 6 in summary while a large amount of fe ii may have been initially released by fe iii oxide reduction most of them had been re partitioned back to the sediment via secondary mineral formation or fe mineral transformation leaving little fe ii in the groundwater such a process can be more favorable under the alkaline ph conditions because oh helps to remove protons released during the precipitation processes 4 2 geochemical constraints on arsenic variability 4 2 1 concurrent fe oxide and sulfate reduction our previous studies strongly suggested that in the shallow aquifer systems of the datong basin the dominant process controlling as release is the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxides wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 assuming an as fe molar ratio of 0 006 in the fe iii oxides based on previous sediment extraction results pi et al 2017 xie et al 2008 the modeling results indicate that the reduction of as bearing fe iii oxides mainly contributed to as increase in the upper 5 m groundwater fig 3a under the reducing conditions most of the released arsenate was reduced to arsenite and thus as iii showed an increasing trend similar to ast fig 3b the modeling results also suggest the presence of as v species in the groundwater and the modeled concentration reached the highest level at the depth of 25 m but much lower than the measured fig 3c taking the groundwater containing the highest ast 18 μmol l as an example the model calculation implies that in the presence of dissolved sulfide the thioarsenates would be the main as v species fig 7 a thioarsenates are likely to form under the alkaline reducing conditions burton et al 2013 couture et al 2010 kumar et al 2016 but depending on the dissolved sulfide concentration they would only account for 10 5 of ast the reason responsible for the difference from the measurement may be that as v reduction was kinetically controlled and thus did not reach equilibrium with other terminal electron accepting processes postma et al 2007 or that some arsenate temporarily remained unreduced when not yet transported into the as reductase containing bacterial cells saltikov et al 2005 despite the uncertainties the modeling results highlight the important control of redox zonation on the elevation of as iii concentration in the groundwater while the decrease in the rates of fe iii oxide reduction could reduce as release it alone cannot explain the decreasing trend in the lower part of the aquifer fig 3b it has been recognized that fe ii sulfide minerals produced under the sulfate reducing conditions could be a significant sequester for as pi et al 2017 xie et al 2014a the increasing as concentration in the interval of 22 25 m could favor the co precipitation of as with the neo formed fe ii sulfides kocar et al 2010 wilkin and ford 2006 while the fitting deviates to some extents from the measured content of as co precipitated with fes the modeling results agree with the observation that more as was sequestered into fes with the increase of aqueous as concentration fig 6b the content of as co precipitated with fes much increased in the depth of 25 27 m up to 0 47 mmol l where groundwater as reached rather high levels at greater depths the content deceased along with the depletion of so4 2 and the decrease of aqueous as concentration it is interesting to note that the zone with decreasing as concentration 25 28 m deep is exactly where sulfate reduction became predominant in the electron accepting processes consuming 70 90 of total electrons an important implication of this finding is that in aquifers containing both fe iii oxides and sulfate the increase of groundwater as will suspend in response to the depletion of easily reducible as bearing fe oxides i e the increased stability and the increasing electron shunting to sulfate reduction the as variation seems to be subtly influenced by the shifts in the redox zonation and the secondary mineral forming processes 4 2 2 arsenic adsorption the adsorption of as species on fe iii oxides and fes is another process potentially affecting as mobilization couture et al 2013 postma et al 2016 wolthers et al 2005 given the higher stability of fe iii oxides in the sediments than ferrihydrite 0 2 mol weak site per mol fe that is employed in the standard surface complexation model of dzombak and morel 1990 in this study the density of weak sites was reduced to 0 12 mmol per mol fe oxide in correspondence with a sedimentary fe oxide content of 1 mol fe iii oxide per liter of contacting groundwater for similar reasons the weak site number on fes became 0 02 mmol per mol fes in the sediments wolthers et al 2005 taking the highest as groundwater as an example again the modeling results indicate that arsenite occupied 10 3 of the surface site of fe iii oxides whereas other as species were insignificantly adsorbed fig 7b the silica complexes mainly occupied the weak site 77 9 fig 7b in accordance with observations of other studies employing the same modeling approach jessen et al 2012 postma et al 2007 the hco3 species only accounted for 3 4 of the site fig 7b in comparison surface complex calculation by postma et al 2007 indicated that hco3 covered 48 of the weak site of sedimentary fe oxide in the presence of about 10 mmol l aqueous hco3 arsenic displacement by hco3 from the surfaces of fe oxide minerals was suggested to be one of as mobilization mechanisms anawar et al 2004 appelo et al 2002 however the present study figs 1d 2a as well as postma et al 2007 observed that uppermost groundwater already had high hco3 concentration but contained very little as such observation suggests that the displacement effect of hco3 may be not significant in the dy aquifer arsenite occupied almost all surface sites of fes but taking the site densities and mineral contents into account the fe iii oxides adsorbed 5 9 times as much arsenic as fes fig 3d the arsenite adsorbed on fe iii oxides and fes which equals 60 120 of dissolved as iii therefore is another significant pool of as in the aquifer fig 3d it is noteworthy that the vertical distribution of the adsorbed as is generally proportional to that of dissolved as iii concentration as iii desorption adsorption will occur in tandem to the decrease or increase of aqueous as iii concentration under the control of thermodynamic equilibrium the similarity thus reflects the capacity of the adsorbed as pool to adapt to the changes in dissolved as iii concentration but as the dissolution of fe iii oxides leads to the decrease of surface site amount such a capacity may gradually lose secondary fes can supplement binding sites for as but since only part of the released fe ii was transformed into fes and the fes had a lower affinity for as than fe iii oxides couture et al 2013 the overall result would be a decrease in the distribution coefficient kd of as such as at the 25 m depth fig 3d due to the varying extents of fe iii oxide reduction over depth as iii transport through the aquifer could cause as desorption or retardation in different layers which additionally contributed to the variability of as concentrations in the groundwater 4 3 implication for other arsenic affected aquifers both the observation data and the reactive transport modeling results suggest that the geochemical processes of fe s and as are interacted and have strong impact on the fate of as in the aquifer system while the rate of organic matter degradation overall determines the extent of redox zonation the stability of fe iii oxides is one key factor determining the electron shunting between fe iii oxide and sulfate reduction potentially including methanogenesis when sulfate is exhausted kocar et al 2014 postma et al 2016 for the scenarios of s se asia such as the case of dan phuong holocene aquifer on the red river floodplain postma et al 2007 dissolved sulfate could have been depleted in the very shallow depths before it penetrated into deeper aquifers an exceptional observation should be the as and so4 2 co contaminated groundwater in punjab pakistan where dissolved so4 2 concentration ranged from 284 to 1550 mg l and as concentration reached 1900 μg l within the depth of 30 m farooqi et al 2007a however the mobilization of as existing mainly as arsenate in the punjab groundwater is more likely controlled by desorption under high ph up to 8 8 conditions instead of fe iii oxide reductive dissolution farooqi et al 2007b in contrast when neutral arsenite is the predominant as species in the high as reducing groundwater the effect of ph on as mobilization may be more prominent in restraining the rate of as release by fe iii oxide reduction than influencing as adsorption postma et al 2016 in s se asian holocene aquifers one of the important contributors to the decoupled relationship of dissolved fe ii and as concentration is the removal of fe ii by siderite horneman et al 2004 mcarthur et al 2004 postma et al 2007 yet high as groundwater generally had high fe ii concentration in addition to siderite precipitation fe ii is also removed by sulfate reduction in the datong aquifer and this process could be one reason for the occurrence of high as in low fe ii groundwater in some cases an inverse relationship between as and fe ii even can be observed in sulfate reducing groundwater guo et al 2013 pi et al 2017 wang et al 2014 in this study a total model time of 1200 years was assigned to describe the redox zonation in the aquifer the hydrochemistry at the end of modeling approaches a steady state prolonging the run time will cause no hydrochemical changes but produces more secondary minerals than measured for simplicity it is assumed that the rate of organic matter degradation kept constant in each cell over time this is acceptable for the not very long model time but may be inappropriate for a timescale of thousands of years postma et al 2016 showed that for a period of 6000 years the reactivity of the organic matter decreased as a power function of the burial age in the red river delta aquifer deposits such a dependence relationship may also explain the decreasing rate of organic matter degradation over the depth of 22 30 m in the present study site since the deeper sediments could be older in burial age and thus had less reactive organic carbon besides the changes in the rates of fe iii oxide reduction as a function of mineral stability as well as ph value can impact the adsorption affinity for as and thus the kd value that consequently varied by a factor of 2 over depth in the aquifer fig 3d in this sense the variability of as kd value if employed to predict as variation in the groundwater needs to be considered in as adsorption models covering a long timescale postma et al 2016 radloff et al 2011 van geen et al 2008b 5 conclusions for sulfate containing aquifers the vertical distribution of groundwater as concentration is geochemically controlled by the fe s as interactions as a result of the depth dependent redox zonation a good demonstration is the occurrence of geogenic as contaminated groundwater in a shallow sulfate reducing aquifer of the datong basin where as concentration showed high vertical variation between 0 05 and 18 μmol l but generally increased in the depth of 20 25 m and then decreased in 25 30 m the high as groundwater was generally low in dissolved fe ii 0 007 mmol l and contained appreciable dissolved sulfide up to 15 μmol l representative of a scenario contrary to the s se asian high as groundwater which usually occurs devoid of sulfate reduction hydrogeochemical data in combination with reactive transport modeling results suggest that electrons from the organic matter biodegradation were mainly shunted between the reduction of fe iii oxides and sulfate but the majority 60 may have been transferred to the latter process due to the moderate reactivity of fe iii oxides the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxides contributed to the increase of dissolved as concentration in the upper part of the aquifer most of the fe ii released was removed by the precipitation of both siderite and fe ii sulfides causing the decoupling of fe ii and as concentration groundwater as decrease in the lower part may be ascribed to as incorporation by fe ii sulfides which more likely occurs following the elevation of groundwater as as iii being the major aqueous as species can be adsorbed by the remaining fe iii oxides and newly formed fe ii sulfides but this pool of as changes in response to the extents of fe iii oxide reduction thereby leading to the variation of as distribution coefficient between the aqueous and the solid phases this study reinforces the importance of coupled geochemical cycling of fe s and as for as variation in groundwater with similar hydrogeochemical characteristics 6 author

7272,influence diagnostics aim to identify a small number of influential data points that have a disproportionate impact on the model parameters and or predictions the key issues with current influence diagnostic techniques are that the regression theory approaches do not provide hydrologically relevant influence metrics while the case deletion approaches are computationally expensive to calculate the main objective of this study is to introduce a new two stage hybrid framework that overcomes these challenges by delivering hydrologically relevant influence metrics in a computationally efficient manner stage one uses computationally efficient regression theory influence diagnostics to identify the most influential points based on cook s distance stage two then uses case deletion influence diagnostics to quantify the influence of points using hydrologically relevant metrics to illustrate the application of the hybrid framework we conducted three experiments on 11 hydro climatologically diverse australian catchments using the gr4j hydrological model the first experiment investigated how many data points from stage one need to be retained in order to reliably identify those points that have the hightest influence on hydrologically relevant metrics we found that a choice of 30 50 is suitable for hydrological applications similar to those explored in this study 30 points identified the most influential data 98 of the time and reduced the required recalibrations by 99 for a 10 year calibration period the second experiment found little evidence of a change in the magnitude of influence with increasing calibration period length from 1 2 5 to 10 years even for 10 years the impact of influential points can still be high 30 influence on maximum predicted flows the third experiment compared the standard least squares sls objective function with the weighted least squares wls objective function on a 10 year calibration period in two out of three flow metrics there was evidence that sls with the assumption of homoscedastic residual error identified data points with higher influence largest changes of 40 10 and 44 for the maximum mean and low flows respectively than wls with the assumption of heteroscedastic residual errors largest changes of 26 6 and 6 for the maximum mean and low flows respectively the hybrid framework complements existing model diagnostic tools and can be applied to a wide range of hydrological modelling scenarios keywords hydrologic model calibration influence diagnostics influence analysis leverage generalized leverage cook s distance 1 introduction hydrological model calibration whereby parameters are identified to best match simulated with observed hydrological response is a critical component of model development as parameters generally cannot be inferred directly from catchment measurements beven 2011 studies have recently called for the use of influence diagnostics as part of model calibration e g foglia et al 2009 foglia et al 2007 hill et al 2015 wright et al 2015 wright et al 2018 to understand the extent to which a small number of influential data points have a disproportionate impact on model calibration for example wright et al 2015 showed that removing a single value of daily streamflow from two years of calibration data could affect the maximum predicted streamflow by 25 in a semi arid catchment however the current approaches to identifying influential points referred to as influence diagnostics have significant drawbacks that limit their ability to identify influential points across a large number of hydrological studies this paper therefore develops a two stage hybrid framework for influence analysis which aims to utilise the strengths of the two separate classes of influence diagnostics case deletion and regression theory influence diagnostics case deletion influence diagnostics measure the influence of censoring deleting a data point case from the set of calibration points recalibrating and then providing a measure of the difference between the original and recalibrated model parameters and or predictions case deletion diagnostics are common in the statistics literature e g chen et al 2012 cook 1977 pinho et al 2015 rocha and simas 2011 ross 1987 vanegas 2010 in hydrological applications e g foglia et al 2009 foglia et al 2007 wright et al 2015 they are particularly attractive as they can be tailored to provide interpretable measures of influence with respect to streamflow or any metric that the modeller wishes to investigate such as the change in maximum or total predicted flow additionally case deletion makes no assumptions regarding the type of model linear nonlinear or the complexity of the residual error model gaussian heteroscedastic etc although flexible the computational demand associated with re estimating the parameters for every data point in the observed data renders influence analysis using case deletion influence diagnostics infeasible for anything but the simplest models e g for a decade of daily data case deletion requires 3650 model recalibrations a secondary issue with the case deletion approach is that anomalous results may arise when calibrating to complex response surfaces with multiple local optima duan et al 1992 kavetski et al 2006 as each recalibration may lead to parameter sets in different local optima this may cause the case deletion calibrated parameter sets to be different from each other even if the data points have low influence on the actual model calibration to address this issue the modeller may choose to increase the robustness of the optimisation however any such efforts will compound the computational demands of the case deletion recalibrations the second class of influence diagnostics are the regression theory influence diagnostics a commonly applied regression theory influence diagnostic is cook s distance cook 1977 which is a standard diagnostic tool in statistics fung et al 2002 and has been applied to a small number of hydrological studies hill et al 2015 wright et al 2015 wright et al 2018 cook s distance is calculated by combining two regression components for each observed data point 1 the leverage which describes the change of the predicted model output with respect to the corresponding observed output wei et al 1998 and 2 the standardised residuals which are based on the difference between the observed output and the model predicted output as well as the residual error model by combining these two components regression theory influence diagnostics require no additional recalibrations and is therefore an attractive alternative to the computationally demanding case deletion influence diagnostics regression theory influence diagnostics can be calculated using a range of formulations for the leverage some with strict assumptions linear leverage cook 1977 assumes that the regression model is linear and that residual errors are gaussian homoscedastic and independent nonlinear leverage st laurent and cook 1992 1993 can take into account nonlinear model response and is suitable for nonlinear models with gaussian residuals lastly generalised leverage wei et al 1998 cannot only take into account nonlinear model response but can also be applied to a broad range of objective functions including those with heteroscedastic and or non gaussian residual error assumptions wright et al 2018 compared all three leverage formulations and found generalised cook s distance which was based on generalised leverage to be the most suitable approach for identifying influential data for a wide range of hydrological model calibration problems including heteroscedastic residual errors and objective functions based on a bayesian approach that incorporates data uncertainty and or prior parameter information however a key drawback of applying generalised cook s distance as the sole influence diagnostic is that the magnitude of influence may not be interpretable in the context of hydrologically relevant variables such as mean flow high flows relevant to flood risk assessment and low flows relevant to environmental flow assessment the main objective of this study is to develop a computationally efficient and hydrologically informative hybrid framework for quantifying the impact of influential data in hydrological model calibration this new framework seeks to overcome the limitations of current approaches by combining the strengths of the two classes of influence diagnostics namely computational efficiency and the quantification of the influence of data points on hydrologically relevant metrics the hybrid framework achieves this through a two stage approach where the most influential points are first identified using the computationally efficient generalised cook s distance and then case deletion influence diagnostics are applied so that the influence of calibration data can be measured in terms of hydrologically relevant metrics this hybrid framework paves the way for quantifying the influence of individual data points for a wide range of hydrological modelling applications while the primary goal of the paper is to develop the hybrid framework a secondary goal is to demonstrate the value of the framework by investigating the following research questions 1 how many influential data points should be taken from stage one of the hybrid framework 2 how does the magnitude of influence change with calibration period length 3 how does the choice of objective function impact the magnitude of influence addressing these three research questions will demonstrate the value of the hybrid framework and provide modellers with guidance to apply computationally efficient flexible and accurate influence diagnostics to their own studies the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we introduce the general modelling setup and the hybrid framework for influence assessment and describe the three experiments and case study components in section 3 we apply the hybrid framework to the experiments to answer the research questions in section 4 we interpret and discuss the results from the experiments give guidance on implementing the framework and outline future work we finish with the conclusions in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 general modelling setup we define the general model response as 1 y f α x ε where y y 1 y 2 y n is a vector of n observed responses f is the model response α α 1 α 2 α p α is a vector of p α model parameters x is an n k matrix of k observed inputs e g precipitation pet and ε is a vector of n residual errors residuals are further assumed to be realisations from a given probability distribution with p β parameters β β 1 β 2 β p β e g a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unknown standard deviation the whole set of p p α p β parameters to be optimised in model calibration is θ α β we will denote θ as the model parameters that maximise the objective function φ and y as the predicted response associated with θ see section 2 4 1 for further details of the objective functions used in this study 2 2 hybrid framework for influence assessment the hybrid framework for identifying influential data and quantifying the magnitude of their impact on hydrological model calibration consists of the following two stages stage one identifying the most influential data points based on generalised cook s distance once hydrological model calibration has been undertaken stage one proceeds by first calculating regression theory generalised cook s distance section 2 2 1 to the whole set of calibration data the points are ranked by generalised cook s distance and the subset of ni most influential data points with respect to generalised cook s distance are taken to stage two of the hybrid framework stage two quantifying the magnitude of the subset of most influential data ni using case deletion influence diagnostics in stage two we perform case deletion recalibration to the subset of influential data ni identified in stage one of the framework and determine the case deletion influence section 2 2 2 stage two enables the magnitude of influence to be described using model predictions parameters or performance based on hydrologically relevant variables such as mean high and low flows while reducing the runtime of the case deletion component as it is only applied ni times rather than for all n data points in the calibration period 2 2 1 regression theory cook s distance regression theory cook s distance cd is calculated by combining the standardised residual of the ith point ν i see eq 3 with the leverage of ith observation on the ith prediction l ii eq 4 cook and weisberg 1982 fox and weisberg 2011 2 cd i ν i 2 p l ii 1 l i i 2 the standardised residuals ν are obtained by dividing the raw residuals ε by their calibrated standard deviations σ 3 ν y y σ the vector σ is determined based on the assumed residual error model and the resultant objective function see section 2 4 1 for further details of the objective functions used in this study leverage is defined as the rate of the change of the i th predicted value y i with respect to the j th observed value y j cook and weisberg 1982 hoaglin and welsch 1978 st laurent and cook 1992 wei et al 1998 4 l ij y i y j or in matrix notation 5 l y y t where l is an n n matrix the diagonal elements l ii most directly reflect the impact of y i on the model fit cook and weisberg 1982 hoaglin and welsch 1978 st laurent and cook 1992 and are used for calculating regression theory cook s distance wright et al 2018 applied three formulations of leverage i e linear leverage nonlinear leverage and generalised leverage to hydrological case studies and found that generalised leverage was the most suitable for hydrological applications as it does not assume linear model response and can be applied to a general class of regression models and a broad range of objective functions including those with heteroscedastic and or non gaussian residual error assumptions generalised leverage is calculated after model calibration and takes into account the curvature of the objective function about the whole set of calibrated parameters θ in this case the general form of leverage in eq 5 can be expressed as l θ wei et al 1998 6 l θ f α x θ 2 φ θ y x θ 2 1 2 φ θ y x θ y t where φ θ y x is the objective function see section 2 4 1 for those applied in this study f α x θ is the n p jacobian matrix with i th row f i α x θ 2 φ θ y x θ 2 is a p p hessian matrix and 2 φ θ y x θ y t is a p n matrix 2 2 2 case deletion influence diagnostics case deletion influence diagnostics describe the influence of deleting a data point in model calibration and assessing the change to the model predictions parameters and or any metric of interest to the modeller we apply case deletion influence diagnostics to quantify the magnitude of influence by comparing predictions from a model calibrated using the full calibration dataset y and the predictions from a model calibrated after deleting the ith data point y i the influence with respect to change in flow metrics is given as 7 δ metric metric y metric y i metric y 100 in the case study we apply eq 7 to three flow metrics 1 change in maximum flow defined as the change in maximum predicted flow from the hydrological model 2 change in mean flow defined as the mean predicted flow from the hydrological model and 3 change in low flow defined as the predicted 10th percentile low flow by volume of the flow duration curve from the hydrological model note that while in this study we use three flow metrics eq 7 can be applied to a range of hydrologically relevant metric of choice e g model predictions parameters and predictive performance in wright et al 2015 and case deletion based cook s distance in wright et al 2018 2 3 experiments undertaken in this study experiment 1 addresses the first research question described in the introduction and is necessary to guide implementation of the hybrid framework a key component of stage one of the framework is to select a subset of influential data based on regression theory cook s distance to be used in stage two for the case deletion influence diagnostics the goal of experiment 1 therefore is to identify a suitable range of this number ni experiments 2 and 3 then demonstrate the application of the hybrid framework for influence assessment for hydrologically relevant problems articulated in the second and third research questions respectively 2 3 1 how many influential data points should be taken from stage one of the hybrid framework the goal of the first experiment is to investigate a suitable number of influential data points to take from stage one of the hybrid framework a key concern with applying the hybrid framework is that the points identified as most influential by generalised cook s distance may not correspond to the points that are most influential with respect to the different case deletion flow metrics there is a trade off in the choice of ni in that it needs to be large enough to sufficiently capture the most influential data points in terms of the hydrologically relevant metrics but also small enough in order to limit the computational demand of case deletion model recalibrations required by stage two of the hybrid framework as a result appropriate choice of ni is crucial to the successful application of the two stage hybrid framework based on results from initial experimentation we found that for data points ranked outside the top 20 in terms of generalized cook s distance from stage one there was low influence on the case deletion metrics in stage two to ensure we were able to identify the most influential data points in the experiments we proceeded in a conservative manner and extended the case deletion recalibrations investigated to the 100 most influential data identified in stage one we proceed by applying the hybrid framework to these 100 data points and investigate the probability of successfully identifying the most influential data point with respect to the three case deletion flow metrics i e relative change in maximum mean and low flow predictions this enables a recommendation of a suitable choice of ni in future studies 2 3 2 how does the magnitude of influence change with calibration period length in experiment 2 we consider the impact of hydrological calibration period length on influence we start experiment 2 by investigating a suitable number of highest regression theory influential data points to consider in order to maximise the sample size while still focusing the analysis on the most influential data we then investigate whether the magnitude of case deletion influence changes with calibration period length we apply the hybrid framework to four calibration period lengths 1 year 2 years 5 years and 10 years 2 3 3 how does the objective function impact the magnitude of influence in experiment 3 we investigate whether application of different objective functions will change the magnitude of influence using the same criteria for selecting influential points as was used in experiment 2 we apply the hybrid framework to the standard least squares sls and weighted least squares wls objective functions see section 2 4 1 and compare trends with respect to the most influential data points these two objective functions were chosen from the large array of objective functions applied in hydrological modelling as they have a key difference in their formulation the sls objective function has an assumption of homoscedastic residual errors i e constant variance and the wls objective function has an assumption of heteroscedastic residual errors i e variance varying with magnitude of predicted streamflow as residual errors in hydrological applications are generally heteroscedastic see schoups and vrugt 2010 sorooshian and dracup 1980 comparing the sls and wls objective functions will allow investigation of the impact of the differences in these assumptions 2 4 case study components 2 4 1 objective functions 2 4 1 1 standard least squares assuming independent and identically distributed i i d gaussian residual errors the following sls log likelihood can be used as the objective function 8 φ θ y x i 1 n log p n y i f i α x 0 σ 2 where p n x μ σ 2 is the gaussian probability density at x assuming constant mean μ and variance σ 2 as the standard deviation σ is unknown it will need to be estimated and therefore we have the additional parameter β σ note that the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 objective function that is commonly applied in hydrological calibration corresponds to the assumptions of constant variance and gaussian residual errors of the sls objective function 2 4 1 2 weighted least squares as hydrological residual errors are typically heteroscedastic i e larger flows have larger errors we also consider the wls objective function the constant standard deviation σ in eq 8 is replaced by a vector σ that varies in time thereby weighting the variance for each observation e g mcinerney et al 2017 thyer et al 2009 a common covariate for modelling heteroscedasticity in streamflow errors is the predicted streamflow itself e g schoups and vrugt 2010 thyer et al 2009 following evin et al 2014 we consider the standard deviation of residuals to be a linear function of predicted streamflow such that 9 σ β 1 y β 2 the wls objective function then becomes 10 φ θ y x i 1 n log p n y i f i α x 0 σ i 2 as the parameters describing the non constant standard deviation i e β β 1 β 2 are unknown they will need to be estimated 2 4 2 catchments we consider the 11 catchments from the australian hydrologic reference stations database turner et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 that were used by mcinerney et al 2017 these catchments reflect a range of australian conditions with köppen geiger climate classifications ranging from tropical savannah in the north east to temperate regions with warm and dry summers in the south west and central regions peel et al 2007 as illustrated in fig 1 for details of annual precipitation annual runoff runoff ratio and the calibration periods of the 11 catchments see table 1 2 4 3 daily hydrological model the daily lumped hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 was selected based upon its performance e g andréassian et al 2014 evin et al 2014 le moine et al 2007 lebecherel et al 2016 wright et al 2015 and parsimonious model structure allowing for computational efficiency in the case deletion model recalibrations the gr4j hydrological model has a simple structure that represents interception infiltration and percolation see the model structure in gr4j perrin et al 2003 fig 1 gr4j has parameters α α 1 α 2 α 3 α 4 where α 1 is the maximum capacity of the production store α 2 is the groundwater exchange coefficient α 3 is the maximum capacity of the routing store and α 4 is the time base of the unit hydrograph 2 4 4 calibration and evaluation procedure for all cases model calibration parameter estimates were obtained by maximising the objective functions in section 2 4 1 over the calibration periods using a quasi newton optimisation method with 100 multistarts kavetski and clark 2010 to ensure that consistent data is used for comparison across varying calibration period lengths of 1 2 5 and 10 years we use the following approach for the 1 year calibration period we use all 10 of the 1 year periods in the 10 year window i e 110 calibration periods over 11 catchments for the 2 year calibration period we use all 5 of the 2 year periods in the 10 year window i e 55 calibration periods over 11 catchments for the 5 year calibration period we use both of the 5 year periods in the 10 year window i e 22 calibration periods over 11 catchments and for the 10 year calibration period we use the whole 10 year window i e 11 calibration periods over 11 catchments 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 how many influential data points should be taken from stage one of the hybrid framework here we examine the selection of a suitable choice of ni from stage one of the hybrid framework across the panels of fig 2 we show the probability that the most influential data point over the calibration series is contained within the top ni data points with ni ranging from 1 to 100 for the three case deletion influence metrics i e change in maximum flows mean flows and low flows note that because there are more calibration runs for the 1 year calibration periods i e 110 runs compared to the 10 year periods i e 11 runs the 1 year calibration curves panel a are smoother than the 10 year calibration curves panel d see section 2 4 4 for details of evaluation periods across the four calibration period lengths and for each metric we see a typical pattern where the probability of successfully identifying the most influential data point rapidly approaches 100 between ni 1 and ni 10 in the region between ni 10 and ni 30 we see some variability across the calibration period lengths however the curves mostly reach their maximum value by ni 30 interestingly we see that the low flow metric typically requires a higher ni to approach 100 than the maximum flow and mean flow metrics the exception to the above findings is for the 2 year calibration data case where we require an ni of 54 to identify the most influential data point with respect to change in maximum predicted flow we will discuss this unexpected result further in section 4 5 finally examining the curves we see that across the four calibration period lengths and 198 total evaluation periods applied in this study a value of ni of 30 identifies the most influential data point 98 of the time i e 4 cases were not identified across the case studies 3 2 experiment 2 how does the magnitude of influence change with calibration period length we start the analysis in experiment 2 by first investigating a suitable number of most influential data points to consider in our analysis of trends across the calibration period lengths in fig 3 we present boxplots of the magnitude of influence for the three flow metrics for the top 100 points ranked by each metric the results are presented for the four calibration data lengths and grouped together in boxplots for the 1 5 the 6 10 the 11 20 and the 21 100 most influential data points to allow presentation of the whole set of 100 case deletion recalibrations the total number of data points in each boxplot depend on both the calibration period and the number of points within each range for example a one year calibration period with ranks from 1 5 by influence comprises a total of 11 catchments 10 calibration periods 5 ranks 550 points examining the four boxplot groupings in fig 3 we see that the five most influential points 1 5 range have an order of magnitude more influence than the next most influential points in the other two panels we see that there are a small number of influential data points above the 95 quantile in the 6 10 range and generally low influence in the 11 20 range with a small number of outliers for the low flow metric third panel this result indicates that for the cases considered the highest magnitude influence is typically in the 1 5 range and so for the remaining analysis in experiment 2 and experiment 3 we will examine the top 5 most influential points in fig 4 we present the influence of the four calibration period lengths of 1 2 5 and 10 years with the three panels representing the change in flow metrics we present the results from the top 5 most influential data points identified by each metric for each calibration length note that as there are a different number of calibration periods in the 1 2 5 and 10 year periods see explanation of evaluation procedure in section 2 4 4 the boxplots have a decreasing sample size as the calibration period increases 550 for the 1 year period down to 55 for the 10 year period surprisingly across the calibration data lengths we see high magnitude influence and even when applying a 10 year calibration period we see that a single point can have a large magnitude of influence on the predicted flows largest changes of 40 10 and 44 for maximum mean and low flows respectively when examining the 5 95 range for the change in maximum flows panel a there is also no clear visual trend with respect to the change in the magnitude of influence across the calibration periods i e 0 6 20 7 0 6 13 5 0 7 16 2 and 0 4 25 9 for the 5 95 range with the same result for the mean flows panel b i e 0 3 8 7 0 3 8 8 0 2 6 0 and 0 1 5 5 for the 5 95 range and the low flows panel c i e 0 7 19 1 0 6 10 7 0 3 13 2 and 0 2 19 2 for the 5 95 range 3 3 experiment 3 how does the choice of objective function impact the magnitude of influence next we investigate how the selection of an objective function can impact the magnitude of influence when applied to a 10 year calibration period in fig 5 we present change in flow metrics for the sls and wls objective functions similar to fig 4 we present the results from the top 5 most influential data points identified by each metric for each calibration length across the objective functions we see large magnitude influence on the predicted flows for both sls largest changes of 40 10 and 44 for maximum mean and low flows respectively and wls largest changes of 26 6 and 6 for maximum mean and low flows respectively next we compare the change in maximum flows panel a across the two objective functions and see that when comparing the 5 95 range there is a clear trend of the sls objective function having higher influence than wls i e 0 4 25 9 and 0 2 7 9 for the 5 95 quantile range for sls and wls respectively as is the case with the mean flows panel b i e 0 1 5 5 and 0 1 3 4 for the 5 95 range for sls and wls respectively and the low flows panel c i e 0 2 19 2 0 1 3 7 for the 5 95 range for sls and wls respectively we apply the paired wilcoxon signed rank test bauer 1972 to see whether there is a statistically significant difference at the 95 confidence level between the sls and wls objective functions the use of a paired test ensures that the two objective functions are compared case by case i e for a single catchment and a single ranking of influence the sls case is compared to the wls case and so forth the wilcoxon test showed a statistically significant trend between sls and wls for the maximum flows and the low flows but not for the mean flows while the wls objective function does have typically lower influence than sls looking across the panels we see that the wls objective function can still have a large magnitude of influence on the predicted flows largest change of 25 8 5 9 and 6 3 influence for maximum mean and low flows respectively 4 discussion 4 1 experiment 1 the hybrid framework significantly reduces the computational burden of case deletion recalibration the results from experiment 1 indicate that the hybrid framework can successfully be applied with a relatively small subset of influential points identified in stage one of the framework ni compared to the length of the calibration period e g across the cases explored an ni of 30 led to the most influential data point being identified 98 of the time thereby significantly reducing the computational burden of undertaking case deletion recalibration on the whole calibration period i e ni of 30 reduces the required recalibrations by 99 for a 10 year calibration period this result indicates that the hybrid framework is well suited to the hydrological case studies and has been shown to be robust across different aspects of hydrological predictions by the three flow metrics and a diverse range of catchments while a larger choice of ni would provide further confidence that the most influential points have been identified in stage one the choice of ni will be dependent on the complexity of the modelling application and the available computational budget of the modeller the results from this experiment indicate that a choice of ni of 30 50 is suitable for hydrological applications similar to those explored in this study 4 2 experiment 2 influential data can have a large impact regardless of calibration period length the results from experiment 2 showed that surprisingly there is no clear decreasing trend in the magnitude of case deletion influence as the length of the calibration data increases from 1 to 2 to 5 to 10 years even when applying 10 years of calibration data it is still possible to observe large magnitude case deletion influence values 30 indicating that individual data points can strongly influence predictions even when calibrating on relatively long periods there is existing literature giving guidance on the role of calibration period length in hydrological modelling for example perrin et al 2007 found that in general 350 days of calibration data sampled from a larger data set including dry and wet conditions are sufficient to obtain robust estimates of model parameters and singh and bárdossy 2012 show that using a relatively small subset of unusual hydrological events are sufficient to specify the model parameters with the same certainty as using the whole observation period li et al 2010 showed that in general eight years of data are sufficient to obtain steady estimates of model performance and parameters for the hydrological model simhyd chiew et al 2002 gibbs et al 2017 showed the importance of selecting a calibration period that is representative of the expected forecast conditions the results from this experiment indicate that irrespective of calibration period length undertaking influence analysis is important interestingly we also saw that the low flow metric typically requires a higher ni to approach the maximum value than the maximum flow and mean flow metrics which is potentially due to the sls objective function which emphasises high flows leading to a reduced ability for the cook s distance to reproduce the influential data points with respect to the low flow metric 4 3 experiment 3 sls objective function is more susceptible to highly influential data than wls the results from experiment 3 showed some evidence of trend that the sls objective function is more susceptible to highly influential data than the wls objective function particularly for the maximum flow and low flow metrics to investigate the key drivers that lead to this difference here we extend the analysis in experiment 3 to provide an interpretation of the result first we investigate the relationship between the observed and predicted flows together with the magnitude of the influence for the 5 most influential data points under the sls and wls objective functions in fig 6 the results are provided for three example locations i e namoi river murray river at biggara and hellyer river results from the remaining catchment locations are consistent with this analysis based on a visual inspection of fig 6 we obtain the following general conclusions 1 the most influential points for the sls objective function correspond to higher magnitude observed and predicted flows with the large influence corresponding to points with large residual errors as indicated by distance from the 1 1 line 2 the most influential points for wls correspond to the case where the magnitude of the predicted flow is low and tends to be below the observed flow as indicated by the majority of the large influence lying beneath the 1 1 line having categorised the flows that are influential under the two objective functions we next examine the distribution of the standardised residuals and compare with the theoretical distribution in fig 7 the empirical histograms are provided for three flow regimes a all flows included b low flows only included with a threshold defined by the 10th percentile of the volume of the flow duration curve fdc and c high flows only included with a threshold defined with the 95th percentile of the volume of the fdc the results are provided for a single location namoi river results from the remaining locations are consistent with this analysis starting with the sls objective function panels a c and e we see that in all three flow regimes the distribution of the standardised residuals provides a poor match to the theoretical distribution comparing the standard deviation of the standardised residuals across flow regimes we see that for the sls objective function for low flows panel c the standard deviation is much lower than 1 i e 0 05 so that the distribution of standardised residuals is well inside the theoretical distribution in contrast for the wls objective function panel d the standard deviation of the standardised residuals is much closer to 1 i e 1 04 and we see that the distribution of standardised residual closely matches the theoretical distribution although there still are a large number of points outside the theoretical distribution i e 7 points higher than 5 standard deviations moving to the high flow regime for the sls objective function panel e the standard deviation of the standardised residuals is much higher than 1 i e 8 23 so that many of the standardised residuals are well outside of the theoretical distribution i e 30 standard deviations from the mean again in this flow regime the wls objective function panel f has a much closer standard deviation of the standardised residuals to 1 i e 1 19 we see that across the three flow regimes the wls objective function assumption of heteroscedastic residual error better matches the observed residual errors than the sls assumption of homoscedastic residual errors this leads to the sls objective function having a large number of standardised residuals with extreme values particularly in the high flow regime when these high standardised residuals are combined with high leverage there is high influence as indicated by the generalised cook s distance equation 2 the large number of standardised residuals outside of the theoretical distribution for sls in the high flow regime explains the earlier result where the high magnitude residual errors and high magnitude flows are most influential in fig 6 likewise the large number of standardised residuals outside of the theoretical distribution for wls in the low flow regime explains the earlier result where the low magnitude predicted flows are most influential for the wls objective function in fig 6 4 4 requirements for implementing stage one of the framework the regression theory generalised cook s distance applied in stage one of the hybrid framework has two requirements 1 the generalised leverage in eq 6 requires an objective function that can be summed over the individual data points see wright et al 2018 and 2 the standardised residuals in eq 3 require a fitted standard deviation these two requirements mean that regression theory cook s distance is particularly well suited to objective functions that are expressed via a likelihood and cannot be applied to objective functions that do not meet these conditions e g the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 in practice most objective functions commonly used in hydrology can be expressed in this suitable form but where this is not feasible it is not possible to proceed with the first stage of the hybrid approach and it becomes necessary to apply the case deletion recalibration on the full calibration period note that as the matrix elements of generalised leverage in eq 6 are evaluated about the whole set of calibrated parameters θ generalised cook s distance assumes that these parameters are at the global optima and therefore robust model calibration is required in stage one of the framework 4 5 guidance on implementing stage two of the framework a key issue with hydrological model calibration is the presence of local optima in the objective function response surface see duan et al 1992 gupta et al 2013 kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 skahill and doherty 2006 thyer 1999 tolson and shoemaker 2007 as the hybrid framework requires a large number of model recalibrations on the subset of influential data identified in stage one ni stage two inherits the problem with local optima to highlight an example of this we further investigate the unexpected result in experiment 1 where for a single case we required an ni of 54 to identify the most influential change in maximum flow for the 2 year calibration period to investigate whether this large influence is due to the presence of local optima in fig 8 we plot α 1 against the remaining model parameters i e α 2 α 3 and α 4 and the residual error model parameter σ from recalibrating the model for the 100 case deletions we also include the parameters obtained from calibrating the model with the whole calibration period and highlight the case deletion parameters for the earlier unexpected result in experiment 1 corresponding to the abercrombie river catchment with a two year calibration period from 1978 to 1979 here we see that in the highlighted case four of the five parameters all except α 4 are well outside of the range of the other 99 case deletions and also a long distance from the parameters obtained using the whole calibration period there are three possible hypotheses for this result 1 the case deletion recalibration has found an inferior local optima leading to a false positive identification of an influential data point this problem can be addressed by repeating the calibration with a more robust optimisation process 2 the case deletion recalibration has discovered a new global optimum substituting the case deletion parameters back into the whole data calibration and the other case deletion recalibrations and performing a gradient search polish will produce a better solution than originally obtained for the whole data 3 the case deletion recalibration is a true reflection of the influence of the data point on the optimum set of parameters we then proceed with making a decision about whether it should be included or removed from the calibration data regardless of which hypothesis is true the hybrid framework provides an opportunity to examine the case deletion parameters and identify situations where the case deletion is having a problem and needs to be checked 4 6 future work future work could focus on applying the hybrid framework to a broader range of case studies to explore additional hydrological research questions including what is the relationship between model complexity and magnitude of influence and what is the relationship between climatology different catchment characteristics and magnitude of influence addressing these questions would require applying the hybrid framework to a wide range of hydrological models of varying complexity and a larger hydrological dataset e g 200 catchments in coron et al 2012 5 conclusions influence diagnostics identify data points that have a disproportionate impact on model calibration the current methods for influence assessment have drawbacks that have limited their application case deletion based influence diagnostics have a large computational demand whilst regression theory cook s distance does not provide a hydrologically interpretable measure of influence in this study we present a two stage hybrid framework for quantifying influence in hydrological model calibration that combines the strengths of the two existing classes of influence diagnostics namely 1 computational efficiency and 2 quantifying influence using hydrologically relevant metrics stage one identifies the regression theory influential data points using the computationally cheap generalised cook s distance the modeller then choses a suitable subset of influential data points to use in stage two which involves undertaking case deletion recalibration of the hydrological model on the subset of the influential data points identified in stage one in order to quantify influence with respect to any metric of choice after describing the two stage hybrid framework for influence assessment we applied the new approach to three experiments these experiments use 11 climatologically diverse australian catchments two objective functions and the gr4j daily hydrological model the experiments have the following key outcomes 1 a choice of 30 50 data points with the highest regression theory influence from stage one is suitable for hydrological applications similar to those explored in this study i e a ni of 30 identified the most influential data points 98 of the time in the case studies explored and reduces the required recalibrations by 99 for a 10 year calibration period 2 there was no strong evidence of a decreasing trend in the magnitude of influence with increasing calibration period length from 1 to 10 years and even for 10 years the impact of influential points can still be high 30 influence on maximum predicted flows the implication is that applying longer calibration periods does not reduce the likelihood of influential data occurring 3 there was some evidence that the sls objective function identified data points with higher influence largest changes of 40 10 and 44 for maximum mean and low flows than the wls objective function largest changes of 26 6 and 6 for maximum mean and low flows when applied to a 10 year calibration period the implication is that applying wls or any objective function that accounts for heteroscedasticity in residual errors is likely to reduce the impact of influential points as hydrological modelling complexity increases i e more complex model structures fenicia et al 2011 multi catchment datasets e g 200 catchments coron et al 2012 and complex objective functions schoups and vrugt 2010 hydrological modellers are increasingly reliant on methods to detect and diagnose the impact of these modelling decisions on whether a realistic representation of the catchment response has been achieved gupta et al 2008 the hybrid framework for influence assessment is suitable for a wide range of hydrological case studies and will provide modellers with new insights to aid in model calibration that will complement existing model assessment tools applied in hydrological modelling such as sensitivity and

7272,influence diagnostics aim to identify a small number of influential data points that have a disproportionate impact on the model parameters and or predictions the key issues with current influence diagnostic techniques are that the regression theory approaches do not provide hydrologically relevant influence metrics while the case deletion approaches are computationally expensive to calculate the main objective of this study is to introduce a new two stage hybrid framework that overcomes these challenges by delivering hydrologically relevant influence metrics in a computationally efficient manner stage one uses computationally efficient regression theory influence diagnostics to identify the most influential points based on cook s distance stage two then uses case deletion influence diagnostics to quantify the influence of points using hydrologically relevant metrics to illustrate the application of the hybrid framework we conducted three experiments on 11 hydro climatologically diverse australian catchments using the gr4j hydrological model the first experiment investigated how many data points from stage one need to be retained in order to reliably identify those points that have the hightest influence on hydrologically relevant metrics we found that a choice of 30 50 is suitable for hydrological applications similar to those explored in this study 30 points identified the most influential data 98 of the time and reduced the required recalibrations by 99 for a 10 year calibration period the second experiment found little evidence of a change in the magnitude of influence with increasing calibration period length from 1 2 5 to 10 years even for 10 years the impact of influential points can still be high 30 influence on maximum predicted flows the third experiment compared the standard least squares sls objective function with the weighted least squares wls objective function on a 10 year calibration period in two out of three flow metrics there was evidence that sls with the assumption of homoscedastic residual error identified data points with higher influence largest changes of 40 10 and 44 for the maximum mean and low flows respectively than wls with the assumption of heteroscedastic residual errors largest changes of 26 6 and 6 for the maximum mean and low flows respectively the hybrid framework complements existing model diagnostic tools and can be applied to a wide range of hydrological modelling scenarios keywords hydrologic model calibration influence diagnostics influence analysis leverage generalized leverage cook s distance 1 introduction hydrological model calibration whereby parameters are identified to best match simulated with observed hydrological response is a critical component of model development as parameters generally cannot be inferred directly from catchment measurements beven 2011 studies have recently called for the use of influence diagnostics as part of model calibration e g foglia et al 2009 foglia et al 2007 hill et al 2015 wright et al 2015 wright et al 2018 to understand the extent to which a small number of influential data points have a disproportionate impact on model calibration for example wright et al 2015 showed that removing a single value of daily streamflow from two years of calibration data could affect the maximum predicted streamflow by 25 in a semi arid catchment however the current approaches to identifying influential points referred to as influence diagnostics have significant drawbacks that limit their ability to identify influential points across a large number of hydrological studies this paper therefore develops a two stage hybrid framework for influence analysis which aims to utilise the strengths of the two separate classes of influence diagnostics case deletion and regression theory influence diagnostics case deletion influence diagnostics measure the influence of censoring deleting a data point case from the set of calibration points recalibrating and then providing a measure of the difference between the original and recalibrated model parameters and or predictions case deletion diagnostics are common in the statistics literature e g chen et al 2012 cook 1977 pinho et al 2015 rocha and simas 2011 ross 1987 vanegas 2010 in hydrological applications e g foglia et al 2009 foglia et al 2007 wright et al 2015 they are particularly attractive as they can be tailored to provide interpretable measures of influence with respect to streamflow or any metric that the modeller wishes to investigate such as the change in maximum or total predicted flow additionally case deletion makes no assumptions regarding the type of model linear nonlinear or the complexity of the residual error model gaussian heteroscedastic etc although flexible the computational demand associated with re estimating the parameters for every data point in the observed data renders influence analysis using case deletion influence diagnostics infeasible for anything but the simplest models e g for a decade of daily data case deletion requires 3650 model recalibrations a secondary issue with the case deletion approach is that anomalous results may arise when calibrating to complex response surfaces with multiple local optima duan et al 1992 kavetski et al 2006 as each recalibration may lead to parameter sets in different local optima this may cause the case deletion calibrated parameter sets to be different from each other even if the data points have low influence on the actual model calibration to address this issue the modeller may choose to increase the robustness of the optimisation however any such efforts will compound the computational demands of the case deletion recalibrations the second class of influence diagnostics are the regression theory influence diagnostics a commonly applied regression theory influence diagnostic is cook s distance cook 1977 which is a standard diagnostic tool in statistics fung et al 2002 and has been applied to a small number of hydrological studies hill et al 2015 wright et al 2015 wright et al 2018 cook s distance is calculated by combining two regression components for each observed data point 1 the leverage which describes the change of the predicted model output with respect to the corresponding observed output wei et al 1998 and 2 the standardised residuals which are based on the difference between the observed output and the model predicted output as well as the residual error model by combining these two components regression theory influence diagnostics require no additional recalibrations and is therefore an attractive alternative to the computationally demanding case deletion influence diagnostics regression theory influence diagnostics can be calculated using a range of formulations for the leverage some with strict assumptions linear leverage cook 1977 assumes that the regression model is linear and that residual errors are gaussian homoscedastic and independent nonlinear leverage st laurent and cook 1992 1993 can take into account nonlinear model response and is suitable for nonlinear models with gaussian residuals lastly generalised leverage wei et al 1998 cannot only take into account nonlinear model response but can also be applied to a broad range of objective functions including those with heteroscedastic and or non gaussian residual error assumptions wright et al 2018 compared all three leverage formulations and found generalised cook s distance which was based on generalised leverage to be the most suitable approach for identifying influential data for a wide range of hydrological model calibration problems including heteroscedastic residual errors and objective functions based on a bayesian approach that incorporates data uncertainty and or prior parameter information however a key drawback of applying generalised cook s distance as the sole influence diagnostic is that the magnitude of influence may not be interpretable in the context of hydrologically relevant variables such as mean flow high flows relevant to flood risk assessment and low flows relevant to environmental flow assessment the main objective of this study is to develop a computationally efficient and hydrologically informative hybrid framework for quantifying the impact of influential data in hydrological model calibration this new framework seeks to overcome the limitations of current approaches by combining the strengths of the two classes of influence diagnostics namely computational efficiency and the quantification of the influence of data points on hydrologically relevant metrics the hybrid framework achieves this through a two stage approach where the most influential points are first identified using the computationally efficient generalised cook s distance and then case deletion influence diagnostics are applied so that the influence of calibration data can be measured in terms of hydrologically relevant metrics this hybrid framework paves the way for quantifying the influence of individual data points for a wide range of hydrological modelling applications while the primary goal of the paper is to develop the hybrid framework a secondary goal is to demonstrate the value of the framework by investigating the following research questions 1 how many influential data points should be taken from stage one of the hybrid framework 2 how does the magnitude of influence change with calibration period length 3 how does the choice of objective function impact the magnitude of influence addressing these three research questions will demonstrate the value of the hybrid framework and provide modellers with guidance to apply computationally efficient flexible and accurate influence diagnostics to their own studies the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we introduce the general modelling setup and the hybrid framework for influence assessment and describe the three experiments and case study components in section 3 we apply the hybrid framework to the experiments to answer the research questions in section 4 we interpret and discuss the results from the experiments give guidance on implementing the framework and outline future work we finish with the conclusions in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 general modelling setup we define the general model response as 1 y f α x ε where y y 1 y 2 y n is a vector of n observed responses f is the model response α α 1 α 2 α p α is a vector of p α model parameters x is an n k matrix of k observed inputs e g precipitation pet and ε is a vector of n residual errors residuals are further assumed to be realisations from a given probability distribution with p β parameters β β 1 β 2 β p β e g a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unknown standard deviation the whole set of p p α p β parameters to be optimised in model calibration is θ α β we will denote θ as the model parameters that maximise the objective function φ and y as the predicted response associated with θ see section 2 4 1 for further details of the objective functions used in this study 2 2 hybrid framework for influence assessment the hybrid framework for identifying influential data and quantifying the magnitude of their impact on hydrological model calibration consists of the following two stages stage one identifying the most influential data points based on generalised cook s distance once hydrological model calibration has been undertaken stage one proceeds by first calculating regression theory generalised cook s distance section 2 2 1 to the whole set of calibration data the points are ranked by generalised cook s distance and the subset of ni most influential data points with respect to generalised cook s distance are taken to stage two of the hybrid framework stage two quantifying the magnitude of the subset of most influential data ni using case deletion influence diagnostics in stage two we perform case deletion recalibration to the subset of influential data ni identified in stage one of the framework and determine the case deletion influence section 2 2 2 stage two enables the magnitude of influence to be described using model predictions parameters or performance based on hydrologically relevant variables such as mean high and low flows while reducing the runtime of the case deletion component as it is only applied ni times rather than for all n data points in the calibration period 2 2 1 regression theory cook s distance regression theory cook s distance cd is calculated by combining the standardised residual of the ith point ν i see eq 3 with the leverage of ith observation on the ith prediction l ii eq 4 cook and weisberg 1982 fox and weisberg 2011 2 cd i ν i 2 p l ii 1 l i i 2 the standardised residuals ν are obtained by dividing the raw residuals ε by their calibrated standard deviations σ 3 ν y y σ the vector σ is determined based on the assumed residual error model and the resultant objective function see section 2 4 1 for further details of the objective functions used in this study leverage is defined as the rate of the change of the i th predicted value y i with respect to the j th observed value y j cook and weisberg 1982 hoaglin and welsch 1978 st laurent and cook 1992 wei et al 1998 4 l ij y i y j or in matrix notation 5 l y y t where l is an n n matrix the diagonal elements l ii most directly reflect the impact of y i on the model fit cook and weisberg 1982 hoaglin and welsch 1978 st laurent and cook 1992 and are used for calculating regression theory cook s distance wright et al 2018 applied three formulations of leverage i e linear leverage nonlinear leverage and generalised leverage to hydrological case studies and found that generalised leverage was the most suitable for hydrological applications as it does not assume linear model response and can be applied to a general class of regression models and a broad range of objective functions including those with heteroscedastic and or non gaussian residual error assumptions generalised leverage is calculated after model calibration and takes into account the curvature of the objective function about the whole set of calibrated parameters θ in this case the general form of leverage in eq 5 can be expressed as l θ wei et al 1998 6 l θ f α x θ 2 φ θ y x θ 2 1 2 φ θ y x θ y t where φ θ y x is the objective function see section 2 4 1 for those applied in this study f α x θ is the n p jacobian matrix with i th row f i α x θ 2 φ θ y x θ 2 is a p p hessian matrix and 2 φ θ y x θ y t is a p n matrix 2 2 2 case deletion influence diagnostics case deletion influence diagnostics describe the influence of deleting a data point in model calibration and assessing the change to the model predictions parameters and or any metric of interest to the modeller we apply case deletion influence diagnostics to quantify the magnitude of influence by comparing predictions from a model calibrated using the full calibration dataset y and the predictions from a model calibrated after deleting the ith data point y i the influence with respect to change in flow metrics is given as 7 δ metric metric y metric y i metric y 100 in the case study we apply eq 7 to three flow metrics 1 change in maximum flow defined as the change in maximum predicted flow from the hydrological model 2 change in mean flow defined as the mean predicted flow from the hydrological model and 3 change in low flow defined as the predicted 10th percentile low flow by volume of the flow duration curve from the hydrological model note that while in this study we use three flow metrics eq 7 can be applied to a range of hydrologically relevant metric of choice e g model predictions parameters and predictive performance in wright et al 2015 and case deletion based cook s distance in wright et al 2018 2 3 experiments undertaken in this study experiment 1 addresses the first research question described in the introduction and is necessary to guide implementation of the hybrid framework a key component of stage one of the framework is to select a subset of influential data based on regression theory cook s distance to be used in stage two for the case deletion influence diagnostics the goal of experiment 1 therefore is to identify a suitable range of this number ni experiments 2 and 3 then demonstrate the application of the hybrid framework for influence assessment for hydrologically relevant problems articulated in the second and third research questions respectively 2 3 1 how many influential data points should be taken from stage one of the hybrid framework the goal of the first experiment is to investigate a suitable number of influential data points to take from stage one of the hybrid framework a key concern with applying the hybrid framework is that the points identified as most influential by generalised cook s distance may not correspond to the points that are most influential with respect to the different case deletion flow metrics there is a trade off in the choice of ni in that it needs to be large enough to sufficiently capture the most influential data points in terms of the hydrologically relevant metrics but also small enough in order to limit the computational demand of case deletion model recalibrations required by stage two of the hybrid framework as a result appropriate choice of ni is crucial to the successful application of the two stage hybrid framework based on results from initial experimentation we found that for data points ranked outside the top 20 in terms of generalized cook s distance from stage one there was low influence on the case deletion metrics in stage two to ensure we were able to identify the most influential data points in the experiments we proceeded in a conservative manner and extended the case deletion recalibrations investigated to the 100 most influential data identified in stage one we proceed by applying the hybrid framework to these 100 data points and investigate the probability of successfully identifying the most influential data point with respect to the three case deletion flow metrics i e relative change in maximum mean and low flow predictions this enables a recommendation of a suitable choice of ni in future studies 2 3 2 how does the magnitude of influence change with calibration period length in experiment 2 we consider the impact of hydrological calibration period length on influence we start experiment 2 by investigating a suitable number of highest regression theory influential data points to consider in order to maximise the sample size while still focusing the analysis on the most influential data we then investigate whether the magnitude of case deletion influence changes with calibration period length we apply the hybrid framework to four calibration period lengths 1 year 2 years 5 years and 10 years 2 3 3 how does the objective function impact the magnitude of influence in experiment 3 we investigate whether application of different objective functions will change the magnitude of influence using the same criteria for selecting influential points as was used in experiment 2 we apply the hybrid framework to the standard least squares sls and weighted least squares wls objective functions see section 2 4 1 and compare trends with respect to the most influential data points these two objective functions were chosen from the large array of objective functions applied in hydrological modelling as they have a key difference in their formulation the sls objective function has an assumption of homoscedastic residual errors i e constant variance and the wls objective function has an assumption of heteroscedastic residual errors i e variance varying with magnitude of predicted streamflow as residual errors in hydrological applications are generally heteroscedastic see schoups and vrugt 2010 sorooshian and dracup 1980 comparing the sls and wls objective functions will allow investigation of the impact of the differences in these assumptions 2 4 case study components 2 4 1 objective functions 2 4 1 1 standard least squares assuming independent and identically distributed i i d gaussian residual errors the following sls log likelihood can be used as the objective function 8 φ θ y x i 1 n log p n y i f i α x 0 σ 2 where p n x μ σ 2 is the gaussian probability density at x assuming constant mean μ and variance σ 2 as the standard deviation σ is unknown it will need to be estimated and therefore we have the additional parameter β σ note that the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 objective function that is commonly applied in hydrological calibration corresponds to the assumptions of constant variance and gaussian residual errors of the sls objective function 2 4 1 2 weighted least squares as hydrological residual errors are typically heteroscedastic i e larger flows have larger errors we also consider the wls objective function the constant standard deviation σ in eq 8 is replaced by a vector σ that varies in time thereby weighting the variance for each observation e g mcinerney et al 2017 thyer et al 2009 a common covariate for modelling heteroscedasticity in streamflow errors is the predicted streamflow itself e g schoups and vrugt 2010 thyer et al 2009 following evin et al 2014 we consider the standard deviation of residuals to be a linear function of predicted streamflow such that 9 σ β 1 y β 2 the wls objective function then becomes 10 φ θ y x i 1 n log p n y i f i α x 0 σ i 2 as the parameters describing the non constant standard deviation i e β β 1 β 2 are unknown they will need to be estimated 2 4 2 catchments we consider the 11 catchments from the australian hydrologic reference stations database turner et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 that were used by mcinerney et al 2017 these catchments reflect a range of australian conditions with köppen geiger climate classifications ranging from tropical savannah in the north east to temperate regions with warm and dry summers in the south west and central regions peel et al 2007 as illustrated in fig 1 for details of annual precipitation annual runoff runoff ratio and the calibration periods of the 11 catchments see table 1 2 4 3 daily hydrological model the daily lumped hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 was selected based upon its performance e g andréassian et al 2014 evin et al 2014 le moine et al 2007 lebecherel et al 2016 wright et al 2015 and parsimonious model structure allowing for computational efficiency in the case deletion model recalibrations the gr4j hydrological model has a simple structure that represents interception infiltration and percolation see the model structure in gr4j perrin et al 2003 fig 1 gr4j has parameters α α 1 α 2 α 3 α 4 where α 1 is the maximum capacity of the production store α 2 is the groundwater exchange coefficient α 3 is the maximum capacity of the routing store and α 4 is the time base of the unit hydrograph 2 4 4 calibration and evaluation procedure for all cases model calibration parameter estimates were obtained by maximising the objective functions in section 2 4 1 over the calibration periods using a quasi newton optimisation method with 100 multistarts kavetski and clark 2010 to ensure that consistent data is used for comparison across varying calibration period lengths of 1 2 5 and 10 years we use the following approach for the 1 year calibration period we use all 10 of the 1 year periods in the 10 year window i e 110 calibration periods over 11 catchments for the 2 year calibration period we use all 5 of the 2 year periods in the 10 year window i e 55 calibration periods over 11 catchments for the 5 year calibration period we use both of the 5 year periods in the 10 year window i e 22 calibration periods over 11 catchments and for the 10 year calibration period we use the whole 10 year window i e 11 calibration periods over 11 catchments 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 how many influential data points should be taken from stage one of the hybrid framework here we examine the selection of a suitable choice of ni from stage one of the hybrid framework across the panels of fig 2 we show the probability that the most influential data point over the calibration series is contained within the top ni data points with ni ranging from 1 to 100 for the three case deletion influence metrics i e change in maximum flows mean flows and low flows note that because there are more calibration runs for the 1 year calibration periods i e 110 runs compared to the 10 year periods i e 11 runs the 1 year calibration curves panel a are smoother than the 10 year calibration curves panel d see section 2 4 4 for details of evaluation periods across the four calibration period lengths and for each metric we see a typical pattern where the probability of successfully identifying the most influential data point rapidly approaches 100 between ni 1 and ni 10 in the region between ni 10 and ni 30 we see some variability across the calibration period lengths however the curves mostly reach their maximum value by ni 30 interestingly we see that the low flow metric typically requires a higher ni to approach 100 than the maximum flow and mean flow metrics the exception to the above findings is for the 2 year calibration data case where we require an ni of 54 to identify the most influential data point with respect to change in maximum predicted flow we will discuss this unexpected result further in section 4 5 finally examining the curves we see that across the four calibration period lengths and 198 total evaluation periods applied in this study a value of ni of 30 identifies the most influential data point 98 of the time i e 4 cases were not identified across the case studies 3 2 experiment 2 how does the magnitude of influence change with calibration period length we start the analysis in experiment 2 by first investigating a suitable number of most influential data points to consider in our analysis of trends across the calibration period lengths in fig 3 we present boxplots of the magnitude of influence for the three flow metrics for the top 100 points ranked by each metric the results are presented for the four calibration data lengths and grouped together in boxplots for the 1 5 the 6 10 the 11 20 and the 21 100 most influential data points to allow presentation of the whole set of 100 case deletion recalibrations the total number of data points in each boxplot depend on both the calibration period and the number of points within each range for example a one year calibration period with ranks from 1 5 by influence comprises a total of 11 catchments 10 calibration periods 5 ranks 550 points examining the four boxplot groupings in fig 3 we see that the five most influential points 1 5 range have an order of magnitude more influence than the next most influential points in the other two panels we see that there are a small number of influential data points above the 95 quantile in the 6 10 range and generally low influence in the 11 20 range with a small number of outliers for the low flow metric third panel this result indicates that for the cases considered the highest magnitude influence is typically in the 1 5 range and so for the remaining analysis in experiment 2 and experiment 3 we will examine the top 5 most influential points in fig 4 we present the influence of the four calibration period lengths of 1 2 5 and 10 years with the three panels representing the change in flow metrics we present the results from the top 5 most influential data points identified by each metric for each calibration length note that as there are a different number of calibration periods in the 1 2 5 and 10 year periods see explanation of evaluation procedure in section 2 4 4 the boxplots have a decreasing sample size as the calibration period increases 550 for the 1 year period down to 55 for the 10 year period surprisingly across the calibration data lengths we see high magnitude influence and even when applying a 10 year calibration period we see that a single point can have a large magnitude of influence on the predicted flows largest changes of 40 10 and 44 for maximum mean and low flows respectively when examining the 5 95 range for the change in maximum flows panel a there is also no clear visual trend with respect to the change in the magnitude of influence across the calibration periods i e 0 6 20 7 0 6 13 5 0 7 16 2 and 0 4 25 9 for the 5 95 range with the same result for the mean flows panel b i e 0 3 8 7 0 3 8 8 0 2 6 0 and 0 1 5 5 for the 5 95 range and the low flows panel c i e 0 7 19 1 0 6 10 7 0 3 13 2 and 0 2 19 2 for the 5 95 range 3 3 experiment 3 how does the choice of objective function impact the magnitude of influence next we investigate how the selection of an objective function can impact the magnitude of influence when applied to a 10 year calibration period in fig 5 we present change in flow metrics for the sls and wls objective functions similar to fig 4 we present the results from the top 5 most influential data points identified by each metric for each calibration length across the objective functions we see large magnitude influence on the predicted flows for both sls largest changes of 40 10 and 44 for maximum mean and low flows respectively and wls largest changes of 26 6 and 6 for maximum mean and low flows respectively next we compare the change in maximum flows panel a across the two objective functions and see that when comparing the 5 95 range there is a clear trend of the sls objective function having higher influence than wls i e 0 4 25 9 and 0 2 7 9 for the 5 95 quantile range for sls and wls respectively as is the case with the mean flows panel b i e 0 1 5 5 and 0 1 3 4 for the 5 95 range for sls and wls respectively and the low flows panel c i e 0 2 19 2 0 1 3 7 for the 5 95 range for sls and wls respectively we apply the paired wilcoxon signed rank test bauer 1972 to see whether there is a statistically significant difference at the 95 confidence level between the sls and wls objective functions the use of a paired test ensures that the two objective functions are compared case by case i e for a single catchment and a single ranking of influence the sls case is compared to the wls case and so forth the wilcoxon test showed a statistically significant trend between sls and wls for the maximum flows and the low flows but not for the mean flows while the wls objective function does have typically lower influence than sls looking across the panels we see that the wls objective function can still have a large magnitude of influence on the predicted flows largest change of 25 8 5 9 and 6 3 influence for maximum mean and low flows respectively 4 discussion 4 1 experiment 1 the hybrid framework significantly reduces the computational burden of case deletion recalibration the results from experiment 1 indicate that the hybrid framework can successfully be applied with a relatively small subset of influential points identified in stage one of the framework ni compared to the length of the calibration period e g across the cases explored an ni of 30 led to the most influential data point being identified 98 of the time thereby significantly reducing the computational burden of undertaking case deletion recalibration on the whole calibration period i e ni of 30 reduces the required recalibrations by 99 for a 10 year calibration period this result indicates that the hybrid framework is well suited to the hydrological case studies and has been shown to be robust across different aspects of hydrological predictions by the three flow metrics and a diverse range of catchments while a larger choice of ni would provide further confidence that the most influential points have been identified in stage one the choice of ni will be dependent on the complexity of the modelling application and the available computational budget of the modeller the results from this experiment indicate that a choice of ni of 30 50 is suitable for hydrological applications similar to those explored in this study 4 2 experiment 2 influential data can have a large impact regardless of calibration period length the results from experiment 2 showed that surprisingly there is no clear decreasing trend in the magnitude of case deletion influence as the length of the calibration data increases from 1 to 2 to 5 to 10 years even when applying 10 years of calibration data it is still possible to observe large magnitude case deletion influence values 30 indicating that individual data points can strongly influence predictions even when calibrating on relatively long periods there is existing literature giving guidance on the role of calibration period length in hydrological modelling for example perrin et al 2007 found that in general 350 days of calibration data sampled from a larger data set including dry and wet conditions are sufficient to obtain robust estimates of model parameters and singh and bárdossy 2012 show that using a relatively small subset of unusual hydrological events are sufficient to specify the model parameters with the same certainty as using the whole observation period li et al 2010 showed that in general eight years of data are sufficient to obtain steady estimates of model performance and parameters for the hydrological model simhyd chiew et al 2002 gibbs et al 2017 showed the importance of selecting a calibration period that is representative of the expected forecast conditions the results from this experiment indicate that irrespective of calibration period length undertaking influence analysis is important interestingly we also saw that the low flow metric typically requires a higher ni to approach the maximum value than the maximum flow and mean flow metrics which is potentially due to the sls objective function which emphasises high flows leading to a reduced ability for the cook s distance to reproduce the influential data points with respect to the low flow metric 4 3 experiment 3 sls objective function is more susceptible to highly influential data than wls the results from experiment 3 showed some evidence of trend that the sls objective function is more susceptible to highly influential data than the wls objective function particularly for the maximum flow and low flow metrics to investigate the key drivers that lead to this difference here we extend the analysis in experiment 3 to provide an interpretation of the result first we investigate the relationship between the observed and predicted flows together with the magnitude of the influence for the 5 most influential data points under the sls and wls objective functions in fig 6 the results are provided for three example locations i e namoi river murray river at biggara and hellyer river results from the remaining catchment locations are consistent with this analysis based on a visual inspection of fig 6 we obtain the following general conclusions 1 the most influential points for the sls objective function correspond to higher magnitude observed and predicted flows with the large influence corresponding to points with large residual errors as indicated by distance from the 1 1 line 2 the most influential points for wls correspond to the case where the magnitude of the predicted flow is low and tends to be below the observed flow as indicated by the majority of the large influence lying beneath the 1 1 line having categorised the flows that are influential under the two objective functions we next examine the distribution of the standardised residuals and compare with the theoretical distribution in fig 7 the empirical histograms are provided for three flow regimes a all flows included b low flows only included with a threshold defined by the 10th percentile of the volume of the flow duration curve fdc and c high flows only included with a threshold defined with the 95th percentile of the volume of the fdc the results are provided for a single location namoi river results from the remaining locations are consistent with this analysis starting with the sls objective function panels a c and e we see that in all three flow regimes the distribution of the standardised residuals provides a poor match to the theoretical distribution comparing the standard deviation of the standardised residuals across flow regimes we see that for the sls objective function for low flows panel c the standard deviation is much lower than 1 i e 0 05 so that the distribution of standardised residuals is well inside the theoretical distribution in contrast for the wls objective function panel d the standard deviation of the standardised residuals is much closer to 1 i e 1 04 and we see that the distribution of standardised residual closely matches the theoretical distribution although there still are a large number of points outside the theoretical distribution i e 7 points higher than 5 standard deviations moving to the high flow regime for the sls objective function panel e the standard deviation of the standardised residuals is much higher than 1 i e 8 23 so that many of the standardised residuals are well outside of the theoretical distribution i e 30 standard deviations from the mean again in this flow regime the wls objective function panel f has a much closer standard deviation of the standardised residuals to 1 i e 1 19 we see that across the three flow regimes the wls objective function assumption of heteroscedastic residual error better matches the observed residual errors than the sls assumption of homoscedastic residual errors this leads to the sls objective function having a large number of standardised residuals with extreme values particularly in the high flow regime when these high standardised residuals are combined with high leverage there is high influence as indicated by the generalised cook s distance equation 2 the large number of standardised residuals outside of the theoretical distribution for sls in the high flow regime explains the earlier result where the high magnitude residual errors and high magnitude flows are most influential in fig 6 likewise the large number of standardised residuals outside of the theoretical distribution for wls in the low flow regime explains the earlier result where the low magnitude predicted flows are most influential for the wls objective function in fig 6 4 4 requirements for implementing stage one of the framework the regression theory generalised cook s distance applied in stage one of the hybrid framework has two requirements 1 the generalised leverage in eq 6 requires an objective function that can be summed over the individual data points see wright et al 2018 and 2 the standardised residuals in eq 3 require a fitted standard deviation these two requirements mean that regression theory cook s distance is particularly well suited to objective functions that are expressed via a likelihood and cannot be applied to objective functions that do not meet these conditions e g the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 in practice most objective functions commonly used in hydrology can be expressed in this suitable form but where this is not feasible it is not possible to proceed with the first stage of the hybrid approach and it becomes necessary to apply the case deletion recalibration on the full calibration period note that as the matrix elements of generalised leverage in eq 6 are evaluated about the whole set of calibrated parameters θ generalised cook s distance assumes that these parameters are at the global optima and therefore robust model calibration is required in stage one of the framework 4 5 guidance on implementing stage two of the framework a key issue with hydrological model calibration is the presence of local optima in the objective function response surface see duan et al 1992 gupta et al 2013 kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 skahill and doherty 2006 thyer 1999 tolson and shoemaker 2007 as the hybrid framework requires a large number of model recalibrations on the subset of influential data identified in stage one ni stage two inherits the problem with local optima to highlight an example of this we further investigate the unexpected result in experiment 1 where for a single case we required an ni of 54 to identify the most influential change in maximum flow for the 2 year calibration period to investigate whether this large influence is due to the presence of local optima in fig 8 we plot α 1 against the remaining model parameters i e α 2 α 3 and α 4 and the residual error model parameter σ from recalibrating the model for the 100 case deletions we also include the parameters obtained from calibrating the model with the whole calibration period and highlight the case deletion parameters for the earlier unexpected result in experiment 1 corresponding to the abercrombie river catchment with a two year calibration period from 1978 to 1979 here we see that in the highlighted case four of the five parameters all except α 4 are well outside of the range of the other 99 case deletions and also a long distance from the parameters obtained using the whole calibration period there are three possible hypotheses for this result 1 the case deletion recalibration has found an inferior local optima leading to a false positive identification of an influential data point this problem can be addressed by repeating the calibration with a more robust optimisation process 2 the case deletion recalibration has discovered a new global optimum substituting the case deletion parameters back into the whole data calibration and the other case deletion recalibrations and performing a gradient search polish will produce a better solution than originally obtained for the whole data 3 the case deletion recalibration is a true reflection of the influence of the data point on the optimum set of parameters we then proceed with making a decision about whether it should be included or removed from the calibration data regardless of which hypothesis is true the hybrid framework provides an opportunity to examine the case deletion parameters and identify situations where the case deletion is having a problem and needs to be checked 4 6 future work future work could focus on applying the hybrid framework to a broader range of case studies to explore additional hydrological research questions including what is the relationship between model complexity and magnitude of influence and what is the relationship between climatology different catchment characteristics and magnitude of influence addressing these questions would require applying the hybrid framework to a wide range of hydrological models of varying complexity and a larger hydrological dataset e g 200 catchments in coron et al 2012 5 conclusions influence diagnostics identify data points that have a disproportionate impact on model calibration the current methods for influence assessment have drawbacks that have limited their application case deletion based influence diagnostics have a large computational demand whilst regression theory cook s distance does not provide a hydrologically interpretable measure of influence in this study we present a two stage hybrid framework for quantifying influence in hydrological model calibration that combines the strengths of the two existing classes of influence diagnostics namely 1 computational efficiency and 2 quantifying influence using hydrologically relevant metrics stage one identifies the regression theory influential data points using the computationally cheap generalised cook s distance the modeller then choses a suitable subset of influential data points to use in stage two which involves undertaking case deletion recalibration of the hydrological model on the subset of the influential data points identified in stage one in order to quantify influence with respect to any metric of choice after describing the two stage hybrid framework for influence assessment we applied the new approach to three experiments these experiments use 11 climatologically diverse australian catchments two objective functions and the gr4j daily hydrological model the experiments have the following key outcomes 1 a choice of 30 50 data points with the highest regression theory influence from stage one is suitable for hydrological applications similar to those explored in this study i e a ni of 30 identified the most influential data points 98 of the time in the case studies explored and reduces the required recalibrations by 99 for a 10 year calibration period 2 there was no strong evidence of a decreasing trend in the magnitude of influence with increasing calibration period length from 1 to 10 years and even for 10 years the impact of influential points can still be high 30 influence on maximum predicted flows the implication is that applying longer calibration periods does not reduce the likelihood of influential data occurring 3 there was some evidence that the sls objective function identified data points with higher influence largest changes of 40 10 and 44 for maximum mean and low flows than the wls objective function largest changes of 26 6 and 6 for maximum mean and low flows when applied to a 10 year calibration period the implication is that applying wls or any objective function that accounts for heteroscedasticity in residual errors is likely to reduce the impact of influential points as hydrological modelling complexity increases i e more complex model structures fenicia et al 2011 multi catchment datasets e g 200 catchments coron et al 2012 and complex objective functions schoups and vrugt 2010 hydrological modellers are increasingly reliant on methods to detect and diagnose the impact of these modelling decisions on whether a realistic representation of the catchment response has been achieved gupta et al 2008 the hybrid framework for influence assessment is suitable for a wide range of hydrological case studies and will provide modellers with new insights to aid in model calibration that will complement existing model assessment tools applied in hydrological modelling such as sensitivity and

7273,salt flat brines are a major source of minerals and especially lithium moreover valuable wetlands with delicate ecologies are also commonly present at the margins of salt flats therefore the efficient and sustainable exploitation of the brines they contain requires detailed knowledge about the hydrogeology of the system a critical issue is the freshwater brine mixing zone which develops as a result of the mass balance between the recharged freshwater and the evaporating brine the complex processes occurring in salt flats require a three dimensional 3d approach to assess the mixing zone geometry in this study a 3d map of the mixing zone in a salt flat is presented using the salar de atacama as an example this mapping procedure is proposed as the basis of computationally efficient three dimensional numerical models provided that the hydraulic heads of freshwater and mixed waters are corrected based on their density variations to convert them into brine heads after this correction the locations of lagoons and wetlands that are characteristic of the marginal zones of the salt flats coincide with the regional minimum water brine heads the different morphologies of the mixing zone resulting from this 3d mapping have been interpreted using a two dimensional 2d flow and transport numerical model of an idealized cross section of the mixing zone the result of the model shows a slope of the mixing zone that is similar to that obtained by 3d mapping and lower than in previous models to explain this geometry the 2d model was used to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in the mixing zone geometry the higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is the lower the slope and the shallower the mixing zone become this occurs because most of the freshwater lateral recharge flows through the upper aquifer due to its much higher transmissivity thus reducing the freshwater head the presence of a few meters of highly permeable materials in the upper part of these hydrogeological systems such as alluvial fans or karstified evaporites that are frequently associated with the salt flats is enough to greatly modify the geometry of the saline interface keywords salt flat saltwater intrusion saline interface brine groundwater modelling aquifer heterogeneity 1 introduction salt flats salares are an important source of minerals they account for half of the world s lithium production and contain the main economic reserves of this element usgs 2017 in addition boron and potash are economically mined from salt flats lithium is a strategic commodity its uses vary from light batteries to cancer treatment its demand has notably increased in the last decade and this trend will probably continue in the future vikström et al 2013 as large quantities may be needed to develop nuclear fusion reactors using tritium generated from lithium this fact is evidenced by the large number of countries that are just now commissioning studies to determine the mineral potential of their salt flats e g salar de uyuni in bolivia or salar del hombre muerto in argentina as well as to increase the amounts of resources that could be exploited during current mining activities e g salar de atacama in chile this explains the current worldwide interest in salt flat hydrogeology which is also due to the existence of peripheral brine and saline water lagoons that have high ecological human and tourist value in addition to their scientific value salt flats are endorheic lagoon systems associated with arid or hyperarid climates where the rate of evaporation is very high in many cases this causes the surface water to disappear and the water table to lie just below the land surface yechieli and wood 2002 this characteristic is what triggers the important precipitation or accumulation of high value industrial minerals corenthal et al 2016 kesler et al 2012 munk et al 2016 risacher et al 2003 in these endorheic basins it is common for evaporation to be higher than local recharge hardie 1991 thus some other contribution which is often groundwater may compensate for this difference in the simplest case ignoring hypothetical deep contributions or inflows from other basins the only water input to the salt flat system is lateral inflow and direct rainfall which is minor due to the aridity of the climate and the only output from the system is evaporation these factors are all strongly related to climate variability and could potentially be affected by global climate change rosen 1994 the most accepted hydrogeological model assumes that dense brines produced from surface evaporation overturn and sink in the central area of the salt flat setting up large scale convection cells in its nucleus i e the core of the salt flat which is dominated by halite these cells return to the surface at the margins of the salt flat where the brines mix with incoming fresh groundwater in a complex process fan et al 1997 hamann et al 2015 nield et al 2008 wood and sanford 1990 wooding et al 1997 for this reason the discharge of groundwater essentially occurs at the resulting freshwater brine mixing zone areas where lagoons may appear duffy and al hassan 1988 tejeda et al 2003 as a result wetlands are commonly present in the margins of salt flats and are the bases for complex and sensitive ecological habitats surrounded by barren lands the contact between two miscible fluids of different densities is characterized by a mixing zone which is also called a saline interface this interface results from the dynamic equilibrium of moving fresh and saltwater custodio and bruggeman 1987 custodio and llamas 1976 dentz et al 2006 where the relationship between the concentrations of both fluids is stoichiometric in coastal aquifers the position and characteristics of the mixing zone are well known and its upper part coincides with the coastline in water table aquifers bear 1972 glover 1959 werner et al 2013 in salt flats where the density contrasts are much greater than those in coastal aquifers the mixing zone develops as a result of point pressure equilibrium between recharge and evaporated water but its position and geometry are more difficult to predict this is because the brine in the salt flats is generated in situ as a result of evaporation acosta and custodio 2008 and recharge and evaporation are strongly subject to climatic oscillations tyler et al 2006 brine mining can affect the dynamics of the mixing zone in a short period of time similar to freshwater extraction in coastal aquifers oude essink 2001 in the natural state evaporation occurs in both the salt flat nucleus and the marginal zone regardless of whether it is a sheet of open water marginal lagoons or a shallow water table which commonly have very irregular spatial distributions the need to assess the detailed characteristics of the mixing zone occurs immediately when managing both mineral resources and their associated ecosystems the best management tool are the numerical models in which the effects of variable density are taken into account these models are expensive to run in two dimensional 2d cases and are currently very difficult to run in three dimensional 3d cases at the regional scale oude essink and boekelman 1996 nevertheless 3d regional scale models are needed for the management of any hydrogeological system in the case of coastal systems this problem is solved in two ways 1 neglecting the effects of variable density by assuming some simplifications or 2 converting the pressures of marine and variable density waters into equivalent pressures of freshwater lu et al 2015 maas and emke 1989 the last solution despite providing only an approximation of the actual situation post et al 2007 is the one that has been chosen to model many coastal systems however to date there is no evidence that any similar methodology has been proposed for the study and management of salt flats furthermore the simplifications that are frequently assumed in coastal aquifers such as neglecting density variations when advection is dominant over convection iribar et al 1997 vázquez suñé et al 2006 are not acceptable in salt flats to obtain solutions for the above problem the salar de atacama ne chile was chosen as a case study the choice was based on three characteristics 1 it is the third largest salt lake on earth with a surface area of 3000 km2 2 it contains exceptional water ecosystems and bird nesting areas in the surficial mixing zone area which require scientific solutions for their preservation and sustainability and 3 there is a unique monitoring network that is regularly operated and well instrumented tyler et al 2006 thanks to the exploitation of brine resources carried out in the southwestern area of the salt flat nucleus the main objective of this work is to obtain the first 3d map of the salt flat mixing zone using the salar de atacama as a case study this 3d map together with an idealized 2d numerical model allows us to understand the dynamics of the mixing zone and the effects of heterogeneity on its large scale geometry we also propose the use of the 3d map to apply simplified rules for constant density 3d models that include mixing zones the structure of the manuscript follows the order described below first the 3d mapping of the mixing zone is addressed second the usefulness of 3d mapping in the salt flats to correct the hydraulic heads by density differences and to facilitate their modelling at a constant density is shown third the idealized 2d numerical model of the regional mixing zone is performed fourth the sensitivity analysis of the hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer is carried out to determine its influence on the geometry of the mixing zone on a regional scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographic setting the salar de atacama hereinafter sda is located in northern chile between 23 and 24 south latitudes and 68 and 69 west longitudes it is located in region ii antofagasta and within the limits of the community municipality of san pedro de atacama fig 1 the basin where the salt flat is located has an oval shape with the long axis in the n s direction and an extent of approximately 20 000 km2 it is bordered to the west by the cordillera de la sal salt range which stretches from nne to ssw at the slopes of the domeyko range and to the east by the western cordillera de los andes andean range whose high peaks are crowned by the current volcanic arc 5500 m a s l metres above sea level the northern part of the basin is bounded by the merging of the domeyko range and the andean range while the southern part is bounded by the lila mountains because the andean range acts as a geographic barrier to atmospheric movement the sda is characterized by a hyperarid climate resulting in a very low rainfall rate bookhagen and strecker 2008 garreaud et al 2010 hartley and chong 2002 on average the salt flat receives less than 20 mm yr of precipitation the major water source is groundwater coming from the andean range in the mountains the average precipitation reaches 160 mm yr idaea csic 2017 the output is water table evaporation produced in the nucleus and marginal zone where the mean surficial water evaporation rate is 4 3 mm d evaporation decreases as the depth of the water table increases and it depends on the soil composition kampf et al 2005 kampf and tyler 2006 muñoz pardo and ortiz astete 2004 the two main river courses contributing to the salt flat as shown in fig 1 are the san pedro river which has an average flow of 1 m3 s and torrential events of up to 25 m3 s and the vilama river which has an average flow of 0 2 m3 s these rivers flow from north to south salas et al 2010 the san pedro river ends in a delta with the same name while the vilama river disappears in the upper half of its basin there are also some intermittent streams that descend from the mountains and infiltrate into the extensive alluvial fans on the eastern side of the salt flat in many cases these streams are controlled by structural features in addition in the eastern margin surficial mixing zone of the sda there are many lagoons and wetlands in some cases these have been defined as ramsar sites this area has been recognized by the international community as an environment with significant value for humanity some lagoons reach surface areas of several hectares although most are smaller the lagoons are grouped into four systems fig 1 soncor chaxa barros negros and puilar lagoons which is connected by the burro muerto channel aguas de quelana peine salada saladita and interna lagoons and tilopozo la punta and la brava lagoons these lagoons are the habitats for several migratory or endemic species mainly birds among which there are three species of high andean flamingos xerophytic and halophytic shrubs or grass and some mammals microcrustaceans microalgae and bacteria flamingos mainly feed on microcrustaceans e g artemia whose range of vital salinity has more or less defined thresholds outside these limits the population of this biota is reduced due to its inability to reproduce and survive if the salt concentration increases or to compete with new predators if the concentration of dissolved salts decreases gajardo and beardmore 2012 2 2 hydrogeological framework the sda is currently located in a compressive tectonic basin which is framed by inverse faults which affect from the palaeozoic basement to present deposits arriagada et al 2006 jordan et al 2007 mpodozis et al 2005 based on its geomorphological geological and hydrogeological characteristics four large domains can be distinguished from the watershed line to the basin depocenter figs 1 and 2 1 the basement and the volcanic deposits of the mountain range 2 the alluvial fans descending therefrom 3 the marginal zone 2300 to 2320 m a s l and 4 the sda nucleus 2300 m a s l in the actual basin depocenter i e the halite nucleus a series of clastic and evaporitic sediments are known to have been deposited from the upper miocene to the present with a thickness that exceeds 1400 m in some areas jordan et al 2007 mpodozis et al 2005 pananont et al 2004 the evaporite deposits in the nucleus and marginal zone show a well defined asymmetric zonation that follows a sequence of classic evaporite precipitation with a gradual evolution from carbonates and sulphates in the marginal zone to halite in the salt flat nucleus vásquez et al 2013 where solutes of mining interest are concentrated in the remnant final brines alluvial deposits and some layers of the salt flat nucleus have medium to high hydraulic conductivities idaea csic 2017 muñoz pardo and ortiz astete 2004 rockwood lithium 2015 in the alluvial deposits this is due to their primary lithological properties in the salt flat nucleus this is the result of intense karstification processes in the salt flat the main aquifer is the upper layer of halite 60 300 m d there is also a deeper second halite aquifer 0 1 20 m d which is confined by a layer of low permeability gypsum acting as an intermediate aquitard 0 01 5 m d this same aquifer aquitard aquifer sequence applies to the alluvial fans as a regional simplification where the upper 80 300 m d and lower 20 m d high permeability detrital deposits are separated from the lower ones by some relatively poorly permeable layers 0 01 5 m d the regional potentiometric surface shows a concentric flow that extends from the highest areas to the depocenter of the basin due to the low recharge and topography the water head gradients are very small less than0 001 m m especially in the nucleus and marginal zones where these gradients are almost zero in the marginal zone mixing zone groundwater crops out thus indicating the freshwater brine interface zone fig 2 2 3 hydraulic role of the mixing zone in the lagoons and wetlands of the salar de atacama three hydraulic domains have been distinguished in the mixing zone from the eastern boundary of the salt flat nucleus to the lateral alluvial fans these are the internal imz middle mmz and external emz mixing zones fig 2 freshwater recharge is mainly produced on the eastern mountain side the marginal lagoons wetlands and springs are located in the mmz fig 2 the resulting flow discharges into this zone and ascends to the surface resulting in the quelana peine and tilopozo lagoons the soncor lagoon system is a special case as it is located in the imz and not in the mmz its origin is not the direct groundwater overflow of the mmz ortiz et al 2014 along the final flow path the total dissolved solids tds of the groundwater gradually increase as a consequence of mixing and evaporation as it is very shallow some of the water returns to the imz and the salt flat nucleus as concentrated brine fig 2 this dynamic behaviour is strongly variable due to the seasonality of recharge and evaporation salas et al 2010 2 4 hydrogeological data the analysis of satellite images landsat 8 allows us to map the surface hydrological features and the mixing zone geometry near the land surface water heads and physico chemical parameters e g electrical conductivity were measured in the field the same physico chemical parameters and solute concentrations were measured in the laboratory following standard procedures some vertical electrical conductivity ec profiles were obtained in boreholes data are available from a total of 310 observation points wells piezometers trenches and surface water courses distributed throughout the area fig 1 with records dating back to 1984 most of the data used for this research project were provided by the sqm company these data have been complemented with other difficult to access sources of information rio chilex s a 1997 rockwood lithium 2015 the main information of the wells with physico chemical data coordinates and average values of ec density and salinity is compiled in table s1 of the supporting information the monitoring network consists of well levelled points with which to measure the water head and collect water samples these monitoring points are most often boreholes but they often designed as wells and piezometers some boreholes are point wells which are open or screened in a short interval at a given depth but they often have long open and screened sections the cased section of the piezometer may contain water of a different density and salinity than that in the open part rushton 1980 this affects the measured water head this effect can be corrected by obtaining an electrical conductivity ec log to calculate vertical density changes and introduce the needed corrections it can also be corrected by substituting the water inside the borehole before measuring the level for water in the open section by repeated bailing or low flow pumping from near the water surface nevertheless in low permeability layers this measurement may be distorted by residual water level drawdown in most cases the depth to the water level is measured without considering the salinity in the uncased section this may introduce some errors in marginal areas with great vertical salinity gradients and where shallow water may enter the borehole water samples are often collected using a bailer or a thief sampler that opens at the desired depth some mixing may thus occur with other water in the borehole or pit the best water samples are obtained with a low flow pump with the inflow inside the section to be sampled measuring and sampling protocols are applied to increase the number of available data points correlations between density ec and tds were obtained fig 3 their magnitudes show a clear mutual correlation kohfahl et al 2015 and provide a practical technique with which to map the interface for ec measurements it is necessary to apply a correction for temperature t hayashi 2004 of approximately 2 c if it is not automatically done when ec and t are measured the ec correction and probe calibration errors may also explain part of the dispersion the correlation between density and ec is not linear and follows a more complex polynomial line the correlation between tds and ec shows linear behaviour up to 100 ms cm 1 similar to other brines jellison et al 1999 however for higher ec values the correlation is nonlinear which will increase dispersion if a polynomial relationship is not applied 2 5 darcýs law head and pressure formulation in variable density flow calculating flow directions and flow rates is the basic goal of almost all hydrogeological studies these values can be obtained using darcy s law in the case of variable density the darcy s law in terms of water pressure is bear 1972 4 q k μ p ρ g z where k is the intrinsic permeability tensor μ is the fluid viscosity p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and g is the gravitational acceleration and z denotes the vertical upward direction the spatial components of q are 5 q x k μ p x 6 q y k μ p y 7 q z k μ p z ρ g the horizontal flow components q x and q y can be calculated based on the corresponding horizontal components of the pressure gradients or from the head gradients referring to the same water density for vertical flow q z there is a buoyant term associated with the gravity vector which does not appear in the horizontal directions 2 6 numerical approach a variable density flow pattern is the result of strongly coupled flow and mass transport differential equations flow in porous media can be described using the following water mass conservation differential equation 8 s s h t q 0 where s s is the specific storage and t is the time neglecting all density dependencies in the balance terms except for the buoyancy term the oberbeck boussinesq approximation q is given by the following expression in terms of water heads 9 q k ρ 0 g μ μ 0 μ h ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 z note that z is multiplied by the density ratio in which ρ 0 is the reference water density the viscosity relation function where μ 0 is the reference fluid viscosity may be neglected in viscosity constant models salt transport can be described using the differential equation 10 ϕ c t q c d c 0 where porosity is ϕ solute concentration is c and the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor is d the code feflow was used to solve this set of coupled governing equations more information about the formulation and performance of this code can be found in diersch 2014 3 results 3 1 3d mapping of the freshwater brine mixing zone the central axis of the mixing zone at the surface was identified through the use of satellite images fig 4 this axis coincides with wetlands and small easily recognizable seasonal lagoons tejeda et al 2003 the three dimensional mapping of the main mixing zone was performed by identifying the position of its central surface ec 150 ms cm 1 upper surface ec 100 ms cm 1 and lower surface ec 200 ms cm 1 these surfaces are used to delineate the main mixing zone which is the region in which the salinity gradient changes most rapidly the given limits do not represent the extreme ec values corresponding to brine and freshwater values between 200 and 240 ms cm 1 are only reached in the central area of the nucleus and values of less than a few ms cm 1 are reached in the recharge areas the position of the mixing zone was deduced based on the density data measured or calculated in each piezometer using nests of wells where each one is open at a different depth allows the more faithful characterization of the geometry of the mixing zone nevertheless considering the particular characteristics of each monitoring point the majority of these sites could be used to produce valuable information the sda mixing zone mainly extends throughout the northeast east and southeast salt flat margins figs 5 and 6 the full range of densities present in the mixing zone can be observed on the land surface the surficial densities closest to 1 23 kg l were measured in the salt flat nucleus while the densities closest to 1 kg l were measured in the external mixing zone and the recharge zone the mixing zone shows a moderate slope in the imz internal mixing zone strong deepening in the mmz middle mixing zone and a gradual slope reduction in the emz external mixing zone and recharge areas the external limits have been defined as far away as possible as monitoring wells are very scarce it is expected that the interface will extend beyond these limits but that it will have a low slope 3 2 2d numerical model of the salar de atacama mixing zone an idealized vertical profile 2d numerical model was carried out to use it as a tool to understand the geometry of the mixing zone although great local heterogeneity has been described in the salar de atacama muñoz pardo and ortiz astete 2004 ortiz et al 2014 salas et al 2010 only three simplified layers have been considered for the idealized regional model fig 7 these layers attempt to represent the regional aquifer aquitard aquifer sequence that has often been identified in both the salt flat nucleus and the alluvial fans as shown in the pumping tests done in the region the hydraulic contrast between these three units aquifer a aquitard ab and aquifer b is conspicuous and spatially continuous but the hydraulic conductivity values may vary due to heterogeneities and karstification idaea csic 2017 the model domain represents an idealized vertical cross section that is 25 000 m long and 1200 m high fig 7 the length is the characteristic of any section of the eastern mixing zone including 10 000 m of nucleus 5000 m of mixing zone and 10 000 m of alluvial fans the thickness chosen corresponds to the thickness of the nucleus vilama formation in the eastern area jordan et al 2007 the right boundary is the contact between the basement rocks and alluvial fans that may be considered impermeable in a simplification because the water that falls in the mountains volcanic rocks and basement of low permeability reaches the alluvial fans largely superficially where it infiltrates due to their greater permeability the left boundary is located inside the salt flat similar to other models duffy and al hassan 1988 fan et al 1997 hamann et al 2015 the lower boundary is located at the bottom of the geological unit b and the upper boundary is the water table aquifers are modelled as confined aquifers with constant transmissivity because the water table variations are very small compared to the aquifer thickness due to the very low hydraulic gradients the model mesh has approximately 153 000 triangular elements to model the salt flats two main methodologies are used depending on the objective for which the model is constructed to study the geochemistry or detailed evaporation processes of the salt flat reactive transport models can be carried out that include evaporation and dissolution using well established saturation indices hamann et al 2015 vásquez et al 2013 however this coupling requires extremely high calculation times even for idealized problems hamann et al 2015 thus techniques are often used that simplify the problem numerically without altering the geometry of the resulting mixing zone duffy and al hassan 1988 fan et al 1997 in this way it is possible to limit the maximum density without needing to precipitate salts based on saturation indices following these guidelines the left lower and right boundaries are treated as no flow zones for water and mass i e neumann type boundary conditions at the top different boundary conditions are selected for each spatial stretch with the purpose of representing the evaporation and recharge processes the reference values of recharge were taken from idaea csic 2017 the recharge considering the total length 36 25 km from the distal alluvial fans to the watershed line ranges from 20 to 140 mm yr respectively if a detention of 25 is considered then the net recharge rate ranges from 15 to 105 mm yr but in our simplified model we only considered 10 km of the total recharge length by this motive a fluid inflow neumann type boundary condition was fixed on the recharge surface with a minimum value of 15 mm yr in the contact between the mixing zone and the alluvial fans and a maximum value of 420 mm yr an unrealistic recharge rate that allows the model to enter the total recharge volume in the contact between the alluvial fans and the basement as in previous models duffy and al hassan 1988 fan et al 1997 the recharge was applied on the top to not condition the mixing zone in the right boundary this takes advantage of a large part of the water recharged in the mountains infiltrates the alluvial fans a water head dirichlet was fixed in the halite nucleus and the internal mixing zone for mass transport fixed solute concentration of 1 23 kg l for the salt flat nucleus and 1 00 kg l for the freshwater recharge area were implemented concentrations were normalized to the densities of freshwater and brine as end members the upwinding option for the numerical treatment has been used to smoothen out steep concentration changes although this causes some additional numerical dispersivity a stationary simulation was carried out to obtain the initial water heads for the initial mass condition a concentration of 1 00 kg l was assigned corresponding to a hypothetical initial scenario where all groundwater is fresh the model was run for several thousands of years with a semiautomatic time step control to reach a quasi stationary state the hydraulic parameters deduced from pumping tests or in some cases from the literature idaea csic 2017 are given in fig 7 the results are shown in fig 8 the geometry of the mixing zone in accordance with the 2d numerical model and the 3d mapping presents a very small slope which allows it to penetrate through all of the alluvial fans only in the first section between the nucleus and the alluvial fans is the interface slope greater this type of mixing zone corresponds to arid and high permeability salt flats in accordance with the case 4 described by duffy and al hassan 1988 3 3 comparison with analytic solutions for the sharp interface in coastal aquifers a comparison of the results of the model with the most commonly used analytical solutions in coastal aquifers is made below in the case of a sharp interface the freshwater and saltwater pressures must be equal at the interface the badon ghyben herzberg bgh principle custodio and bruggeman 1987 custodio and llamas 1976 establishes that in a homogeneous coastal aquifer the depth of the interface below sea level ξ is given as ξ α h f in which h f is the freshwater head and α is the inverse of the relative density difference α ρ f ρ s ρ f where ρ s and ρ f are the densities of saline water and freshwater respectively it is assumed that the freshwater flow is horizontal and that the saline water flow is steady and equal to that of the saline water body for coastal aquifers the most frequent value of α is 40 for the salar de atacama brine the value of α is 4 35 as vertical flows and the true brine head are not taken into account in the bgh principle the predicted depth is generally too shallow and it does not occur inside the actual mixing zone therefore in most cases the bgh formula is not a good predictor of the mixing zone depth if the actual head of salt water is considered the hubbert 1940 formula is used 1 ξ α h f 1 α h s where h f and h s are theoretically measured on the interface in practice they are assumed to be equal to the freshwater and saline water heads measured in the point monitoring wells on the vertical axis of the site considered or near it thus vertical components are ignored which introduces an error the closer the well screens are to the mixing zone the more the predicted position generally falls inside or closer to the position of the mixing zone pool and carrera 2011 proposed an empirical improvement of the bgh principle for coastal aquifers in which ε 1 α ρ s ρ f ρ f is changed to ε 1 α t b 1 6 in which α t transversal dispersivity and b depth below sea level of the aquifer bottom which is assumed to be horizontal they rewrote the bgh approximation to the interface depth as ξ h f ε none of these predictions take into account the effect of layering which is very important in the case described here in the case study the sharp bgh interface is always situated well above the mean mixing zone surface 1 115 kg l fig 8 the sharp interface resulting from the pool and carrera 2011 approximation shows a better fit of the mixing zone the hubert interface best fits the results of the numerical model although it requires a greater number of hydraulic head data for its calculation which hinders its practical applicability 4 discussion 4 1 water head corrections by contrast densities in salt flats in the case of sda only a few potentiometric surface mappings were completed in previous studies moreover only some simplified three dimensional numerical modelling has been performed none of which was at the regional scale and they often neglected the effects of density muñoz pardo and ortiz astete 2004 performed a 3d numerical model of the nucleus and marginal zone of the sda by neglecting density effects although they recognized a range of densities between 0 99 and 1 22 kg l ortiz et al 2014 also showed a potentiometric surface mapping of the soncor lagoons system without taking density effects into account salas et al 2010 were the only authors to consider the effects of density although they did not explain the followed methodology in that study the flow path lines did not describe the expected behaviour of a natural freshwater brine mixing zone because at the time of that study the brine pumps had already depressed the water table in the nucleus establishing the direction and sense of the water flow directly from the water head data measured in piezometers and wells with waters of different salinities is often erroneous this error may be very important if the contrast in densities is as important as it is in the sda thus all water head measurements have been transformed to the same reference density and these were subsequently used following the rules of considering consider buoyancy effects in the case of salt flats especially in the nucleus marginal zone and its surroundings areas the dominant flow component is vertical unlike that in coastal aquifers therefore it is essential to apply a correction allowing for the most faithful reproduction possible of the vertical flow near the mixing zone if the density dependence of the flow is neglected the predicted flow path lines have their origin in the mountains and end in the salt flat nucleus fig 9 a this contrasts with a general observation in which groundwater discharge and wetlands occur at the margins of the salt flats fig 9b however taking into account the effects of density on flow in three dimensional complex numerical modelling is almost impossible because of the high degree of computational power that is required an interesting solution would be to apply a density correction methodology similar to that applied to coastal aquifers lusczynski 1961 to transform saltwater heads into freshwater heads the results obtained using this methodology indicate that the lagoons are in the regional minimum water head and that they represent the main discharge area similar to the actual case fig 9c nevertheless in contrast to coastal aquifers the focus of interest and the highest numbers of observation points in salt flats are in the nucleus and the mixing zone but not in the freshwater zone recharge area for this reason it is much more useful to develop a solution that allows for the correction of the water heads by transforming freshwater heads into brine heads the following procedure is adopted for the water head correction depending on the characteristics and available information obtained from piezometers or wells four study cases have been established point wells with an ec profile long screened wells with an ec profile point wells without an ec profile and long screened wells without an ec profile the point wells slotted only in a very short stretch in which an ec profile was available have been corrected by taking the vertical density distribution into account using the equation 2 h c h i z 0 z 2 z ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 dz where h c is the corrected water head h i is the measured water head z is the saturated well thickness z 0 is the origin of the water depths of the well z 2 is the depth corresponding to an ec of 200 ms cm 1 ρ is the density measured at each point and ρ 0 is the reference density in the case of sda the reference density is 1 23 kg l the long screened wells with an ec profile were corrected using the same criteria a unitary correction for each stretch of the vertical profile may be performed by obtaining the vertical distribution of the water heads the point wells in which an ec profile was not available were corrected assuming that the slotted density was homogeneous throughout the entire well in this case the previous equation is simplified to 2 h c h i z ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 the long screened wells without an ec profile were corrected by assuming the density distribution of the reference ec density surfaces obtained in the regional mixing zone mapping fig 10 to apply the correction in each piezometer three stretches are considered inside these monitoring wells 1 the thickness of the water layer below the surface of 200 ms cm 1 2 the thickness between the surfaces of 200 ms cm 1 and 100 ms cm 1 with a reference surface of 150 ms cm 1 and 3 the thickness between the surface of 100 ms cm 1 and the water table the first stretch is not corrected because it is considered to be practically brine the correction of the second stretch is performed based on the thickness of the mixing zone between the surfaces of 200 ms cm 1 and 100 ms cm 1 and their average density finally the correction in the third stretch is made by taking into account a linear gradient between the existing density in the surface of 100 ms cm 1 and the density measured in the upper water of that observation point 3 h c h i z 1 z 0 ρ 01 ρ 0 ρ 0 z 2 z 1 ρ 12 ρ 0 ρ 0 where z 1 is the depth corresponding to the 100 ms cm 1 surface ρ 01 is the average density between z 0 and z 1 and ρ 12 is the average density between z 1 and z 2 in the monitoring wells where the third stretch does not exist when the internal mixing zone is close to the land surface the correction is made by applying the density value measured at the surface to the entire freshwater column in this case the corrected water head may be slightly underestimated by not correcting from 200 ms cm 1 to 240 ms cm 1 however it is very difficult to map the surface of 240 ms cm 1 with a density of 1 23 kg l as it is only attained in some areas of the salt flat nucleus the mixing zone stretch in which the density ec values change faster is between 100 and 200 ms cm 1 farther from these surfaces these changes are slow diffuse and too complex to be identified 4 2 mixing zone hydrodynamics in the quasi stationary stage fig 8 the effects of variable density allow us to differentiate five sectors with very different hydraulic behaviours namely the nucleus internal mixing zone imz middle mixing zone mmz external mixing zone emz and recharge zone the hydrodynamics in the nucleus are controlled by convection cells that are continuously evolving triggered by the evaporation of brine in the surface these convection cells become denser collapse and cause the upward movement of less dense brine the presence of low permeability layers such as the intermediate aquitard ab produce a vertical break in the convection cells the lateral convection cell which is closest to the mixing zone is the engine of the upward flow in the imz where a mixture with freshwater is produced causing the eastern part of the nucleus to have densities slightly lower than the western and middle zone fig 2 in contrast the recharge zone is primarily characterized by a downward flow of freshwater that gradually rotates and points towards the nucleus until the mixing zone is reached where the flow ascends parallel to the principal mixing zone surface finally this groundwater ascends with a relatively high velocity to the land surface in the emz and especially in the mmz in this way the mmz is the zone that clearly presents the highest flow rates because the mmz is where the flows coming from the nucleus and the recharge water merge fig 2 the mmz thus constitutes the main outflow of the domain returning part of this water to the more surficial zone of the imz it is expected that the saline mixing zone at least in the upper aquifer is in equilibrium with climatic oscillations even those of relatively short cycles e g enso in contrast at depth these zones do not show visible direct responses to short term oscillations as they only reflect the effects of large time scale cycles additionally stormy events may cause local to regional disturbances in the upper mixing zone especially in the internal mixing zone these hydrological dynamics are consistent with the hydrogeochemical differences observed by boutt et al 2016 between the samples collected in the imz and emz they are also consistent with the hydraulic response to short term and long term variations in precipitation and recharge regimes in both zones as observed in the abovementioned manuscript in the imz where the flow is slow and sometimes has short path lines precipitation events give rise to a more evident water table response than in the emz where the flow is higher and a precipitation event induces a very small or inappreciable effect finally a special case of mixing zone occurs in the northeastern marginal zone just to the north of the soncor lagoon system where numerous springs have been mapped fig 4 the waters that come out of these springs drain to the burro muerto channel and finally to the soncor lagoon system if the mixing zone geometry of this zone figs 4 and 5 is compared with those of the previously described southeastern and central eastern areas a large plateau can be seen with its long axis approximately oriented in the n s direction unlike the rest of the marginal zone where the lagoons tend to be located along the central axis of the middle mixing zone mmz in the soncor system the mapped springs are not only located along this axis but also located in the internal mixing zone imz furthermore it should be noted that the mixing zone is always located around the salt flat nucleus except in this area where the mixing zone moves northward and becomes much more gradual the arrangement of these springs coincides with some of the structural planes described by universidad de chile 2016 or their extensions fig 4b there is a lowering of the hydraulic head along the permeable fault planes and an uprising of somewhat deeper freshwater flows that partially feed the springs this could explain the very low water head gradients the shallow water table and some of the hydro chemical anomalies described by other authors ortiz et al 2014 4 3 influence of heterogeneity on mixing zone geometry through the 3d mapping of the mixing zone important variations in the depth of the mixing zone have been observed along the entire eastern margin of the salt flat although different sensitivity analyses have been carried out both for recharge and for hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer is the one that shows the greatest sensitivity to the regional geometry of the saline interface if the recharge varies within a coherent range for example by doubling or reducing it by half the changes produced are very small in this section we analyse the effects that the high permeability layers in the top and the aquitards have on the geometry of the mixing zone to study the effect of a high permeability layer on the upper part of the system the regional 2d vertical model is used as a basis the hydraulic conductivity values of the ab aquitard and the b aquifer were both set at 0 1 m d to prevent further factors from coming into play the hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer varied 0 1 m d homogeneous case 1 m d 10 m d and 100 m d these values are commonly found in the upper aquifer of the mixing zone and in the alluvial fans of the salar de atacama the results of the sensitivity analysis show that the higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is the lower the slope is and the shallower the mixing zone becomes fig 11 this occurs because the lateral recharge freshwater flows almost entirely through this layer when there is an upper layer of very high permeability in the lower layers the recharge water almost does not penetrate thus favouring the rise of the mixing zone and notably reducing its slope fig 11c and d on the other hand when the aquifer is homogeneous there is no preferential flow through the upper layer thus the deep freshwater is able to maintain a higher head thus repelling the mixing zone reducing saltwater intrusions and moving it towards the salt flat fig 11a and b in the homogeneous case the largest slope of the interface is reached the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layers greatly influences the geometry of the regional saline interface this explains the low slope and great intrusion of the mixing zone in the salar de atacama unlike in previous works tejeda et al 2003 vásquez et al 2013 where the mixing zone did not penetrate the alluvial fans and had a much higher slope all of these studies considered a homogenous porous medium without a high permeability top layer additionally theoretical works fan et al 1997 hamann et al 2015 holzbecher 2005 always addressed a homogenous case of study only fan et al 1997 made a first approximation of the effect of heterogeneity in the mixing zone by taking into account a more realistic geology however these authors focused their efforts on explaining the free convection differences between both cases and did not focus on the geometry of the mixing zone the presence of aquitards can also modify the position of the mixing zone this is because the aquitard further hinders the flow of groundwater through the deeper layers and forces the flow through the upper aquifer at up flow areas thus the relative deepening and reduced thickness of the mixing zone may be observed the effects described above may explain the most abrupt deepening of the mixing zone observed in the central eastern area east of soncor of the salar de atacama figs 5 and 6b near this zone some studies cornellà et al 2009 ortiz et al 2014 have described several less permeable layers at different levels 5 conclusions the two 2d and three dimensional 3d geometry and hydrodynamics of the salt flat freshwater brine mixing zone were studied using the salar de atacama as case study the three dimensional mapping of the actual mixing zone was carried out for the first time in a salt flat showing the irregularities of the mixing zone in both the vertical and horizontal directions using the 3d mixing zone mapping data the application of a water head correction to the freshwater and mixed water heads in order to compensate for density variations and transform them into brine water heads was proposed to reduce the computational cost of the 3d regional models of salt flats by applying this methodology it was possible to reproduce the vertical fluxes in the lagoons and wetlands which are located in the minimum regional piezometric area an idealized two dimensional model of a vertical cross section in the salar de atacama general structure was carried out to reproduce the mixing zone at a regional scale and to evaluate how heterogeneity affects the mixing zone geometry the higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is the lower the slope is and the shallower the mixing zone becomes this occurs because the freshwater that is recharged is forced to flow through the upper aquifer and thus have a lower head at the mixing zone thus hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer generally constituted by karstified evaporites and alluvial deposits in the salt flats is critical in the geometry of the resulting saline interface acknowledgments the authors acknowledge sqm for their support and for

7273,salt flat brines are a major source of minerals and especially lithium moreover valuable wetlands with delicate ecologies are also commonly present at the margins of salt flats therefore the efficient and sustainable exploitation of the brines they contain requires detailed knowledge about the hydrogeology of the system a critical issue is the freshwater brine mixing zone which develops as a result of the mass balance between the recharged freshwater and the evaporating brine the complex processes occurring in salt flats require a three dimensional 3d approach to assess the mixing zone geometry in this study a 3d map of the mixing zone in a salt flat is presented using the salar de atacama as an example this mapping procedure is proposed as the basis of computationally efficient three dimensional numerical models provided that the hydraulic heads of freshwater and mixed waters are corrected based on their density variations to convert them into brine heads after this correction the locations of lagoons and wetlands that are characteristic of the marginal zones of the salt flats coincide with the regional minimum water brine heads the different morphologies of the mixing zone resulting from this 3d mapping have been interpreted using a two dimensional 2d flow and transport numerical model of an idealized cross section of the mixing zone the result of the model shows a slope of the mixing zone that is similar to that obtained by 3d mapping and lower than in previous models to explain this geometry the 2d model was used to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in the mixing zone geometry the higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is the lower the slope and the shallower the mixing zone become this occurs because most of the freshwater lateral recharge flows through the upper aquifer due to its much higher transmissivity thus reducing the freshwater head the presence of a few meters of highly permeable materials in the upper part of these hydrogeological systems such as alluvial fans or karstified evaporites that are frequently associated with the salt flats is enough to greatly modify the geometry of the saline interface keywords salt flat saltwater intrusion saline interface brine groundwater modelling aquifer heterogeneity 1 introduction salt flats salares are an important source of minerals they account for half of the world s lithium production and contain the main economic reserves of this element usgs 2017 in addition boron and potash are economically mined from salt flats lithium is a strategic commodity its uses vary from light batteries to cancer treatment its demand has notably increased in the last decade and this trend will probably continue in the future vikström et al 2013 as large quantities may be needed to develop nuclear fusion reactors using tritium generated from lithium this fact is evidenced by the large number of countries that are just now commissioning studies to determine the mineral potential of their salt flats e g salar de uyuni in bolivia or salar del hombre muerto in argentina as well as to increase the amounts of resources that could be exploited during current mining activities e g salar de atacama in chile this explains the current worldwide interest in salt flat hydrogeology which is also due to the existence of peripheral brine and saline water lagoons that have high ecological human and tourist value in addition to their scientific value salt flats are endorheic lagoon systems associated with arid or hyperarid climates where the rate of evaporation is very high in many cases this causes the surface water to disappear and the water table to lie just below the land surface yechieli and wood 2002 this characteristic is what triggers the important precipitation or accumulation of high value industrial minerals corenthal et al 2016 kesler et al 2012 munk et al 2016 risacher et al 2003 in these endorheic basins it is common for evaporation to be higher than local recharge hardie 1991 thus some other contribution which is often groundwater may compensate for this difference in the simplest case ignoring hypothetical deep contributions or inflows from other basins the only water input to the salt flat system is lateral inflow and direct rainfall which is minor due to the aridity of the climate and the only output from the system is evaporation these factors are all strongly related to climate variability and could potentially be affected by global climate change rosen 1994 the most accepted hydrogeological model assumes that dense brines produced from surface evaporation overturn and sink in the central area of the salt flat setting up large scale convection cells in its nucleus i e the core of the salt flat which is dominated by halite these cells return to the surface at the margins of the salt flat where the brines mix with incoming fresh groundwater in a complex process fan et al 1997 hamann et al 2015 nield et al 2008 wood and sanford 1990 wooding et al 1997 for this reason the discharge of groundwater essentially occurs at the resulting freshwater brine mixing zone areas where lagoons may appear duffy and al hassan 1988 tejeda et al 2003 as a result wetlands are commonly present in the margins of salt flats and are the bases for complex and sensitive ecological habitats surrounded by barren lands the contact between two miscible fluids of different densities is characterized by a mixing zone which is also called a saline interface this interface results from the dynamic equilibrium of moving fresh and saltwater custodio and bruggeman 1987 custodio and llamas 1976 dentz et al 2006 where the relationship between the concentrations of both fluids is stoichiometric in coastal aquifers the position and characteristics of the mixing zone are well known and its upper part coincides with the coastline in water table aquifers bear 1972 glover 1959 werner et al 2013 in salt flats where the density contrasts are much greater than those in coastal aquifers the mixing zone develops as a result of point pressure equilibrium between recharge and evaporated water but its position and geometry are more difficult to predict this is because the brine in the salt flats is generated in situ as a result of evaporation acosta and custodio 2008 and recharge and evaporation are strongly subject to climatic oscillations tyler et al 2006 brine mining can affect the dynamics of the mixing zone in a short period of time similar to freshwater extraction in coastal aquifers oude essink 2001 in the natural state evaporation occurs in both the salt flat nucleus and the marginal zone regardless of whether it is a sheet of open water marginal lagoons or a shallow water table which commonly have very irregular spatial distributions the need to assess the detailed characteristics of the mixing zone occurs immediately when managing both mineral resources and their associated ecosystems the best management tool are the numerical models in which the effects of variable density are taken into account these models are expensive to run in two dimensional 2d cases and are currently very difficult to run in three dimensional 3d cases at the regional scale oude essink and boekelman 1996 nevertheless 3d regional scale models are needed for the management of any hydrogeological system in the case of coastal systems this problem is solved in two ways 1 neglecting the effects of variable density by assuming some simplifications or 2 converting the pressures of marine and variable density waters into equivalent pressures of freshwater lu et al 2015 maas and emke 1989 the last solution despite providing only an approximation of the actual situation post et al 2007 is the one that has been chosen to model many coastal systems however to date there is no evidence that any similar methodology has been proposed for the study and management of salt flats furthermore the simplifications that are frequently assumed in coastal aquifers such as neglecting density variations when advection is dominant over convection iribar et al 1997 vázquez suñé et al 2006 are not acceptable in salt flats to obtain solutions for the above problem the salar de atacama ne chile was chosen as a case study the choice was based on three characteristics 1 it is the third largest salt lake on earth with a surface area of 3000 km2 2 it contains exceptional water ecosystems and bird nesting areas in the surficial mixing zone area which require scientific solutions for their preservation and sustainability and 3 there is a unique monitoring network that is regularly operated and well instrumented tyler et al 2006 thanks to the exploitation of brine resources carried out in the southwestern area of the salt flat nucleus the main objective of this work is to obtain the first 3d map of the salt flat mixing zone using the salar de atacama as a case study this 3d map together with an idealized 2d numerical model allows us to understand the dynamics of the mixing zone and the effects of heterogeneity on its large scale geometry we also propose the use of the 3d map to apply simplified rules for constant density 3d models that include mixing zones the structure of the manuscript follows the order described below first the 3d mapping of the mixing zone is addressed second the usefulness of 3d mapping in the salt flats to correct the hydraulic heads by density differences and to facilitate their modelling at a constant density is shown third the idealized 2d numerical model of the regional mixing zone is performed fourth the sensitivity analysis of the hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer is carried out to determine its influence on the geometry of the mixing zone on a regional scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographic setting the salar de atacama hereinafter sda is located in northern chile between 23 and 24 south latitudes and 68 and 69 west longitudes it is located in region ii antofagasta and within the limits of the community municipality of san pedro de atacama fig 1 the basin where the salt flat is located has an oval shape with the long axis in the n s direction and an extent of approximately 20 000 km2 it is bordered to the west by the cordillera de la sal salt range which stretches from nne to ssw at the slopes of the domeyko range and to the east by the western cordillera de los andes andean range whose high peaks are crowned by the current volcanic arc 5500 m a s l metres above sea level the northern part of the basin is bounded by the merging of the domeyko range and the andean range while the southern part is bounded by the lila mountains because the andean range acts as a geographic barrier to atmospheric movement the sda is characterized by a hyperarid climate resulting in a very low rainfall rate bookhagen and strecker 2008 garreaud et al 2010 hartley and chong 2002 on average the salt flat receives less than 20 mm yr of precipitation the major water source is groundwater coming from the andean range in the mountains the average precipitation reaches 160 mm yr idaea csic 2017 the output is water table evaporation produced in the nucleus and marginal zone where the mean surficial water evaporation rate is 4 3 mm d evaporation decreases as the depth of the water table increases and it depends on the soil composition kampf et al 2005 kampf and tyler 2006 muñoz pardo and ortiz astete 2004 the two main river courses contributing to the salt flat as shown in fig 1 are the san pedro river which has an average flow of 1 m3 s and torrential events of up to 25 m3 s and the vilama river which has an average flow of 0 2 m3 s these rivers flow from north to south salas et al 2010 the san pedro river ends in a delta with the same name while the vilama river disappears in the upper half of its basin there are also some intermittent streams that descend from the mountains and infiltrate into the extensive alluvial fans on the eastern side of the salt flat in many cases these streams are controlled by structural features in addition in the eastern margin surficial mixing zone of the sda there are many lagoons and wetlands in some cases these have been defined as ramsar sites this area has been recognized by the international community as an environment with significant value for humanity some lagoons reach surface areas of several hectares although most are smaller the lagoons are grouped into four systems fig 1 soncor chaxa barros negros and puilar lagoons which is connected by the burro muerto channel aguas de quelana peine salada saladita and interna lagoons and tilopozo la punta and la brava lagoons these lagoons are the habitats for several migratory or endemic species mainly birds among which there are three species of high andean flamingos xerophytic and halophytic shrubs or grass and some mammals microcrustaceans microalgae and bacteria flamingos mainly feed on microcrustaceans e g artemia whose range of vital salinity has more or less defined thresholds outside these limits the population of this biota is reduced due to its inability to reproduce and survive if the salt concentration increases or to compete with new predators if the concentration of dissolved salts decreases gajardo and beardmore 2012 2 2 hydrogeological framework the sda is currently located in a compressive tectonic basin which is framed by inverse faults which affect from the palaeozoic basement to present deposits arriagada et al 2006 jordan et al 2007 mpodozis et al 2005 based on its geomorphological geological and hydrogeological characteristics four large domains can be distinguished from the watershed line to the basin depocenter figs 1 and 2 1 the basement and the volcanic deposits of the mountain range 2 the alluvial fans descending therefrom 3 the marginal zone 2300 to 2320 m a s l and 4 the sda nucleus 2300 m a s l in the actual basin depocenter i e the halite nucleus a series of clastic and evaporitic sediments are known to have been deposited from the upper miocene to the present with a thickness that exceeds 1400 m in some areas jordan et al 2007 mpodozis et al 2005 pananont et al 2004 the evaporite deposits in the nucleus and marginal zone show a well defined asymmetric zonation that follows a sequence of classic evaporite precipitation with a gradual evolution from carbonates and sulphates in the marginal zone to halite in the salt flat nucleus vásquez et al 2013 where solutes of mining interest are concentrated in the remnant final brines alluvial deposits and some layers of the salt flat nucleus have medium to high hydraulic conductivities idaea csic 2017 muñoz pardo and ortiz astete 2004 rockwood lithium 2015 in the alluvial deposits this is due to their primary lithological properties in the salt flat nucleus this is the result of intense karstification processes in the salt flat the main aquifer is the upper layer of halite 60 300 m d there is also a deeper second halite aquifer 0 1 20 m d which is confined by a layer of low permeability gypsum acting as an intermediate aquitard 0 01 5 m d this same aquifer aquitard aquifer sequence applies to the alluvial fans as a regional simplification where the upper 80 300 m d and lower 20 m d high permeability detrital deposits are separated from the lower ones by some relatively poorly permeable layers 0 01 5 m d the regional potentiometric surface shows a concentric flow that extends from the highest areas to the depocenter of the basin due to the low recharge and topography the water head gradients are very small less than0 001 m m especially in the nucleus and marginal zones where these gradients are almost zero in the marginal zone mixing zone groundwater crops out thus indicating the freshwater brine interface zone fig 2 2 3 hydraulic role of the mixing zone in the lagoons and wetlands of the salar de atacama three hydraulic domains have been distinguished in the mixing zone from the eastern boundary of the salt flat nucleus to the lateral alluvial fans these are the internal imz middle mmz and external emz mixing zones fig 2 freshwater recharge is mainly produced on the eastern mountain side the marginal lagoons wetlands and springs are located in the mmz fig 2 the resulting flow discharges into this zone and ascends to the surface resulting in the quelana peine and tilopozo lagoons the soncor lagoon system is a special case as it is located in the imz and not in the mmz its origin is not the direct groundwater overflow of the mmz ortiz et al 2014 along the final flow path the total dissolved solids tds of the groundwater gradually increase as a consequence of mixing and evaporation as it is very shallow some of the water returns to the imz and the salt flat nucleus as concentrated brine fig 2 this dynamic behaviour is strongly variable due to the seasonality of recharge and evaporation salas et al 2010 2 4 hydrogeological data the analysis of satellite images landsat 8 allows us to map the surface hydrological features and the mixing zone geometry near the land surface water heads and physico chemical parameters e g electrical conductivity were measured in the field the same physico chemical parameters and solute concentrations were measured in the laboratory following standard procedures some vertical electrical conductivity ec profiles were obtained in boreholes data are available from a total of 310 observation points wells piezometers trenches and surface water courses distributed throughout the area fig 1 with records dating back to 1984 most of the data used for this research project were provided by the sqm company these data have been complemented with other difficult to access sources of information rio chilex s a 1997 rockwood lithium 2015 the main information of the wells with physico chemical data coordinates and average values of ec density and salinity is compiled in table s1 of the supporting information the monitoring network consists of well levelled points with which to measure the water head and collect water samples these monitoring points are most often boreholes but they often designed as wells and piezometers some boreholes are point wells which are open or screened in a short interval at a given depth but they often have long open and screened sections the cased section of the piezometer may contain water of a different density and salinity than that in the open part rushton 1980 this affects the measured water head this effect can be corrected by obtaining an electrical conductivity ec log to calculate vertical density changes and introduce the needed corrections it can also be corrected by substituting the water inside the borehole before measuring the level for water in the open section by repeated bailing or low flow pumping from near the water surface nevertheless in low permeability layers this measurement may be distorted by residual water level drawdown in most cases the depth to the water level is measured without considering the salinity in the uncased section this may introduce some errors in marginal areas with great vertical salinity gradients and where shallow water may enter the borehole water samples are often collected using a bailer or a thief sampler that opens at the desired depth some mixing may thus occur with other water in the borehole or pit the best water samples are obtained with a low flow pump with the inflow inside the section to be sampled measuring and sampling protocols are applied to increase the number of available data points correlations between density ec and tds were obtained fig 3 their magnitudes show a clear mutual correlation kohfahl et al 2015 and provide a practical technique with which to map the interface for ec measurements it is necessary to apply a correction for temperature t hayashi 2004 of approximately 2 c if it is not automatically done when ec and t are measured the ec correction and probe calibration errors may also explain part of the dispersion the correlation between density and ec is not linear and follows a more complex polynomial line the correlation between tds and ec shows linear behaviour up to 100 ms cm 1 similar to other brines jellison et al 1999 however for higher ec values the correlation is nonlinear which will increase dispersion if a polynomial relationship is not applied 2 5 darcýs law head and pressure formulation in variable density flow calculating flow directions and flow rates is the basic goal of almost all hydrogeological studies these values can be obtained using darcy s law in the case of variable density the darcy s law in terms of water pressure is bear 1972 4 q k μ p ρ g z where k is the intrinsic permeability tensor μ is the fluid viscosity p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and g is the gravitational acceleration and z denotes the vertical upward direction the spatial components of q are 5 q x k μ p x 6 q y k μ p y 7 q z k μ p z ρ g the horizontal flow components q x and q y can be calculated based on the corresponding horizontal components of the pressure gradients or from the head gradients referring to the same water density for vertical flow q z there is a buoyant term associated with the gravity vector which does not appear in the horizontal directions 2 6 numerical approach a variable density flow pattern is the result of strongly coupled flow and mass transport differential equations flow in porous media can be described using the following water mass conservation differential equation 8 s s h t q 0 where s s is the specific storage and t is the time neglecting all density dependencies in the balance terms except for the buoyancy term the oberbeck boussinesq approximation q is given by the following expression in terms of water heads 9 q k ρ 0 g μ μ 0 μ h ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 z note that z is multiplied by the density ratio in which ρ 0 is the reference water density the viscosity relation function where μ 0 is the reference fluid viscosity may be neglected in viscosity constant models salt transport can be described using the differential equation 10 ϕ c t q c d c 0 where porosity is ϕ solute concentration is c and the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor is d the code feflow was used to solve this set of coupled governing equations more information about the formulation and performance of this code can be found in diersch 2014 3 results 3 1 3d mapping of the freshwater brine mixing zone the central axis of the mixing zone at the surface was identified through the use of satellite images fig 4 this axis coincides with wetlands and small easily recognizable seasonal lagoons tejeda et al 2003 the three dimensional mapping of the main mixing zone was performed by identifying the position of its central surface ec 150 ms cm 1 upper surface ec 100 ms cm 1 and lower surface ec 200 ms cm 1 these surfaces are used to delineate the main mixing zone which is the region in which the salinity gradient changes most rapidly the given limits do not represent the extreme ec values corresponding to brine and freshwater values between 200 and 240 ms cm 1 are only reached in the central area of the nucleus and values of less than a few ms cm 1 are reached in the recharge areas the position of the mixing zone was deduced based on the density data measured or calculated in each piezometer using nests of wells where each one is open at a different depth allows the more faithful characterization of the geometry of the mixing zone nevertheless considering the particular characteristics of each monitoring point the majority of these sites could be used to produce valuable information the sda mixing zone mainly extends throughout the northeast east and southeast salt flat margins figs 5 and 6 the full range of densities present in the mixing zone can be observed on the land surface the surficial densities closest to 1 23 kg l were measured in the salt flat nucleus while the densities closest to 1 kg l were measured in the external mixing zone and the recharge zone the mixing zone shows a moderate slope in the imz internal mixing zone strong deepening in the mmz middle mixing zone and a gradual slope reduction in the emz external mixing zone and recharge areas the external limits have been defined as far away as possible as monitoring wells are very scarce it is expected that the interface will extend beyond these limits but that it will have a low slope 3 2 2d numerical model of the salar de atacama mixing zone an idealized vertical profile 2d numerical model was carried out to use it as a tool to understand the geometry of the mixing zone although great local heterogeneity has been described in the salar de atacama muñoz pardo and ortiz astete 2004 ortiz et al 2014 salas et al 2010 only three simplified layers have been considered for the idealized regional model fig 7 these layers attempt to represent the regional aquifer aquitard aquifer sequence that has often been identified in both the salt flat nucleus and the alluvial fans as shown in the pumping tests done in the region the hydraulic contrast between these three units aquifer a aquitard ab and aquifer b is conspicuous and spatially continuous but the hydraulic conductivity values may vary due to heterogeneities and karstification idaea csic 2017 the model domain represents an idealized vertical cross section that is 25 000 m long and 1200 m high fig 7 the length is the characteristic of any section of the eastern mixing zone including 10 000 m of nucleus 5000 m of mixing zone and 10 000 m of alluvial fans the thickness chosen corresponds to the thickness of the nucleus vilama formation in the eastern area jordan et al 2007 the right boundary is the contact between the basement rocks and alluvial fans that may be considered impermeable in a simplification because the water that falls in the mountains volcanic rocks and basement of low permeability reaches the alluvial fans largely superficially where it infiltrates due to their greater permeability the left boundary is located inside the salt flat similar to other models duffy and al hassan 1988 fan et al 1997 hamann et al 2015 the lower boundary is located at the bottom of the geological unit b and the upper boundary is the water table aquifers are modelled as confined aquifers with constant transmissivity because the water table variations are very small compared to the aquifer thickness due to the very low hydraulic gradients the model mesh has approximately 153 000 triangular elements to model the salt flats two main methodologies are used depending on the objective for which the model is constructed to study the geochemistry or detailed evaporation processes of the salt flat reactive transport models can be carried out that include evaporation and dissolution using well established saturation indices hamann et al 2015 vásquez et al 2013 however this coupling requires extremely high calculation times even for idealized problems hamann et al 2015 thus techniques are often used that simplify the problem numerically without altering the geometry of the resulting mixing zone duffy and al hassan 1988 fan et al 1997 in this way it is possible to limit the maximum density without needing to precipitate salts based on saturation indices following these guidelines the left lower and right boundaries are treated as no flow zones for water and mass i e neumann type boundary conditions at the top different boundary conditions are selected for each spatial stretch with the purpose of representing the evaporation and recharge processes the reference values of recharge were taken from idaea csic 2017 the recharge considering the total length 36 25 km from the distal alluvial fans to the watershed line ranges from 20 to 140 mm yr respectively if a detention of 25 is considered then the net recharge rate ranges from 15 to 105 mm yr but in our simplified model we only considered 10 km of the total recharge length by this motive a fluid inflow neumann type boundary condition was fixed on the recharge surface with a minimum value of 15 mm yr in the contact between the mixing zone and the alluvial fans and a maximum value of 420 mm yr an unrealistic recharge rate that allows the model to enter the total recharge volume in the contact between the alluvial fans and the basement as in previous models duffy and al hassan 1988 fan et al 1997 the recharge was applied on the top to not condition the mixing zone in the right boundary this takes advantage of a large part of the water recharged in the mountains infiltrates the alluvial fans a water head dirichlet was fixed in the halite nucleus and the internal mixing zone for mass transport fixed solute concentration of 1 23 kg l for the salt flat nucleus and 1 00 kg l for the freshwater recharge area were implemented concentrations were normalized to the densities of freshwater and brine as end members the upwinding option for the numerical treatment has been used to smoothen out steep concentration changes although this causes some additional numerical dispersivity a stationary simulation was carried out to obtain the initial water heads for the initial mass condition a concentration of 1 00 kg l was assigned corresponding to a hypothetical initial scenario where all groundwater is fresh the model was run for several thousands of years with a semiautomatic time step control to reach a quasi stationary state the hydraulic parameters deduced from pumping tests or in some cases from the literature idaea csic 2017 are given in fig 7 the results are shown in fig 8 the geometry of the mixing zone in accordance with the 2d numerical model and the 3d mapping presents a very small slope which allows it to penetrate through all of the alluvial fans only in the first section between the nucleus and the alluvial fans is the interface slope greater this type of mixing zone corresponds to arid and high permeability salt flats in accordance with the case 4 described by duffy and al hassan 1988 3 3 comparison with analytic solutions for the sharp interface in coastal aquifers a comparison of the results of the model with the most commonly used analytical solutions in coastal aquifers is made below in the case of a sharp interface the freshwater and saltwater pressures must be equal at the interface the badon ghyben herzberg bgh principle custodio and bruggeman 1987 custodio and llamas 1976 establishes that in a homogeneous coastal aquifer the depth of the interface below sea level ξ is given as ξ α h f in which h f is the freshwater head and α is the inverse of the relative density difference α ρ f ρ s ρ f where ρ s and ρ f are the densities of saline water and freshwater respectively it is assumed that the freshwater flow is horizontal and that the saline water flow is steady and equal to that of the saline water body for coastal aquifers the most frequent value of α is 40 for the salar de atacama brine the value of α is 4 35 as vertical flows and the true brine head are not taken into account in the bgh principle the predicted depth is generally too shallow and it does not occur inside the actual mixing zone therefore in most cases the bgh formula is not a good predictor of the mixing zone depth if the actual head of salt water is considered the hubbert 1940 formula is used 1 ξ α h f 1 α h s where h f and h s are theoretically measured on the interface in practice they are assumed to be equal to the freshwater and saline water heads measured in the point monitoring wells on the vertical axis of the site considered or near it thus vertical components are ignored which introduces an error the closer the well screens are to the mixing zone the more the predicted position generally falls inside or closer to the position of the mixing zone pool and carrera 2011 proposed an empirical improvement of the bgh principle for coastal aquifers in which ε 1 α ρ s ρ f ρ f is changed to ε 1 α t b 1 6 in which α t transversal dispersivity and b depth below sea level of the aquifer bottom which is assumed to be horizontal they rewrote the bgh approximation to the interface depth as ξ h f ε none of these predictions take into account the effect of layering which is very important in the case described here in the case study the sharp bgh interface is always situated well above the mean mixing zone surface 1 115 kg l fig 8 the sharp interface resulting from the pool and carrera 2011 approximation shows a better fit of the mixing zone the hubert interface best fits the results of the numerical model although it requires a greater number of hydraulic head data for its calculation which hinders its practical applicability 4 discussion 4 1 water head corrections by contrast densities in salt flats in the case of sda only a few potentiometric surface mappings were completed in previous studies moreover only some simplified three dimensional numerical modelling has been performed none of which was at the regional scale and they often neglected the effects of density muñoz pardo and ortiz astete 2004 performed a 3d numerical model of the nucleus and marginal zone of the sda by neglecting density effects although they recognized a range of densities between 0 99 and 1 22 kg l ortiz et al 2014 also showed a potentiometric surface mapping of the soncor lagoons system without taking density effects into account salas et al 2010 were the only authors to consider the effects of density although they did not explain the followed methodology in that study the flow path lines did not describe the expected behaviour of a natural freshwater brine mixing zone because at the time of that study the brine pumps had already depressed the water table in the nucleus establishing the direction and sense of the water flow directly from the water head data measured in piezometers and wells with waters of different salinities is often erroneous this error may be very important if the contrast in densities is as important as it is in the sda thus all water head measurements have been transformed to the same reference density and these were subsequently used following the rules of considering consider buoyancy effects in the case of salt flats especially in the nucleus marginal zone and its surroundings areas the dominant flow component is vertical unlike that in coastal aquifers therefore it is essential to apply a correction allowing for the most faithful reproduction possible of the vertical flow near the mixing zone if the density dependence of the flow is neglected the predicted flow path lines have their origin in the mountains and end in the salt flat nucleus fig 9 a this contrasts with a general observation in which groundwater discharge and wetlands occur at the margins of the salt flats fig 9b however taking into account the effects of density on flow in three dimensional complex numerical modelling is almost impossible because of the high degree of computational power that is required an interesting solution would be to apply a density correction methodology similar to that applied to coastal aquifers lusczynski 1961 to transform saltwater heads into freshwater heads the results obtained using this methodology indicate that the lagoons are in the regional minimum water head and that they represent the main discharge area similar to the actual case fig 9c nevertheless in contrast to coastal aquifers the focus of interest and the highest numbers of observation points in salt flats are in the nucleus and the mixing zone but not in the freshwater zone recharge area for this reason it is much more useful to develop a solution that allows for the correction of the water heads by transforming freshwater heads into brine heads the following procedure is adopted for the water head correction depending on the characteristics and available information obtained from piezometers or wells four study cases have been established point wells with an ec profile long screened wells with an ec profile point wells without an ec profile and long screened wells without an ec profile the point wells slotted only in a very short stretch in which an ec profile was available have been corrected by taking the vertical density distribution into account using the equation 2 h c h i z 0 z 2 z ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 dz where h c is the corrected water head h i is the measured water head z is the saturated well thickness z 0 is the origin of the water depths of the well z 2 is the depth corresponding to an ec of 200 ms cm 1 ρ is the density measured at each point and ρ 0 is the reference density in the case of sda the reference density is 1 23 kg l the long screened wells with an ec profile were corrected using the same criteria a unitary correction for each stretch of the vertical profile may be performed by obtaining the vertical distribution of the water heads the point wells in which an ec profile was not available were corrected assuming that the slotted density was homogeneous throughout the entire well in this case the previous equation is simplified to 2 h c h i z ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 the long screened wells without an ec profile were corrected by assuming the density distribution of the reference ec density surfaces obtained in the regional mixing zone mapping fig 10 to apply the correction in each piezometer three stretches are considered inside these monitoring wells 1 the thickness of the water layer below the surface of 200 ms cm 1 2 the thickness between the surfaces of 200 ms cm 1 and 100 ms cm 1 with a reference surface of 150 ms cm 1 and 3 the thickness between the surface of 100 ms cm 1 and the water table the first stretch is not corrected because it is considered to be practically brine the correction of the second stretch is performed based on the thickness of the mixing zone between the surfaces of 200 ms cm 1 and 100 ms cm 1 and their average density finally the correction in the third stretch is made by taking into account a linear gradient between the existing density in the surface of 100 ms cm 1 and the density measured in the upper water of that observation point 3 h c h i z 1 z 0 ρ 01 ρ 0 ρ 0 z 2 z 1 ρ 12 ρ 0 ρ 0 where z 1 is the depth corresponding to the 100 ms cm 1 surface ρ 01 is the average density between z 0 and z 1 and ρ 12 is the average density between z 1 and z 2 in the monitoring wells where the third stretch does not exist when the internal mixing zone is close to the land surface the correction is made by applying the density value measured at the surface to the entire freshwater column in this case the corrected water head may be slightly underestimated by not correcting from 200 ms cm 1 to 240 ms cm 1 however it is very difficult to map the surface of 240 ms cm 1 with a density of 1 23 kg l as it is only attained in some areas of the salt flat nucleus the mixing zone stretch in which the density ec values change faster is between 100 and 200 ms cm 1 farther from these surfaces these changes are slow diffuse and too complex to be identified 4 2 mixing zone hydrodynamics in the quasi stationary stage fig 8 the effects of variable density allow us to differentiate five sectors with very different hydraulic behaviours namely the nucleus internal mixing zone imz middle mixing zone mmz external mixing zone emz and recharge zone the hydrodynamics in the nucleus are controlled by convection cells that are continuously evolving triggered by the evaporation of brine in the surface these convection cells become denser collapse and cause the upward movement of less dense brine the presence of low permeability layers such as the intermediate aquitard ab produce a vertical break in the convection cells the lateral convection cell which is closest to the mixing zone is the engine of the upward flow in the imz where a mixture with freshwater is produced causing the eastern part of the nucleus to have densities slightly lower than the western and middle zone fig 2 in contrast the recharge zone is primarily characterized by a downward flow of freshwater that gradually rotates and points towards the nucleus until the mixing zone is reached where the flow ascends parallel to the principal mixing zone surface finally this groundwater ascends with a relatively high velocity to the land surface in the emz and especially in the mmz in this way the mmz is the zone that clearly presents the highest flow rates because the mmz is where the flows coming from the nucleus and the recharge water merge fig 2 the mmz thus constitutes the main outflow of the domain returning part of this water to the more surficial zone of the imz it is expected that the saline mixing zone at least in the upper aquifer is in equilibrium with climatic oscillations even those of relatively short cycles e g enso in contrast at depth these zones do not show visible direct responses to short term oscillations as they only reflect the effects of large time scale cycles additionally stormy events may cause local to regional disturbances in the upper mixing zone especially in the internal mixing zone these hydrological dynamics are consistent with the hydrogeochemical differences observed by boutt et al 2016 between the samples collected in the imz and emz they are also consistent with the hydraulic response to short term and long term variations in precipitation and recharge regimes in both zones as observed in the abovementioned manuscript in the imz where the flow is slow and sometimes has short path lines precipitation events give rise to a more evident water table response than in the emz where the flow is higher and a precipitation event induces a very small or inappreciable effect finally a special case of mixing zone occurs in the northeastern marginal zone just to the north of the soncor lagoon system where numerous springs have been mapped fig 4 the waters that come out of these springs drain to the burro muerto channel and finally to the soncor lagoon system if the mixing zone geometry of this zone figs 4 and 5 is compared with those of the previously described southeastern and central eastern areas a large plateau can be seen with its long axis approximately oriented in the n s direction unlike the rest of the marginal zone where the lagoons tend to be located along the central axis of the middle mixing zone mmz in the soncor system the mapped springs are not only located along this axis but also located in the internal mixing zone imz furthermore it should be noted that the mixing zone is always located around the salt flat nucleus except in this area where the mixing zone moves northward and becomes much more gradual the arrangement of these springs coincides with some of the structural planes described by universidad de chile 2016 or their extensions fig 4b there is a lowering of the hydraulic head along the permeable fault planes and an uprising of somewhat deeper freshwater flows that partially feed the springs this could explain the very low water head gradients the shallow water table and some of the hydro chemical anomalies described by other authors ortiz et al 2014 4 3 influence of heterogeneity on mixing zone geometry through the 3d mapping of the mixing zone important variations in the depth of the mixing zone have been observed along the entire eastern margin of the salt flat although different sensitivity analyses have been carried out both for recharge and for hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer is the one that shows the greatest sensitivity to the regional geometry of the saline interface if the recharge varies within a coherent range for example by doubling or reducing it by half the changes produced are very small in this section we analyse the effects that the high permeability layers in the top and the aquitards have on the geometry of the mixing zone to study the effect of a high permeability layer on the upper part of the system the regional 2d vertical model is used as a basis the hydraulic conductivity values of the ab aquitard and the b aquifer were both set at 0 1 m d to prevent further factors from coming into play the hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer varied 0 1 m d homogeneous case 1 m d 10 m d and 100 m d these values are commonly found in the upper aquifer of the mixing zone and in the alluvial fans of the salar de atacama the results of the sensitivity analysis show that the higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is the lower the slope is and the shallower the mixing zone becomes fig 11 this occurs because the lateral recharge freshwater flows almost entirely through this layer when there is an upper layer of very high permeability in the lower layers the recharge water almost does not penetrate thus favouring the rise of the mixing zone and notably reducing its slope fig 11c and d on the other hand when the aquifer is homogeneous there is no preferential flow through the upper layer thus the deep freshwater is able to maintain a higher head thus repelling the mixing zone reducing saltwater intrusions and moving it towards the salt flat fig 11a and b in the homogeneous case the largest slope of the interface is reached the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layers greatly influences the geometry of the regional saline interface this explains the low slope and great intrusion of the mixing zone in the salar de atacama unlike in previous works tejeda et al 2003 vásquez et al 2013 where the mixing zone did not penetrate the alluvial fans and had a much higher slope all of these studies considered a homogenous porous medium without a high permeability top layer additionally theoretical works fan et al 1997 hamann et al 2015 holzbecher 2005 always addressed a homogenous case of study only fan et al 1997 made a first approximation of the effect of heterogeneity in the mixing zone by taking into account a more realistic geology however these authors focused their efforts on explaining the free convection differences between both cases and did not focus on the geometry of the mixing zone the presence of aquitards can also modify the position of the mixing zone this is because the aquitard further hinders the flow of groundwater through the deeper layers and forces the flow through the upper aquifer at up flow areas thus the relative deepening and reduced thickness of the mixing zone may be observed the effects described above may explain the most abrupt deepening of the mixing zone observed in the central eastern area east of soncor of the salar de atacama figs 5 and 6b near this zone some studies cornellà et al 2009 ortiz et al 2014 have described several less permeable layers at different levels 5 conclusions the two 2d and three dimensional 3d geometry and hydrodynamics of the salt flat freshwater brine mixing zone were studied using the salar de atacama as case study the three dimensional mapping of the actual mixing zone was carried out for the first time in a salt flat showing the irregularities of the mixing zone in both the vertical and horizontal directions using the 3d mixing zone mapping data the application of a water head correction to the freshwater and mixed water heads in order to compensate for density variations and transform them into brine water heads was proposed to reduce the computational cost of the 3d regional models of salt flats by applying this methodology it was possible to reproduce the vertical fluxes in the lagoons and wetlands which are located in the minimum regional piezometric area an idealized two dimensional model of a vertical cross section in the salar de atacama general structure was carried out to reproduce the mixing zone at a regional scale and to evaluate how heterogeneity affects the mixing zone geometry the higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is the lower the slope is and the shallower the mixing zone becomes this occurs because the freshwater that is recharged is forced to flow through the upper aquifer and thus have a lower head at the mixing zone thus hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer generally constituted by karstified evaporites and alluvial deposits in the salt flats is critical in the geometry of the resulting saline interface acknowledgments the authors acknowledge sqm for their support and for

urbanization tourism and agriculture may pose threats to river deltas the knowledge of the factors controlling the regional water quality regime in these areas is important for planning sustainable use and management of the water resources here hydrochemical methods and multivariate statistical techniques were combined to investigate the shallow aquifer of the pinios river thessaly deltaic plain with respect to water quality hydrogeochemical evolution and interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies water quality assessment indicated that most of the river and groundwater samples fully comply with the criteria set by the drinking water directive 98 83 ec the river is recharged mainly from springs of the tempi valley and the shallow aquifer and to a lesser degree from precipitation throughout the year the hydrogeochemical characteristics indicated a cation ca mg and na bicarbonate water type which evolves to calcium chloride sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride water type in the northern part of the delta calcite and dolomite dissolution determined the major ion chemistry but other processes such as silicate weathering and cation exchange reactions also contributed in the northern part of the plain the interaction with the deeper aquifer enriched the shallow aquifer with na and cl ions principal component analysis showed that five components pcs

resources on a spatial and temporal basis brunke and gonser 1997 ezzy et al 2006 menció and mas pla 2008 torres rondon et al 2013 seasonal variations of precipitation river discharge and water table level can cause a reduced replenishment of the water system leading to limited availability of water groundwater over extraction can trigger sea water intrusion causing a degradation of the deltaic freshwater quality and shortage of drinking water supplies nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural practices can contaminate aquifers and surface waters via infiltration and direct runoff respectively barrett et al 2002 kim et al 2009 mondal et al 2011 sarma et al 1982 the detailed knowledge of the factors controlling the surface water and groundwater quality is recognized as

water discharge were measured monthly from october 2012 to september 2013 river water discharge in m3 s was measured at two river sites one just before the river enters the delta area site ga and one close to the river mouth site gp see fig 1 using a current flow meter valeport bfm 001 002 groundwater levels were measured in 13 boreholes with a contact gauge ott kl 010 rtk gps was used to map the position of the boreholes to an accuracy of 10 mm monthly rainfall data were obtained from meteorological stations davis vantage pro2 plus at stomio rs and at palaiopyrgos rp within the deltaic plain at an altitude of 9 m and 6 5 m respectively groundwater samples from 13 boreholes were collected in different seasons october 2012 january 2013 april 2013 and july 2013 two springs were sampled on monthly basis for the first year 2012 2013 and on seasonal basis for the second year 2013 2014 the same sampling pattern was followed for river water samples collected from 7 sampling stations in and

et al 2017 since salinization and nitrate pollution were considered the most important threats to the deltaic system a weight of 4 was assigned to no3 no2 nh4 ec na and cl manganese so4 and ca were assigned the weights 3 3 and 1 respectively the variables were normalized transformed to one of four corresponding scores 0 25 50 100 table 1 of supplementary material the normalization factors used to transform each measured concentration were limited to four 0 25 50 100 in contrast to eleven 0 100 incremented by 10 used by debels et al 2005 because this was dictated by the concentration ranges set by the european legislation limits and other water quality criteria loukas 2010 see supplementary material for the mathematical calculation of increments the classification scale was modified by debels et al 2005 taking into account that spring waters produced wqi values ranging from 100 to 85 this range was set as the high quality class to set the last class bad 25 a mock calculation was performed with a hypothetical sample that scored 25 for all parameters for the three intermediate classes that needed to be set in order to comply with wfd categories it was decided that the scoring range of 25 84 be equidistantly incremented by 20 units the intermediate classes were set as good 84 65 moderate 64 45 poor 44 25 for higher resolution between samples of the same class the three intermediate classes were further subdivided into sub classes a and b i e good a good b moderate a moderate b and poor a poor b the higher a values corresponded to samples closer to the immediately better classification class and the lower b values to the next worst 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological conditions the temporal variation of groundwater levels in the middle part of the deltaic plain e g p7 p19 fig 2 a follows roughly the seasonal patterns of precipitation with higher water table values observed during the wet season and the lower ones during the dry season in the beginning of the dry season october november water levels of the shallow aquifer were relatively low increased until february and dropped gradually to reach the lowest values during the end of the dry season august september on the other hand the groundwater level in borehole p22 in the western part of the plain remained constant throughout the year indicating that rainfall recharge played a secondary role in this area of the delta here shallow aquifer recharge seems to be related to a lateral groundwater supply from the surrounding mountainous area river water discharge variation patterns did not closely follow the high and low peaks of precipitation on a monthly basis indicating that the river was also recharged from different sources springs and groundwater both river discharge and groundwater levels followed roughly the same temporal pattern fig 2a indicating that there is interaction between the two both reached their highest peak in february and showed a smooth temporal variation with higher values in the wet season and lower values in the dry season during the dry season a temporary dirt barrier bar1 in fig 1 is emplaced to divert part of the river water flow towards an irrigation canal in the se from june to september river water discharge downstream site gp was higher than upstream site ga despite the diversion of river flow in may the comparison of water levels in the river channel at gp to water levels in the nearby boreholes g3 and g7 fig 2b showed that groundwater levels were constantly higher than the water in the river channel indicating that in this part of plain there is an inflow of water from the aquifer to the river during the dry period 4 2 hydrochemistry of the deltaic plain tables 2 5 of the supplementary material summarize

conductivity as well as the concentrations of k na mg and cl were higher during the dry period than the wet period which can be attributed to evaporation and or recharge from groundwater e g during baseflow conditions no3 concentrations ranged from 0 to 7 5 mg l less than the 50 mg l acceptable concentration for human consumption directive 98 83 ec the nitrate values increased during the wet period as a result of increased precipitation and subsequent agricultural runoff at the mouth area downstream of the second river barrier bar2 in fig 1 river water at sites ekv1 ekv4 had temperatures

order of hco3 cl so4 no3 the ionic concentrations of the spring waters were similar to the river waters at sampling sites ge75 and ga nitrates and nitrites were below the threshold values of 50 mg l

among the different categories of water samples groundwater had the highest ec values and concentrations of total dissolved solids tds mean 874 mg l the highest mean ec values were in the northern part of the plain p10 5849 μs cm p13 1868 μs cm p15 1472 μs cm p19 1067 μs cm and p12 994 μs cm theses elevated values indicated the influence of saline water in this part of the plain calcium mg na and k accounted for 15 1 13 4 41 2 and 2 0 of the tz of the groundwater respectively however after excluding brackish samples at sites p10 and p13 ca mg na and k accounted for 21 7 19 2 15 3 and 2 8 of the tz of the groundwater respectively molar cation concentrations followed the order ca mg na k and hco3 was the dominant anion accounting for 78 5 of the tz the anion concentrations of groundwater followed the order hco3 cl so4 no3 of the major ions so4 was below the threshold value of 250 mg l set by the eu directive for drinking water sodium exceeded the value of 200 mg l only in borehole p10 while cl exceeded the eu threshold value of 250 mg l in 12 of the samples nitrates and nitrites were generally below the eu threshold values of 50 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively directive 98 83 ec whereas ammonium exceeded the eu threshold value of 0 5 mg l in 38 of samples the highest no3 from 10 9 to 31 8 mg l and nh4 from 0 8 to 89 7 mg l concentrations were observed in the western e g p2 p4 p22 and northern part of the plain e g p10 p11 p15 the higher no3 and nh4 concentrations in groundwater compared to river water signifies that the aquifer is contaminated not only from agricultural runoff but also from point sources of contamination in places e g domestic effluents at the built up coastal area e g p11 the concentrations of fe mn and zn showed the highest values in the groundwater samples tables 2 5 of the supplementary material probably originating from natural weathering of iron manganese and zinc bearing minerals and rocks only manganese concentration exceeded the eu threshold value of 50 μg l in 56 of the samples max 826 μg l which could be attributed to an additional source of mn such as the application of mn enriched fertilizers see also section 4 6 4 3 water quality index the water quality index results and classification for all sampling sites and periods are found in tables 6 and 7 of the supplementary material a spatial summation of the wqi results is presented in fig 3 the classification of the groundwater samples showed that 13 of the samples were classified as high quality 73 as good quality and the remaining 14 as moderate 8 and poor 6 quality waters furthermore 63 of the good quality groundwater samples were classified into the subcategory of good b water quality which is closer to the moderate water quality class in the northern part of the plain groundwater samples showed a poor b p10 to moderate p13 water quality no seasonal variation was observed on the wqis of the groundwater samples considering the riverine water body of 52 river water samples 11 were classified as of good a water quality and the remaining as of high water quality the upstream river sampling site gg located outside the deltaic plain had a good quality which was attributed to enrichment with contaminants originating from the agricultural plain of thessaly the city of larisa and its industrial zone the contribution of spring waters to the river as it enters the plain resulted in the classification of the river water samples at site ge75 as of high quality in the central part of the plain 82 of the water samples of sampling site gp were classified as of high quality whereas 50 of the river water samples from the mouth area were classified as of good 29 as of high and 21 as of moderate water quality the deterioration of the water quality in the mouth area samples is limited and due to seawater intrusion 4 4 hydrochemical evolution water types were defined for all samples river mouth area springs groundwater using cations and anions plotted on a piper diagram piper 1944 six water types are shown in fig 4 since it was not possible to discriminate the ca mg hco3 ca hco3 and mg hco3 water types a ca mg ratio and a ternary ca mg cl diagram were used as discussed later river water samples upstream and at the mouth area showed mainly a ca mg hco3 water type two river water samples one collected inside the plain site gp in november 2012 and one outside the plain site gg in september 2013 as well as a groundwater sample collected from site p13 in november 2012 showed a na hco3 water type the river water samples at the mouth area were taken only during the wet period and were not enriched in cl mean 39 4 mg l except sampling site ekv1 which showed a na cl type in october 2013 due to increased cl concentration 225 mg l because of seawater intrusion spring water samples showed a ca hco3 water type throughout the year indicating a constant mineralization source groundwater samples were mainly concentrated in the water types ca mg hco3 ca hco3 and mg hco3 the samples close to the river e g p2 p3 and p7 showed the same water type ca mg hco3 as the river samples of site gp indicating possible interaction between the two water bodies in the northern part of the plain groundwater quality evolved locally e g p10 p13 to a na cl water type indicating enrichment in na and cl and influence from a saline source borehole p15 showed a hydrochemical evolution to a ca cl water type indicating occurrence of hydrogeochemical processes as discussed later in the western part of the plain borehole p4 exhibits a nh4 hco3 water type due to the extremely high nh4 concentration mean 60 mg l attributed to a point source of agricultural pollution however after removing the nh4 contamination the water varied between the ca mg hco3 and the mg hco3 water type throughout the year as illustrated in fig 5 as the river flows towards the river mouth area the ca mg ratio changed because of interaction with spring waters and groundwater outside the plain sampling site gg showed a mean ca mg ratio of 1 8 which increased to 2 3 at the river sampling site ga as a result of mixing with the spring waters of ag paraskevi site pa which showed a mean ca mg ratio of 3 0 before entering the deltaic plain the river is recharged by the spring waters near rapsani site pe75 mean ca mg 4 9 as confirmed by the increase of the ca mg ratio at the river water sampling site ge75 mean ca mg 3 9 as the river crosses the deltaic plain the mean ca mg ratio decreased to 2 8 at the river water sampling site gp indicating water enrichment in mg probably due to the interaction with groundwater mean ca mg 1 5 at sites ekv1 ekv4 the river water samples exhibited a mean ca mg ratio 2 1 2 4 like that of sampling site gp 2 8 groundwater samples showed no particular pattern in terms of ca mg ratio the groundwater samples close to the river e g p2 p3 and p7 showed similar ca mg ratios mean ca mg 2 0 to the river samples of site gp mean ca mg 2 8 indicating possible interaction between the river and the aquifer in the western part of the plain the p2 sampling site exhibited the highest ca mg ratio 3 0 which was close the ca mg ratio of the river site ge75 3 9 suggesting that interaction between the river and the aquifer is likely to occur in the northern part of the plain groundwater shows a high variation in terms of ca mg ratio this is because the aquifer in this area is influenced by saline sources with low ca mg ratios and high cl concentration for example the p10 sampling site exhibited the highest mean ec value 3743 μs cm a mean ca mg of 0 7 and a mean cl value of 1297 mg l 4 5 water rock interactions and mixing gibbs 1970 proposed that the tds versus na na ca can be used to explore the relative importance of the major natural mechanisms controlling water chemistry as illustrated in fig 6 a and b the samples collected from the river the springs and the boreholes fell mainly in the domain influenced by geology only a few groundwater samples in the northern part of the plain e g p10 underwent some mixing with saline water to further investigate the salinization effect the revelle 1941 index ri cl hco3 co3 was used fig 7 river water samples upstream of the mouth area showed a ri ranging between 0 1 and 1 1 representing mainly fresh water except for the river water samples of site gg which became slightly brackish in the summer of 2013 the river site gg lies outside the deltaic plain thus seawater intrusion cannot explain the increase in cl concentration which was probably due to evaporation phenomena combined with low river flow at the river mouth area the water exhibited low ri values 0 5 indicating no brackishness due to seawater intrusion in the wet period however in october 2013 the site ekv1 showed a ri of 1 0 which indicated a seawater intrusion influence most of the groundwater samples 77 1 showed a ri 0 5 fewer groundwater samples 14 6 collected mostly in the dry season fell in the slightly brackish water domain moderately or very brackish waters accounted for 8 3 of the groundwater samples as illustrated in fig 7 in the northern part of the plain sampling sites p10 and p13 exhibited a strong enrichment in cl as a result of a saline source influence in this part of the plain the groundwater level remained above the absolute sea water level throughout the year matiatos et al 2014b while the ri values did not reach their maximum during the summer season thus it can be concluded that the aquifer became enriched in cl not because of seawater intrusion but due to mixing with the brackish deeper aquifer pisinaras et al 2014 4 5 1 cation exchange processes the cation exchange reaction taking place during freshening of the aquifer is given by appelo and postma 1993 3 1 2 ca 2 na x 1 2 ca x 2 na when saline water intrudes on a freshwater aquifer na replaces part of the ca on the solid surface as demonstrated in the following equation 4 na 1 2 ca x 2 na x 1 2 ca 2 where x represents the cation exchanger to investigate cation exchange processes a scatter plot of na versus ca was constructed fig 8 inside and outside the deltaic plain river water samples exhibited constant calcium and sodium values except for river water at site gp which showed a strong increase of sodium concentration 8 7 mmol l and a decrease in calcium concentration 2 5 mmo l in november 2012 which was attributed to recharge from groundwater influenced by cation exchange processes in the northern part of the deltaic plain groundwater at site p13 showed excess sodium in october 2012 resulting in a water type of na hco3 which was attributed to cation exchange reactions during freshening of the aquifer calcium concentration at sampling site p15 increased from october 2012 to january 2013 but sodium concentration decreased resulting in a ca cl water type indicative of cation exchange reactions due to mixing with saline water the na hco3 water of site p4 of october 2012 showed that freshwater is flushing saline water from the aquifer which results in uptake of ca and mg by the exchangers with release of na as illustrated in fig 8 the groundwater samples showed a decrease in calcium concentration with respect to sodium concentration and thus ion exchange reactions occur 4 5 2 carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering the reaction of calcite and dolomite with water and carbon dioxide can be written as follows appelo and postma 1993 5 caco 3 calcite h 2 o co 2 ca 2 2 hco 3 6 camg co 3 2 dolomite 2 h 2 o 2 co 2 ca 2 mg 2 4 hco 3 the mg ca mg ratio can provide evidence of the carbonate dissolution most samples showed a mg ca mg ratio below 0 5 indicating a limestone dolomite dissolution process hounslow 1995 when calcite and dolomite dissolve according to reactions 5 and 6 respectively the molar proportions of ca hco3 and ca mg hco3 are expected to be linear with a slope of 0 5 as illustrated in fig 9 a calcite dissolution alone cannot explain the high hco3 concentrations surface and groundwater samples that plotted close to the ca mg 0 5 hco3 line indicated that dolomite could explain the excess hco3 and enrichment in mg fig 9b all water samples were super saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite except for the samples collected from boreholes p2 p7 p15 and p18 during april and july 2013 and the spring water sample of site pe75 collected during april 2013 the water samples that plotted above the theoretical line of dolomite dissolution were highly enriched in calcium and magnesium in relation to bicarbonate ca mg hco3 0 5 mg enrichment could be attributed to silicate weathering the plot of ca mg vs hco3 so4 confirms that ca and mg enrichment is also due to the weathering of silicates fig 9c temporal variations of groundwater hydrochemistry were related to the fluctuations of water table levels low ec and ionic concentrations were observed during high recharge whereas the increased residence time during low flow recharge produced higher ec and ionic concentrations although the solubility of calcite and dolomite are similar the kinetics of dolomite dissolution is slower than calcite plummer et al 1978 thus increased dolomite dissolution and higher mg concentrations are expected during low flow recharge as depicted in fig 9d in the central part of the plain boreholes p7 and p19 were enriched in mg when groundwater level is lower low recharge when the groundwater level raised the ec and mg concentrations decreased due to the mixing of groundwater with fresh water 4 5 3 dedolomitization processes the high ca mg hco3 ratio 0 5 can be attributed to the depletion of water samples in bicarbonates due to dedolomitization processes triggered by eberts and george 2000 1 dissolution reactions with carbonate minerals and gypsum or and 2 sulphuric acid neutralization which involves dissolution of carbonate minerals with sulphuric acid generated by the oxidation of pyrite all samples showed a ca ca so4 ratio higher than 0 5 indicating that the calcium source was probably not gypsum hounslow 1995 moreover gypsum presence in the neogene sediments of the deltaic plain is not reported by other researchers katsikatsos and migiros 1982 thus a dedolomitization model due to gypsum cannot explain the bicarbonate depletion sulphide minerals mainly pyrite have been observed in the amphibolites schists and prasinites of the metamorphic ophiolites katsikatsos and migiros 1982 therefore dedolomitization due to pyrite oxidation was a possible source of bicarbonate depletion on a plot of ca mg vs so4 0 5hco3 the dedolomitization reaction yields a straight line with slope 1 fig 10 a the groundwater samples plotted close to the dedolomitization line however during a dedolomitization process the ca mg so4 ratio is expected to be close to unity and the saturation indices with respect to calcite and dolomite to show saturation and undersaturation accordingly hounslow 1995 most of the samples showed a ca mg so4 ratio higher than 5 and supersaturation with respect to dolomite sidolomite 0 indicating that dedolomitization is not likely to occur fig 10b the samples that exhibited undersaturation with respect to dolomite sidolomite 0 showed ratios of ca mg so4 away from 1 so such a process cannot explain the decreased bicarbonate values in the water samples the presence of sulphates in the water samples was examined by calculating the so4 cl ratio a marine origin of sulphates is indicated by a ratio of 0 05 as mmol l hem 1985 most samples showed an excess of so4 so4 cl above 0 05 mmol l compared to the composition of sea water so non marine sources were considered such as dedolomitization or agricultural activities as discussed earlier it is not likely that dedolomitization processes are taking place in the region so agricultural activities are considered an additional source of so4 on the contrary samples in the northern part of the deltaic plain e g p10 p13 that showed so4 cl below 0 05 mmol l could be due to removal of so4 or supply of non marine cl e g from the brackish deeper aquifer 4 6 multivariate statistical analysis the results of pca revealed that the contribution of the first five components component 1 component 2 component 3 component 4 and component 5 was 34 5 14 5 10 3 9 5 and 8 1 respectively accounting for approximately 77 of the total geochemical variance table 8 of supplementary material the loadings of the varimax rotated component matrix for the five component model are presented in fig 11 where evidently the first factor was generally more correlated with the variables than the second and third component 1 exhibited high loadings for ec na k cl and mg which are derived from saline sources either from seawater influence or evaporation or interaction with saline components of the deeper aquifer hence component 1 was interpreted as the salinity factor component 2 was defined as the water silicate rocks interaction factor because of the high loadings of fe zn and the moderate loadings of mn this factor was associated with the dissolution of silicate minerals bearing these trace elements the geological setting of the plain is partly composed of metamorphic formations e g shales and ophiolites hosting silicate minerals such as pyroxenes feldspars mica olivine and pyrite katsikatsos and migiros 1982 although silicate weathering is a very slow process it seems to be important in places component 3 was interpreted as the hardness factor because of its moderate positive loadings in ca and hco3 which can be associated with calcite dissolution the presence of carbonate formations in the study area supports the current interpretation the weak correlation with na can be explained by the occurrence of cation exchange processes as discussed earlier component 4 was interpreted as nitrogen pollution since no3 showed the highest loading to further investigate nitrogen pollution pca was applied only to groundwater samples the results of the second pca showed the nitrogen pollution factor exhibited even higher loadings in no3 0 720 and mn 0 788 indicating a stronger negative correlation between the two elements which could support the occurrence of denitrification processes under anaerobic hypoxic anoxic conditions bacteria remove oxygen from nitrate denitrification to produce n2 gas and also from manganese and iron oxides thereby increasing the concentration of dissolved manganese and iron in groundwater and a decrease in nitrates güler et al 2012 kendall 1998 to explore the possible occurrence of denitrification the relationship between no3 and mn was investigated the surface water and the spring water samples retained very low and constant mn concentrations indicating that denitrification is not prevalent the groundwater samples showed the highest mn concentrations with a trend of increase relative to decreasing nitrate concentrations there was no correlation between nitrates and iron however the measured iron concentration refers to the total dissolved iron and not to fe2 which is released during a denitrification process therefore it was assumed that denitrification is occurring at a limited extent however additional measurements e g fe2 dissolved oxygen n isotopes are required to confirm the occurrence of the denitrification process the increased dissolved manganese concentrations in most boreholes can originate from minerals such as pyrolusite but no such minerals have been identified in the region based on the literature review of the geological setting component 5 is interpreted by high loadings of so4 and mn that could be attributed either to dedolomitization processes or to increased agricultural input dedolomitization was not confirmed from the correlations between the hydrochemical variables as discussed earlier so agricultural influence should be considered as additional source of so4 and mn enrichment manganese fertilizer mnso4 is mainly used as feed additive and catalyst of synthesizing chlorophyll for plants and is easily soluble in water therefore component 5 can be defined as the non n related artificial fertilizers factor during the pca procedure scores for each water sample which represent the influence of each factor on the samples were calculated fig 11 in the northern part of the plain sampling sites p10 and p13 showed the highest scores on component 1 indicating that they are characterized by high salinity content these sampling sites were characterized by a na cl water type sampling sites p3 p4 p7 p10 and p19 showed the highest positive scores on component 2 suggesting fe zn and mn enrichment from water rock interaction the highest positive scores for component 3 which reflects high content in ca na and hco3 were observed outside and inside the deltaic plain p13 p15 ge75 pe75 gp and pa which showed the highest concentrations in calcium and sodium and were characterized by a ca hco3 or a na hco3 water type the p13 sampling site showed two water types during the sampling campaigns na hco3 and na cl which justifies the high scores on component 1 and component 3 the p2 p3 p10 p11 and p15 sampling sites showed the highest scores on component 4 indicating that they are enriched in nitrates due to agricultural activities and domestic effluents many samples p4 p7 p10 p12 p15 p18 p19 p22 exhibited high positive scores on component 5 suggesting that the application of non n related artificial fertilizers are contaminating the aquifer 4 7 comparison with river deltas worldwide during the last years numerous studies and monitoring networks have reported the occurrence of contaminants especially of nitrate and chloride ions in river water and groundwater of deltaic plains the european environmental agency eea has launched in 2015 an interactive map that shows the mean annual concentration of nitrates observed in river monitoring stations and reported by eea member countries via wise water quality in transitional coastal and marine waters database the nitrate concentration values of 2012 referring to the major river deltas in europe were derived from this database so to compare them with the results of the current study in addition a literature review of case studies concerning shallow aquifers hosted in river deltas worldwide and impacted by anthropogenic activities was performed to identify differences between the aquifers including the shallow aquifer examined in this paper the review included only studies which applied multivariate statistical techniques to identify hydrogeochemical processes and factors to define the groundwater quality the ranges minimum and maximum values and the mean concentrations of nitrate as no3 chloride as well as the pca findings reported for aquifers hosted in deltaic environments including the current study are summarized in table 1 according to eea 2015 no3 concentrations in european rivers flowing in a deltaic environment exhibit a range of mean annual values from 0 to 16 mg l without exceeding the threshold value of 50 mg l set for water intended for human consumption directive 98 83 ec pinios river showed low nitrate concentrations mean no3 3 0 mg l indicating that the nitrogen load in the river is relatively low however the temporal variation of nitrate concentration 0 7 9 mg l shows that the river receives different nitrogen loads throughout the year and thus the nitrate concentration in the river may vary nitrate concentrations in shallow aquifers hosted in deltaic environments exhibit a wide range of values ranging from 0 to 201 mg l as no3 the higher concentrations were reported for the eastern niger river delta in nigeria and nile river delta in egypt due to agricultural activities and wastewater leakages amadi et al 2012 masoud 2014 in the latter nitrate concentrations locally exceeded 50 mg l due to the intensive application of manure and chemical fertilizers and to insufficient sewage facilities masoud 2014 the extent of nitrogen pollution in the groundwater of the pinios river deltaic plain is relatively low mean no3 6 2 mg l compared to other case studies chloride concentrations of groundwater in river deltas range between 2 9 and 12186 mg l masoud 2014 reported extremely high chloride concentrations in the nile river delta due to intensive seawater influence especially at the mouth of the river making the groundwater unsuitable even for irrigation purposes in the cauvery river delta the high chloride values 1000 mg l in the coastal area are attributed to over pumping in the pre monsoon period and to the tidal phenomena during the monsoon period which activate the penetration of seawater into the groundwater system through seepage jayakumar and siraz 1997 in the tarsus river delta güler et al 2012 and in the nile river delta masoud 2014 the salinization of the aquifer was due to seawater intrusion and mineral dissolution evaporites in the pinios river delta seawater intrusion is limited at the mouth area and the high chloride concentrations 1000 mg l observed in the northern part of the plain are attributed to the interaction with the brackish deeper aquifer in most hydrogeochemical studies carried out in deltaic areas the factors controlling groundwater chemistry are similar to the ones identified in the present study i e water rock interaction seawater intrusion and nitrogen pollution in most case studies e g amadi et al 2012 güler et al 2012 olobaniyi and owoyemi 2006 mineral dissolution e g calcite silicates gypsum and ion exchange processes are reported as the main processes releasing major ions such as ca mg na k and hco3 in the groundwater in the nile river delta masoud 2014 the high calcium and phosphate concentrations were attributed to the application of calcium and phosphate fertilizers for agricultural purposes by applying pca techniques groundwater salinity has been shown to be not always related to over pumping el arabi et al 2013 masoud 2014 but also to natural factors such as storm surges and high tidal events jayakumar and siraz 1997 olobaniyi and owoyemi 2006 or to the interaction with deeper aquifers of higher salinity current study moreover the spatial distribution of the factor scores extracted from pca has shown that nitrate pollution originated not only from agricultural activities but also from wastewater treatment plants septic systems and urban wastes e g masoud 2014 phung et al 2015 by using pca techniques the presence of high so4 concentrations in the groundwater of the western niger delta has been attributed to the dissolution of minerals such as pyrite and to contamination by petroleum refinery wastes and heavy vehicular activities olobaniyi and owoyemi 2006 moreover heavy metal pollution has been attributed to natural background e g chromium minerals but also to the release of wastes from chemical industries and petroleum hydrocarbon storage facilities and the disposal of hazardous wastes such as batteries electronics and machine scraps e g amadi et al 2012 güler et al 2012 5 conclusions this work presents a regional hydrogeochemical study of the deltaic plain of river pinios central greece an evaluation of the water quality status and the identification of the main geochemical processes controlling water hydrochemistry and its spatial evolution the river is primarily recharged by groundwater influxes from the surrounding mountains and secondarily by precipitation and the shallow aquifer inside the deltaic plain the results of the water quality index classification showed that spring water and river water in the deltaic plain are characterized by high quality rankings in the river mouth area the water quality degradation was mostly attributed to limited seawater intrusion which classifies most of the mouth area water samples into the moderate water quality class calcite and dolomite dissolution cation exchange processes and silicate weathering control the groundwater chemistry locally high concentrations of na and cl were attributed to the interaction of the shallow aquifer with a deeper brackish aquifer especially in the northern part of the delta agricultural activities and point sources of contamination introduce n pollutants into the subsurface through leaching this deterioration was reflected in the water quality index as most of the samples from that area were classified as of good to poor water quality five factors explained 77 of the total variance in the water quality component 1 was the salinity factor due to seawater influence evaporation and interaction with saline components of the deeper aquifer component 2 was the water silicate rocks interaction factor and related to the dissolution of silicate minerals bearing fe zn and mn component 3 was the hardness factor and was associated with calcite dissolution and cation exchange processes component 4 was the nitrogen pollution factor whereas component 5 was interpreted as the non n related artificial fertilizers factor the results showed that the water quality was good compared to other river deltas worldwide but river and groundwater were susceptible to contamination especially from agricultural practices and point sources of nitrogen pollution these findings can be used by stakeholders in the application of strategies for the sustainable management of the water resources in the deltaic plain acknowledgements a significant part of this work was financially

7274,river deltas sustain important ecosystems with rich biodiversity and large biomass as well as human populations via the availability of water and food sources anthropogenic activities such as urbanization tourism and agriculture may pose threats to river deltas the knowledge of the factors controlling the regional water quality regime in these areas is important for planning sustainable use and management of the water resources here hydrochemical methods and multivariate statistical techniques were combined to investigate the shallow aquifer of the pinios river thessaly deltaic plain with respect to water quality hydrogeochemical evolution and interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies water quality assessment indicated that most of the river and groundwater samples fully comply with the criteria set by the drinking water directive 98 83 ec the river is recharged mainly from springs of the tempi valley and the shallow aquifer and to a lesser degree from precipitation throughout the year the hydrogeochemical characteristics indicated a cation ca mg and na bicarbonate water type which evolves to calcium chloride sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride water type in the northern part of the delta calcite and dolomite dissolution determined the major ion chemistry but other processes such as silicate weathering and cation exchange reactions also contributed in the northern part of the plain the interaction with the deeper aquifer enriched the shallow aquifer with na and cl ions principal component analysis showed that five components pcs explain 77 of the total variance of water quality parameters these are 1 salinity 2 water silicate rocks interaction 3 hardness due to calcite dissolution and cation exchange processes 4 nitrogen pollution and 5 non n related artificial fertilizers this study demonstrated that the variation of water hydrochemistry in the deltaic plain could be attributed to natural and anthropogenic processes

these areas account for only 5 of the global land mass river deltas are areas of ecological and societal value because they host fresh surface and groundwater resources sustain biodiversity and provide large flat areas for agricultural and urban uses these multiple conflicting human activities apply significant pressures and risks to deltaic and coastal ecosystems kuenzer and renaud 2012 the status of fresh surface water and groundwater quality in the deltaic areas is affected by natural factors such as the high lateral and vertical granulometric variability of deltaic depositional sequences the hydrogeochemical reactions between water and sediments and the surface water groundwater interactions which modify the hydrochemical characteristics of the surface water and groundwater resources on a spatial and temporal basis brunke and gonser 1997 ezzy et al 2006 menció and mas pla 2008 torres rondon et al 2013 seasonal variations of precipitation river discharge and water table level can cause a reduced replenishment of the water system leading to limited availability of water groundwater over extraction can trigger sea water intrusion causing a degradation of the deltaic freshwater quality and shortage of drinking water supplies nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural practices can contaminate aquifers and surface waters via infiltration and direct runoff respectively barrett et al 2002 kim et al 2009 mondal et al 2011 sarma et al 1982 the detailed knowledge of the factors controlling the surface water and groundwater quality is recognized as critical for water resources management especially in the semi arid southern coastal parts of europe i e mediterranean coast conventional hydrochemical methods of data analysis combined with multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis pca are widely applied in surface and groundwater studies to identify the natural and anthropogenic factors that control water

events indicative of the gradual geomorphological evolution of the plain over the years karymbalis et al 2016 the delta has a mediterranean climate with mean annual precipitation and air temperature of 800 mm and 14 0 c respectively matiatos et al 2014b 2 1 geological and hydrogeological setting the largest part of the pinios river deltaic plain comprises alluvial sediments e g sands clays silts of holocene age whereas sand dunes and coastal sediments mostly sands prevail along coastal areas fig 1 the western and northern boundaries of the deltaic plain comprise neogene deposits marls and conglomerates and pleistocene formations debris cones screes and fluvial terraces whereas the rest of the plain is surrounded by metamorphic rocks such as crystalline limestones and dolomites shales and ophiolites katsikatsos and migiros 1982 this study focuses on the shallow aquifer system hosted in the alluvial sediments which are composed mostly of coarse grained sands with clays and silts located mainly in the broader river mouth area on the basis of the vertical distribution of electrical resistance the aquifer is confined below 5 10 m depth alexopoulos et al 2014 the aquifer is recharged through i the debris cones and screes of pleistocene age at the inland limit of deltaic plain where the pinios river exits the tempi valley and enters the deltaic plain ii precipitation and iii lateral less permeable formations such as the neogene sediments previous studies e g matiatos et al 2014b panagopoulos et al 2001 show hydraulic interaction between the river and the aquifer especially in the central part of the plain depending on location season and groundwater level fluctuation land use in the deltaic plain is mainly agricultural kiwi olive trees corn sunflower cotton plantations but there are areas for animal grazing irrigational water is obtained by groundwater and river water extraction potable water demand is met by groundwater pumped from boreholes outside the deltaic plain groundwater inside the plain is mostly extracted from shallow boreholes with suction pumps 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical procedures groundwater levels and river water discharge were measured monthly from october 2012 to september 2013 river water discharge in m3 s was measured at two river sites one just before the river enters the delta area site ga and one close to the river mouth site gp see fig 1 using a current flow meter valeport bfm 001 002 groundwater levels were measured in 13 boreholes with a contact gauge ott kl 010 rtk gps was used to map the position of the boreholes to an accuracy of 10 mm monthly rainfall data were obtained from meteorological stations davis vantage pro2 plus at stomio rs and at palaiopyrgos rp within the deltaic plain at an altitude of 9 m and 6 5 m respectively groundwater samples from 13 boreholes were collected in different seasons october 2012 january 2013 april 2013 and july 2013 two springs were sampled on monthly basis for the first year 2012 2013 and on seasonal basis for the second year 2013 2014 the same sampling pattern was followed for river water samples collected from 7 sampling stations in and out of the deltaic plain river water samples were collected by lowering horizontal sampling bottles from bridges both groundwater and surface water samples were collected in pre cleaned high density polyethylene 2 l bottles in situ parameters temperature ph electrical conductivity were measured by means of an ysi 63 multi parameter instrument all water samples were field filtered through 8 μm and

pre concentration of an aliquot of filtered water sample in a chelex 100 resin details about the detection limits and the certified references used to check the accuracy can be found in the supplementary material total dissolved solids tds were not measured in situ but calculated from electrical conductivity ec to be used in the bivariate plots some results from river stations were

mn and zn were used procedural blanks duplicate samples and certified reference materials were analysed for quality control purposes in all chemical methods all hydrochemical analyses were checked for electro neutrality below 5 the per cent relative standard deviation rsd from the duplicate analysis ranged between 1 and 10 and recoveries from the reference materials ranged between 80 and 115 depending on the complexity of each analytical procedure concentrations below the detection limit were replaced by the detection limit the methodologies followed for sampling chemical analysis and data preparation for statistical analysis are summarized in fig s1 of supplementary material 3 2 saturation index using phreeqc parkhurst 1995 calcite and dolomite saturation indices were calculated for water samples collected from boreholes and springs the calcite and dolomite saturation indices were defined by appelo and postma 1993 1 calcite saturation index log ca 2 co 3 2 k calcite 2 dolomite saturation index log ca 2 mg 2 co 3 2 k dolomite where k values are the thermodynamic solubility product constants and denotes activities of ions 3 3 multivariate statistical analysis although a large number of parameters were measured for each water sample dependent and redundant parameters e g tds were excluded from the dataset to optimize the multivariate statistical analysis based on the approach of cloutier et al 2008 after data processing the following parameters were retained ph ec ca mg na k hco3 so4 cl no3 zn fe and mn multivariate statistical analysis was applied on normalized log transformed data to address the wide range of concentrations especially between the major and the minor elements davis 1986 the dataset of thirteen variables ph ec ca mg na k hco3 so4 cl no3 zn fe and mn was used for pca fig s1 of supplementary material before applying pca a correlation matrix of the selected variables was created and inspected to examine if there was an appropriate number of correlations pearson correlation coefficient pcc above 0 3 between the variables tabachnick and fidell 2006 two statistical tests the barlett test of sphericity p below 0 05 and the kaiser meyer olkin kmo measure of sampling adequacy msa above 0 5 were performed to examine the correlation between the variables hinton et al 2014 to extract the principal components or factors and to calculate the eigenvectors the eigenvalues and the loadings the kaiser criterion was applied for which only the components with eigenvalues greater than 1 were retained kaiser 1958 to maximize the variance of the principal axes the varimax normalized rotation was applied the terms strong moderate and weak as applied to principal component loadings refer to absolute loading values of 0 75 0 75 0 5 and 0 5 0 3 respectively 3 4 water quality index to characterize the quality of the various water types in the pinios river deltaic plain a wqi was calculated for each sample the aim was to provide a five class scoring in line with the water framework directive wfd quality classification 2000 60 ec high good moderate poor and bad to characterize water quality in the study area with greater detail compared to the dual good failing to achieve good scheme which is currently used in wfd reporting of chemical status the equation proposed by debels et al 2005 to describe water pollution of a river system affected by agricultural activities was used for the calculation of the wqi for each sample wqi i 1 n c i p i i 1 n p i where n represents the total number of parameters used for the calculation ci is the normalized concentration of parameter i and pi is the weight of the parameter the chemical parameters normalization factors weights and parameter value ranges are presented in table 1 of the supplementary material the chemical parameters considered in the calculations were ec na cl ca no3 so4 and mn as the most representative of the five factors extracted from the pca analysis with the addition of nh4 no2 to include all parameters for which quality standards are set by the drinking water directive 98 83 ec the weights were set from 1 to 4 loukas 2010 şener et al 2017 since salinization and nitrate pollution were considered the most important threats to the deltaic system a weight of 4 was assigned to no3 no2 nh4 ec na and cl manganese so4 and ca were assigned the weights 3 3 and 1 respectively the variables were normalized transformed to one of four corresponding scores 0 25 50 100 table 1 of supplementary material the normalization factors used to transform each measured concentration were limited to four 0 25 50 100 in contrast to eleven 0 100 incremented by 10 used by debels et al 2005 because this was dictated by the concentration ranges set by the european legislation limits and other water quality criteria loukas 2010 see supplementary material for the mathematical calculation of increments the classification scale was modified by debels et al 2005 taking into account that spring waters produced wqi values ranging from 100 to 85 this range was set as the high quality class to set the last class bad 25 a mock calculation was performed with a hypothetical sample that scored 25 for all parameters for the three intermediate classes that needed to be set in order to comply with wfd categories it was decided that the scoring range of 25 84 be equidistantly incremented by 20 units the intermediate classes were set as good 84 65 moderate 64 45 poor 44 25 for higher resolution between samples of the same class the three intermediate classes were further subdivided into sub classes a and b i e good a good b moderate a moderate b and poor a poor b the higher a values corresponded to samples closer to the immediately better classification class and the lower b values to the next worst 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological conditions the temporal variation of groundwater levels in the middle part of the deltaic plain e g p7 p19 fig 2 a follows roughly the seasonal patterns of precipitation with higher water table values observed during the wet season and the lower ones during the dry season in the beginning of the dry season october november water levels of the shallow aquifer were relatively low increased until february and dropped gradually to reach the lowest values during the end of the dry season august september on the other hand the groundwater level in borehole p22 in the western part of the plain remained constant throughout the year indicating that rainfall recharge played a secondary role in this area of the delta here shallow aquifer recharge seems to be related to a lateral groundwater supply from the surrounding mountainous area river water discharge variation patterns did not closely follow the high and low peaks of precipitation on a monthly basis indicating that the river was also recharged from different sources springs and groundwater both river discharge and groundwater levels followed roughly the same temporal pattern fig 2a indicating that there is interaction between the two both reached their highest peak in february and showed a smooth temporal variation with higher values in the wet season and lower values in the dry season during the dry season a temporary dirt barrier bar1 in fig 1 is emplaced to divert part of the river water flow towards an irrigation canal in the se from june to september river water discharge downstream site gp was higher than upstream site ga despite the diversion of river flow in may the comparison of water levels in the river channel at gp to water levels in the nearby boreholes g3 and g7 fig 2b showed that groundwater levels were constantly higher than the water in the river channel indicating that in this part of plain there is an inflow of water from the aquifer to the river during the dry period 4 2 hydrochemistry of the deltaic plain tables 2 5 of the supplementary material summarize the mean minimum and maximum values and the standard deviation of the 19 hydrochemical variables determined from the spring groundwater and river water samples 4 2 1 river water the data of river water upstream of the mouth were slightly alkaline with ph values in the range of 6 8 8 6 water temperature and ec ranged from 9 2 to 29 9 c and from 349 to 771 μs cm respectively river water samples showed lowest mineralization compared to other water samples by the low ec values mean 563 μs cm and tds values mean 343 ppm on average ca mg na and k accounted for 31 5 12 3 11 6 and 0 8 respectively of the total dissolved cationic charge tz na k 2 mg 2ca in meq l of the analysed river water samples the cation concentrations followed the order of ca na mg k at sampling sites gg and gp and ca mg na k at sampling sites ge75 and ga sodium mean 0 9 mmol l was higher than cl mean 0 5 mmol l indicating that salt is not the sole na source in river waters bicarbonate was the major anion accounting for approximately 88 of the total dissolved anionic charge tz cl 2so4 hco3 no3 in meq l the anion concentrations followed the order hco3 cl so4 no3 in river sampling sites gg ge75 ga and gp electrical conductivity as well as the concentrations of k na mg and cl were higher during the dry period than the wet period which can be attributed to evaporation and or recharge from groundwater e g during baseflow conditions no3 concentrations ranged from 0 to 7 5 mg l less than the 50 mg l acceptable concentration for human consumption directive 98 83 ec the nitrate values increased during the wet period as a result of increased precipitation and subsequent agricultural runoff at the mouth area downstream of the second river barrier bar2 in fig 1 river water at sites ekv1 ekv4 had temperatures between 8 1 and 16 8 c and ec between 481 and 1240 μs cm water chemistry was dominated by hco3 and cl accounting for 77 6 and 13 9 of the tz respectively the molar anion concentrations in the mouth area were hco3 cl so4 no3 ca mg na and k accounted for 29 3 13 0 14 5 and 0 9 of the tz of the river water respectively the molar cation concentrations followed the order ca na mg k no3 concentrations ranged from 1 1 to 7 9 mg l 4 2 2 spring water spring water samples from sites pa and pe75 were neutral to slightly alkaline with an average ph value of 7 6 the temperature of spring waters ranged from 13 3 to 20 8 c and ec ranged from 448 to 851 μs cm with an average value of 684 μs cm the mineralization of the spring water samples was attributed to water rock interaction on average ca mg na and k account for 38 3 9 9 3 3 and 0 3 of the tz of the spring water samples respectively cation concentrations followed the same order and levels as those of the river water sampling sites ge75 and ga indicating recharge of the river by springs the dominant anion hco3 accounted for approximately 95 of the tz in the spring waters the molar anion concentrations of the spring waters followed an order of hco3 cl so4 no3 the ionic concentrations of the spring waters were similar to the river waters at sampling sites ge75 and ga nitrates and nitrites were below the threshold values of 50 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively directive 98 83 ec 4 2 3 groundwater shallow aquifer the ph of groundwater ranged from 6 9 to 8 2 with ec values between 230 and 9180 μs cm and a mean value of 1365 μs cm among the different categories of water samples groundwater had the highest ec values and concentrations of total dissolved solids tds mean 874 mg l the highest mean ec values were in the northern part of the plain p10 5849 μs cm p13 1868 μs cm p15 1472 μs cm p19 1067 μs cm and p12 994 μs cm theses elevated values indicated the influence of saline water in this part of the plain calcium mg na and k accounted for 15 1 13 4 41 2 and 2 0 of the tz of the groundwater respectively however after excluding brackish samples at sites p10 and p13 ca mg na and k accounted for 21 7 19 2 15 3 and 2 8 of the tz of the groundwater respectively molar cation concentrations followed the order ca mg na k and hco3 was the dominant anion accounting for 78 5 of the tz the anion concentrations of groundwater followed the order hco3 cl so4 no3 of the major ions so4 was below the threshold value of 250 mg l set by the eu directive for drinking water sodium exceeded the value of 200 mg l only in borehole p10 while cl exceeded the eu threshold value of 250 mg l in 12 of the samples nitrates and nitrites were generally below the eu threshold values of 50 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively directive 98 83 ec whereas ammonium exceeded the eu threshold value of 0 5 mg l in 38 of samples the highest no3 from 10 9 to 31 8 mg l and nh4 from 0 8 to 89 7 mg l concentrations were observed in the western e g p2 p4 p22 and northern part of the plain e g p10 p11 p15 the higher no3 and nh4 concentrations in groundwater compared to river water signifies that the aquifer is contaminated not only from agricultural runoff but also from point sources of contamination in places e g domestic effluents at the built up coastal area e g p11 the concentrations of fe mn and zn showed the highest values in the groundwater samples tables 2 5 of the supplementary material probably originating from natural weathering of iron manganese and zinc bearing minerals and rocks only manganese concentration exceeded the eu threshold value of 50 μg l in 56 of the samples max 826 μg l which could be attributed to an additional source of mn such as the application of mn enriched fertilizers see also section 4 6 4 3 water quality index the water quality index results and classification for all sampling sites and periods are found in tables 6 and 7 of the supplementary material a spatial summation of the wqi results is presented in fig 3 the classification of the groundwater samples showed that 13 of the samples were classified as high quality 73 as good quality and the remaining 14 as moderate 8 and poor 6 quality waters furthermore 63 of the good quality groundwater samples were classified into the subcategory of good b water quality which is closer to the moderate water quality class in the northern part of the plain groundwater samples showed a poor b p10 to moderate p13 water quality no seasonal variation was observed on the wqis of the groundwater samples considering the riverine water body of 52 river water samples 11 were classified as of good a water quality and the remaining as of high water quality the upstream river sampling site gg located outside the deltaic plain had a good quality which was attributed to enrichment with contaminants originating from the agricultural plain of thessaly the city of larisa and its industrial zone the contribution of spring waters to the river as it enters the plain resulted in the classification of the river water samples at site ge75 as of high quality in the central part of the plain 82 of the water samples of sampling site gp were classified as of high quality whereas 50 of the river water samples from the mouth area were classified as of good 29 as of high and 21 as of moderate water quality the deterioration of the water quality in the mouth area samples is limited and due to seawater intrusion 4 4 hydrochemical evolution water types were defined for all samples river mouth area springs groundwater using cations and anions plotted on a piper diagram piper 1944 six water types are shown in fig 4 since it was not possible to discriminate the ca mg hco3 ca hco3 and mg hco3 water types a ca mg ratio and a ternary ca mg cl diagram were used as discussed later river water samples upstream and at the mouth area showed mainly a ca mg hco3 water type two river water samples one collected inside the plain site gp in november 2012 and one outside the plain site gg in september 2013 as well as a groundwater sample collected from site p13 in november 2012 showed a na hco3 water type the river water samples at the mouth area were taken only during the wet period and were not enriched in cl mean 39 4 mg l except sampling site ekv1 which showed a na cl type in october 2013 due to increased cl concentration 225 mg l because of seawater intrusion spring water samples showed a ca hco3 water type throughout the year indicating a constant mineralization source groundwater samples were mainly concentrated in the water types ca mg hco3 ca hco3 and mg hco3 the samples close to the river e g p2 p3 and p7 showed the same water type ca mg hco3 as the river samples of site gp indicating possible interaction between the two water bodies in the northern part of the plain groundwater quality evolved locally e g p10 p13 to a na cl water type indicating enrichment in na and cl and influence from a saline source borehole p15 showed a hydrochemical evolution to a ca cl water type indicating occurrence of hydrogeochemical processes as discussed later in the western part of the plain borehole p4 exhibits a nh4 hco3 water type due to the extremely high nh4 concentration mean 60 mg l attributed to a point source of agricultural pollution however after removing the nh4 contamination the water varied between the ca mg hco3 and the mg hco3 water type throughout the year as illustrated in fig 5 as the river flows towards the river mouth area the ca mg ratio changed because of interaction with spring waters and groundwater outside the plain sampling site gg showed a mean ca mg ratio of 1 8 which increased to 2 3 at the river sampling site ga as a result of mixing with the spring waters of ag paraskevi site pa which showed a mean ca mg ratio of 3 0 before entering the deltaic plain the river is recharged by the spring waters near rapsani site pe75 mean ca mg 4 9 as confirmed by the increase of the ca mg ratio at the river water sampling site ge75 mean ca mg 3 9 as the river crosses the deltaic plain the mean ca mg ratio decreased to 2 8 at the river water sampling site gp indicating water enrichment in mg probably due to the interaction with groundwater mean ca mg 1 5 at sites ekv1 ekv4 the river water samples exhibited a mean ca mg ratio 2 1 2 4 like that of sampling site gp 2 8 groundwater samples showed no particular pattern in terms of ca mg ratio the groundwater samples close to the river e g p2 p3 and p7 showed similar ca mg ratios mean ca mg 2 0 to the river samples of site gp mean ca mg 2 8 indicating possible interaction between the river and the aquifer in the western part of the plain the p2 sampling site exhibited the highest ca mg ratio 3 0 which was close the ca mg ratio of the river site ge75 3 9 suggesting that interaction between the river and the aquifer is likely to occur in the northern part of the plain groundwater shows a high variation in terms of ca mg ratio this is because the aquifer in this area is influenced by saline sources with low ca mg ratios and high cl concentration for example the p10 sampling site exhibited the highest mean ec value 3743 μs cm a mean ca mg of 0 7 and a mean cl value of 1297 mg l 4 5 water rock interactions and mixing gibbs 1970 proposed that the tds versus na na ca can be used to explore the relative importance of the major natural mechanisms controlling water chemistry as illustrated in fig 6 a and b the samples collected from the river the springs and the boreholes fell mainly in the domain influenced by geology only a few groundwater samples in the northern part of the plain e g p10 underwent some mixing with saline water to further investigate the salinization effect the revelle 1941 index ri cl hco3 co3 was used fig 7 river water samples upstream of the mouth area showed a ri ranging between 0 1 and 1 1 representing mainly fresh water except for the river water samples of site gg which became slightly brackish in the summer of 2013 the river site gg lies outside the deltaic plain thus seawater intrusion cannot explain the increase in cl concentration which was probably due to evaporation phenomena combined with low river flow at the river mouth area the water exhibited low ri values 0 5 indicating no brackishness due to seawater intrusion in the wet period however in october 2013 the site ekv1 showed a ri of 1 0 which indicated a seawater intrusion influence most of the groundwater samples 77 1 showed a ri 0 5 fewer groundwater samples 14 6 collected mostly in the dry season fell in the slightly brackish water domain moderately or very brackish waters accounted for 8 3 of the groundwater samples as illustrated in fig 7 in the northern part of the plain sampling sites p10 and p13 exhibited a strong enrichment in cl as a result of a saline source influence in this part of the plain the groundwater level remained above the absolute sea water level throughout the year matiatos et al 2014b while the ri values did not reach their maximum during the summer season thus it can be concluded that the aquifer became enriched in cl not because of seawater intrusion but due to mixing with the brackish deeper aquifer pisinaras et al 2014 4 5 1 cation exchange processes the cation exchange reaction taking place during freshening of the aquifer is given by appelo and postma 1993 3 1 2 ca 2 na x 1 2 ca x 2 na when saline water intrudes on a freshwater aquifer na replaces part of the ca on the solid surface as demonstrated in the following equation 4 na 1 2 ca x 2 na x 1 2 ca 2 where x represents the cation exchanger to investigate cation exchange processes a scatter plot of na versus ca was constructed fig 8 inside and outside the deltaic plain river water samples exhibited constant calcium and sodium values except for river water at site gp which showed a strong increase of sodium concentration 8 7 mmol l and a decrease in calcium concentration 2 5 mmo l in november 2012 which was attributed to recharge from groundwater influenced by cation exchange processes in the northern part of the deltaic plain groundwater at site p13 showed excess sodium in october 2012 resulting in a water type of na hco3 which was attributed to cation exchange reactions during freshening of the aquifer calcium concentration at sampling site p15 increased from october 2012 to january 2013 but sodium concentration decreased resulting in a ca cl water type indicative of cation exchange reactions due to mixing with saline water the na hco3 water of site p4 of october 2012 showed that freshwater is flushing saline water from the aquifer which results in uptake of ca and mg by the exchangers with release of na as illustrated in fig 8 the groundwater samples showed a decrease in calcium concentration with respect to sodium concentration and thus ion exchange reactions occur 4 5 2 carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering the reaction of calcite and dolomite with water and carbon dioxide can be written as follows appelo and postma 1993 5 caco 3 calcite h 2 o co 2 ca 2 2 hco 3 6 camg co 3 2 dolomite 2 h 2 o 2 co 2 ca 2 mg 2 4 hco 3 the mg ca mg ratio can provide evidence of the carbonate dissolution most samples showed a mg ca mg ratio below 0 5 indicating a limestone dolomite dissolution process hounslow 1995 when calcite and dolomite dissolve according to reactions 5 and 6 respectively the molar proportions of ca hco3 and ca mg hco3 are expected to be linear with a slope of 0 5 as illustrated in fig 9 a calcite dissolution alone cannot explain the high hco3 concentrations surface and groundwater samples that plotted close to the ca mg 0 5 hco3 line indicated that dolomite could explain the excess hco3 and enrichment in mg fig 9b all water samples were super saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite except for the samples collected from boreholes p2 p7 p15 and p18 during april and july 2013 and the spring water sample of site pe75 collected during april 2013 the water samples that plotted above the theoretical line of dolomite dissolution were highly enriched in calcium and magnesium in relation to bicarbonate ca mg hco3 0 5 mg enrichment could be attributed to silicate weathering the plot of ca mg vs hco3 so4 confirms that ca and mg enrichment is also due to the weathering of silicates fig 9c temporal variations of groundwater hydrochemistry were related to the fluctuations of water table levels low ec and ionic concentrations were observed during high recharge whereas the increased residence time during low flow recharge produced higher ec and ionic concentrations although the solubility of calcite and dolomite are similar the kinetics of dolomite dissolution is slower than calcite plummer et al 1978 thus increased dolomite dissolution and higher mg concentrations are expected during low flow recharge as depicted in fig 9d in the central part of the plain boreholes p7 and p19 were enriched in mg when groundwater level is lower low recharge when the groundwater level raised the ec and mg concentrations decreased due to the mixing of groundwater with fresh water 4 5 3 dedolomitization processes the high ca mg hco3 ratio 0 5 can be attributed to the depletion of water samples in bicarbonates due to dedolomitization processes triggered by eberts and george 2000 1 dissolution reactions with carbonate minerals and gypsum or and 2 sulphuric acid neutralization which involves dissolution of carbonate minerals with sulphuric acid generated by the oxidation of pyrite all samples showed a ca ca so4 ratio higher than 0 5 indicating that the calcium source was probably not gypsum hounslow 1995 moreover gypsum presence in the neogene sediments of the deltaic plain is not reported by other researchers katsikatsos and migiros 1982 thus a dedolomitization model due to gypsum cannot explain the bicarbonate depletion sulphide minerals mainly pyrite have been observed in the amphibolites schists and prasinites of the metamorphic ophiolites katsikatsos and migiros 1982 therefore dedolomitization due to pyrite oxidation was a possible source of bicarbonate depletion on a plot of ca mg vs so4 0 5hco3 the dedolomitization reaction yields a straight line with slope 1 fig 10 a the groundwater samples plotted close to the dedolomitization line however during a dedolomitization process the ca mg so4 ratio is expected to be close to unity and the saturation indices with respect to calcite and dolomite to show saturation and undersaturation accordingly hounslow 1995 most of the samples showed a ca mg so4 ratio higher than 5 and supersaturation with respect to dolomite sidolomite 0 indicating that dedolomitization is not likely to occur fig 10b the samples that exhibited undersaturation with respect to dolomite sidolomite 0 showed ratios of ca mg so4 away from 1 so such a process cannot explain the decreased bicarbonate values in the water samples the presence of sulphates in the water samples was examined by calculating the so4 cl ratio a marine origin of sulphates is indicated by a ratio of 0 05 as mmol l hem 1985 most samples showed an excess of so4 so4 cl above 0 05 mmol l compared to the composition of sea water so non marine sources were considered such as dedolomitization or agricultural activities as discussed earlier it is not likely that dedolomitization processes are taking place in the region so agricultural activities are considered an additional source of so4 on the contrary samples in the northern part of the deltaic plain e g p10 p13 that showed so4 cl below 0 05 mmol l could be due to removal of so4 or supply of non marine cl e g from the brackish deeper aquifer 4 6 multivariate statistical analysis the results of pca revealed that the contribution of the first five components component 1 component 2 component 3 component 4 and component 5 was 34 5 14 5 10 3 9 5 and 8 1 respectively accounting for approximately 77 of the total geochemical variance table 8 of supplementary material the loadings of the varimax rotated component matrix for the five component model are presented in fig 11 where evidently the first factor was generally more correlated with the variables than the second and third component 1 exhibited high loadings for ec na k cl and mg which are derived from saline sources either from seawater influence or evaporation or interaction with saline components of the deeper aquifer hence component 1 was interpreted as the salinity factor component 2 was defined as the water silicate rocks interaction factor because of the high loadings of fe zn and the moderate loadings of mn this factor was associated with the dissolution of silicate minerals bearing these trace elements the geological setting of the plain is partly composed of metamorphic formations e g shales and ophiolites hosting silicate minerals such as pyroxenes feldspars mica olivine and pyrite katsikatsos and migiros 1982 although silicate weathering is a very slow process it seems to be important in places component 3 was interpreted as the hardness factor because of its moderate positive loadings in ca and hco3 which can be associated with calcite dissolution the presence of carbonate formations in the study area supports the current interpretation the weak correlation with na can be explained by the occurrence of cation exchange processes as discussed earlier component 4 was interpreted as nitrogen pollution since no3 showed the highest loading to further investigate nitrogen pollution pca was applied only to groundwater samples the results of the second pca showed the nitrogen pollution factor exhibited even higher loadings in no3 0 720 and mn 0 788 indicating a stronger negative correlation between the two elements which could support the occurrence of denitrification processes under anaerobic hypoxic anoxic conditions bacteria remove oxygen from nitrate denitrification to produce n2 gas and also from manganese and iron oxides thereby increasing the concentration of dissolved manganese and iron in groundwater and a decrease in nitrates güler et al 2012 kendall 1998 to explore the possible occurrence of denitrification the relationship between no3 and mn was investigated the surface water and the spring water samples retained very low and constant mn concentrations indicating that denitrification is not prevalent the groundwater samples showed the highest mn concentrations with a trend of increase relative to decreasing nitrate concentrations there was no correlation between nitrates and iron however the measured iron concentration refers to the total dissolved iron and not to fe2 which is released during a denitrification process therefore it was assumed that denitrification is occurring at a limited extent however additional measurements e g fe2 dissolved oxygen n isotopes are required to confirm the occurrence of the denitrification process the increased dissolved manganese concentrations in most boreholes can originate from minerals such as pyrolusite but no such minerals have been identified in the region based on the literature review of the geological setting component 5 is interpreted by high loadings of so4 and mn that could be attributed either to dedolomitization processes or to increased agricultural input dedolomitization was not confirmed from the correlations between the hydrochemical variables as discussed earlier so agricultural influence should be considered as additional source of so4 and mn enrichment manganese fertilizer mnso4 is mainly used as feed additive and catalyst of synthesizing chlorophyll for plants and is easily soluble in water therefore component 5 can be defined as the non n related artificial fertilizers factor during the pca procedure scores for each water sample which represent the influence of each factor on the samples were calculated fig 11 in the northern part of the plain sampling sites p10 and p13 showed the highest scores on component 1 indicating that they are characterized by high salinity content these sampling sites were characterized by a na cl water type sampling sites p3 p4 p7 p10 and p19 showed the highest positive scores on component 2 suggesting fe zn and mn enrichment from water rock interaction the highest positive scores for component 3 which reflects high content in ca na and hco3 were observed outside and inside the deltaic plain p13 p15 ge75 pe75 gp and pa which showed the highest concentrations in calcium and sodium and were characterized by a ca hco3 or a na hco3 water type the p13 sampling site showed two water types during the sampling campaigns na hco3 and na cl which justifies the high scores on component 1 and component 3 the p2 p3 p10 p11 and p15 sampling sites showed the highest scores on component 4 indicating that they are enriched in nitrates due to agricultural activities and domestic effluents many samples p4 p7 p10 p12 p15 p18 p19 p22 exhibited high positive scores on component 5 suggesting that the application of non n related artificial fertilizers are contaminating the aquifer 4 7 comparison with river deltas worldwide during the last years numerous studies and monitoring networks have reported the occurrence of contaminants especially of nitrate and chloride ions in river water and groundwater of deltaic plains the european environmental agency eea has launched in 2015 an interactive map that shows the mean annual concentration of nitrates observed in river monitoring stations and reported by eea member countries via wise water quality in transitional coastal and marine waters database the nitrate concentration values of 2012 referring to the major river deltas in europe were derived from this database so to compare them with the results of the current study in addition a literature review of case studies concerning shallow aquifers hosted in river deltas worldwide and impacted by anthropogenic activities was performed to identify differences between the aquifers including the shallow aquifer examined in this paper the review included only studies which applied multivariate statistical techniques to identify hydrogeochemical processes and factors to define the groundwater quality the ranges minimum and maximum values and the mean concentrations of nitrate as no3 chloride as well as the pca findings reported for aquifers hosted in deltaic environments including the current study are summarized in table 1 according to eea 2015 no3 concentrations in european rivers flowing in a deltaic environment exhibit a range of mean annual values from 0 to 16 mg l without exceeding the threshold value of 50 mg l set for water intended for human consumption directive 98 83 ec pinios river showed low nitrate concentrations mean no3 3 0 mg l indicating that the nitrogen load in the river is relatively low however the temporal variation of nitrate concentration 0 7 9 mg l shows that the river receives different nitrogen loads throughout the year and thus the nitrate concentration in the river may vary nitrate concentrations in shallow aquifers hosted in deltaic environments exhibit a wide range of values ranging from 0 to 201 mg l as no3 the higher concentrations were reported for the eastern niger river delta in nigeria and nile river delta in egypt due to agricultural activities and wastewater leakages amadi et al 2012 masoud 2014 in the latter nitrate concentrations locally exceeded 50 mg l due to the intensive application of manure and chemical fertilizers and to insufficient sewage facilities masoud 2014 the extent of nitrogen pollution in the groundwater of the pinios river deltaic plain is relatively low mean no3 6 2 mg l compared to other case studies chloride concentrations of groundwater in river deltas range between 2 9 and 12186 mg l masoud 2014 reported extremely high chloride concentrations in the nile river delta due to intensive seawater influence especially at the mouth of the river making the groundwater unsuitable even for irrigation purposes in the cauvery river delta the high chloride values 1000 mg l in the coastal area are attributed to over pumping in the pre monsoon period and to the tidal phenomena during the monsoon period which activate the penetration of seawater into the groundwater system through seepage jayakumar and siraz 1997 in the tarsus river delta güler et al 2012 and in the nile river delta masoud 2014 the salinization of the aquifer was due to seawater intrusion and mineral dissolution evaporites in the pinios river delta seawater intrusion is limited at the mouth area and the high chloride concentrations 1000 mg l observed in the northern part of the plain are attributed to the interaction with the brackish deeper aquifer in most hydrogeochemical studies carried out in deltaic areas the factors controlling groundwater chemistry are similar to the ones identified in the present study i e water rock interaction seawater intrusion and nitrogen pollution in most case studies e g amadi et al 2012 güler et al 2012 olobaniyi and owoyemi 2006 mineral dissolution e g calcite silicates gypsum and ion exchange processes are reported as the main processes releasing major ions such as ca mg na k and hco3 in the groundwater in the nile river delta masoud 2014 the high calcium and phosphate concentrations were attributed to the application of calcium and phosphate fertilizers for agricultural purposes by applying pca techniques groundwater salinity has been shown to be not always related to over pumping el arabi et al 2013 masoud 2014 but also to natural factors such as storm surges and high tidal events jayakumar and siraz 1997 olobaniyi and owoyemi 2006 or to the interaction with deeper aquifers of higher salinity current study moreover the spatial distribution of the factor scores extracted from pca has shown that nitrate pollution originated not only from agricultural activities but also from wastewater treatment plants septic systems and urban wastes e g masoud 2014 phung et al 2015 by using pca techniques the presence of high so4 concentrations in the groundwater of the western niger delta has been attributed to the dissolution of minerals such as pyrite and to contamination by petroleum refinery wastes and heavy vehicular activities olobaniyi and owoyemi 2006 moreover heavy metal pollution has been attributed to natural background e g chromium minerals but also to the release of wastes from chemical industries and petroleum hydrocarbon storage facilities and the disposal of hazardous wastes such as batteries electronics and machine scraps e g amadi et al 2012 güler et al 2012 5 conclusions this work presents a regional hydrogeochemical study of the deltaic plain of river pinios central greece an evaluation of the water quality status and the identification of the main geochemical processes controlling water hydrochemistry and its spatial evolution the river is primarily recharged by groundwater influxes from the surrounding mountains and secondarily by precipitation and the shallow aquifer inside the deltaic plain the results of the water quality index classification showed that spring water and river water in the deltaic plain are characterized by high quality rankings in the river mouth area the water quality degradation was mostly attributed to limited seawater intrusion which classifies most of the mouth area water samples into the moderate water quality class calcite and dolomite dissolution cation exchange processes and silicate weathering control the groundwater chemistry locally high concentrations of na and cl were attributed to the interaction of the shallow aquifer with a deeper brackish aquifer especially in the northern part of the delta agricultural activities and point sources of contamination introduce n pollutants into the subsurface through leaching this deterioration was reflected in the water quality index as most of the samples from that area were classified as of good to poor water quality five factors explained 77 of the total variance in the water quality component 1 was the salinity factor due to seawater influence evaporation and interaction with saline components of the deeper aquifer component 2 was the water silicate rocks interaction factor and related to the dissolution of silicate minerals bearing fe zn and mn component 3 was the hardness factor and was associated with calcite dissolution and cation exchange processes component 4 was the nitrogen pollution factor whereas component 5 was interpreted as the non n related artificial fertilizers factor the results showed that the water quality was good compared to other river deltas worldwide but river and groundwater were susceptible to contamination especially from agricultural practices and point sources of nitrogen pollution these findings can be used by stakeholders in the application of strategies for the sustainable management of the water resources in the deltaic plain acknowledgements a significant part of this work was financially
